Protocol Number: M14-675 Name of Study Drug: Upadacitinib (ABT-494) Phase of Development: 3 Name of Active Ingredient: Upadacitinib (ABT-494)Date of Protocol Synopsis: 31 July 2020 Protocol Title: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Induction Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib (ABT-494) in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis. Objective: The primary objective of Study M14-675 (Phase 3 induction) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (QD) compared to placebo in inducing clinical remission (per Adapted Mayo score) in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). At the time of this amendment, the study has closed screening. Investigators: Multicenter Study Sites: Approximately 400 sites worldwide. Study Population: Males and females between 18 and 75 years of age with a diagnosis of moderately to severely active UC. Adolescent males and females 16 and 17 years of age with body weight ≥ 40 kg and meet the definition of Tanner Stage 5 will be enrolled if approved by the country or regulatory/health authority. If these approvals have not been granted, only subjects ≥ 18 years old will be enrolled. The study will consist of a mixed population: biologic-inadequate responders (bio-IR) and non-biologic-inadequate responders (non-bio-IR). Number of Subjects to be Enrolled: A total of approximately 462 subjects will be enrolled worldwide. The number of non-bio-IR subjects enrolled will be at least 25% and not exceed 50% of the total number of subjects enrolled. Methodology: Study M14-675 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of upadacitinib 45 mg QD compared to placebo as induction therapy for up to 16 weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. At the end of either Week 8 (Part 1) or Week 16 (Part 2), if subjects are eligible, they will be offered an opportunity to participate in Study M14-234 Substudy 3 which is a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg compared to placebo as maintenance therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who achieved clinical response following induction with upadacitinib in Study M14-675. Please consult the Study M14-234 protocol for further details. Study visits may be impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This may include changes such as phone or virtual visits, visits at alternative locations, or changes in the visit frequency and timing of study procedures, among others. Additional details are provided in the subsequent section. Every effort should be made to ensure the safety of subjects and site staff, while maintaining the integrity of the study. If visits cannot be conducted onsite due to travel restrictions or other pandemic-related reasons, follow the updates below on how to proceed. These measures will only be implemented under the protocol in countries that are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic."
9,page_9,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 10 Methodology (Continued): Subjects who consent and meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into Study M14-675, which consists of two parts: (Part 1) a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled 8-week induction study; and (Part 2) an 8-week Extended Treatment Period for clinical non- responders from Part 1. Part 1 In Part 1, approximately 462 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to double-blind upadacitinib 45 mg QD or matching placebo for 8 weeks. The randomization will be stratified by bio-IR status (bio-IR vs non-bio-IR), corticosteroid use (yes or no) and Adapted Mayo score ( ≤ 7 or > 7) at Baseline. Within bio-IR, the randomization will be further stratified by number of prior biologic treatments ( ≤ 1 or > 1). Within non-bio-IR, the randomization will be further stratified by previous biologic use (yes or no). Treatment groups for Part 1 include: !Group 1: Upadacitinib 45 mg QD (blinded, n = 308) !Group 2: Placebo QD (blinded, n = 154) At Week 8, subjects achieving clinical response, defined as a decrease from Baseline in the Adapted Mayo score ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline, PLUS a decrease in rectal bleeding subscore (RBS) ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS ≤ 1 may be eligible to enter the 52-week, double-blind, maintenance portion of Study M14-234 (Substudy 3). All subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 8 will be eligible to participate in Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period) to receive open-label upadacitinib 45 mg QD for an additional 8 weeks. Part 2 Part 2 is an open-label, 8-week Extended Treatment Period for subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 8 in Part 1. The objectives of Part 2 are to offer upadacitinib induction treatment to placebo clinical non-responders from Part 1 and to evaluate delayed clinical response of upadacitinib in subjects who do not initially respond during Part 1. The blind from Part 1 will not be broken for the duration of the study as subjects will be assessed as clinical non-responders at the 8 Week Visit of Part 1 and will be moved to Part 2 for further treatment in the study without identifying their initial treatment assignment. All eligible subjects entering Part 2 will receive open-label treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg QD for 8 additional weeks (until Week 16). At Week 16, an endoscopy will be performed to evaluate the treatment effect. A flexible rectosigmoidoscopy is recommended. However, the use of flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy is at the investigators' discretion based on local practice. During Part 2, subject with persistent symptoms or worsening UC may be discontinued at any time. At Week 16, subjects who achieve clinical response may be eligible to enter Study M14-234 (Substudy 3) for further blinded treatment. Subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 16 will be discontinued from the study and will not be eligible to enroll in Study M14-533 (long term extension)."
10,page_10,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 11 Methodology (Continued): Part 2 (Continued) All subjects will be provided with a Subject Diary (eDiary) at Screening in Study M14- 675 where they will record UC-related symptoms, use of anti-diarrheals, and use of medications for endoscopy preparation. For the assessment of the clinical endpoints, the stool frequency and the rectal bleeding subscore will be calculated as an average of the entries recorded into the subject's diary from the most recent consecutive 3-day period prior to each study visit. If diary entries from the 3 consecutive days prior to the visit are not available, the 3 most recent consecutive days in the last 10 days will be utilized. If data is not available for 3 consecutive days, the average of the entries from the most recent 3 non- consecutive days in the last 10 days will be utilized. Clinical endpoints of abdominal pain and bowel urgency from subject diaries will be measured at the same time period as the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores. Proportion of subjects who report no abdominal pain and proportion of subjects who report no bowel urgency in the 3 days will be estimated. At each study visit, a routine physical examination including evaluation of vital signs, evaluation of extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs), diary review, monitoring for adverse events (AEs), review of concomitant medications, and completion of laboratory assessments will be performed. A full physical examination will be performed at Screening, Baseline, Week 8 and Week 16/Premature Discontinuation (PD) (for subjects who enter the Extended Treatment Period) and must include an evaluation of extra- intestinal manifestations. Symptom based physical examinations will be performed at all other visits at a minimum, but evaluation of EIMs will still be completed at every study visit. Subjects will undergo a full colonoscopy with biopsy for histologic assessment during Screening with local investigator assessment for Mayo endoscopic subscore for initial eligibility assessment, confirmed by a central reader prior to randomization. At end of treatment (Week 8 in Part 1) a full colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, depending on the extent of disease at Screening, will be performed. For subjects in Part 2, an endoscopy will be performed at Week 16/PD. A flexible rectosigmoidoscopy is recommended at Week 16/PD, however, the use of flexible rectosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will be based on the investigator's discretion per local practice. The endoscopic subscore result from the central reader during the screening period will be used to evaluate the eligibility of a subject to enroll in the study and for all efficacy assessments at Week 8 of Part 1. However, for re randomization into Substudy 3, the endoscopic subscore at Week 8 (Study M14-675 Part 1) or Week 16 (Study M14-675 Part 2) based on the local reader's assessment will be used to determine clinical response status compared to the Baseline assessment of the central reader for enrollment into Study M14-234 Substudy 3. In addition to the Mayo endoscopic subscore, the central reader will assess the endoscopy findings using the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) scoring system for additional exploratory analyses. Blood samples will be collected for high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), upadacitinib plasma concentrations and other biomarker analyses. In addition, stool samples for fecal calprotectin will be collected. The stool samples should be taken before starting bowel preparations for scheduled endoscopies. Subjects will be asked to fill out the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI), European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), Short Form 36 Item (SF-36), and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms Questionnaire (UC-SQ), and Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS; only in select sites) during the study at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 8/PD for Part 1. These same questionnaires will be completed at Week 16/PD for Part 2."
11,page_11,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 12 Methodology (Continued): Subjects will be asked to fill out the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) during the study at Week 2, and Week 8/PD for Part 1. This same questionnaire will be completed at Week 16/PD for Part 2. During each study visit subjects will also be asked to report UC-related hospitalizations and surgeries which will be captured as a part of the supplemental Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU) form of Adverse Event collection in electronic data capture. Subjects will be discontinued from the study if they withdraw consent or if they are deemed unsuitable to continue for any reason by the investigator. Washout Period: Subjects, who have been taking exclusionary medications prior to screening must complete medication washout. The duration is based on the excluded medication as described in the protocol. However, for subjects who have discontinued infliximab, certolizumab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, natalizumab, ustekinumab, if there is proper documentation of an undetectable drug level measured by a commercially available assay for any of the approved biologics above, there is no minimum washout prior to Baseline. Protocol-related adverse events should be reviewed and subjects must complete the washout prior to the Baseline Visit. Concomitant UC-Related Medications (Oral Corticosteroids, Antibiotics, Aminosalicylates, and/or Methotrexate): Parts 1 and 2 All UC-related concomitant medications should be kept on stable doses in Parts 1 and 2. All subjects receiving stable dose of UC-related antibiotics (those subjects who did not discontinue), aminosalicylates, or MTX at Week 0 will maintain their concomitant treatments and respective doses through the end of the study. Dose may be decreased or terminated in the event of moderate to severe treatment related toxicity (e.g., leukopenia or elevated liver enzymes) in the opinion of the investigator. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion: Main Inclusion: 1. Male or female between 16 and 75 years of age at Baseline. !Adolescent subjects 16 and 17 years old will only be enrolled if approved by the country or regulatory/health authority and must weigh ≥ 40 kg and meet the definition of Tanner Stage 5 (refer to Appendix H) at the screening visit. If these approvals have not been granted, only subjects ≥ 18 years old will be enrolled. 2. Diagnosis of UC for 90 days or greater prior to Baseline, confirmed by colonoscopy during the Screening Period, with exclusion of current infection, colonic dysplasia and/or malignancy. Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of UC, in the assessment of the Investigator, must be available. 3. Active UC with an Adapted Mayo score of 5 to 9 points and endoscopic subscore of 2 to 3 (confirmed by central reader)."

The ITT analysis set includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug from Study M14-675. The ITT analysis set that includes all subjects in Part 1 who received blinded upadacitinib 45 mg QD or matching placebo is denoted as ITT1 population. The ITT analysis set that includes all subjects in Part 2 who received open label upadacitinib 45 mg QD dose is denoted as ITT2 population. ITT1 is the primary analysis set of Study M14-675. The comparisons between upadacitinib and placebo treatment groups in the ITT1 population for the primary efficacy and key ranked secondary endpoints will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by bio-IR status (bio-IR vs non-bio-IR), corticosteroid use (yes or no), and Adapted Mayo score ( ≤ 7 or > 7) at Baseline. Non-responder imputation (NRI) method, where subjects with missing data at scheduled assessment visits will be considered as ""not achieved"" for the clinical remission, will be used for primary analysis. Primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively for ITT2 population. Pharmacokinetic: Individual plasma concentrations of upadacitinib will be tabulated and summarized. A non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach will be used to estimate the population central values and the empirical Bayesian estimates of the individual values for upadacitinib oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F). Additional parameters may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data. Safety: The safety analysis set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. For the safety analysis, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually received, regardless the treatment randomized. Incidence of AEs, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed. Treatment-emergent adverse events will be tabulated by system organ class and by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term for each treatment group for each Substudy and over the entire study. Mean change from Baseline for laboratory and vital signs data will be summarized."

27,page_27,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 28 3.0 Introduction Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two primary forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is postulated that UC is caused by unregulated and exaggerated local immune response to environmental triggers in genetically susceptible individuals. 1 UC is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease of the large intestine characterized by inflammation and ulceration of mainly the mucosal and occasionally submucosal intestinal layers. The highest annual incidence of UC was 24.3 per 100,000 person-years in Europe, 6.3 per 100,000 person-years in Asia and the Middle East, and 19.2 per 100,000 person-years in North America, with a prevalence of 505 cases per 100,000 persons in Europe and 249 cases per 100,000 persons in North America. 2 The burden of UC on the healthcare system is profound, accounting for nearly 500,000 physician visits and more than 46,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States (US) alone. 3 The hallmark clinical symptoms include bloody diarrhea associated with rectal urgency and tenesmus. The clinical course is marked by exacerbation and remission. The diagnosis of UC is suspected on clinical grounds and supported by diagnostic testing, and elimination of infectious causes. 4 The most severe intestinal manifestations of UC are toxic megacolon and perforation. Extraintestinal complications include arthritis (peripheral or axial involvement), dermatological conditions (erythema nodosum, aphthous stomatitis, and pyoderma gangrenosum), inflammation of the eye (uveitis), and liver dysfunction (primary sclerosing cholangitis). Patients with UC are at an increased risk for colon cancer, and the risk increases with the duration of disease as well as extent of colon affected by the disease. 5 The aim of medical treatment in UC is to control inflammation and reduce symptoms. Available pharmaceutical therapies are limited, do not always completely abate the inflammatory process, and may have significant adverse effects. Therapies for mild to moderate active UC include 5-aminosalicylic acid derivatives and immunosuppressants."
28,page_28,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 29 Corticosteroids are used in patients with more severe symptoms but are not useful for longer term therapy.6 The frequency and severity of corticosteroid toxicities are significant, including infections, emotional and psychiatric disturbances, skin injury, and metabolic bone disease. Corticosteroids are not effective for the maintenance of remission and the UC practice guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology recommend against chronic steroid treatment. 7 Patients with moderate to severe symptoms may derive some benefits from immunomodulatory agents (azathioprine [AZA], 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], or methotrexate [MTX]); however, the use of these agents is limited as induction treatment due to a slow onset of action (3 to 6 months) and as maintenance therapy due to adverse events (AEs), including bone marrow suppression, infections, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and malignancies. 7,8 Despite these therapies, approximately 15% of UC patients experience a severe clinical course, and 30% of these patients require removal of the colon/rectum, to eliminate the source of the inflammatory process, although accompanied by significant morbidity. 9,10 Biological agents targeting specific immunological pathways have been evaluated for their therapeutic effect in treating patients with UC. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents were the first biologics to be used for IBD. Infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are successfully being used for the treatment of UC. Vedolizumab, an anti-adhesion therapy, has been approved for the treatment of IBD. Anti-TNF therapies are an effective treatment for patients who are steroid refractory or steroid dependent, who had inadequate response to a thiopurine, or who are intolerant to these medications. Potential risks with anti-TNF therapies include infusion or injection site reactions, serious infections, lymphoma, heart failure, lupus-like syndromes, and demyelinating conditions. 11 Despite the beneficial results achieved with the available biologic agents, only 17% to 45% of patients who receive them are able to achieve clinical remission. 12-15 Thus, there remains a clear medical need for additional therapeutic options in UC for patients with inadequate response to or intolerance to conventional therapies and biologic therapies."
29,page_29,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 30 Rationale for Development of a JAK Inhibitor in UC The Janus kinases or JAKs are a family of intracellular tyrosine kinases that function as dimers in the signaling process of many cytokine receptors. The JAKs play a critical role in both innate and adaptive immunity, making them attractive targets for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Targeting the Janus activated kinase (JAK) signaling pathway for autoimmune diseases, is supported by the involvement of various pro-inflammatory cytokines that signal via JAK pathways in the pathogenesis of these immune-related disorders. The activation of JAK signaling initiates expression of survival factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocyte cellular trafficking and cell proliferation, which contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. 16 Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor that inhibits JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 with high in vitro functional specificity for kinases 1 and 3. In completed Phase 3 studies in patients with moderately to severely active UC, tofacitinib was more effective than placebo as induction and maintenance therapy. 17 JAK inhibitors have been associated with infections, including herpes zoster reactivation, malignancies, and asymptomatic, mild and reversible changes in levels of hemoglobin, lymphocyte counts, white blood cell counts, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, high density liporprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and liver transaminases (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST]) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). 18,19 Upadacitinib is a novel selective Janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitor. JAK1 inhibition blocks the signaling of many important pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, and IL-15, which are known contributors to inflammatory disorders. Through modulation of these proinflammatory cytokine pathways, upadacitinib offers the potential for effective treatment of inflammatory or autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), giant cell arteritis (GCA), Takayasu arteritis, polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA), Crohn's disease (CD), UC and atopic dermatitis (AD). The clinical hypothesis is that,"
30,page_30,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 31 based on the differentiated selectivity profile for JAK inhibition, upadacitinib could demonstrate an improved benefit/risk profile compared to other less selective JAK inhibitors or other therapeutic strategies for patients with inflammatory diseases. To date, upadacitinib has been investigated in 22 Phase 1 studies with healthy volunteers (one of which also employed a substudy in subjects with mild to moderate RA), and multiple Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies for indications of RA, CD, AD, PsA and UC. Upadacitinib has been shown to be effective in the treatment of the indicated medical conditions based on the data available from the various studies. Safety results across the studies showed that upadacitinib was well tolerated and the types and frequencies of AEs were consistent with subjects with the medical conditions receiving immunomodulatory therapy. Many of the safety findings are expected for the class products with JAK inhibition, such as infections, increase in LDL-C and HDL-C, and asymptomatic and transient CPK elevation. Upadacitinib has been evaluated in Phase 2b dose ranging placebo-controlled study in subjects with moderately to severely active UC with a history of inadequate response to or intolerant to immunosuppressants, corticosteroids or biologic therapies (Study M14-234 Substudy 1). At the time of this protocol development, Phase 2b interim results from Study M14-234 Substudy 1 Part 1 became available. The primary objective of demonstrating statistically significant dose-response relationship of upadacitinib compared to placebo for the primary endpoint and all ranked secondary endpoints was met, with the highest rates observed in 45 mg once daily (QD) treatment group for both clinical and endoscopic endpoints. Upadacitinib was generally safe and well tolerated. No new safety concerns were identified compared to what has been observed in studies of upadacitinib in other disease indications. A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology and safety experience with upadacitinib can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure. 20"
31,page_31,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 32 3.1 Differences Statement This Phase 3 study differs from other upadacitinib studies as it is one of the two large- scale studies to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. 3.2 Benefits and Risks Despite the availability of various UC therapies, including biologic therapies such as anti- TNFs, many patients still do not respond adequately to these treatments, or gradually lose response over time. Thus, there remains a clear medical need for additional therapeutic options in UC for patients with inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to conventional therapies but have not failed biologic therapy. Clinical efficacy of JAK inhibition has been demonstrated in the treatment of UC. Tofacitinib is recently approved for the treatment of UC. 21 However, the non-selectivity of tofacitinib targeting JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 has been associated with a number of safety issues. 17-19,22,23 Upadacitinib is a novel JAK1 selective inhibitor with minimal inhibitory effects on JAK2 and JAK3, which could potentially minimize some of the reported safety concerns with non-selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be mediated by inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathways. The available long-term safety data from the Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) studies with upadacitinib did not show any new significant safety concerns compared to the marketed JAK inhibitors. The findings of an increased risk of infections, herpes zoster, and abnormal laboratory changes have been observed (e.g., elevations of serum transaminases, lipids, creatine phosphokinase, and reductions in hemoglobin and white blood cells) with upadacitinib. The incidence rates of other clinically important adverse events such as cardiovascular events, malignancies and mortality reported during the RA studies were within the expected range for the general population or for a population of patients with moderately to severely active RA. Events of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"
32,page_32,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 33 and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib. The results of genetic toxicology testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic; however, upadacitinib is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy in females of childbearing potential. Based on the calculated safety margins for human fetal exposure with seminal fluid transfer, there is judged to be no risk to the pregnancy of female partners of male subjects who are treated with upadacitinib. Male trial participants are therefore not required to use contraception when participating in upadacitinib clinical trials. We propose to initiate a Phase 3 study in UC subjects based on the following supportive findings: 1) demonstrated improved potency of upadacitinib versus tofacitinib in preclinical models of inflammation; 2) confirmed JAK1 selectivity of upadacitinib in both preclinical and clinical settings; 3) acceptable preclinical toxicological findings in chronic toxicity studies in two species; 4) acceptable safety and tolerability profile of upadacitinib in single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy volunteers; 5) evidence that JAK inhibition in inflammatory bowel disease results in clinical and endoscopic improvement; and 6) evidence of efficacy and safety in a different inflammatory disease (rheumatoid arthritis). The current Phase 3 Study M14-675 will assess the benefit to risk profile of upadacitinib in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to oral aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and/or biologic therapies. As presented above, the completed Phase 2 dos e ranging Study M14-234 Substudy 1 has demonstrated superior efficacy of upadacitinib with an acceptable safety profile compared to placebo in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. The benefit-risk profile of upadacitinib in this Phase 2 study supports further evaluation of upadacitinib in subjects with UC. 24"

At this time, the effects of upadacitinib on the course of COVID-19 are not well defined. 3.3 Safety Evaluations Safety will be assessed by AE monitoring, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, imaging and clinical laboratory testing during the study. Laboratory assessments will include hematologic parameters, chemistry, liver function tests, and lipid parameters. 4.0 Study Objective The primary objective of Study M14-675 (Phase 3 induction) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (QD) compared to placebo in inducing clinical remission (per Adapted Mayo score) in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who have demonstrated inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to oral aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and/or biologic therapies. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy of upadacitinib 45 mg QD comparing with placebo in ranked secondary endpoints of achieving endoscopic improvement, endoscopic remission, clinical response per Adapted Mayo Score, clinical response per Partial Adapted Mayo score, histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement, no bowel urgency, no abdominal pain, histologic improvement, mucosal healing, and change in IBDQ total score and FACIT-F score. The study will allow enrollment of up to 30% of enrolled bio-IR subjects who have failed 3 or more biologics. Among non-bio-IR subjects, subjects who have used a biologic up to 1 year and have discontinued for reasons other than inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance (e.g., change of insurance/reimbursement, well-controlled disease, etc.) may be enrolled but must meet other criteria for inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants as defined in the protocol.

This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the ef ficacy, safety, a nd pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib as induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who have been inadequate responders or intolerant to oral aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and/or biologic therapies. The number of enrolled non-biologic-inadequate responders (non-bio-IR) subjects will be at least 25% and not exceed 50%. Study M14-675 will allow enrollment of up to 30% of enrolled bio-IR subjects who have failed 3 or more biologics. Among non-bio-IR subjects, subjects who have used a biologic up to 1 year and have discontinued for reasons other than inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance (e.g., change of insurance/reimbursement, well-controlled disease, etc.) may be enrolled but must meet other criteria for inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants as defined in the protocol. The study will allow for enrollment of up to 20% enrolled non-bio-IR subjects who could also have previous use of biologic therapy but discontinued based on reasons other than inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance. The study is designed to enroll approximately 462 subjects to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations. Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled."

Study visits may be impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This may include changes such as phone or virtual visits, visits at alternative locations, or changes in the visit frequency and timing of study procedures, among others. Additional details are provided in the subsequent section. Every effort should be made to ensure the safety of subjects and site staff, while maintaining the integrity of the study. If visits cannot be conducted onsite due to travel restrictions or other pandemic-related reasons, follow the updates below on how to proceed. These measures will only be implemented under the protocol in countries that are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects (n = 462) who consent and meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria as defined in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into Study M14-675, which consists of two parts: (Part 1) a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week induction study; (Part 2) an 8-week open-label Extended Treatment Period for clinical non-responders from Part 1. The number of non-bio-IR subjects will be at least 25% and not exceeding 50%. In Part 1, approximately 462 subjects will be enrolled. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups (double-blind upadacitinib 45 mg QD or matching placebo) for 8 weeks. The following are the treatment groups for Part 1 of Study M14-675: ●Group 1: Upadacitinib 45 mg QD (blinded, n = 308) ●Group 2: Placebo QD (blinded, n = 154)"

The objectives of Part 2 are to offer upadacitinib induction treatment to placebo clinical non-responders (defined by Adapted Mayo Score) from Part 1, and to evaluate delayed clinical response to upadacitinib in subjects who do not initially respond to upadacitinib during Part 1. During COVID-19 pandemic, investigators should make the best effort to perform the endoscopies required per protocol. For subjects with missing endoscopy at Week 8/16when endoscopies cannot be performed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the site should assess the status of clinical response defined by the Partial Adapted Mayo Score. If the subject is a clinical responder at Week 8/16, the subject may enter Study M14-533Cohort 1. If the subject is a clinical non-responder at Week 8, the subject may enter Part 2. If the subject is a clinical non-responder at Week 16 the subject will discontinue from the study. A notification should be sent to the TAMD as to the responder status and which part of the program the subject will be going to prior to the transfer taking place. The blind from Part 1 will be maintained as these subjects will be assessed simply as non- responders and moved to Part 2 for further treatment in the study. All eligible subjects entering Part 2 will receive open-label treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg QD for 8 additional weeks (until Week 16). Subjects who achieve clinical response defined by Adapted Mayo Score at Week 8 or Week 16 and do not meet any study discontinuation criteria will be eligible to enroll into Study M14-234 Substudy 3 following written informed consent.

Once written informed consent is obtained, subjects will undergo screening procedures as outlined in Appendix C with a maximum of 35 days allowed for the screening period. The Baseline Visit can be scheduled and a subject randomized at any point during this 35-day period once all eligibility criteria have been met. An electronic diary (e-diary) will be dispensed and training will be provided to the subject at the Screening Visit in Study M14-675 (see Section 10.3 details). With the exception of the QuantiFERON TB-Gold Plus and PPD tests (requirements outlined in Section 5.3.1 [Clinical Laboratory Tests]), exclusionary laboratory values can be re-tested once during the Screening Period. If the re-tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusionary, the subject will be considered a screen failure. Redrawing samples if previous samples were unable to be analyzed would not count as a retest since previous result was never obtained. Subjects who have been taking exclusionary medications prior to screening or Baseline must complete medication washout. The duration is based on the excluded medication as described in the protocol. During Screening, biologic drug levels may be optionally assessed at the investigator's discretion as an alternative to completing the required washout period: (1) infliximab and natalizumab: may be tested approximately 4 weeks or later from the last dose; (2) adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, or vedolizumab: may be tested approximately 6 weeks or later from the last dose; (3) ustekinumab: may be tested approximately 8 weeks or later from the last dose. If the biologic drug is not detected, the subject will be considered as eligible and the washout period is not required.

TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis Screening All subjects must be evaluated for TB at screening and annually, unless the subject is considered to be TB test positive prior to screening. The TB screening tests are diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the subject's epidemiology, history, exam findings, etc. and it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine if a subject has active or latent tuberculosis. Expert consultation for the evaluation and/or management of TB may be considered per Investigator discretion.

The TB risk assessment form will be completed annually (Part 1 only) for all subjects, regardless of TB test results. One or more ""yes"" response on the TB risk assessment form indicates increased risk of TB. If a subject has a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test within 90 days prior to Screening and source documentation is available, TB testing does not need to be performed by the central laboratory at Screening provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. If a subject only had a negative PPD test within 90 days prior to Screening, a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test is required at Screening. If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test cannot be performed by the central laboratory at Screening and source documentation is available the PPD Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test or Mantoux Test) does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. These cases may be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD. The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation. Subjects with a negative TB test and chest x-ray (CXR) not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled. Subjects with history of active TB may be enrolled if it has been adequately treated with no evidence of current active TB; subjects with inadequate documentation of treatment should be cleared by a TB specialist prior to enrollment. Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent TB, including signs and symptoms and CXR. Subjects with no signs or symptoms and a CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see below). Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled. For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening or the most recent evaluation, an annual TB follow-up test will be performed. If an annual TB test is newly positive (seroconversion), a chest x-ray (CXR) needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active versus latent TB, and"

Any positive TB test after the patient has started the study should be reported as an AE of latent TB or active TB (as applicable). If the subject is experiencing signs or symptoms suspicious for TB or something has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant investigation and a repeat test before the next scheduled annual TB retest, the case (including the TB test results) should be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD. TB TestingThe QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test (or equivalent) should be performed at Screening on all subjects. The PPD skin test should be utilized when the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test (or equivalent) is not possible or if both tests are required per local guidelines: ●Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus Test and/or PPD Skin Test and/or history of latent or active TB. It is not required to repeat either test at Screening or during the study and should be considered positive. ●For regions that require both PPD and QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus testing, both will be performed. If either PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus is positive, the TB test is considered positive. ●If TB testing is done at Screening for subjects with a prior positive TB test and a positive result is reported, the subject is considered TB test positive. If TB testing is done for subjects with a prior positive TB test at the annual evaluation, repeated TB prophylaxis in not required for a positive result unless indicated by the subject's medical history. The PPD Skin Test should be utilized only when a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus Test is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines). ●If only a PPD is placed at screening, then the TB test to be used for the remainder of the study for that subject is the PPD. Similarly, if a subject enters the study with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test alone, then the"
67,page_67,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 68 subject should have their annual TB test performed with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test. ●If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus Test is NOT possible (or if both the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus Test and the PPD are required per local guidelines) the PPD will be performed. The PPD should be read by a licensed healthcare professional between 48 and 72 hours after administration. A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reaction. The absence of induration will be recorded as ""0 mm"" not ""negative."" ●Subjects who have an ulcerating reaction to PPD in the past should not be re-exposed and the PPD should be considered positive. ●If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test is indeterminate, then the investigator should perform a local QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test (or through the central laboratory if not locally available) to rule out a positive test result. If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is considered to be positive for the purpose of this study. If the testing result is negative, then the patient is considered to be negative. ●Interpretation of a positive TB test in low risk subjects: In cases where the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test by the central laboratory is positive and the investigator considers the subject at low risk for TB (i.e., no risk factors identified using the T Part I and Part II questions of the TB risk assessment questionnaire at Screening or Part I questionnaire annually) and has no clinical suspicion of TB, the investigator may perform a local QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory if not locally available) to confirm the positive test result. If the repeat testing result is negative, the investigator may consider the test to be negative based on his/her clinical judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive or indeterminate, the test is considered positive. ●An alternative Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) (such as T-SPOT TB test) may be substituted for the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus."

QuantiFERON TB test or PPD should be performed as soon as restrictions allow at study site or local hospital/facility. TB prophylaxisAt screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection (no symptoms, positive TB test and the subject has a chest x-ray not suggestive of activ e TB), prophy lactic treatment must be initiated at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the study drug (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer). At least 6 months of prophylaxis need to be completed; however, the full course of prophylaxis does not need to be completed prior to the first dose of study drug. If the investigator deems that it is necessary, consultation with a TB expert can be considered. In Ireland, the full course of prophylaxis treatment must be completed prior to the first dose of the study drug. Note: Rifampicin or rifapentine are not allowed for TB prophylaxis.Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have documented completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy will be allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changedin the subject's medical history warrant repeat treatment. For subjects with completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy but insufficient documentation the investigator should consult with the AbbVie TA MD prior to enrolling the subject. Newly initiated prophylactic treatment should be captured in the eCRF and in the source documents. Prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF."

Study drug (s) should not be withheld. Two to four weeks later, the subject should be re-evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and symptoms as well as laboratory assessment of toxicity to TB prophylaxis. If the subject is experiencing signs of symptoms suspicious of active TB or something has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test, the case (including the TB test results) must be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD prior to enrolling the subject. Pregnancy Tests A serum pregnancy test will be performed by the central lab at the Screening Visit on all female subjects of childbearing potential. If the serum pregnancy test is positive the subject is considered a screen failure. If the serum pregnancy test is borderline, it should be repeated ≥ 3 days later to determine eligibility. If the repeat serum pregnancy test is: ●Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure; ●Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial; ●Still borderline ≥ 3 days later, this will be considered documentation of continued lack of a positive result and the subject can be enrolled into the study in the absence of clinical suspicion of pregnancy and other pathological causes of borderline results. Where mandated by local requirements a negative serum pregnancy test will be required for subject enrolment. ●For subjects in Ireland and Argentina, a repeat serum pregnancy test ≥ 3 days later that is still borderline will result in screen failure. (A borderline serum pregnancy test may be repeated more than once during the screening period.) Women of childbearing potential includes all women who are not surgically sterile (both ovaries and or both fallopian tubes removed or uterus removed) or post-menopausal (defined as at least 55 years of age with no menses for at least one year, without an alternate medical reason for amenorrhea, or less than 55 years of age with no menses for"

Women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test performed locally by designated study personnel at Baseline and all subsequent visits. Women of childbearing potential will also have a urine pregnancy test performed at home 30 days after the last visit. The results of follow up pregnancy test should be communicated during the telephone follow up call. If any urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test will be performed by the central laboratory. If the serum pregnancy test is positive, dosing must be stopped and the subject must be discontinued from the study or, if pregnancy identified at end of study visit, pregnancy must be reported to AbbVie as outlined in Section 6.1.6. A lactating or pregnant female will not be eligible for participation or continuation in this study. If during the course of the study a woman becomes surgically sterile or postmenopausal and complete documentation as described in Section 5.2.4 is available, pregnancy testing is no longer required. COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications Monthly urine pregnancy testing must be performed for women of child-bearing potential and results confirmed prior to administration of study drug to the subject. Urine pregnancy tests may be performed at the local lab or at home and confirmed by site staff via phone, telemedicine or video call. Pregnancy test results must be available before drug dispensation. Hepatitis Screen All subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV and HCV at Screening."

C. Difficile During the Screening Period a stool sample will be collected and sent to the central laboratory for testing. The sample will be assessed for the presence of C. difficile toxin. The sample must be shipped to the central laboratory using dry ice. Additional information is available in the Investigator Manual provided by the central laboratory. Subjects who are positive for C. difficile toxin should be screen-failed; these subjects may be re-screened after completing the appropriate treatment. For subjects who are borderline for C. difficile toxin, the investigator may send another sample for a test. If the result is negative, the investigator may consider the test to be negative based on his/her judgment. If the result is positive or borderline, the test is considered positive and subject should be screen failed. For those subjects with two borderline results, the PI can decide if C. difficile treatment is needed based on his/her clinical judgment; these subjects may be re-screened with or without C. difficile treatment.

DTP study drug shipment will be allowed on the study for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and will be removed once the pandemic is considered to be resolved. Mayo Score/Partial Mayo Score Data from the subject diaries will be collected in order to calculate Mayo Score/Partial Mayo Score at the time points indicated in Appendix C and Appendix D . Whenever possible, the same physician (investigator or sub-investigator) should determine the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) subscore for an individual subject through the duration for the study. The directions for capturing the stool frequency subscore (SFS), rectal bleeding subscore (RBS), and PGA subscores of the Mayo score are described in Appendix F . Diary entries from the most recent 3 consecutive days prior to the visit should be utilized for calculation purposes. If diary entries from the 3 most recent consecutive days prior to the visit are not available, the 3 most recent consecutive days in the last 10 days will be utilized. If data are not available for 3 consecutive days, the average of the entries from the most recent 3 non-consecutive days in the last 10 days will be utilized. Endoscopy All endoscopies should be recorded in a color video format at the time points noted in Appendix C and Appendix D . There will be a window of 7 days prior to the scheduled"
83,page_83,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 84 visit to conduct the endoscopy. For the screening endoscopy, this procedure may be completed at any time during the Screening Period but not on the date the subject is randomized as the central reader review of the endoscopy video is required for study entry (central reading can take up to 3 business days). For other scheduled visits, the endoscopy may not occur after the visit, only on the day of or in advance of the scheduled visit. This window may be extended as necessary after consultation with the AbbVie TA MD in case of external, not subject-related circumstances (e.g., scheduling conflict). Endoscopies will be reviewed by a primary central reader who is blinded to the subject's clinical data, the site's endoscopy assessment and the subject's therapy. If, in the assessment of the endoscopist at the site, the Screening endoscopy shows a normal colonic mucosa, the subject should be screen-failed and the video should not be sent for central reading. The endoscopy will be used for calculation of the endoscopy subscore of the Mayo Score. The endoscopy subscore will be documented by the endoscopist at the site and maintained in the subject's source documents. In addition to endoscopic evaluation using Mayo endoscopic sub-score, the endoscopy findings using the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) scoring system will be used for additional exploratory analyses. During all endoscopy procedures, the endoscopist at the site should determine the segment where there is a clear demarcation between normal and inflamed mucosa and document the distance from the anal verge (in centimeters) in the eCRF. Screening Endoscopy: A full colonoscopy will be performed at Screening. The endoscopy subscore result from the central reader will be entered into the eCRF by the site and used to evaluate the eligibility of a subject at Baseline for the study. The central reader's assessment will be used in the Mayo score calculations for all efficacy endpoint assessments. Week 8 (Part 1), Week 16 (Part 2 – Extended Treatment Period) Endoscopy: The Week 8 endoscopy may be either a full colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy depending on the extent of the disease at Screening. The endoscopy should be performed up to the segment where a clear demarcation of inflammation is observed. For subjects that entered Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period), an endoscopy will be performed at"
84,page_84,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 85 Week 16. A flexible sigmoidoscopy is recommended at Week 16; however, the use of a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will be based on the investigator's discretion per local practice. The site's endoscopist scoring will be entered into the eCRF by the site and used for the Mayo score calculation for the purposes of re-randomization into Substudy 3. For the Week 8 or Week 16 re-randomization, the local reading will be compared with the baseline central reading in order to determine clinical response status. The central reader's assessment will be used for the Mayo scores used in all efficacy endpoint assessments. The same endoscopist should, where possible, perform all endoscopies for an individual subject throughout the study. In addition, where possible, the investigator or subinvestigator should be the endoscopist for the study. The endoscopy subscores by segment will be noted in the subject's source documents and in the database but the central reader's endoscopy subscore will be used for the efficacy analyses. COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications If an Endoscopy required at Week 8 and Week 16 is not able to be scheduled at the study site in the required protocol window due to COVID-19, then this may be performed ± 7 days from the planned visit and can be completed at a different Hospital/facility. If the endoscopy cannot be performed during this extended window at the site or another location, please refer to the guidance for subjects outlined in Section 5.1. Biopsy During Endoscopy Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of UC, in the assessment of the investigator, must be available in order to confirm the subject's eligibility for the study. If this documentation is not available a diagnostic biopsy from the most affected observed area of the colon must be performed during the Screening endoscopy and read by a qualified local pathologist and the results reviewed by the investigator, the central laboratory will not provide a pathology report during the screening endoscopy to document UC diagnosis. Biopsies to rule out dysplasia and colon"

Biopsies sent to the central laboratory will not be returned to sites and will be retained for study use only. Obtainment of biopsy samples should also be recorded on the video.The signed pathology report will be monitored by the responsible clinical research associate and kept with the subject's source documents onsite. Subjects should not be enrolled if high grade colonic dysplasia or colon cancer is discovered at the Screening endoscopy. Subjects may be enrolled if low grade colonic dysplasia is discovered during endoscopy and is completely removed. If a diagnosis of high grade colonic dysplasia or colon cancer is discovered during any subsequent endoscopic evaluation during the course of the study, the findings should be recorded as an AE and the subject should be discontinued from the study. If low grade colonic dysplasia is discovered during any subsequent endoscopic evaluation during the course of the study, the findings should be entered as an AE and the subject can continue in the study if the lesion has been completely removed. During all endoscopies up to 3 sets of biopsies are to be collected; one mandatory set of biopsies and, if consented for, two optional sets of biopsies. Each set of biopsies should consist of 2 samples each obtained from the rectosigmoid colon (approximately 15 –30 cm from the anal verge) for histologic assessment. For each set of 2 samples, one should be taken from the area of most inflammation (if the area is ulcerated, the sample should be obtained from the edge of the ulcer), and one from an area that is representative of the general degree of mucosal inflammation present in that segment. For all histology biopsies, the location of the biopsy specimen (distance from the anal margin) should be recorded. For China only: only a single biopsy at each endoscopy from the most inflamed area (HistoMOST) will be required per local requirements. The single, required biopsy will be"

For follow-up endoscopies, in the absence of any visible lesions or areas of general inflammation characteristic of UC, up to 3 sets of biopsies should be collected from normal mucosa in the same segments as noted above. Biopsy Sample Collection, Storage and Shipping: Biopsies performed to confirm the diagnosis of UC or to rule out current dysplasia/malignancy should be processed and read locally per site standards. Biopsy specimens per subject should be obtained by endoscopy for histologic assessment at the time points indicated in Appendix C and Appendix D . Using routine forceps for tissue collection, obtain the required number of biopsy specimens and process the specimens following the instructions in the study-specific laboratory manual. Intestinal Tissue Analysis The following analyses will be sent to the central laboratory and performed on tissue samples: ●Qualitative UC histological assessment using Geboes histologic activity score, 25and other histologic scoring systems. These samples may not be read in real time, however if unexpected findings, such as dysplasia, are noted on the histology biopsies, the central laboratory will contact the investigator to inform him/her about the unexpected finding. Subjects who are found to have high grade colonic dysplasia on the submitted biopsy will be terminated from the trial at the time the dysplasia is discovered. Unexpected findings should be recorded as an adverse event. ●Subjects will have the option to provide tissue biopsies (per local requirements) for future exploratory research and/or validation studies.

If an endoscopy is completed at an alternative location from the study site the study required biopsy is not required. Biopsy can be completed per endoscopist's discretion for local evaluation. Follow-Up Period Subjects will be contacted approximately 30 days after the last administration of study drug to obtain information on any new or ongoing adverse events (AEs). If subject is enrolled into Substudy 3 of Study M14-234 they would not be required to complete the follow-up period in Study M14-675 and would be completed under that protocol, as applicable. During this follow-up call the results of the follow-up at home pregnancy test should be communicated to the site and follow reporting found in Section 6.1.6. Subjects may discontinue study drug treatment at any time during study participation. Subjects that end study participation early will have a Premature Discontinuation (PD) Visit and complete the procedures outlined for the PD Visit in Appendix C and Appendix D as soon as possible after the last dose of study drug and preferably prior to the administration of any new therapies. Unscheduled Visits An Unscheduled Visit should be performed when the subject comes in for a medical visit for evaluation and assessment. During Unscheduled Visits, blood and urine samples will be obtained for the laboratory tests listed in Table 1, or for other tests at the investigator's discretion. Visits for dispensing new study drug in case of temperature excursion, loss or damage are not considered an Unscheduled Visit.

The investigator can decide to continue or interrupt study drug on a case-by-case basis taking into account the risk:benefit of continuing study drug. The investigator can temporarily interrupt study drug at any time for a safety issue, or for any reason if they feel that the risk outweighs the benefit of study treatment. 5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study The study will be discontinued or terminated in case of an unacceptable risk, any relevant toxicity, or a negative change in the risk/benefit assessment. This might include the occurrence of AEs with a character, severity or frequency that is new in comparison to the existing risk profile. In addition, any data deriving from other clinical trials or toxicological studies which negatively influence the risk/benefit assessment might cause discontinuation or termination of the study. AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site, for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended termination. The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination. Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns. If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination. 5.5 Treatments Study drug will be taken orally once daily beginning at the Baseline Visit and should be taken at approximately the same time each day.

The proposed study is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib compared to placebo in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who have had inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or biologic therapies. The study consists of two parts, in Part 1, upadacitinib 45 mg QD is compared with placebo as induction therapy for 8 weeks. Part 2 consists of open-label upadacitinib 45 mg QD in an Extended Treatment Period for an additional 8 weeks to provide treatment for those who were treated with placebo or who did not respond to the initial 8-week upadacitinib treatment. A comparative study utilizing a placebo control design provides an unbiased assessment of the efficacy and safety profile of upadacitinib. In order to provide a potentially efficacious regimen to all participating subjects, subjects in Study M14-675 who do not achieve clinical response after completion of the 8-week induction treatment will be received oral upadacitinib therapy for an additional 8 weeks. Rationale of placebo use in this study A placebo controlled study is necessary for new medication registrational purposes. Based on the guidance provided in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Tripartite Guideline, Topic E10 ""Choice of Control Group in Clinical Trials,"" 34a placebo- controlled trial design, using randomization and blinding has been implemented in the study in order to minimize subject and investigator bias, and support an objective assessment of all study endpoints. Current EMA guidelines on the development of new"

A placebo control is the most objective comparator and a prerequisite for confirmation of clinical benefit in a Phase 3 trial. In order to minimize the exposure to placebo during the studies, in the induction phase, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive upadacitinib or placebo for 8 weeks. If subjects do not respond at Week 8, an open label treatment of upadacitnib 45 mg QD will be provided for an additional 8 weeks. It should also be noted that in this program, if the subjects are at stable and permitted dose of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and/or methotrexate at Baseline, the treatment can be continued in the study. Also, at any time of the study, subjects may discontinue from the study for any reason, including lack of response. 5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study. All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with UC. All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted. Central reading of endoscopy will increase study rigor and ensure enrollment of patients with moderately to severely active UC. 5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population Male and female subjects, including adults and adolescents (16 or 17 years old) when locally permissible, with moderately to severely active UC who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are eligible for enrollment in this study. The specific population chosen was based on the unmet medical need of those subjects with a history of inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to oral aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and/or biologic therapies."

Results from the Phase 2b Induction Study M14-234 (Substudy 1) showed that upadacitinib plasma exposures associated with the 45 mg QD regimen maximize the therapeutic benefit across endpoints and across bio-IR and non-bio-IR subpopulations, at Week 8 with effect on laboratory parameters consistent with previous indications. Preliminary exposure-response analyses for the Phase 2b Study M14-234 (Substudy 1) show that at Week 8, the percentage of subjects achieving clinical remission based on the Adapted Mayo Score (primary endpoint for Phase 3), clinical response, and the endoscopic endpoints (improvement and remission) increased with increasing upadacitinib plasma exposures. With the exception of endoscopic remission, the plateau of key efficacy endpoints (clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement) was established at Week 8 within the range of exposures evaluated in this study. Simulations using exposure-response models indicate that the upadacitinib 45 mg QD regimen is predicted to maximize efficacy across efficacy endpoints and across bio-IR and non-bio-IR sub-populations after 8 weeks of induction treatment in subjects with UC. The selection of the induction dose in subjects with UC is also supported by the efficacy and safety results observed in the Phase 2 study in subjects with CD (Study M13-740), wherein the two highest upadacitinib doses evaluated were 12 mg IR BID and 24 mg IR BID (equivalent of 30 mg ER QD and 60 mg ER QD). Simulations using the exposure"
109,page_109,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 110 response models indicated that a dose higher than 45 mg ER QD (60 mg ER QD) would result in only a 1% to 2% incremental efficacy in terms of clinical response and remission endpoints, and 3% to 4% higher proportions for endoscopic response and remission, while simultaneously resulting in greater decreases in NK cells and increases in CPK. Thus, the 45 mg QD dose offers the optimal benefit-risk profile and was selected as the induction dose for Phase 3 in CD. In summary, exposures associated with upadacitinib 45 mg QD regimen are predicted to maximize efficacy across efficacy endpoints and across bio-IR and non-bio-IR sub-populations in subjects with UC while resulting in acceptable impact on laboratory parameters. Given the plateau has been established in the evaluated dose and exposure range of the Phase 2b study, a dose higher than 45 mg QD is projected to have no additional benefit for Adapted Mayo based clinical remission (primary endpoint) but can have incremental negative impact on laboratory parameters (e.g., NK cells). A dose lower than 45 mg QD is predicted to provide lower efficacy across endpoints (~2% to 10% relative to 45 mg QD). 6.0 Complaints A Complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for distribution. Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2). For adverse events, please refer to Section 6.1 through Section 6.1.8. For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2. 6.1 Medical Complaints The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a routine basis throughout the study. The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or"
110,page_110,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 111 sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken. For serious adverse events considered as having ""no reasonable possibility"" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide another cause of the event. For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity. Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded. All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. 6.1.1 Definitions 6.1.1.1 Adverse Event An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness including UC is considered an adverse event. Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, [meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity management)] and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry. However, if the"
111,page_111,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 112 pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event. 6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event. Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject. Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g.,sprained ankle)."

For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug will be considered ""associated."" Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered ""not associated."" In addition, when the investigator has not reported causality or deemed it not assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated. If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is given, another cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious adverse event. 6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period All adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug administration have elapsed will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.

Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be discontinued (Section 5.4.1). Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected. Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event. The medical outcome for either mother or infant, meeting any serious criteria including an elective or spontaneous abortion, is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. 6.1.7 Toxicity Management The toxicity management of the AEs including AEs of special interest consists of safety monitoring (review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodic/ad hoc review of safety issues by an independent Data Monitoring Committee), and if applicable interruption of study drug dosing with appropriate clinical management and/or discontinuation of the subjects from study drug. The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is described below. For subjects who discontinue study drug but continue study participation and are on standard of care therapies, these toxicity management requirements do not apply (including alerts from the central laboratory) and any intolerability to standard of care therapies should be managed by the prescribing physician. Serious Infections: Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with study drug. Study drug should be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection. A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug should undergo prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject. As appropriate, antimicrobial therapy"
119,page_119,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 120 should be initiated, and the subject should be closely monitored. Study drug may be restarted once the infection has been successfully treated. These subjects will continue to be clinically monitored and will be evaluated in the safety analyses. Subjects who develop active tuberculosis must be permanently discontinued from study drug (refer to ""TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis"" under Section 5.3.1.1). Herpes zoster: If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting study drug until the episode resolves. Gastrointestinal Perforation: Subjects presenting with the onset of signs or symptoms of a gastrointestinal perforation should be evaluated promptly for early diagnosis and treatment. If the diagnosis of spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed (other than appendicitis or mechanical injury), the subject must be permanently discontinued from study drug. Cardiovascular Events: Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular events including non-cardiac, non-CNS thrombotic and embolic events should be carefully monitored. These events will be reviewed and adjudicated by an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee in a blinded manner. Malignancy and Gastrointestinal (GI) Dysplasia: Subjects who develop malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or carcinoma in situ of the cervix should be discontinued. Subjects who develop high grade colonic dysplasia, should be discontinued. Information including histopathological results should be queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis. Periodic skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at increased risk for skin cancer. Thrombosis Events: Subjects who develop symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately. If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus or non-cardiac, non-neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug."

The DMC is responsible for monitoring safety data and alerting AbbVie to possible safety concerns related to the conduct of the study. Data for DMC review will be prepared by AbbVie (for blinded data) and an independent CRO (Axio Research for unblinded data to DMC). The DMC will review safety data at a minimum of 6-month intervals throughout the course of the study. The DMC will determine if more frequent DMC meetings are required based on review of the accumulating safety data. In addition, ad-hoc DMC meetings will be scheduled in the event of any significant safety concerns. Based on these reviews, the DMC will make recommendations, as appropriate, regarding the conduct and management of the study. DMC recommendations will be triaged by the AbbVie Contact to the appropriate parties (AbbVie Study Management Team or Internal Review Committee).

Any information available to help in the determination of causality to the events outlined directly above should be captured. 6.2.2 Reporting Product Complaints concerning the investigational product must be reported to the Sponsor within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event via the Product Complaint form. Product Complaints occurring during the study will be followed-up to a satisfactory conclusion. All follow-up information is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) and documented in source as required by the Sponsor. Product Complaints associated with adverse events will be reported in the study summary. All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint condition. In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by the investigator to return the product within 30 days. If returns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an estimated date of return. The description of the complaint is important for AbbVie in order to enable AbbVie to investigate and determine if any corrective actions are required. 7.0 Protocol Deviations AbbVie does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol unless when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. The principal investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, and applicable global and local laws regarding protocol deviations.

The ITT analysis set that includes all subjects who received the open label upadacitinib induction of 45 mg QD in the Extended Treatment Period is denoted as ITT2. For the ITT analysis sets, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the randomization schedule, regardless of the treatment actually received. The efficacy analysis will be based on the corresponding ITT analysis set. 8.1.1.2 Safety Analysis Set The safety analysis set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication in each part of the study, respectively. For the safety analysis sets, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually received, regardless the treatment randomized. Safety analyses of the entire study will be carried out using the union of all safety analysis sets for all treated subjects. 8.1.2 Subject Accountability The number of subjects randomized, the number of subjects who received at least one dose of study drug, the number of subjects who completed the study, and the number of subjects who prematurely discontinued will be calculated overall and for each investigational site by treatment group. 8.1.3 Definition of Missing Data Imputation Missing data will be imputed using one or more of the following methods:"

Observed Cases (OC): The OC analysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded from the OC analysis for that visit. Depending on the magnitude of missing data due to COVID-19, additional appropriate analysis of missing data may be performed with details included in the SAP. The SFS and RBS at an assessment visit will be calculated as an average of the entries recorded into the subject's diary from the most recent consecutive 3-day period prior to each study visit. If diary entries from the 3 consecutive days prior to the visit are not available, the 3 most recent consecutive days in the last 10 days will be utilized. If data are not available for 3 consecutive days, the average of the entries from the most recent 3 non-consecutive days in the last 10 days will be utilized. If less than 3 days of diary data are available, SFS and RBS will be considered missing. Clinical endpoints of abdominal pain and bowel urgency from subject diaries will be measured at the same time period as the SFS and RBS. Subjects in whom UC-related corticosteroids are initiated during treatment (not taken at Baseline) or who have dosages of these medications increased to greater than the dose taken at Baseline will be considered a failure for categorical efficacy endpoints and will have the last values carried forward for non-categorical assessments from that time point through the end of the study. 8.1.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Baseline demographics and characteristics will be summarized for ITT analysis sets."

Note: evidence of friability during endoscopy in subjects with otherwise ""mild"" endoscopic activity will confer an endoscopic subscore of 2) at Week 8. 8.1.6.1.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint The primary analysis will compare the subjects in upadacitinib treatment group and placebo group in the ITT1 analysis set. The difference between the treatment groups in the primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by baseline corticosteroid use, baseline Adapted Mayo score (≤ 7 or > 7), and bio-IR status (yes or no).

Incidence of adverse events, including those related to study drug, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, ECGs, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed. Treatment-emergent adverse events will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term for each treatment group. Mean change from Baseline for laboratory and vital signs data will be summarized. Missing safety data will not be imputed. 8.1.8.2 Analysis of Adverse Events 8.1.8.2.1 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary. Treatment-emergent adverse events, defined as AEs that began or worsened in severity after initiation of study drug in each period of the study, will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and MedDRA preferred term for each treatment group. Adverse events starting more than 30 days following discontinuation of study drug will not be included in summaries of treatment-emergent AEs. When summarizing adverse events by relationship or severity, if a subject has an event with unknown severity or relationship then the subject will be counted in the severity/relationship category of ""unknown"" even if the subject has a second occurrence of the same event with a severity/relationship present. The only exception is if the subject has a second occurrence of the same event with the most extreme severity (i.e., ""severe"") or a relationship"

136,page_136,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 137 Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK and exposure-response analyses. Population PK and exposure-response analyses of only data from this study may not be conducted. The following general methodology will be used for the population PK and exposure-response analyses. Population PK analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to dosing. PK models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach with NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version). The structure of the starting PK model will be based on the PK analysis of data from previous studies. The CL/F and V/F of upadacitinib will be the PK parameters of major interest in the analyses. If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis. The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of different models. ●The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the alternative model(s). ●The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more randomly distributed across the line of unity (a straight line with zero intercept and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s). ●Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters, and change in inter-subject and intra-subject error. Once an appropriate base PK model (including inter- and intra-subject error structure) is developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be calculated by the posterior conditional estimation technique using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. The relationship between these conditional estimates CL/F and V/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory markers of hepatic of renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.05. After"
137,page_137,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 138 identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of covariates from the full model will be employed to evaluate the significance (at P< 0.005, corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 7.88 for one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model. Linear or non-linear relationships of primary PK parameters with various covariates will be explored. Relationships between upadacitinib exposure and clinical observations (primary efficacy variable) will be explored. Exposure-response relationships for secondary efficacy variables and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored. The relationship between exposure (e.g., population PK model predicted average concentrations, area under the curve, trough concentrations, the individual model-predicted PK profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and drug effect will be explored. Several classes of models (e.g., linear, log-linear, exponential, E max, sigmoid E max, etc.) will be evaluated to characterize the exposure-response relationship based on observed data. Results of the PK and exposure-response analyses may be summarized in a separate report prior to regulatory filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of UC, rather than in the CSR. Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate. 8.2 Determination of Sample Size For Study M14-675 (Part 1), a total of 462 subjects will be allocated to upadacitinib treatment group or placebo in a randomization ratio of 2:1. The sample size for this study is based on the expected proportion of subjects who achieve clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score at Week 8. Assuming clinical remission rate of 5% in the placebo arm and 18% of the upadacitinib QD treatment arms at Week 8, a sample size of 154 subjects in placebo and 308 subjects in upadacitinib dose will have > 95% power to detect the 13% treatment difference in the primary endpoint between an upadacitinib 45 mg QD and placebo using two-sided Fisher's exact test at a 0.05 significant level."

Subjects will be contacted 30 days following study drug discontinuation for an assessment of any new or ongoing AEs, except t hose subjects who will continue on to Substudy 3 of Study M14-234, this will not be required until the subject completes the UC program. The home pregnancy test res ults will be reported at this visit, as applicable, and if a pregnancy is identified, the pregnancy must be reported to AbbVie as outlined in Section 6.1.6 . The 30 day follow up visit should not take place sooner than 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the allowable visit window is dependent upon what phase of the study the subjec t was at when discontinuing study drug. During Part 1 and 2 of the induction period a + 3 day window (30 to 33 days after last study drug date) is allowed. f. Update inclusion/exclusion, medical/surgical history information, and prior and concomitant therapy to assure subject eligibi lity. g. In Part 1, Physical examinations performed at Screening, Baseline, Week 8/PD and Part 2 at Week 16/PD Visits are full physica l examinations which must include an assessment of extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs). Physical exams at all other visits are symptom-based as necessary. Asse ssment of EIMs are required at every visit. For subjects 16 or 17 years of age a Tanner Stage check is to be completed during the physical examination at the screening visit, this may be completed by the investigator or by self-assessment (completed by the subject/legally authorized representative) per local requirements. h. Height (with shoes off) will be measured at Screening only for subjects ≥ 18 years of age. For Subjects 16 or 17 years of age, where locally permitted, height (with shoes off) will be measured at screening, Week 8 and Week 16. i. Subjects will undergo a full colonoscopy with biopsy for histologic assessment during Screening, and a full colonoscopy or fl exible sigmoidoscopy, depending on the extent of disease at Screening, at Week 8. For subjects in Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period), an endoscopy will be performed at Week 16, for this a flexible sigmoidoscopy is recommended, however the use of flexible rectosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will be based on the investigator's discretion per l ocal practice. j. Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of UC, in the assessment of the investigator, must be available in order to confirm the subject's eligibility for the study. If this documentation is not available a diagnostic biopsy from the most affected observed area of the colon must be performed during the Screening endoscopy and evaluated by a qualified local pathologist and the results reviewed by the investigator. Biopsies to rule out current dysplasia and colon cancer may be taken during any study endoscopy per the investigator's discretion and evaluated by the local pathologist. During all endoscopies, up to 3 sets of biopsies will be taken (see Section 5.3.1.1 for details about biopsy sampling). k. Subjects with normal ECG within 90 days of Screening will not require a repeat ECG, if documentation is available. The Week 8 ECG will serve as the Baseline ECG for Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period), as applicable or for Baseline of Study M14-234 Substudy 3. For subjects who enter Part 2 ( Extended Treatment Period), Week 16 ECG will serve as the baseline ECG for Study M14-234 Substudy 3. l. Chest x-ray includes posterior-anterior [PA] and lateral views. Subjects with normal chest x-ray within 3 months of Screenin g will not require a repeat chest x-ray, if documentation is available. In Japan, a CT scan of the chest may be performed in lieu of a CXR, at investigator's discretion. m. If a subject had a negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test within 90 days of Screening and source documentation is available, the test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. PPD skin test is only to be used if th e site is unable to perform the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus testing and is to be read 48 to 72 hours after placement. n. It is requested to have a minimum of 8 hours fasting before any chemistry and lipid. If a subject is not able to fast when ne cessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non- fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation test."

During screening, biologic drug levels may be optionally assessed at the investigator's discretion as an alternative to comple ting the required washout period: (1) infliximib and natalizumab: may be tested approximately 4 weeks or later from the last dose; (2) adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, or vedolizumb: may be tested approximately 6 weeks or later from the last does; (3) ustekinumab: may be tested approximately 8 weeks or later from the last dose. p. The Central Laboratory will perform the urinalysis macro and micro (if applicable). A microscopic analysis will be performed by the central laboratory, in the event the dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, ketone, protein, blood, or glucose value of greater than a trace. Sites will not be provided with urinalysis dipsticks. q. A serum pregnancy test will be performed on all women of childbearing potential at Screening. In Part 1, a urine pregnancy t est will be performed at the site at Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and PD Visits. In Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period), a urine pregnancy test it will be done at Weeks 10, 12, 14 and 16, and a home pregnancy test will be performed at the 30-Day Follow-up Visit, if applicable, for all women of child bearing potential. If any urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test will be performed by the central laboratory. If a pregnancy is identified, the pregnancy must be reported to AbbVie as outlined in Sec tion 6.1.6 . r. Subjects will be tested for the presence of the hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) at Screening. A positive result for th e hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) or hepatitis C (HCV RNA detectable for any subject with positive anti-HCV AB) will be exclusionary. For subjects who are negative for HBsAg but positive for core antibody (HBcAb), HBV DNA PCR will be performed and any result that meets or exceeds detection sensitivity will be exclusionary. HBV te sting is done every 12 weeks where required. s. For Japan subjects only: Subjects with positive HBs Ab and/or positive HBc Ab results at Screening should have HBV-DNA PCR t est performed at Week 8 in the induction period; in cases where recurrence of HBV-DNA is observed, the subject should be discontinued from the study. This measure is n ot necessary in patients with history of HBV vaccination and positive HBs Ab result. t. Stool sample will be collected at each time point indicated. For the visit that an endoscopy will be conducted, stool sample should be collected prior to the endoscopy. If a sample cannot be obtained during the site visit, the site will give instructions and a stool sample supply kit (supplies will be provided at the time-points indicated). All stool samples should be collected before any bowel preparation for endoscopy is started and should be returned to the site within 3 d ays of collection. Stool sample supply kit to be provided at Week 8 visit for subjects entering into the extended treatment program. u. Reference Section 5.3.2.1 regarding PK sample collection. The PK sample at Week 8 will be the baseline PK sample for Study M14-234 Substudy 3.

Patient Reported Outcomes Descriptions in Upadacitinib (ABT-494) UC Programs IBDQ – Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire The IBDQ is a disease-specific instrument composed of 32 Likert-scaled items. The total score ranges from 32 to 224 using the 7-point response options, with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life. The IBDQ scale contains 4 component subscales: bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional function, and social function. Each subscale can be computed with total scores ranging from 10 to 70, 5 to 35, 12 to 84, and 5 to 35, respectively. 27,28 SF-36 – Short Form 36 The SF-36 questionnaire is a self-administered multi-domain scale with 36 items. Eight subscales cover a range of functioning: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The scoring yields a physical component score, a mental component summary score, and subscale scores. Higher scores represent better outcomes. The concepts measured by the SF-36 are not specific to any age, disease, or treatment group, allowing comparison of relative burden of different diseases and the benefit of different treatments. 29,30 EQ-5D-5L – European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Levels The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized non-disease specific instrument for describing and valuing health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problem, slight problem, moderate problem, severe problem or unable to do the activity. It also contains a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Subjects are asked to indicate the level that describes their current level of function or experience for each dimension. As a measure of health status, it provides a descriptive profile and can be used to generate a single index value for health status, where full health is equal to 1 and death is equal to 0. The VAS records the subject's assessment of his/her own health along a vertical 20 cm line, which has health state scores between 0 and 100. 31"

The PGIC is one item in which subjects are asked to rate overall improvement since start of the treatment. Subjects rate their change as ""Very much improved,"" ""Much improved,"" ""Minimally improve d,"" ""No change,"" ""Minimally worse,"" ""Much worse"" and ""Very much worse."" PGIS - Patient Global Impression of Severity The PGIS is a self-administered instrument that assesses the severity of the overall symptoms due to ulcerative colitis. The PGIS is one item in which subjects are asked to rate overall severity of symptoms over the past week. Subjects rate their change as ""Absent,"" ""Minimal,"" ""Mild,"" ""Moderate,"" ""Moderately severe,"" ""Severe"" and ""Very severe."" FACIT-F – Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue The FACIT system is a collection of quality of life (QOL) questionnaires targeted to the management of cancer and other chronic illnesses. The FACIT fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire was developed to assess fatigue associated with anemia. It consists of 13 fatigue-related questions. The responses to the 13 items on the FACIT fatigue questionnaire are each measured on a 4-point Likert scale. The responses to the answers are the following: (i) not at all: 0 points; (ii) a little bit: 1 point; (iii) somewhat: 2 points; (iv) quite a bit: 3 points; (v) very much: 4 points. Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 52. High scores represent less fatigue. 32 WPAI – Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire Ulcerative Colitis The Work Productivity and Activity Index assesses the impact of the condition on work productivity losses and impairment in daily activity. WPAI has six items covering four domains: (1) Absenteeism (work time missed), measured as the number of hours missed from work in the past 7 days due to a condition related problems. Scores are"
168,page_168,"Upadacitinib M14-675 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-000642-62 169 expressed as impairment percentages, adjusting for hours actually worked according to the WPAI scoring algorithm; (2) Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness), measured as the impact of the condition on productivity while at work (i.e., reduced amount or kind of work, or not as focused as usual). Responses are recorded on a 0 – 10 Likert scale (where, 0 = no effect of UC on work and 10 = severe impact of UC while at work); (3) Productivity loss (overall work impairment), measured as the sum of hours missed due to condition i.e., absenteeism and number of hours worked with impairment i.e., product of number of hours worked and presenteeism; and (4) Activity impairment (i.e., activities other than paid work like work around house, cleaning, shopping, traveling, studying), recorded and scored in the same way as presenteeism. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity. 33 UC-SQ – Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms Questionnaire The Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms Questionnaire (UC-SQ) is a UC-specific instrument composed of 17 items. UC-SQ was developed to assess UC related gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., frequent bowel movements, abdominal pain, cramping) and non-gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., joint pain and sleep difficulties). Each symptom item 1 -9 can be responded on Likert-type of options such as (i) Not at all: 0 points; (ii) A little bit: 1 point; (iii) Somewhat: 2 points; (iv) Quite a bit: 3 points; (v) Very much: 4 points. Each symptom item 10 - 17 can be responded on Likert-type of options such as (i) Never: 0 points; (ii) Rarely: 1 point; (iii) Sometimes: 2 points; (iv) Often: 3 points; (v) Always: 4 points. Overall symptom scores are calculated by combining ratings of the individual items, with higher scores indicating greater severity.

Subjects will be contacted 30 days following study drug discontinuation for an assessment of any new or ongoing AEs, except those subjects who will continue on to Substudy 3 of Study M14-234, this will not be required until the subject completes the UC program. The home pregnancy test res ults will be reported at this visit, as applicable, and if a pregnancy is identified, the pregnancy must be reported to AbbVie as outlined in Section 6.1.6 . The 30 day follow up visit should not take place sooner than 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the allowable visit window is dependent upon what phase of the study the subjec t was at when discontinuing study drug. During Part 1 and 2 of the induction period a + 3 day window (30 to 33 days after last study drug date) is allowed. ff. Update inclusion/exclusion, medical/surgical history information, and prior and concomitant therapy to assure subject eligib ility. gg. In Part 1, Physical examinations performed at Screening, Baseline, Week 8/PD and Part 2 at Week 16/PD Visits are full physic al examinations which must include an assessment of extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs). Physical exams at all other visits are symptom-based as necessary. Asse ssment of EIMs are required at every visit. For subjects 16 or 17 years of age a Tanner Stage check is to be completed during the physical examination at the screening visit, this may be completed by the investigator or by self-assessment (completed by the subject/legally authorized representative) per local requirements. hh. Height (with shoes off) will be measured at Screening only for subjects ≥ 18 years of age. For Subjects 16 or 17 years of age, where locally permitted, height (with shoes off) will be measured at screening, Week 8 and Week 16. ii. Subjects will undergo a full colonoscopy with biopsy for histologic assessment during Screening, and a full colonoscopy or f lexible sigmoidoscopy, depending on the extent of disease at Screening, at Week 8. For subjects in Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period), an endoscopy will be performed at Week 16, for this a flexible sigmoidoscopy is recommended, however the use of flexible rectosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will be based on the investigator's discretion per lo cal practice. jj. Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of UC, in the assessment of the investigator, must be available in order to confirm the subject's eligibility for the study. If this documentation is not available a diagnostic biopsy from the most affected observed area of the colon must be performed during the Screening endoscopy and evaluated by a qualified local pathologist and the results reviewed by the investigator. Biopsies to rule out cu rrent dysplasia and colon cancer may be taken during any study endoscopy per the investigator's discretion and evaluated by the local pathologist. During all endoscopies, up to 3 sets of biopsies will be taken (see Section 5.3.1.1 for details about biopsy sampling). kk. Subjects with normal ECG within 90 days of Screening will not require a repeat ECG, if documentation is available. The Week 8 ECG will serve as the Baseline ECG for Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period), as applicable or for Baseline of Study M14-234 Substudy 3. For subjects who enter Part 2 ( Extended Treatment Period), Week 16 ECG will serve as the baseline ECG for Study M14-234 Substudy 3. ll. Chest x-ray includes posterior-anterior [PA] and lateral views. Subjects with normal chest x-ray within 3 months of Screeni ng will not require a repeat chest x-ray, if documentation is available. In Japan, a CT scan of the chest may be performed in lieu of a CXR, at investigator's discretion. mm. If a subject had a negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test within 90 days of Screening and source documentation is available, the test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. PPD skin test is only to be used if the site is unable to perform the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus testing and is to be read 48 to 72 hours after placement. nn. It is requested to have a minimum of 8 hours fasting before any chemistry and lipid. If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non- fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation test."
