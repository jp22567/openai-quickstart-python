Study Design Originally, t his was amulticenter, randomized, double -blind study conducted as a postmarketing requirement by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to evaluate an alternat e dose regimen for lenvatinib in combination with everolimus. Asof 14 Jul 2018 ,all ongoing subjects’ treatment assignment has been unblinded to investigational site personnel, and the study will be conducted in an open -label fashion .The investigational site personnel and study subjects will be unblinded as to the treatment assignment for all newly enrolled subjects . In subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti -angiogenic treatment, the current approved lenvatinib dose is 18 mg daily incombination with everolimus 5mgdaily . This study will evaluate the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus in subjects with advanced predominant clear cell RCC following one prior vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF )-targeted treatment at 14- mg starting dose of lenvatinib and allow up -titration of lenvatinib to determine whether this regimen provides comparable efficacy but has a better safety profile than the 18 -mg starting dose. The 14- mg starting dose will be escalated to 18 mg if no Grade 2 (intolerable) or any ≥Grade 3 treatment -emer gent adverse events ( TEAEs )that require dose reduction are observed in the first cycle (4 weeks) of treatment. If Grade 2 (intolerable) or Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs are observed, the lenvatinib dose will be reduced, as described below in the dose reduction section. Bot h lenvatinib and everolimus will be administered orally ( PO)and once daily ( QD). Eligible subjects will have measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and will be randomly assigned to each treatment arm in a 1:1ratio. The total sample size will be approximately 338subjects. Randomization will follow a predefined randomization scheme based on the following stratification factors: Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic groups ( favorable , intermediate ,or poor risk); and whether subjects have had a prior PD -1/PD -L1 treatment (yes orno). Subjects will receive study treatment as continuous 28-day cycles . Treatment cycles will be counted continuously regardless of dose interruptions. Subjects will undergo safet y and efficacy assessments as defined in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments and in the Schedule of Assessments after the Data Cutoff for the Prim ary Analysis . After the data cutoff for the primary analysis subjects ,will be eligible to receive study treatment as continuous 56 -day cycles . Subjects will discontinue study treatment upon evidence of progressive disease, as judged by the Investigator. After disease progression, subjects will be followed for survival and PFS2 until data cutoff for the primary analysis . This study will consist of 2 phases, the Prerandomization Phase ,and the Randomization Phase with treatment continuing after the data cutoff for the primary analysis . The Prerandomization Phase will last no longer than 28 days and will include a Screening Period to establish protocol eligibility and a Baseline Period to confirm eligibility and establish disease characteristics prior to randomization and treatment. Repeated laboratory evaluation to establ ish eligibility is not allowed unless discussed and agreed upon with the sponsor. The Randomization Phase will consist of a Treatment Period and a Follow -up Period. It will begin at the time of randomization of the first subject and will end at the data c utoff for the primary analysis , which is defined as when all randomized subjects complete the Week -24 tumor assessments or discontinue study treatment before Week 24.

The Treatment Period for an individual subject will begin at the time of randomization and will end upon completion of the Off -Treatment Visit, which will occur within 28 days after the fina l administration of study drug. The Treatment Period consists of open -label treatment with study drug in 28 -day treatment cycles that will be counted continuously regardless of dose interruptions. Serious adverse events (SA Es) and AEs must be captured for 28days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects will undergo safety and efficac y assessments as defined in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments and will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression. The Follow-up Period will begin immediately after the Off -Treatment Visit and will continue as long as the subject is alive, unless the subject withdraws consent, or until the data cutoff for the primary analysis . Subjects who discontinue study drug treatment prior to disease progression will continue to have tumor assessments performed every 8 weeks until documentati on of disease progression or initiation of another anticancer treatment. Following the Off-treatment Visit , subjects will continue tobe followed every 12 weeks (±1week) for survival and PFS2 , and all anticancer treatments received will be recorded until the data cutoff for the primaryanalysis (ie, Follow -up ends at the end of the Randomization Phase) .This information will be recorded unless this information is not allowed to be provided due to confidentiality. If a subject discontinues study treatme nt and does not consent to continued follow -up, the investigator must not access confidential records that require the subject’s consent. However, an investigator may consult public records to establish survival status. While receiving investigational pro duct, subjects should continue with the same assessments as noted in the Schedule of Assessments/Procedures. All s ubjects who are still on study treatment after the data cutoff for the primary analysis (ie, at the end of the Randomization Phase) will continue to receive investigational product until they complete the Off -Treatment Visit. After the data cutoff for the primary analysis, t he Treatment Period will consist of 56-day treatment cycles and an Off-Treatment Visit, where subjects still on study treatment following the data cutoff of the planned primary analysis (ie, at the end of the Randomization Phase) will continue to receive the same treatment they received during the Randomization Phase. Study treatment will continue until confirmed disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject request, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow up or study termination by the sponsor . If the study is terminated by the sponsor, study drug (s) will be provided to subjects where commercial access is not available . Tum or assessments will be performed according to the local standard of care, and scans will no longer be required to be sent to the imaging core laboratory ( ICL) . The Off -Treatment Visit will occur wit hin 28days after the final dose of study treatment. After the data cutoff for the primary analysis, all AEs leading to study drug discontinuation and SAEs will be recorded until 28 days after the last dose of study drug. The definition of the End of the Studyis the last subject’s last assessment (Off -Treatment Visit) after the data cutoff for the primary analysis . The data obtained after the data cutoff for the primary analysis will be summarized and included in the CSR at the end of study as an addendum.

For Grade 3 toxicity, investigator will decide the probability of the event being related to one or both drugs as to whether dose modification of 1or both drugs is required. f.For asy mptomatic laboratory abnormalities, such as Grade ≥3 elevations of amylase and lipase that are not considered clinically relevant by the investigator, continuation of treatment should be discussed with the Sponsor. g.Excluding laboratory abnormalities judged to be non -life-threatening, in which case manage as Grade 3. Lenv atinib Dose Reducti on Schedule For Intolerable Toxicities Lenvatinib dose reductions occur in succession based on the previous dose level (18,14, 10, 8, and 4mg/day),as shown in the table below. Dose Reductions for Lenvatinib in Combination with 5 mg Everolimus Current Dose (QD) Dose Reduction 18 mg 14 mg QD 14 mg 10 mg QD 10 mg 8 mg QD 8 mg 4 mg QD MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION Hypertension is a recognized side effect of treatment with drugs inhibiting VEGF signaling. Investigators should therefore ensure that subjects enrolled to receive treatment with l envatinib have BP of ≤150/90 mm Hg at the time of study entry and, if known to be hypertensive, have been on a stable dose of antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week before Cycle 1/Day 1. Early detection an d effective management of hypertension are important to minimize the need for lenvatinib dose interruptions and reductions. Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg) is confirmed on 2 assessments a minimum of 30 minutes apart . One BP assessment is defined as the mean value of 3 measurements at least 5 minutes apart. After the data cutoff for the primary analysis, one BP assessment is defined as the mean value of 2 measurements at least 5 m inutes apart. The choice of antihypertensive treatment should be individualized to the subject’s clinical circumstances and follow standard medical practice. For previously normotensive subjects, appropriate antihypertensive therapy should be starte d when systol ic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg is first observed on 2 assessments a minimum of 30 minutes apart. For those subjects already on antihypertensive medication, treatment modification may be nece ssary if hypertension persists. Lenvatinib should be withheld in any instance where a subject is at imminent risk to develop a hypertensive crisis or has significant risk factors for severe complications of uncontrolled hypertension ( eg,BP ≥160/100 mm Hg, significant risk factors for cardiac disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, or other significant co -morbidities). Once the subject has been on the same hypertensive"

During the Treatment Period, subjects with systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mm Hg must have their BP monitored on Day 15 or more frequently as clinical lyindicated unt il systolic BP has been ≤150 mm Hg a nd diastolic BP has been ≤95 mm Hg for 1 treatment cycle (ie, 56- day cycle ). If a repe at event of systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mm Hg occurs, the subject must resume the Day -15 evaluation unt il systolic BP has been ≤150 mm Hg a nd diastolic BP has been ≤95 mmHg for 1 treatment cycle (ie, 56- day cycle ). The following g uidelines should be followed for the management of systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg confirmed on repeat measurements after 30 minutes : 1.Continue lenvatinib and institute antihypertensive therapy for subjects not already receiving this. 2.For those subjects already on antihypertensive medication, the dose of the current agent may be increased, if appropriate, or one or more agents of a different class of antihypertensive should be added. 3.If systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg persis ts despite maximal antihypertensive therapy, then lenvatinib administration should be interrupted. It should be restarted at 1dose level reduction only when systolic BP ≤150 mmHg and diastolic BP ≤95mmHg and the subject has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication for at least 48 hours. -If systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg recurs on the first dose reduction despite optimal management of hypertension with antihypertensive medications (either by dose increase or the addition of a differ ent class of antihypertensive), then lenvatinib administration should be interrupted. It should be restarted at an additional dose reduction only when systolic BP is≤150 mmHg and diastolic BP is≤95 mmHg and the subject has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication for at least 48 hours. -If systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg recurs on the second dose reduction despite optimal management of hypertension with antihypertensiv e medications (either by dose increase or the addition of a different class of antihypertensive), then lenvatinib administration should be interrupted. It should be restarted at a third dose reduction only when systolic BP is≤150 mmHg and diastolic BP is≤95 mmHg and the subject has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication for at least 48 hours. -Additional dose reduction should be discussed with the sponsor. The following guidelines should be followed for the management of Grade 4 hypertension (life- threatening consequences): 1.Institute appropriate medical management 2.Discontinue study treatment MANAGEMENT OF PROTEINURIA Regular assessment of proteinuria should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments. Guidelines for a ssessment and management of proteinuria: 1.Grading will be based on the 24- hour urinary protein result. Management of lenvatinib administration will be based on the grade of proteinuria according to the “Dose Modification Guidelines for Lenvatinib -Everolimus Combination Treatment -Related Toxicity.” 2.A 24 -hour urine collection (within 72 hours) to verify the grade of proteinuria for protein quantitation is required in the following situations: -The first (initial) occurrence of ≥2+ proteinu ria on urine dipstick while on study drug"

MANAGEMENT OF DIARRHEA An anti -diarrheal agent should be recommended to the subject at the start of study treatment and subjects should be instructed and educated to initiate anti -diarrheal treatment at the first onset of soft bowel movements. The choice of anti -diarrh eal agent should be individualized to the subject’s clinical circumstances and follow standard medical practice. If signs/symptoms of diarrhea persist despite optimal medical management, instructions contained in the“Dose Modification Guidelines for Lenvatinib -Everolimus Combination Treatment -Related Toxicity” should be followed. MANAGEMENT OF NON -INFECTIOUS PNEUMONITIS Non-infectious pneumonitis is a recognized class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including everolimus. Non-infectious pneumonitis w as described in 19% of subjects taking everolimus (AFINITOR®Package Insert ). Some cases were severe and on rare occasions, a fatal outcome was observed. Investigators should therefore consider a diagnosis of non -infectious pneumonitis in subjects presen ting with non -specific respiratory signs and symptoms and in whom infectious, neoplastic ,andother non -medicinal causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Subjects who develop radiological changes suggestive of non- infectious pneum onitis and have few or no symptoms (CTCAE Grade 1) may continue study dosing without dose adjustments. If symptom s are moderate (CTCAE Grade 2): -Lenvatinib -everolimus combination therapy should be interrupted and the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until symptoms abate (resolved to CTCAE Grade 0- 1) and may then be restarted at the same doses prior to study treatment interruption. -If Grade 2 non -infectious pneumonitis recurs despite optimal management, then lenvatinib - everolimus combination therapy administration should be interrupted ,and the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until symptoms abate (resolved to CTCAE Grade 0 -1). If symptoms are severe (CTCAE Grade 3): -Lenvatinib -everolimus combination therapy should be interrupted and the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical s ymptoms resolve (to CTCAE Grade 0-1). Investigators will decide the probability of the event being related to 1 or both drugs as to whether dose modification of 1 or both drugs is required. If symptoms a re life-threatening (CTCAE Grade 4): -Everolimus should be discontinued. Investigators will decide the probability of the event being related to 1 or both drugs as to whether discontinuation of 1 or both drugs is required. MANAGEMENT OF INFECTIONS"
30,page_30,"Clinical Study Protocol incorporating Amendment 08E7080 -G000 -218 Eisai FINAL: 11 Sep 2020 Confidential Page 31of 146Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose subjects to infections. Therefore, it is important to monitor for signs and sympto ms of infection and treat promptly. Dose alterations of everolimus may be required in accordance with prescribing information. MANAGEMENT OF BLOOD GLUCOSE AND LIPIDS Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia ,and hypertriglyceridemia are recognized class effects of rapamycin derivatives, including everolimus. Glycemic and lipids control should be optimized before starting a subject on this study. Blood glucose will be monitored as specified in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments. For subjects with blood glucose >ULN, a fasting (> 6h, water only) blood gluco se sample will be obtained. Grading according to CTCAE v4.03 will be based on the fasting blood glucose result. The choice of hypoglycemic agent should be individualized to the subject’s clinical circumstances and follow standard medical practice. Dose alterations of everolimus may be required in accordance with prescribing information . MANAGEMENT OF HEPATOTOXICITY Liver function tests ( ALT , AST , bilirubin levels) should be monitored at baseline, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and monthly thereafte r, and as clinically indicated (see Schedule of Procedures/Assessments). If signs/symptoms indicating liver injury occur, instructions contained in the “Dose Modification Guidelines for Lenvatinib -Everolimus Combination Treatment -Related Toxicity” should be followed. Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring. If hepatic failure occurs ,the study drug must be discontinued. MANAGEMENT OF THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS Subjects should be advised to pay attention to symptoms sugge stive of venous thromboembolic events ,which include acute onset of shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, and deep-vein thrombosis ( DVT )signs inc luding lower -extremity swelling and warmth to touch or tenderness. In case any of these symptoms appear, subjects should be instructed to report such symptoms promptly to the treating physician. If a thromboembolic event is confirmed, instructions contained in the “Dose Modification G uidelines for Lenvatinib -Everolimus Combination Treatment -Related Toxicity” should be followed. Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring. If a subject experiences life -threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reactions, i ncluding pulmonary embolism, the study drug must be discontinued. Arterial thromboembolic events ( eg,new onset, worsening, or unstable angina, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrovascular accident) of any grade require study treat ment discontinuation. MANAGEMENT OF POSTERIOR REVERSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME / REVERSIBLE POSTERIOR LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME (PRES/RPLS) In clinical studies with lenvatinib, events of PRES/RPLS were reporte d in less than 1% of lenvatinib -treated su bjects. PRES/RPLS is a neurological disorder that can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, altered mental function, blindness, and other visual or neurological disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI )is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES/RPLS. Appropriate measures should be taken to control BP. In subjects with signs or symptoms of PRES/RPLS , “Dose Modification Guidelines for"

MANAGEMENT OF HYPOCALCEMIA Serum calcium should be monitored per the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments. Corrected serum calcium should be used to assess the grade of hypocalcemia per CTCAE v 4.03, using the following formula: Corrected calcium = ([4 –serum albumin in g/dL] x 0.8 + serum calcium) The formula is not applicable when serum albumin concentration is normal (˃4g/dL); in such situations, the total (uncorrected) serum calcium should be used instead. Hypocalcemia should be treated per institutional guidelines ( eg,using appropriate calcium, magnesium, and Vitamin D supplementation) until resolution. Duration of Treatment A subject will remain on study treatment until 1 or more of the following events occur(s): Progressive Disease (as determined by investigator assessment) Unacceptable toxicity Subject request Lost to follow -up Withdrawal of consent Termination of the study by the Sponsor End of study Concomitant Drug/Therapy The following therapies are prohibited during the Screening and Treatment Period of this study: Concurrent anticancer therapies such as: chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) , radiotherapy (except for palliative radiotherapy of up to 2painful pre -existing, non -target bone metastases), antitumor interventions (surgical resection, thoracentesis, etc.), or immunotherapy Concurrent other investigational drugs Live vaccines while participating in the study. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to the followin g:measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed. However, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg. Flu -Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed . For further information on the prohibited concomitant therapies for everolimus, please refer to the respective Prescribing Information. Treatment (including blood products, blood transfusions, fluid transfusio ns, antibiotics, and antidiarrheal drugs, etc.) of complications of AEs or therapy to ameliorate symptoms may be administered at the discretion of the investigator, unless it is expected to interfere with the evaluation of (or to interact with) the study m edication. For clarification, the following concomitant therapies are also allowed: Adjuvant hormonal therapy for history of definitively treated breast or prostate cancer Bisphosphonates or denosumab"

Assessm ents Efficacy Assessments Tumor assessments will be performed using RECIST 1.1. Investigator -deter mined response assessments will be performed at each assessment time point and entered onto the case report form. Copies of all tumor assessment scans will be sent to an ICL designated by the sponsor for blinded independent efficacy assessment until data cutoff for the primaryanalysis . For subjects enrolled after implementation of Amendment 06,tumor assessments will be carried out following the guidelines provided by the ICL. Tumor assessments (CT chest, and CT or MRI abdomen, pelvis and other known or suspected sites of disease) will be performed during the Prerandomization Phase and then during the Randomization Phase every 8 weeks (within the 8th week) until documentation of progressive disease as determined by the investigator and on a schedule as determined by the treating physician after the data cutoff for the primary analysis , but not less frequently than every 12 weeks or earlier if clinically indicated . All responses must be confirmed no less than 4 weeks following the initial indication of response. A chest x -ray or a skeletal x- ray that clearly demonstrates a new metastatic lesion may be used to document progression in lieu of the CT/MRI scans. A bone scan will be p erformed during the Prerandomization Phase to establish a baseline (a historical bone scan performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization is acceptable), every 24 weeks after randomization, within a target of 1 week ,but no more than 2 weeks following a complete response (CR )as assessed by the investigator , and as clinically indicated after the data cutoff for the primary analysis . Lesions identified on bone scans should be followed at all tumor assessment time points with cross -sectional imaging. A brain scan will be performed at screening and as clinically indicated thereafter, and within a target of 1 week ,but no more than 2 weeks following achievement of a confirmed CR. For subjects with a history of protocol -eligible treated brain metastases, a brain scan will be required at all protocol - specified tumor assessment time points (ie,every 8 weeks) . Subjects with protocol -eligible treated brain metastases should also have brain CT/MRI performed as per local standard of care. For other subjects, b rain scans should be performed as clinically indicated . Subjects going off treatment without disease progression in the Treatment Period during the Randomization Phase, will continue to undergo tumor assessments in the Follow -up Period per the above schedu le until disease progression is documented, another anticancer therapy is initiated, or data cutoff for the primaryanalysis . Pharmacokinetic Assessments Sparse PK samples will be collected from all subjects and will be analyzed using the population pharma cokinetics approach. Pharmacodynamic and Other Biomarker Assessments Samples will be collected at protocol -specified time points as indicated in the Schedule of"

Safety Assessments Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording of all AEs, including all CTCAE v4.03 grades (for both increasing and decreasing severity), and SAEs; regular laboratory evaluation for hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and ECGs; and the performance of physical examinations. An echocardiogram or a MUGA scan in cluding LVEF will be performed at screening, and as clinically indicated. Other Assessments Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL )will be assessed at Baseline (prior to first dose of study drug), on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, and at the Off -Treatment Visit. Every effort should be made to administer HRQoL surveys prior to study drug administration and before other assessments and procedures. Subjects will complete the Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptoms Index -Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI -DRS), the Europ ean Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ -C30 and the European Quality of Life ( EuroQ ol) EQ -5D-3L instruments. Bioanalytical Methods Lenvatinib in plasma and ever olimus in blood will be quantified by use of validated High Perfor mance Liquid Chromatography -tandem mass spectroscopy methods. Statistical Methods Study Endpoints Primary Endpoints Objective response rate (ORR) at Week 24 (ORR 24W) as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1. ORR 24Wis defined as the proportion of subjects with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or pa rtial response (PR) at the Week 24 (after randomization) time point or earlier. To be consider ed a BOR, all responses must be confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of response. Proportion of su bjects with intolerable Grade 2 and any ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs within 24 weeks afte r randomization (as of the Week 24 time point).

In the absence of confirmation of death , subjects will be censored either at the date that the subject was last known to be alive or the date of data cutoff for the primary analysis , whichever comes earlier. Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Kidney Symptom Index -Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI -DRS), the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ -C30 and the European Quality of Life ( EuroQol ) EQ -5D-3L instruments. PFS2, defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression after next line of therapy or death from any cause ,or the date of data cutoff for the primary analysis whichever occurs first. PFS2 censoring rules will be defined in the SAP . Exploratory Endpoints Tumor response endpoints ORR 24W, ORR, and PFS based on IIR assessment. These endpoints will be defined in the same way as those based on the investigator assessments. Associations between blood biomarker and efficacy -related endpoints. Development of exposure/biomarker/clinical endpoint models (whenever possible, using a mechanism -based approach) for both efficacy and safety data. Analysis Sets Full Analysis Set will include all randomized subjects. This will be a secondary analysis set for efficacy endpoints , which will be analyzed according to the treatment randomized, regardless of the treatment actually received. Per-Protocol Analysis Set 1 will include all randomized subjects minus the 32 subjects who had received ≥2 inc orrect lenvatinib doses due to IxRS issues. This will be the primary analysis set for efficacy endpoints , which will be analyzed according to the treatment randomized. (A 33rd subject received a single incorrect lenvatinib dose due to IxRS issues, but given the brief exposure of the incorrect (slightly higher) dose before detection and correction, and because there were no adverse effects, this subject willnotbe exclud ed from this Per -Protocol Analysis Set 1.) Per-Protocol Analysis Set 2will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, had no major protocol deviations, and had both baseline and at least 1 post -baseline tumor assessment. Subjects fo r whom death occurred prior to the first post -baseline tumor assessment will also be included. The Per-Protocol Analysis Set 2 will be asecondary analysis set for efficacy endpoints. The 32 subjects who received ≥2 incorrect lenvatinib dosesdue to IxRS issues are considered as having experienced major protocol deviations and will be excluded from the Per-Protocol Analysis Set2. Safety Analysis Set will include all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1dose of study drug. This will be t he analysis set for all safety evaluations, which will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received. Per-Protocol Safety Analysis Set will include all treated subjects in Per -Protocol Analysis Set 1. This will be the primary analysis set for th e primary safety endpoint , which will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received . Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set will include all subjects who received at least 1dose of study drug with documented dosing history and have at least 1 evaluable lenvatinib plasma or ever olimus whole blood concentration data. Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set will include all subjects who received at least 1dose of study drug with documented dosing history and have at least 1 evaluable pharmacodynamic data.

Quality of Lif e (QoL) Analysis Set will consist of all subjects who have any Qo L data. Efficacy Analyses Analyses of Primary Endpoint : Primary analysis of ORR 24Wwill be based on a non- inferiority test. At each interim analysis and primaryanalysis, the point estimate of ORR 24Wfor each treatment group (18 mg and 14 mg) will be summarized with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The odds ratio of ORR 24W(14 mg vs 18 mg) along with the 90% CI will be calculated using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH ) method stratified by MSKCC prognostic groups and prior PD -1/PD -L1 treatment. The first and second interim analysis will be performed only in the Per -Protocol An alysis Set 1. The primary analysis will be performed in the Per -Protocol Analysis Set 1 as the primary analysis set, and will also be performed in the Per-Protocol Analysis Set 2 and the Full Analysis Set as secondary analysis sets . Non-inferiority in ORR 24Wwill be claimed if the O’Brien -Fleming non-inferiority boundary is crossed at either interim analysis or primary analysis based on the result from the Per-Protocol Analysis Set 1 .If the 1-sided P-value is ≤0.005 at the first interim analysis, or ≤0.014 at th e second interim analysis, or ≤0.045 at the primaryanalysis, non -inferiority in ORR 24Wwill be claimed. Futility will be claimed if the futility boundary is crossed. If the 1-sided P-value is ≥0.776 at the first interim analysis, or ≥0.207 at the second interim analysis, futility will be claimed. The treatment differ ence in ORR 24Wfor 14 mg vs .18 mg will also be estimated along with 90% CIs based on the asym ptotic normal approximation. The safety endpoint for the primary analyses is the proportion of subjects with intolerable Grade 2 and any ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs within 24 weeks after ra ndomization (as of the Week 24 time point). Frequency (number and percentage) will be summarized for intolerable Grade 2 and any ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs within 24 weeks after randomization by treatment. The propor tions will be tested using the CMH test ( 2-sided alpha=0.05) , stratified by MSKCC prognostic groups and prior PD -1/PD -L1 treatment. At each interim analysis and the primaryanalysis, if the noninferiority boundary of the primary efficacy endpoint is cross ed, the analysis of the primary safety endpoint will be performed for Per-Protocol Safety Analysis Set . The proportions will also be summarized descriptively for Safety Analysis Set . To explore homogenei ty of treatment effect across centers/regions, sensitivity analyses will be conducted to adjust center/region effect for the primary endpoints of ORR 24Wand proportion of subjects with intolerable Grade 2 and any ≥Grade 3 TEAEs within 24 weeks after randomization using logistic regression models , including center/region as a covariate. Determination of whether 14 mg lenvatinib can be used as an alternative dosing strategy will be based on clinical judgment by the Sponsor in consultation with the independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC )(as specified in the DMC charter) by assess ingrisks and benefits according to the totality of the safety and efficacy data. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints : All secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively for the Per -Protocol Analysis Set 1, Per-Protocol Analysis Set 2, and Full Analysis Set . The media n PFS and PFS2 will be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit estimates for each treatment group and presented with 2- sided 95% CIs. The KM estimate of PFS will also be plotted ov er time for each treatment group. Point estimate of ORR and 95% CI will be summarized for each treatment arm. Odds ratio with 90% CI will be estimated using the CMH method stratified by MSKCC prognostic groups and prior PD-1/PD -L1 treatment."

The KM estimates of OS will be plotted over time. All safety analyses will be pe rformed on the Per-Protocol Safety Analysis Set and the Safety Analysis Set and summarized by treatment g roup. The proportion of subjects who discontinue treatment due to toxicity will be summarized by frequency counts and perce ntages. Median, upper ,and lower quintiles of time -to-treatment failure due to toxicity will be summarized for subjects who discontinue study treatment due to TEAEs. For HRQoL analyses, summary statistics of the scores for the derived functional / symptom scales according to the sco ring m anual and global health status scores will be summarized by treatment arm at each time point. A separate pre -specified HRQoL analysis following FDA and EMEA PRO Guidelines will be performed and detailed in a separate SAP and HRQoL report. Scoring o f EQ-5D-3L and derivation of utility for health economic analysis will also be accomplished in a separate analysis and described in a separate HRQoL report. Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints : All exploratory endpoints will be summarized descriptively. Exploratory efficacy response endpoints ORR 24W, ORR, and PFS based on IIR assessment will be summarized using the same statistical methods as those used for the same response parameters based on the investigator assessments. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodyn amic and Other Biomarker Analyses Pharmacokinetic Analyses Lenvatinib and everolimus concentration s will be summarized by use of descriptive statistics and plotted as appropriate for each treatment group. Concentration s of lenvatinib in plasma and everoli mus in whole blood will be pooled with existing data from other completed studies and analyzed using a population PK approach to estimate population PK parameters for each drug . The analyses will be detailed in a separate analysis plan. Pharmacokinetic/Ph armacodynamic Analyses Lenvatinib and everolimus exposure parameters (AUC or concentration at the time of the event or cumulative AUC, as appropriate) derived from the population PK analysis will be related to biomarker, safety, and efficacy data using a m odel-based approach. For some PK/ PDanalyses, data from this study will be pooled with data from the Phase 2 Study E7080 -G000 -205 (Study 205). For the exposure -response relationship for biomarkers (eg,VEGF, Ang -2) data will be analyzed using a model -based approach with indirect PK/PD models. For efficacy, a tumor growth inhibition model based on longitudinal tumor size measurements of target lesions will be included. Study drug exposure for lenvatinib and everolimus and/or measured biomarkers ( eg,VEGF, Ang -2) will be investigated as predictors and/or correlations with tumor burden changes in the tumor growth inhibition model , whenever possible using a mechanism -based appro ach. Other analyses will include logistic regression analysis for ORR 24W,KM plots of PFS data, and Cox-regression analysis. For the Cox -regression analysis of PFS, adjustment will be made for subject’s baseline characteristics or tumor -related features. In addition to lenvatinib and everol imus exposure, changes in biomarker concentrations and/or tumor burden will be related to PFS , whenever possible using a mechanism -based approach . For the exposure -response relationship of safety, the model -based analysis will include the following AEs: hypertension (systolic and diastolic BP),triglyceridemia (and cholesterolemia ),glycemia, proteinuria, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. For hypertension, triglyceridemia (and cholesterolemia) and glycemia ,data will be analyzed using an indirect -response model. For proteinuria, urine dipstick and/or 24 -hour urine data will be analyzed using a longitudinal categorical"

For time to treatment discontinuation due to an AE and time to first dose reduction, KM plots stratified by lenvatinib exposure will be prepared. Population PK and PK/ PDanalyses will be detailed in a separate analysis plan. Biomarker Analysis The effect of lenvatinib and everolimus combination treatment on exploratory biomarkers will be summarized by treatment group. Associations between clinical outcomes and baseline b iomarker levels, and/or change in levels from baseline will be explored. The analysis willbe detailed in the biomarker analysis plan (BAP) and reported separately. For exploratory endpoints, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic and Other Biomarker endpoints, their respective analysis plans will specify if the analyses will and will not include the 32 subjects who received ≥2 incorrect lenvatinib dose sdue to IxRS issues. Safety Analyses All safety analyses will be performed by treatment group for the Per-Protocol Safety Analysis Set and Safety Analysis Set . The incidence of TEAEs, intolerable Grade 2 TEAEs that lead to dose interruption, dose reduction, or drug discontinuation, and SAEs will be summarized and rates will be summarized descriptively . Time to treatment discontinuation due to an AE, number of dose reductions, and time to first dose reduction will be summarized. Laboratory test results, vital signs an d their changes from ba seline, and 12 -lead ECG results will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Abnor mal values will be flagged. Prior and c oncomitant medications, medical/ surgical history and subject demographics will be summarized and listed. Interim Analyses Safety and efficacy monitoring will be performed by an independent DMC. The function and membership of the DMC will be described in the DMC charter. Minutes from the open meetings of the DMC will be provided to regulatory agencies, if re quested. Two interim analyses will take place when 150 and 200 total subjects in Per -Protocol Analysis Set 1 have completed 24 weeks follow -up or discontinue earlier. Each interim analysis will test both non - inferiority and futility of the 14 -mg arm ORR 24Wcompared with the 18 -mg arm ORR 24W.An O’Brien -Fleming stopping boundary will be used for non-inferiority . An interpolated non -binding stopping bou ndary will be used for futility . Sample Size Rationale The objective of the study is to assess whether a starting dose of lenvatinib 14 mg QD in combination with everolimus 5 mg will provide comparable efficacy with an improved safety profile compared with lenvatinib 18 mg in combination witheverolimus 5 mg . Determination of whether 14 mg lenvatinib can be used as an alternative dosing strategy will be based on clinical judgment by the Sponsor in consultation with the independent DMC (as specified in the D MC charter) by assess ing risks and benefits according to the totality of data at either of the interim or primary analys es. Nevertheless ,the sample size is guided by the plan of testing non -inferiority on primary efficacy endpoint and superiority on primary safety endpoint. The details and assumptions are provided below. Sample size is based on detecting both the non -infer iority of ORR 24Wand superiority of the primary safety endpoint of the proportion of subjects with intolerable Grade 2 and any ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs within 24 weeks after ra ndomization in comparison of 14- mg arm to 18 -mg arm."

The non -infer iority margin is chosen to ensure that a reasonable fraction of the lenvatinib 18 mg + everolimus vs. everolimus treatment effect is preserved. A 70% retention of the treatment effect of lenvatinib 18 mg + everolimus vs. everolimus is used for this design. Following the approach in Rothmann et al. (2003), using the 95% CI upper limit method based on logarithm of the odds ratio, the non -inferiority margin is estimated as exp((1− )∗ (            95%    log           (         18   +     ⁄ ))), wher e0 <   < 1 is the retention rate. To retain 70% of the lenvatinib 18 mg + everolimus vs. everolimus treatment effect, the non-inferiority margin of the odds ratio is est imated to be exp((1−0.7)∗    (0.395)) =0.76 (ie,Ha: OR (14 mg/18 mg)> M). The table below lists the non -infer iority margins on the scale of difference in ORR 24Wbetween the lenvatinib 14 -mg + everolimus arm and the lenvatinib 18- mg + everolimus arm corresponding to a 0.76 non -inferiority margin on the odds ratio scale for a different ORR 24Win the lenvatinib 18- mg +ever olimus arm. ORR 24Win the lenvatinib 18 -mg armNon-inferiority margin on difference scale (lenvatinib 14-m g arm -lenvatinib 18 -mg arm) 10% -0.02 20% -0.04 30% -0.05 40% -0.06 50% -0.07 60% -0.07 Two interim analyses will take place when 150 and 200 total subjects in the Per -Protocol Analysis Set 1 have completed 24 weeks follow -up or discontinue earlier. Each interim analysis will test both non-inferiority and futility of the 14 -mg-arm ORR 24Wcompared to the 18- mg-arm ORR 24W. An O’Brien -Fleming stopping boundary will be used for non -inferiority. An interpolated non -binding stopping boundary will be used for futility, which will spend β = 0.005 and β = 0.10 at the first and second interim analysis, respectively. Assuming 37% ORR 24Win the lenvatinib 18- mg arm and 45% ORR 24Win the lenvatinib 14- mg arm, and adjusting for the interim analyses, a total of 3 06 subjects (153 per arm) is required to achieve 80% statistical power at one -sided α = 0.05. The stopping boundaries on the P-value scale and the cumulative error probabilities spent at each interim analysis and primaryanalysis are shown in the table bel ow. For example, at the second interim analysis, non -infer iority in ORR 24Wwill be claimed if the P-value is ≤0.014; futility will be claimed if the P-value is ≥0.207.

Assuming 75% of subjects with intolerable G rade 2 or above TEAEs within 24weeks after randomization in the 18 -mg arm, with a total of 306 subjects, a superiority test at 2-sided α = 0.05 will give 80% statistical power to detect a 15% drop in proportion of subjects with intolerable Grade 2 or above TEAEs within 24 week s after randomization in the 14 -mg arm. In consideration of both the prim ary efficacy and safety endpoints, a total of approximately 306subjects was originally planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to both treatment arms. Since there wer e 32 subjects who received ≥2 incorrect lenvatinib dosesdue to IxRS issues, the numb er of subjects to be randomized will be increased by 32 to a total of approximately 338. Thus , approximately 306 subjects will be included in the Per -Protocol Analysis Set 1. Randomization will be stratified by MSKCC prognostic groups ( favorable , intermediate ,and poor risk) and whether subjects have had a prior PD -1/PD -L1 treatment (yes or no)."

The safet y profile for l envat inib plus evero limus was consistent with the known toxicit ies o f each individual agent, with no unexpected treatm ent-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) observed (AFINITOR®Pack age Insert and LENVIMA®Package Insert ).The most common TEAEs of any grade in the l envat inib plus everolimus arm were diarrhea and fat igue or asthenia. Grade 3 and 4 AEs occurred i n 36/51 (71%) of the subjects in the lenvat inib plus evero limus cohort. The m ost comm on Grade 3 or 4 TEAE in the lenvat inib plus evero limus cohort was diarrhea (10/51 [20%]). The percentage of subjects with lenvatinib dose reduction and/or do se interruption was similar in the combinat ion and l envatinib arms (84.3% and 78.8%, respectively). The percentage of subjects with study treatm ent di scontinuat ion was similar in both lenvat inib containing arms (23.5% for the combinat ion and 25.0% for the lenvatinib arm). Diarrhea and vo miting were the most frequently reported AEs that led to dose reduction and/or interruption in the co mbinat ion arm . These events resulted in dose reduction and/or interrupti on m ore of ten in the combinat ion than in the lenv atinib arm: 41.2% vs 28.8%, respectively , for diarrhea and 19.6% vs 5.8%, respectively, for vomit ing. The percentages of subjects with study treatm ent discontinuat ion due to AEs were similar in both the combinat ion and l envat inib arms (23.5% and 25.0%, res pectively) and were approximately 2-fold higher than in the evero limus arm (12.0%)."

The percentage of subjects with study treatment discontinuat ion due to AEs was higher in the combinat ion arm (23.5%) com pared to everolimus arm (12.0%). Two deaths were deemed related to study drug, 1cerebral hemorrhage in the lenvatinib plus evero limus group and 1myocardial infarct ion with single -agent l envatinib (Motzer, et al ., 2015) . 7.2 Results of Exposure -Response Analyses for Lenvatinib plus Everolimus The intent of the current study is to determine whether a different dosing regimen can maintain the significant efficacy ( object ive response rate at 24 weeks; ORR 24W) while reducing the frequency o f Grade 3 and 4 AEs. To that end, using data from Study 205,Eisai and the FDA have co llaboratively developed a tumor -growth PK/PD model, as depi cted in Figure 2 ,which incorp orates tumor suppression by both lenvat inib and evero limus and tumor resistance to lenvat inib for the purpose of evaluat ing, in terms o f safety and efficacy , the effect of (1) lower lenvat inib starting doses, (2) lenvat inib drug ho lidays (eg. 2 -week on/1-week off), and (3) different lenvat inib starting doses with the option of up -titrations of the lenvat inib dose. The model (shown below) incorporates terms for the natural growth rate of the cl ear cell RCC tumors and the growth suppressing effects of both lenvatinib and evero limus . Addit ionally, an exposure -AE binary model was devel oped for the rel ationship between exposure to lenvatinib and any AEleading to drug reduction, interruption or discontinuat ion (data on file; Modeling and Simulation Report CPMS -E7080 -008ADD ).

54,page_54,"Clinical Study Protocol incorporating Amendment 08E7080 -G000 -218 Eisai FINAL: 11 Sep 2020 Confidential Page 55of 146The FDA and Ei sai both utilized these modelsto explore various exposure -response analyses for the time course of tumor burden (size) and dose- altering AEs to aid in t he design of the current study . The three cases modeled were: (Case 1) where lenvat inib starting doses less than 18 mg QD in combinat ion with 5 mg QD evero limus were administered and doses were reduced as necessary to control AEs; (Case 2) where a lenva tinib drug holiday was incor porated into the dosage regimen; and (Case 3) Case 1 with the additional caveat that a subject’s lenvat inib dose could be subsequently raised as lo ng as the subject tolerated the current dose. Note that Study 205 fo llowed Case 1. The m odeling resul ts showed that in Case 1, lenvatinib daily doses less than 18 mg were less effect ive, ie, the simulated percent reduction in tumor size was less and occurred l ater than with the 18 -mg dose (see Figure 3),and the predicted ORR 24Wwas lower . * In combinat ion with 5 mg QD everolimus. Figure 3 Case 1 – Effect Of Starting Dose Levels Less Than 18 Mg Lenvatinib* With N o Allowance For Lenvatinib Dose Escalation In Case 2 (see Figure 4), the efficacy o f regimens utilizing a lenvatinib drug holiday proved less effect ive than continuous dosing ,and the predicted ORR 24Wwas l ower ."

The reference 18- mg lenvatinib dose re gimen will only allow reduction of the dose as necessary to con trol AEs. In contrast, the 14 -mg lenvatinib dose regimen will require one 4 -mg/day increase (ie, to 18 m g)on Day 1 of Cycle 2, if the subject is tolerat ing the 14-mg dose (while also allowing reducti on of the dose whenever necessary to control AEs). The obj ective o f the study is to determine whether the lower lenvat inib starting dose regimen provides equivalent efficacy (as assessed by ORR 24W) with increased safet y to the subjects with RCC. 8STUDY OBJECTIVES 8.1 Primary Objective The primary object ive of the study is toassess whether a starting dose of lenvat inib 14 mg in combinat ion with everolimus 5 m g QD will provide com parable efficacy (based on ORR 24W) with an improved safet y profile co mpare d to l envatinib 18 mg in combinat ion with evero limus 5 mg (based on treatment -emergent intolerable Grade 2 or any ≥Grade 3 AEs in the first 24 weeks after randomization)."

This study will evaluate the combinat ion of lenvat inib and evero limus at a 14-mg starting dose of lenvatinib and allow up -titration of lenvat inib to determine whether this alternate dose regimen provides compa rable efficacy but has a better safet y profile than the 18 -mg starting dose in this subject populat ion. The 14-mg starting dose will be escalated to 1 8 mg if no Grade 2 (intolerable) or any ≥Grade 3 TEAEs that require dose reduction are observed in the first cy cle (4 weeks) of treatment. If Grade 2 (intolerable) or Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs are observed, the lenvat inib dose will be reduced, as described in the dose reduction sect ion (Secti on 9.4.2 ). Both lenvat inib and evero limus will beadministered orally ( PO)and daily (QD). Eligible subjects will have measurable disease according to Response Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and will be randomly assigned to each treatment arm in a 1:1 ratio. The total sample size will be approximately 338 subjects. Rando mizat ion will fo llow a predefined rando mizat ion scheme based on the fo llowing stratificat ion factors: Mem orial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic groups ( favorable , intermediate ,or poor risk); and whether subjects have had a prior PD -1/PD -L1 treatment (yes orno). Subjects will receive study treatm ent as continuous 28 -day cycles. Treatment cy cles will be counted continuously regardless of dose interruptions. Subjects will undergo safet y and efficacy assessments as defined in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments (Table 6)and in theSchedule of Assessments After the Data Cutoff for the Primary Analysis (Table 7).After the data cutoff for the primary analysis subjects will be eligible to receive s tudy treatm ent as continuous 56- day cycles. Subjects will discontinue study treatm ent upon evidence of progres sive di sease, as j udged by the invest igator. After disease progression, subjects will be fo llowed f or survival and PFS2 until the data cut -off for the primary analysis .

The purpose of the Screening Period is to obtain informed consent and to establish protocol eligibilit yaccording to the inclusio n and exclusio n criteria listed in Secti ons9.3.1 and 9.3.2 , respectively . The screening assessment can serve as the baseline assessment if performed within 72 hours before randomizat ion. Inform ed consent will be ob tained after the study has been fully explained to each subject and before the conduct of any screening procedures or assessments. Procedures to be followed when obtaining informed consent are detailed in Section5.3.

Th is informat ion will be recorded unless the informat ion is not allowed to be provided due to confident iality. If a subject discont inues study treatment and does not consent to continued fo llow-up, the investigator must not access confidential records that r equire the subject’s consent. However, an invest igator may consult public records to establish survival status. Copies of tumor assessment scans will no longer be sent to the ICL and independent review will not be carried out during the Fo llow-Up Peri od. All subjects who are still on study treatm ent following the data cutoff for the primary analysis (ie, at the end of the Rando mizat ion Phase) willcontinue to receive the same study treatment. Tum or assessments will be performed according to the local st andard of care, but not less frequently than every 12 weeks or earlier if clinically indicated , and scans will no longer be required to be sent to the ICL.

Following the unblinding on 14 Jul 2018, Study 218 will be conducted in an open -label fashio n;all ongoing and new ly enrolled subjects, as well as investigat ional site personnel , will be unblinded as to the subjects’ treatment assignment. Lenvat inib 18 mg daily in co mbinat ion with everolimus 5 mg daily is approved in the US and EU for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcino ma (RCC) fo llowing 1 prior VEGF -targe ted therapy .The safet y and efficacy of lenvat inib and evero limus in combinat ion was invest igated in Study E7080 -G000 -205 (hereafter referred to as “Study 205”) in subjects with predominant c lear-cell RCC following 1 prior VEGF -targeted treatm ent. The co mbination significant ly pro longed PFS compared wi th either agent as monotherapy , and the safety profile for the combination treatment was consistent with the known toxicit ies of each individual agent, with no unexpected TEAEs observed . Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs occurred in 36/51 (71%) of the subjects in the lenvat inib plus everolimus cohort. The intent of the current 2- armstudy is to determine whether a different dosing regimen for lenvat inib in co mbinat ion with everolimus can m aintain the significant effi cacy (ORR 24W) while reducing the frequency o f Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs. To that end, Eisai and the FDA have co llaboratively developed a tumor -growth inhibit ion model thatincorporates tumor suppressio n by both lenvatinib and everolimus and tumor resistance to lenvatinib for the purpose of evaluat ingsafet y and efficacy . Eisai and the FDA both utilized this model to explore various exposure -response analyses for the time course of tumor burden (size) and dose-altering AEs with data from Study 205. The mode ling results showed that daily starting doses of lenvatinib 14 mg orlenvatinib 18 mg in combinat ion with everolimus 5 m g were indicated. The reference 18 -mg lenvatinib dose regimen will only allow reducti onof the dose as necessary to control AEs. In co ntrast, the 14 -mg lenvatinib dose regimen will require one 4 m g/day increase in the dose on Day 1 of Cycle 2, if the subject is tolerat ing the dose (while also allowing reducti onof the dose whenever necessary to control AEs ).

Refer to the revised Pharmacy Manual for com plete instructions. 9.4.2.2 Management of Hypertension Hypertensio n is a recognized side effect of treatment with drugs inhibit ing VEGF signaling. Invest igators should therefore ensure that subjects enrolled to receive treatment with lenvat inib have BP of ≤150/90 mmHg at the time of study entry and, if known to be hypertensive, have been on a stable dose of ant ihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week before Cycle 1/Day 1. Early detecti on and effect ive management of hypertension are important to minimize the need for lenvat inib dose interruptions and reductions. Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg) is confirmed on 2 assessments a minimum o f 30 minutes apart. One BP assessment is defined as the mean value of 3 measurements at least 5 minutes apart. After the data cutoff for the primary analysis, one BP assessment is defi ned as the m ean value of 2 measurements at least 5 minutes apart. The cho ice of antihypertensive treatment shoul d be individualized to the subject’s clinical circumstances and follow standard medical practi ce. For previously normotensive subjects, approp riate ant ihypertensive therapy should be started when systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg is first observed on 2 assessments a minimum of 30 minutes apart. F or those subjects already on antihypertensive medicat ion, treatm ent m odificat ion may be necessary if hypertensio n persists. Lenvat inib shoul d be wi thheld in any instance where a subject is at imminent risk to develop a hypertensive crisis or has significant risk factors for severe complicat ions of uncontrolled hypertensio n (eg,BP ≥160/100 mmHg, significant risk factors for cardiac disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, or other si gnificant co -morbidities). Once the subject has been on the sam e hypertensive medicat ions for at least 48 hours and the BP is controlled, lenvat inib shoul d be resume d as described below. During the Treatment Period, subjects with systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg must have their BP mo nitored on Day 15 or more frequent ly as clinical ly indicated until systo lic BP has been ≤150 mmHg and diastolic BP has bee n ≤95 mmHg for 1 treatm ent cycle (ie,56-day cycle) . If a repeat event of systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg occurs, the subject m ust resum e the Day -15 evaluati on unt il systo lic BP has been ≤150 mmHg and diastolic BP has been ≤95 mmHg for 1 treatment cy cle (ie,56-day cycle). The fo llowing gui delines shoul d be f ollowed for the m anagement of systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥100 mmHg confirmed on repeat measurements after 30 minutes : 1.Continue lenvat inib and inst itute antihypertensive ther apy for subjects not already receiving this."

The cho ice of antidiarrheal agent should be individualized to the subject’s clinical circumstances and fo llow standard m edical pract ice. If signs/symptom s of diarrhea persist despite optimal medical management, instructions contained in Table 2 ,“Dose Modificat ion Guidelines for Lenvat inib-Everolimus Combinat ion Treatm ent-Related Toxi city,”shoul d be fo llowed. 9.4.2.5 Management of Non -Infectious Pneumonitis Non-infectious pneumonit is is a recognized class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including evero limus. Non -infect ious pneumo nitis was described in 19% of subjects taking evero limus (AFINITOR®Package Insert ). Som e cases were severe and on rare occasions, a fatal outcom e was observed. Invest igators should therefore consider a diagnosis o f non-infectious pneumo nitis in subject s present ing with non -specific respiratory signs and symptom s and in whom infect ious, neopl astic and other non -medicinal causes have been excluded by means o f appropriate investigations. Subjects who develop radio logical changes suggestive of non -infect ious pneumo nitis and have few or no symptoms (CTCAE Grade 1) may continue study dosing wi thout dose adjustm ents. If symptoms are moderate (CTCAE Grade 2): -Lenvat inib-everolimus combinat ion therapy should be interrupted and the use of corticosteroi ds may be in dicated unt il symptoms ab ate (resolved to CTCAE Grade 0-1) and may then be restarted at the same doses prior to study treatm ent interrupti on. - If Grade 2 non- infect ious pneumo nitis recurs despite optimal management, then lenvat inib-everolimus combinat ion therapy administrati on shoul d be interrupted and the use of corticosteroids may be indicated until symptoms abate (resolved to CTCAE Grade 0 -1). If symptoms are severe (CTCAE Grade 3): -Lenvat inib-everolimus combinat ion therapy should be interrupted and the use of corticosteroi ds may be indicated unt il clinical symp toms reso lve (to CTCAE"

Investigators will decide the probability of t he event being related to 1 or both drugs as to whether dose modificat ion of 1 or both drugs is required. If symptoms are life -threatening (CTCAE Grade 4): -Everolimus shoul d be discont inued. Invest igators will decide the probabilit y of the event being rel ated to 1 or both drugs as to whether discontinuation of 1 or both drugs is required. 9.4.2.6 Management of Infections Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose subjects to infect ions. Therefore , it is important to monitor for signs and symp toms of infect ion, and treat promptly. Dose alterations o f evero limus may be required in accordance with prescribing informat ion. 9.4.2.7 Management of Blood Glucose and Lipids Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia , and hypertriglyceridemia are recognized class effects o f rapamycin derivat ives, including everolimus. Glycemic and lipids control should be optimized before starting a subject on this study . Blood gl ucose will be mo nitored as specified in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments. For subjects with bl ood gl ucose > ULN, a fast ing (>6 h, water only) blood glucose sample will be obtained. Grading according to CTCAE v4.03 will be based on the fasting blood glucose resul t. The choi ce of hypoglycemic agent should be individualized to the subject’s clinical circumst ances and fo llow standard m edical practice. Dose alterations o f evero limus may be required in accordance with prescribing informat ion. 9.4.2.8 Management of Hepatotoxicity Liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin levels) should be monitored at baseline, every 2weeks for the first 2 months ,and mo nthly thereafter, and as clinically indicated (see Schedule of Procedures/Assessments , Table 6)and the Schedule of Assessments Af ter the Data Cutoff for the Primary Analysis ( Table 7). If signs/symptoms indicat ing liver injury occur, instructions contained in Table 2 ,“Dose Modificat ion Guidelines for Lenvat inib- Everolimus Co mbinat ion Tre atment-Related Toxi city,”shoul d be f ollowed.

Appropri ate supportive care should be provided together with close mo nitoring. If a subject experiences life-threatening (Grade 4) thromboembo lic react ions, including pulmo nary embo lism, the study drug m ust b e discontinued. Arterial thromboembo lic events ( eg,new onset, worsening, or unstable angina, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrovascular accident) of any grade require study treatm ent discont inuat ion. 9.4.2.10 Management of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome/Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome In clinical studies with lenvat inib, events of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndro me/reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES/RPLS )were reported for less than 1% of lenvat inib-treated subjects. PRES/RPLS is a neurological disorder that can present with headache, seizure, lethargy , conf usion, al tered m ental function, blindness, and other visual or neurological disturbances. Mild to severe hypertensio nmay be present. MRI i s necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES/RPLS. Appropriate measures should be taken to control BP. In subjects with signs or symptoms of PRES/RPLS, instructions contained in Table 2,“Dose Modificat ion Guidelines for Lenvat inib-Everolimus Combinat ion Tre atment-Related Toxi city,” shoul dbe followed. 9.4.2.11 Management of Hypocalcemia Serum calcium shoul d be m onitored per the Schedul e of Procedures/Assessments. Corrected serum calci um should be used to assess the gr ade of hypocalcemia per CTCAE v 4.03, using the following form ula: Corrected calcium = ([4 –serum albumin in g/dL] x 0.8 + serum calcium) The formula is not applicable when serum albumin concentration is normal (˃4 g/dL); in such situations, the total (uncorrected) serum calcium should be used instead. Hypocalcemia shoul d be treated per i nstitutional gui delines ( eg, using appropriate calcium, magnesium, and Vitamin D supplementation) until resolution. 9.4.3 Identity of Investigat ional Products The study drug under evaluat ion in this study is lenvatinib 14 mg and 18 mg in co mbinat ion with everolimus 5 mg.

Randomization will fo llow a predefined rando mization scheme based on the fo llowing stratificat ion factors: MSKCC prognosti c groups ( favorable , interm ediate ,and poor risk); and whether subjects have had a prior PD -1/PD -L1 treatment (yes and no). The rando mizat ion scheme and identificat ion for each subject will be included in the final clinical study report for thi s study . Randomization will be perform ed centrally by an Interactive Voice and Web Response System (IxRS). At enrollment ( and after successful complet ion of Visit 1), the invest igator or desi gnee will call the IxRS to register the subject information. At r andomizat ion (Visit 2), the IxRS will assign each subject a unique 6 -digit rando mizat ion number. At every subsequent dose change, the invest igator or a designee will call the IxRS to register the subject’s visit (see the IxRS Manual for further instructi ons). At e achof these postrandomizat ionvisits, the invest igator will select the subject’s appropriate treatm ent dose in accordance wit h the protocol. As of 01 Oct 2020, the IxRS will be discont inued. Refer to the revised Pharmacy Manual for com plete i nstructi ons. 9.4.5 Selection of Doses in the Study In subjects with advanced predominant clear RCC fo llowing 1prior VEGF -targeted treatm ent, the current approved dose is 18 mg lenvatinib in co mbinat ion with 5 mg evero limus. Study 205 dem onstrated that the combinat ion significant ly prolonged PFS compared wi th either agent as m onotherapy . The intent of the current study is to determine whether a n alternate dosing regimen can provi de com parable efficacy (based on ORR 24WK) withan improved safet y profile co mpared to lenvatinib 18 m g in co mbinat ion with everolimus 5 m g (based on treatment -emergent intolerable Grade 2 or any ≥ Grade 3 AEs in the first 24 weeks after rando mizat ion). A tumor-growth model that was developed collabor atively by Eisai and the FDA was used to explore various exposure -response analyses for the time course of tumor burden (size) and dose-altering AEs with data from Study 205. The modeling results showed that lenvat inib daily doses l ess than 18 mg were les s effect ive, ie,the simulated percent reduction in tumor size was less and occurred later than wit h the 18 -mg dose. Further, the modeling results showed that efficacy regimens that utilize lower starting doses ( ie,12 m g or 14 m g) but allowed up -titration of doses showed equivalent or superior tumor reduction to an 18 -mg starting dose that allowed only dose reducti on of lenvat inib. The utilit y of an u p-titration to"
79,page_79,"Clinical Study Protocol incorporating Amendment 08E7080 -G000 -218 Eisai FINAL: 11 Sep 2020 Confidential Page 80of 14622 m g was also m odeled; there was no added benefit to increasin g the dose to 22 mg from the 14-mg starting dose. Based on these simulations, daily starting doses of lenvat inib 14 mg or 18 m g in co mbinat ion with everolimus 5 mg were chosen. The reference 18 -mg lenvat inib dose regimen will only allow reducti on of the dose as needed to control AE s. The 14- mg lenvat inib dose regimen will require one 4- mg per day increase in the dose on Day 1 of Cycle 2, if the subject tolerates the dose). 9.4.6 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject Lenvat inib will be administered as 3 capsules daily. These 3 capsules will consist of 10 -mg and 4 -mg capsules of lenvat inib or matching placebos provided in the appropriate configuration based on their assigned dose (18 m g or 14 m g). Everolimus is provided as 5-mg tablets(See Section 9.4.1, Table 1). Study drug sare to be taken orally once a day continuously from Day 1/Cycle 1 onward at approximately the same t ime in the morning without regard to food intake . A cycle is considered 28 daysduring the Rando mizat ion Phase and 56days after the data cutoff for the primary analysis . If a subject misses a dose, it may be taken wi thin the 12 hours fo llowing the usual time o f the mornin g dose. If m ore than 12 hours have elapsed fro m the time of the usual daily dose, study drug shoul d be taken the next day at the usual time in the morning. In the event a subject vomits after study drug administrati on, the subject should not take another dose until the next scheduled dose. 9.4.7 Blinding As of 14 J ul 2018, the study is no l onger blinded. 9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy All prior medicat ions (including over -the-counter medicat ions) administered 30 days before the first dose of study drug and any concomi tant therapy administered to the subject during the course of the study (starting at the date of informed consent) until 28 days after the final dose of study drug will be recorded. Additionally, all diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures relating to malignancy should be recorded. Any medicati on that is considered necessary for the subject’s healt h and that is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of or interact with lenvatinib may be cont inued during the study. Treatment of complicat ions or AEs, or therapy to ameli orate symptoms (includ ing blood products, blood transfusio ns, fluid transfusio ns, antibiotics, and ant idiarrheal drugs), may be given at the discret ion of the investigator, unless it is expected to interfere with the evaluation of (or to interact with) lenvatinib. Aspirin, nons teroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and low- molecular -weight heparin (LMWH) are permissible but should be used with caution.

Ery thropoi etin may be used according to ASCO, institutional, or national guidelines, but the subject should be carefully monitored for increases in red blood cell (RBC) counts. 9.4.8.1 Drug -Drug Interactions Lenvat inib’s weak in vitro inhibitory and induct ion potential on cy tochrom e P450 (CYP P450) enzymes (Study No. XT063020) suggests a low risk of lenvat inib interference wit h the PK of other drugs metabolized by CYP P450 enzymes thatare co -administered in u sual clinic practice. Nonclinical studies ident ify CYP3A4 as the important CYP isozyme responsible for human hepat ic met abolism o f lenvatinib. However, clinical studies conducted showed that co -administration of lenvatinib wit h CYP3A4/P -glycoprotein (P -gp) inhibitors or inducers is not of clinical concern. The main metabo lic pathways for lenvat inib in humans were ident ified as enzymat ic (CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase) and non -enzymat ic processes (LENVIMA®Package Insert ). Please refer to Appendix 2 and http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ for the most current informat ion. For subjects receiving evero limus, drugs or substances (including her bal supplements or grapefruit juice) known to be poten t inhibi tors of CYP3A4/P -gp shoul d not be used. Potent inducers o f CYP3A4/P -gp shoul d not be used unless there is no alternat ive treatment available. Moderate/ weak inhibitors or inducers or substrate s of CYP3A4 and/or P -gp shoul d be used wi th cauti on. Dose reducti on of everolimus may be considered when co - administering moderate CYP3A4 or P -gp inhibitors. For further information please refer to the prescribing informat ion. 9.4.8.2 Prohibited Concomitant Ther apies and Drugs Prior therapy must be documented by the f ollowing cri teria prior to entry into study: Any single agent therapy , and any combination of cy totoxi c, horm onal, biological targeted agents, and/or humanized ant ibodies, scheduled to be administered as a prepl anned treatm ent, given concomitant ly, sequentially or both, is considered 1 regimen. Planned neoadj uvant chem otherapy (to debulk the tum or prior to surgi cal interventi on) plus postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is considered 1 regim en. For chemotherapy : if, due to toxi city, the dosing of one or more of the components must be reduced, or one or more of the components of the regimen must be omitted, or one of the com ponents m ust be repl aced wi th another similar drug, the changed versio n of the original regimen is not consi dered a new regimen. However, if a new component, dissimilar to any of the ori ginal com ponents, i s added to the regimen, the new combinat ion is considered a new regimen. For pri or VEGF/VEGFR -targeted agents, treatment with each agent will be counted individually , regardl ess of the durati on of administrati on. If the treatment is interrupted for surgery or radi otherapy or any other reason and then continues with an unchanged schedule and components, that treatment is cons idered as 1regimen despite the interruption."

Instructi ons for the processing, storage, and shipping of samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual (see also Appendix 1 2). 9.5.1.4 Safety Assessments Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs, including all CTCAE v4.03 grades (for both incr easing and decreasing severit y)and SAEs; regular monitoring of hematol ogy, blood chemistry , and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardi ogram s (ECGs) ; and performance of physical examinat ionsduring the Randomization Phase. An echocardiogram or a MUGA scan including LVEF will be perform ed at screening, and as clinically indicated. After the data cutoff for the prim ary analysis , all AEs leading to study discontinuat ion,SAEs and concomitant medicat ionswill be monitored and recorded . Hematology andblood chemistry will be m onitored pri or to administration of study drug and as clinically indicated. Urine di pstick testing will be monitored at each visit and as clinically indicated. A serum or urine pregnancy test will be perform ed during the study for wom en of childbearing potential. A symptom -directed physical examinat ion and vital signs (resting BP, HR, RR and body temperature) will be perform edat each visit andas clinically indicated. A 12 -lead ECG and Echocardi ogram /MUCA scan will be performed as clinically indicated (Table 7). Progression of RCC and signs and symptoms clearly related to the progression of RCC shoul d not be captured as an AE. Disease progressio n is a study endpoint and should be captured i n the CRF as per the guide lines for reporting disease progression. 9.5.1.4.1 ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL SITUATIONS An AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a patientor clinical investigation subject administered an invest igational product. An AE does not necessari ly have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. For this study , the study drug sare lenvat inib and evero limus ."

However, worsening of the primary disease shoul d be captured under efficacy assessments as disease p rogression rather than as an AE Any deterioration in nonprotocol -requi red m easurements of a l aboratory value or other clinical test (eg,ECG or x -ray) that resul ts in symptom s, a change in treatment, or discontinuat ion of study drug Recurrence of an intermittent medical condit ion (eg,headache) not present pretreatment (Baseline) An abnormal laboratory test resul t shoul d be considered an AE if the ident ified laboratory abnorm ality leads to any type of intervent ion, withdrawal of study drug, or wi thhol ding of study drug , whether pr escribed in the protocol or not All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the CRF. All AEs, regardless of relationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the subject signs the study ICF through the l ast visit . Subjects who fail screening primarily due to AE(s) must have the AE(s) leading to screen failure reported on the Screening Disposit ion CRF. All AEs and SAEs will be co llected for 28 days after the last dose. After the data cutoff for the primary analysis, all AEs leading to study drug discont inuat ion and SAEs will be recorded until 28 days after the last dose of study drug. SAEs, irrespect ive of relationship to study drug, m ust be reported as soon as possible but not later than 24 hours from the date when t he invest igator becomes aware of the event . Abnorm al laboratory values shoul d not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be part of the clinical syndro me that is being reported as an AE. It is the responsibilit y of the investigator to review all laboratory findings in all subjects and determine if they consti tute an AE. Medical and scient ific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an iso lated laboratory abnorm ality shoul d be classified as an AE. Any laboratory abnormalit y considere d to consti tute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF. Abnorm al ECG (QTc) results, if not otherwise considered part of a clinical symptom that is being reported as an AE, should be considered an AE if the QTc interval is more than 450ms and t here is an increase of more than 60ms from baseline. Any ECG abnormalit y that the investigator considers as an AE should be reported as such. All AEs must be fo llowed for 28 days after the subject’s last dose, or until reso lution, whichever comes first. Subjects with onset of an AE or deterioration of a preexist ing AE will be fo llowed unt il resolut ion to baseline, start of a new ant icancer treatment, or death. All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or, if resolut ion is unlikely, to stabilizat ion."
88,page_88,"Clinical Study Protocol incorporating Amendment 08E7080 -G000 -218 Eisai FINAL: 11 Sep 2020 Confidential Page 89of 146Every effort must be made by the investigator to categorize each AE according to its severity and its relationship to the study treatment. Assessing Severity of Adverse Events Adverse events will be graded on a 5- point scale according to CTCAE v4.03 (Appendix 3 ). Invest igators will report CTCAE grades for all AEs (for both increasing and decreasing severit y). For Grade 2 AEs that lead to changes in study drug administration (dose held, dose reduced, or dosing discontinuation), the invest igator will be required to confirm in the CRF that the AE is considered intolerable. Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatm ent are: Temporal relat ionship of the onset of the event to the init iation of the study treatm ent The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuat ion of study treatm ent or reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable Whether the event is known to be associ ated wi th the study treatm ent or wi th other similar treatments The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the event The presence of non -study treatm ent-related factors that are known to be associated with the occurrence of the event Classification of Causality The rel ationship of each AE to the study drug will berecorded on the CRF in response to the following question: Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the study drug caused the AE? Yes (rel ated) A causal relati onship between the study drug and the AE i s a reasonable possibilit y. No (not related) A causal relat ionship between the study drug and the AE i s not a reasonable possibilit y. 9.5.1.4.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL SITUATION S A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: Results in death Is life -threatening ( ie,the subject was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occ urred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death) Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on"

Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situat ions. In addit ion to the above, events associated with special situat ions include pregnancy or exposure to study drug through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error . These events associ ated wi th special situat ions are to be captured using the SAE procedures but are to be c onsidered as SAEs only if they meet one of the above criteria. All AEs associ ated wi thspecial si tuations are to be reported on the CRF whether or not they meet the cri teria for SAEs . All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or, if resolut ion is unlikely , to stabilizat ion. The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse event” (ie,there is no untoward m edical occurrence) associated with the hospitalizat ion: Hospitalizations for respite care Planned hospi talizat ions requi red by the protocol Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condit ion requiring the hospi talizati on has not changed afterstudy drug administrati on) Hospitalization for administration of study drug or insertion of access for adm inistration of study drug Hospitalization for routine maintenance o f a device (eg,battery replacement) that was in place before study entry If possible, a blood sample for the measurement of study drug plasma concentration shoul d be drawn at the first report of an SAE or a severe unexpected AE and at its resolution. A blood sam ple to m easure study drug pl asma concentrati ons will no longer be needed after the data cutoff for the primary analysis. 9.5.1.4.3 LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS Clinical laboratory tests to be performed, including hematology , chemistry , urine dipst ick testing, and a serum or urine pregnancy test (for female subjects of childbearing potential), are summarized in Table 5. Subj ects shoul d be in a seated or supine position during blood collect ion. The Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 6) and the Schedule o f Assessments After the Data Cutoff for the Primary Analysis ( Table 7) shows the visit s and time points at which blood for c linical laboratory tests and urine for dipstick testing (and possible 24-hour urine collection to quantify the 24- hour urine protein excret ion)will be collected in the study ."

TSH levels will be repe ated at Day 1 of ever y other cycle (starting with Cycle 2) and at the Off -Treatment visit. c.For subjects with blood glucose >ULN, a fasting (>6 h, water only) blood glucose sample will be obtained. d.For women of childbearing potential ( ie,premenopausal wome n and postmenopausal women who have been amenorrheic for less than 12 months) e.If urine dipstick testing suggests a urinary tract infection, a urin alysis with microscopy and/o r urine culture with sensitivit iesshould be considered, if clinically indicated , at the institution’s laboratory. f.If urine protein by dipstick is ≥2+ (first occurrence or a subsequent increase in severity of urine dipstick proteinuria occurring on the same lenvatinib dose level), then a 24 -hour urine collection should be done to quanti fy the 2 4-hour urine protein excretion. All hematol ogy, clinical chemistry (including pregnancy test, as applicable), and urine samples are to be obtained prior to study drug administrati on and results reviewed prior to administration/dispensing of study drug at the beginning of Cycle 1, and within 48 hours of Day 1 in each treatm ent cy cleand wi thin 72 hours of Day 1 after the data cutoff for the primary analysis . Refer to Table 2 for management of clinically significant laboratory abnorm alities. A laboratory abnorm ality may meet the cri teria to qualify as an AE as described in this protocol (see Secti on 9.5.1.4.1 and the CRF Completion Guidelines. In these instances, the AE corresponding to the laboratory abnorm ality will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF. 9.5.1.4.4 VITAL SIGNS AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS Vital sign m easurements (ie,systolic and diastolic BP [mmHg], pulse [beats per minute], respi ratory rate [per minute], body temperature [in cent igrade]), and weight (kg) will be obtained at the visits designated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments (Table 6)bya validated m ethod. Bl ood pressure and pul se will be m easured after the subject has been resting for 5minutes . All BP measurements should be performed on the same arm, preferably by the same person. One BP assessment is defined as the mean value o f 3measurements at least 5 minutes apart . After the data cutoff for the primary analysis, one BP assessment is def ined as the mean value of 2 measurements at least 5 minutes apart. Vital sign measurements (resti ng BP [including date and time of measurement], HR, RR and body temperature) will be obtained ,excluding weight at the visits designated in the Schedule of Assessments After the Data Cutoff for the Primary Analysis (Table 7).

A di ary will be provi ded to the subject to capture the BP evaluat ions between study visit s. See subsect ion for management of hypertensive subject s (Secti on9.4.2.2 ). 9.5.1.4.5 PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS Physical examinat ions will be performed as designated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments (Table 6)and in the Schedul e of Assessments After the Data Cutoff for the Primary Analysis ( Table 7). Docum entati on of the physical examinat ion will be included in the source documentation at the site. Only changes fro m screening physical examinat ion findings that meet the definit ion of an AE will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF. A symptom -directed physical examinat ion will be performed as clinically indicated. 9.5.1.4.6 ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS ECG swill be performed during screening and every 4 weeks on Day 1 of each cycle during the Rando mizat ionPhase beginning with Cycle 2 a nd at the Off -Treatm ent Vi sit (Table 6) . After the data cutoff for the primary analysis , ECGs maybe performed as clinically indicated (Table 7).Complete, standardized, 12 -lead ECG recordings that permit all 1 2leads to be displayed on a single page with an accompanying lead II rhy thm strip below the customary 3 ×4 lead form at are to be used. In addition to a rhythm strip, a minimum of 3full complexes shoul d be recorded from each lead simultaneously. Subjects are suggested to be in the recumbent posit ion for a period of 5 minutes prior to the ECG. An ECG abnormalit y may meet the criteria of an AE as described in this protocol (see Secti on9.5.1.4.1 ) andthe CRF Co mpletion Guidelines. In these instances, the AE corresponding to the ECG abnormalit y will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF. 9.5.1.4.7 ECHOCARDIOGRAM OR MULTIPLE GATED ACQUISITION SCAN A MUGA scan (using technet ium-99m -pertechnetate) or an echocardiogram to assess LVEF will be performed at Screening and as clinically indicated (Table 6) and ( Table 7). MUGA or echocardiogram scans shoul d be perform ed locally in accordance wit h the institution’s standard practice. MUGA scans are the preferred modalit y; however, whichever modalit y is used for an i ndividual subject at Baseline should be repeated for all subsequent LVEF assessments for that subject. LVEFs as assessed by the inst itution will be entered onto the CRF. Invest igator assessment will be based upon inst itutional reports. 9.5.1.4.8 PREGNANCY TEST A serum or urine pregnancy test(β-hCG or hCG wit h a minimum sensit ivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of β -hCG or hCG) will be performed in women of childbearing potential (ie, prem enopausal wom en and postm enopausal wom en who have been amenorrheic for less than"

Samplesof blood or urine will be taken at designated time points as specifie d in the Schedule of Procedures and Assessments (Table 6)and Schedule of Assessments After the Data Cutoff for the Primary Analysis (Table 7). 9.5.1.5 Other Assessments HRQoL will be assessed at Baseline (prior to first dose of study drug), on Day 1 of each subsequent cy cle, and at the Off -Treatment Vi sitin the Randomizat ion Phase. HRQOL will not be assessed after the data cutoff for the primary analysis . Every effort shoul d be made to administer HRQoL surveys prior to study drug admi nistrati on and before other assessments and procedures. Subjects will co mplete the Cancer Therapy -Kidney Symptom Index -Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI -DRS ;Appendix 9), the European Organizat ion for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ -C30 (Appendix 10)and the European Qualit y of Life ( EuroQ ol) EQ -5D- 3L (Appendix 11)instruments. The FKSI -DRS consists of 9 items that experts and patients have indicated are important targets for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, and that clinical experts have indicated are primarily disease -related, as opp osed to treatm ent-related. Symptoms assessed on the FKSI -DRS include pain, fat igue, shortness of breath, fevers, weight loss, coughing, and blood in urine. The total score can range fro m 0 (worst) to 36 (best). The QLQ- C30 measure co mprises 9 mult iple-item scales and 6 single items. Mult iple-item scales o f QLQ -C30 consist of 6 funct ional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognit ive, social and glo bal QoL) and 3 symptom scales (fat igue, nausea and vo miting, pain). Six single -item scales o f QLQ -C30 invo lve dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial impact. All o f the derived scales range in score from 0 to 100. For the overall HRQoL and funct ioning scales, a higher score is correlated with better HRQoL, whereas a higher score represents worse HRQoL for symptom scales. The EQ - 5D-3L generic QoL questionnaire is co mprised of 5 dimensio ns: m obilit y, self -care, usual act ivities, pain or disco mfort, and anxiet y or depressio n. Each dimensio n has 3levels (1) no problem, (2) some probl em, or (3) extrem e probl em. Thus, the final scoring consists of 243 possible co mbinat ions or health states. The utilit y value for each state is assigned on the basis o f a set of preference weights (tariffs) elicited fro m the general population . 9.5.2 Schedule of Procedures/Assessments Table 6presents the schedule of procedures/assessments for the study .Table 7presents the schedule of procedures/ assessments after the data cutoff for the primary analysis."

Electrolytes such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium should be monitored and ab normalities should be corrected in all subjects before starting treatment per the Investigator’s discretion . Clinical laboratory assessments may be conducted anytime within 72 hours prior to the scheduled visit, unless otherwise specified. If ther e is ≥Grade 3 hematologic or clinical chemistry toxicity, repeat the specific laboratory test and AE assessment at least 3 -7 days (until improvement to <Grade 3). For subjects with blood glucose >ULN, a fasting (>6 h, water only) blood glucose sample will be obtained. l.Urine dipstick testing for subjects with proteinuria ≥2+ should be performed locally ever y 2 weeks (on Day 1 and Day 15 or more frequently as clinically indicated) until the results have been 1+ or negative for 3 consecutive months. Urine dipstick testing should be performed preferably at the investigational site (but may be performed locally by the primary care physician or a local laboratory if the subject doe s not have to come for a visit to the site). If a new event of proteinuria ≥2+ occurs, the subject must resume the Day -15 urine dipstick testing for evaluation of proteinuria until results are 1+ or negative for 3 consecutive months.

There will be two interim analys es and theprimary analysis. The two interim analyse s will be performed using only Per-Protocol Analysis Set 1. The primary analysis will be performed using the Per - Protocol Analysis Set 1 as the primary analysis set and will also be performed using Per- Protocol Analysis Set 2 and the Full Analysis Set as secondary analysis s ets. At each interim analysis and primary analysis, the poi nt estimate of ORR 24Wfor each treatment group (18 mg and 14 m g) will be summarized wi th the corresponding 95% confidence interval ( CI). The odds rati o of ORR 24W(14 m g vs 18 mg) along wit h the 90% CI will be calculated using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) method stratified by MSKCC prognosti c groups and prior PD-1/PD -L1 treatment. Non-inferiorit y in ORR 24Wwill be claimed if the O’Brien -Fleming efficacy boundary is crossed at ei ther interim analysis or primary analysis based on the resul tsfrom the Per -Protocol Analysis Set 1 . If the 1-sidedP-value is ≤0.005 at t he first interim analysis, or ≤0.014 at th e second interim analysis, or ≤0.045 at the primary analysis, non -inferiorit y in ORR 24Wwill be claimed.

Determinat ion of whet her 14 mg lenvat inib can be used as an alternat ive dosing strategy will be based on clinical judgment by the Sponsor in consultat ion with the independent DMC (as specified in the DMC charter) by assess ingrisks and benefit s according to the totalit y of data at ei ther of the interim or primary analyse s. Nevertheless ,the sample size is guided by the plan of testing non -inferiorit y on the primary efficacy endpoint and superiorit y on the primary safet y endpo int. The details and assumpt ions are provided below. Sample size is based on detecting both the non -inferi ority of ORR 24Wand superiorit y of the primary safet y endpo int of the proporti on of subjects with intolerable Grade 2 or any ≥Grade 3 TEAEs within 24 weeks af ter randomizati on in co mpar ison of the 14- mg arm to the 18- mg arm (Appendix 13 ). Non-Inferiority of ORR 24WComparing the 14-mg Arm to the 18-mg Arm Based on the assumption fro m Study 205 that the con firmed ORR for the 18mg lenvatinib + 5mg evero limus arm is 37% (19 responders out of N=51) v s 6% for the everolimus arm (3responders out of N=50), the 95% CIof the odds rati o compar ingeverolimus vs. lenvat inib 18 mg + evero limus arm is (0.029, 0.395) .The non -inferiorit y margin is chosen to ensure that a reasonable fract ion of the lenvat inib 18 m g + everolimus vs. evero limus treatm ent effect is preserved. A70% retention of the treatment effect of lenvatinib 18 mg + evero limus vs. evero limus is used for this design. Following the approach in Rothm ann, etal. (2003) , using the 95% CI upper limit method based on logarithm o f the odds rati o, the non-inferiorit y margin is estimated as exp((1− )∗(            95%    log           (         18   +     ⁄ ))), where 0 <   < 1 is the retention rate. To retain 70% of the lenvatinib18 m g + everolimus vs. everolimus treatment effe ct, the non-inferiorit y margin o f the odds ratio is est imated to be exp (1− 0.7)∗    (0.395) = 0.76 (ie,Ha: OR (14 mg/18 mg)> M) .Listed belo w are the non-inferiorit y margins on the scale of difference in ORR 24Wbetween the lenvatinib 14 -mg + evero limus arm and the lenvatinib 18 -mg + everolimus arm corresponding to a 0.76 non - inferi ority margin on the odds ratio scale for a different ORR 24Win the lenvatinib 18- mg + evero limus arm."

Each interim analysis will test both non -inferiority and f utility of the 14 -mg arm ORR 24Wcompared to the 18-mg arm ORR 24W. An O’Brien -Fleming stopping boundary will be used for non - inferi ority. An interpolated no n-binding stopping boundary will be used f or futility, which will spend β=0.005 and β= 0.10 at the first and second interim analysis, respect ively.

In consideration o f both the primary efficacy and safet y endpoints, a total of approximately 306 subjects were originally planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to both treatment arms. Since there were 32 subjects who received ≥2 incorrect lenvatinib dose sdue to IxRS issues, the number of subjects to be randomized will be increased by 32 to a total of approximately 338.

Amendments specifically affect ing the safet y of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scient ific qualit y of the study requi re submissi on to heal th or regul atory authori ties as well as additional approval by the applicable IRBs/IECs. These requirements should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the invest igator, or by the sponsor, in the interest of preserving the safet y of all subjects included in the study . If the invest igator determines that an immediate change to or deviat ion from the protocol is necessary for saf etyreasons to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects, the sponsor’s medical mo nitor and the IRB/IEC for the site must be notified immediately. The sponsor must notify the healt h or regul atory authori ty as requi red per l ocal regulat ions. Protocol amendments that affect only administrative aspects of the study may not requi re submissio n to health or regulatory authori ty or the IRB/IEC, but the healt h or regulatory authori ty and IRB/ IEC (or if regionally required, the head of the medical inst itution)should be kept informed of such changes as required by lo cal regulati ons. In these cases, the sponsor m ay be requi red to send a letter to the IRB/IEC and the Competent Authorities (or, if regionally required, the head of the medical inst itution)detailing such changes. 11.2 Adherence to the Protocol The invest igator will conduct the study in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to ICH E6, Section 4.5). 11.3 Monitoring Procedures The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the investigator and designated st aff by telephone, letter, or email between study visit s.

In addit ion, since the study was unblinded in July 2018, the sponsor will send a list of treatment codes by study subject to the investigator. The site should plan to retain study docum ents, as di rected by the sponsor, for at least 2 y ears after the last approval o f a market ing applicat ion in an ICH region and unt il there are no pending or contemplated marketing applicat ions in an ICH region or at l east 3 y ears have elapsed since the formal discont inuat ion of clinical development of the invest igational product. It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the investigator retire or relocate, the invest igator contact the sponsor, allowing the sponsor the option of perm anent ly retaining the study records. 11.7 Auditing Procedures and Inspection In addit ion to routi ne monitoring procedures, the sponsor’s Clinical Qualit y Assurance departm ent conducts audi ts of clinical research activit ies in accordance with the sponsor’s SOPs to evaluate compliance wit h the principles of ICH GCP and all a pplicable l ocal regul ations. If a government regulatory authori ty requests an inspect ion during the study or after its com pletion, the invest igator must inform the sponsor immediately. 11.8 Handling of Study Drug All study drug will be supplied to the principal investigator (or a desi gnated pharm acist) by the sponsor. Drug supplies must be kept in an appropriate secure area (eg,locked cabinet) and stored according to the condit ions specified on the drug labels. The invest igator (or a designated pharmacist) must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of the study drug in a drug accountabilit y ledger, a copy of which m ust be given to the sponsor at the end of the study . An accurate record of th e date and am ount of study drug di spensed to each subject must be available for inspect ion at any t ime. The CRA will visit the site and review these documents along with all other study conduct docum ents at appropri ate intervals once study drug has been r eceived by the site. All drug supplies are to be used only for this study and not for any other purpose. The investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy any drug labels or any partly used or unused drug supply before approval to do so by the sponsor . At the conclusio n of the study and as appropriate during the study , the invest igator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used and unused drug containers, drug labels, and a copy of the com pleted drug di sposi tion form to the sponsor’s CRA or des ignated contractor or, when approval is given by the sponsor, will destroy supplies and containers at the site."

Clinical studies were conducted to test these findings. Simultaneous CYP3A4/P -glycoprotein (P -gp) inhibit ion by ke toconazol e slight ly (15% to 19%) increases systemic exposure to lenvatinib ( Shumaker, et al., 2015 ). Since no change was observed in half -life, t max, or lag time (t lag), the slight increase in systemic exposure is probably related to a decrease in first pass metabolism. However, since the magnitude of change i s small, co -administration of lenvat inib with CYP3A4/P -gp inhibitors is not of clinical concern. The influence of P-gp inhibit ion on l envat inib PK has been investigated. P -gp inhibit ion was accomplished by co -administering a single dose of rifampin wit h a single dose of lenvatinib. Preliminary results suggest P -gp inhibit ion increases systemic exposure to lenvat inib 26% to 32%. Thus, co -administration of lenvatinib wit h P-gp inhibitors only causes a small increase in lenvatinib exposure. The influence of simultaneous P -gp and CYP3A4 induct ion on l envat inib PK has been investigated. Examinat ion of simultaneous P-gp and CYP3A4 induct ion on l envat inib PK was acco mplished by administering rifampin QD for 21 day s (Shumaker, et al., 2014 ). A single dose of lenvat inib was co -administered with the 15th dose of rifampin. Based on preliminary data, simultaneous P -gp and CYP3A4 induct ion minimally altered lenvat inib exposure as mean C maxincreased about 8% while AUC decreased about 7%. Co - administration of lenvatinib wit h CYP3A4/P -gp inducers is not of clinical concern. The m ain metabolic pathways for lenvatinib in humans were identified as enzymat ic (CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase) and non -enzymat ic processes (LENVIMA®Package Insert )."
