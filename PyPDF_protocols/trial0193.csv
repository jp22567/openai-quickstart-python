INTRODUCTION Shortly after Charles Huggins first reported on the remarkable palliative benefits of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with advanced prostate cancer, case series recounting the paradoxical benefits of testosterone (T) supplementation in prostate c ancer patients began to emerge [1-5]. Recent preclinical studies have shed light on the mechanism s underlying the antitumor effects of androgens, and have renewed our interest in exploring high- dose T as a therapeutic strategy for men with castration -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) [6-10]. As such, we have recently published the results of a pilot study designed to evaluate the e ffects of rapid cycling between very high and very low serum T levels in men with asymptomatic CRPC, a mode of therapy we call bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) [11]. In this study we found that ~50% of men had PSA declines and radiographic responses (partial or complete responses). Because the induction of DNA damage appears to be a key mechanism underlying the clinical effect s of BAT, we hypothesize that combining BAT with the PARP inhibitor olaparib to impair DNA damage repair (DDR) will improve clinical efficacy. 1.1 Disease Background Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in men in the US. [12] Approximately one in ever y six American men will be diagnosed with the disease during his lifetime. The disease continuum has been modeled as a series of states defined by the presence or absence of detectable metastases and whether testosterone levels are in the castrate or non - castrate range (Figure 1). Each state represents a significant milestone in the illness that forms the basis for clinical research and for medical decision making in the context of routine clinical practice. The standard treatment for patients with metastatic disease includes surgical or medical castration with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analog, which is continued indefinitely (i.e. androgen deprivation therapy, ADT). The results are predictable, with a decline in PSA followed by tumor regression, a period of stability in which the tumor does not proliferate and PSA remains stable, followed by rising PSA and regrowth as a castration resistant lesion. Prostate cancer progression despite castrate levels of testosterone represents a transition to a lethal disease phenotype referred to as castration -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Figure 1.

The first agent, docetaxel, is a semi -synthetic taxane that function by inhibiting microtubule activity. Originally it was only indicated for men with mCRPC, but recent data has demonstrated that it is highly effective when combined with ADT in the upfront treatment of metastatic hormone -sensitive prostate cancer. [18, 21-24] In 2010, the next-generation taxane cabazitaxel was also approved for use in patients progressing on docetaxel.[15] Figure 2: Timeline of recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for mCRPC drugs. Median improvement in overall survival in months (mos) is provided. More recently, it has become apparent that the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis remains engaged even in the castration -resistant setting, with AR -regulated genes (e.g. PSA) often expressed at high levels [25]. While older literature had describe d CRPC as a ‘hormone refractory’ disease state, the term ‘castration -resistant’ has been adopted largely due to the increasing recognition that androgen receptor (AR) signaling still plays a vital role in driving prostate cancer growth, and remains a viabl e target in the CRPC disease space. [26] Indeed, the development of newer drugs like abiraterone (an extragonadal inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis) and enzalutamide (a pure AR -antagonist) that function to inhibit ligand -AR interaction have provided proof of principle that the AR remains an important driver of CRPC growth [13, 14, 19, 20] . Given their similar mechanisms of action, it is not surprising that evidence of cross -resistance between abiraterone and enzalutamide has begun to emerge, with overexpression of AR representing the most frequently observed mechanisms of resistance to AR -signaling inhibitors [25, 27-35]. Other resistance mechanisms described, include: increased extragonadal androgen synthesis; the emergence of constitutively active AR splice variants (AR-Vs); AR point mutations; AR -signaling activation via alternative pathwa ys (e.g. AKT/mTOR/Pi3K, HER kinases); and activation of other nuclear hormone receptors such as the glucocorticoid receptor [25, 36-45]. One or more of these mechanisms may provide a basis for why progression on one AR-directed agent may portend a poor response to the other drug when used second line. 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

Sipuleucel -T is an ex vivo autologous immunotherapy product and remains the only cancer vaccine shown to improve overall survival in Phase III testing [16, 46] . It is designed to produce an immune response toward the prostate antigen PAP. Interestingly no difference in disease progression was observed between patient receiving sipuleucel -t or placebo in the Phase III study, nor did it associate with tumor or PSA responses. Sipuleucel-t is not approved for patients with V\PSWRPDWLFGLVHDVHDQGJLYHQWKDWRQO\PHQZLWKDOLIHH[SHFWDQF\PRQWKVZHUHLQFOXGHG in the pivotal Phase III trial, it is not appropriate for patients with rapidly progressive disease or tho se expected to live <6 months. Radium- 223 is a novel alpha emitting radiopharmaceutical that possesses intrinsic bone targeting properties similar to that of other alkaline earth elements, such as calcium, and is approved for the treatment of symptomatic, bone- metastatic CRPC. Radium -223 is not expected to affect soft tissue metastases, and on this basis radium -223 is not indicated for patients with visceral metastases or nodal metastases >3 cm[17]. As outlined above, the majority of the agents approved for m CRPC are either AR -signaling inhibitors (i.e., abiraterone and enzalutamide) , only indicated for a narrow subset of patients, or have minimal clinical efficacy. Approaches that do not rely on inhibiting the AR -signaling axis are sorely needed. Importantly, preclinical studies have demonstrated that high -dose testosterone has potent anti -tumor activity in prostate cancer models with high AR levels – indicating that treatment with androgen supplementation is likely to be most effective in advanced prostate cancer patients who have progressed on drugs that inhibit AR- signaling [6, 47]. In addition, recent mechanistic studies have indicated that high -dose testosterone may exert an antitumor effect by inducing double strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks, providing a rationale for combining high- dose testosterone with agent s that can impair DNA repair (e.g. PARP inhibitors). 1.2 Supraphysiologic Testosterone (SPT) in CRPC Background 1.2.1 SPT in CRPC Pre-clinical experience As prostate cancer cells adapt to low androgen levels, one of the most frequently observed events is an adaptive upregulation of the androgen receptor (AR) – likely driving resistance to AR-signaling inhibition [25, 35]. We hypothesized that the adaptive autoregulation of AR may serve as a therapeutic liability, sensitizing prostate cancer cells to supraphysiologic androgen - induced cell death. In support of this, we and others have observed that adapted prostate cancer cell lines display blunted cell growth when exposed to supraphysiologic androgen levels (Fig ure 3) [7, 11, 47-52]. 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

B) Growth of adapted LNCaP cells in nude mice treated with a testosterone implant (sq) vs an empty (control) implant (P <0.05 after day 21). Studies exploring the mechanisms behind the paradoxical antitumor effects of SPT have demonstrated that in high-AR cell lines, rapidly transitioning from a castrate to high androgen environment induces double strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks, an effect likely mediate d by topoisomerase IIB (TOP2B) [6, 10, 11] . As AR -mediated transcription proceeds, knots and tangles in DNA occur. In order to overcome these topologic constraints, TOP2B induces transient dsDN A breaks, which are then repaired by the enzyme. Supporting this model is preclinical data showing that the TOP2B poison etoposide is able to potentiate dsDNA breaks by inhibiting DNA re- ligation (Figure 4) [11]. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrate synergy when SPT is combined with DNA damaging doses of radiation [53]. Figure 4: Supraphysiologic androgens induce dsDNA breaks in prostate cancer cells.

As such, we developed a form of intermittent high-T therapy we termed Bipolar Androgen Therapy (BAT) in which serum T levels are rapidly cycled between very high and very low level s in men with asymptomatic mCRPC.[11] We hypothesized that BAT would prevent AR levels from adapting to either high or low androgen conditions, thereby preventing the eme rgence of resistance to high- dose T. In addition, because studies have shown that the dsDNA breaks and apoptosis induced by high-doses of androgens are transient, rapid cycling of T could result in repeated rounds of DNA damage, enhancing antitumor effects [53]. Clinically, BAT has been administered as intramuscular (IM) injections of either testostero ne enanthate or cypionate (which have identical pharmacokinetics) at a dose of 400 mg every 28 days. This dose and formulation was selected because it has been shown to drive T levels well into the supraphysiologic range (>1500 ng/dL), followed by a rapid decline in T back to the near-castrate range at the end of a 28 day cycle [11, 54]. In our initial pilot study testing BAT, w e treated 16 CRPC patients with BAT combined with etoposide for 3 months. Patients whose PSA was falling at the end of this 3 month period were allowed to continue on BAT monotherapy until disease progression. In total, 14 patients completed the first 3 months of therapy and were response evaluable. Of these 14 men, we observed high response rates, with robust PSA responses (Figure 5A ) and tumor shrinkage on scans in 50% of patients [11]. In a more recent study testing BAT in men with hormone- sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) we found that BAT resulted in high- rates of PSA suppression and i mportantly also in improvements in quality of life (Fig ure 5B)[55]. Preliminary results from the RESTORE trial, a Phase II study test ing BAT in men progressing on enzalutamide (N=30), have also revealed evidence of clinical activity in heavily pre -treated mCRPC. In that study 30% of patients had PSA declines IURPEDVHOLQHDQGDPHGLDQ clinical/radiographic PFS of 8.6 months was observed, which compares favorably to other AR-directed therapies given post -enzalutamide [56, 57]. Importantly, BAT was found to be well tolerated across the three trials evaluating it in men with advanced prostate cancer (Figure 6). 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

Figure 6. Adverse events observed in trials testing BAT in men with advanced prostate cancer. Note, the BAT Pilot Study tested BAT in combination with etoposide for the first 3 months of treatment. One individual developed neutropenic sepsis and subsequent ly died. This was deemed to be a consequence of etoposide and unrelated to BAT. Compared to our experience with BAT, older studies testing physiologic doses of T in men with CRPC have documented modest benefit at best [58, 59] . In these contemporary Phase I studies testing physiologic doses of T in men with CPRC, there were no objective radiographic responses and PSA declines >50% occurred in only one out of 27 patients [58, 59]. This is in contrast to our trials testing intermittent doses of SPT (i.e. , BAT) , where we observed high response rates in men with CRPC, with robust PSA responses and tumor shrinkage in 50% of patients [11]. 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

Because this individual’s tu mor had an intrinsic deficiency in its ability to repair DNA damage, it was hypothesized that dsDNA breaks induced by high-dose T were unable to be repaired, and BAT was therefore synthetically lethal to tumor cells [60]. As part of ongoing translational work aimed at understanding the drivers of response/resistance to BAT, w e have performed next-generation sequencing on tumor DNA from seven patients receiving BAT on the TRANSFORMER clinical trial, which is testing BAT vs. enzalutamide in mCRPC patients who have progressed on abiraterone [clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02286921]. Consistent with the findings from the aforementioned case report, we have found that the majority of patients exhibiting a PSA response have detectable alt eration in D NA damage repair pathway genes – further supporting the induction of DNA damage as a key mechanism driving clinical responses to BAT (Figure 7).

PARP inhibition is a novel approach to targeting tumors with deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms. PARP enzymes are essential for repairing DNA single strand breaks (SSBs). Inhibiting PARPs leads to the persistence of SSBs, which are then converted to t he more serious DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during the process of DNA replication [61-64]. During the process of cell division, DSBs can be efficiently repaired in normal cells by homologous recombination repair (HR). Tumors with HR deficiencies (HRD), such as ovarian cancers in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, cannot accurately repair the DNA damage, which may become lethal to cells as it accumulates [64-66]. In addition, PARP is involved in repairing DSB through the alternative non-homologous end- joining ( NHEJ ) pathway, and PARP inhibitors could therefore further impair DSB repair in HR -deficient tumors[67-69]. In such tumor types, olaparib may offer a potentially efficacious and less toxic cancer treatment compared with currently available chemotherapy regimens. BRCA1 and BRCA2 defective tumors are intrinsically sensitive to PARP inhibitors, both in tumor models in vivo and in the clinic [70-72]. The mechanism of action for olaparib results from the trapping of inactive PARP onto the single-strand breaks preventing their repair [73, 74]. Persistence of SSBs during DNA replication results in their conversion into the more serious DNA DSBs that would normally be repaired by HR repair. Olaparib has been shown to inhibit selected tumor cell lines in vitro and in xenograft and primary explant models as well as in genetic BRCA knock -out models, either as a stand -alone treatment or in combination with established chemotherapies. In addition, PARP inhibitors have been shown across multiple preclinical tumor models to potentiate the antitumor effects of DNA damaging cytotoxic agents (e.g. alkylating agents, platinum chemotherapy) as well as radiation [72, 75- 78]. Importantly, many of these studies have shown that the observed anti- tumor effects are not restricted to cell lines with loss of HR pat hway genes. 1.3.1 Pre-clinical experience The pre- clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the olaparib Investigator’s Brochure (IB). A range of tumor cell lines have been investigated using colony formation assays for sensitivity to P ARP inhibition with olaparib as a single agent. IC50 data were calculated for each cell line across KU95, a mixed tumor type panel of 95 cancer cell lines that also contained ovarian cancer cell lines (Figure 8).

The panel was also profiled for relative protein and messenger ribonucleic acid gene expression levels of key DNA damage response (DDR) and HRR associated genes such as BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM , ATR, mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 and MRE11A . A cell line was classified as HRD when either relative gene or protein expression for 2 or more HRR target genes was less the half (50%, 0.5) relative to the mean expression. Cell lines with published literature confirming deleterious, homozygous loss-of-fun ction BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were also classed as HRD [79-82].

In both a BRCA1 -/- orthoto pic mouse mammary tumor model and a BRCA2 - /- orthotopic mouse model, dosing with 50 mg/kg olaparib once daily (od) for 28-days showed significant anti -tumor efficacy for single agent olaparib [71, 72]. An anal ysis of the correlation of olaparib response with several standard -of-care chemotherapies in a panel of breast cancer cell lines demonstrated a strong correlation with both carboplatin (0.84, p=0.0006) and camptothecin (0.8, p=0.0018). This is consistent w ith what is known about the types of DNA damage they induce (intra- strand and inter -strand cross-links for platinum and trapped topoisomerases-DNA adducts for camptothecins, both of which result in DNA DSB formation in replicating cells) and the DDR pathways that deal with them (primarily HRR in cells undergoing DNA replication). The same does not hold for a mechanistically unrelated chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel ( -0.11) whose mechanism of action is unrelated to the induction of DNA damage.

Moreover, other PARP inhibitors have also been shown to be effective with a number of non- classical alkylating agents including MMS, DTIC and TMZ. However, for the “classic” alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide and N, N’-bis(2- chloroethyl) -N-nitrosourea (BCNU; carmustine) only some early literature reports are available on showing potentiation but, to date, no data have been generated for olaparib with such agents. Similarly, the effectiveness of olapar ib with topoisomerase I inhibitors ( i.e., camptothecin family) and platinum agents ( e.g., cisplatin and carboplatin) has been shown in both in vitro and in vivo studies. 1.3.2 Toxicology and safety pharmacology summary The toxicology and safety pharmacology is fully described in the current version of the olaparib Investigator’s Brochure (IB). In repeat dose oral toxicity studies of up to 6 months duration in rats and dogs, the principal target organ for toxicity was the bone marrow, with associated changes i n peripheral hematology parameters, which may be related to the primary pharmacology of olaparib. All changes showed full or partial recovery following withdrawal of olaparib. Olaparib was not mutagenic in an Ames bacterial mutation test, but was clastogenic in a CHO chromosome aberration test in vitro. When dosed orally, olaparib also induced micronuclei in bone marrow of rats. These findings are consistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary pharmacology of olaparib. In reproductive toxicology studies in rats, oral dosing of olaparib prior to mating produced no adverse effects on male fertility. In female rats, although conception rates were unaffected by pre- and peri-conception dosing, embryofetal survival was decreased. Administration of olaparib during organogenesis had an adverse effect on embryofetal survival and also increased major fetal malformations at dose levels that were not maternally toxic. The effects on embryofetal development are considered to be related to the primary ph armacology of olaparib. Exposures in the repeat dose and reproductive toxicology studies were below those achieved at the clinical therapeutic doses of 400 mg bd olaparib (capsule) and 300 mg bd (tablet). Combination studies in rats suggest potential for olaparib to exacerbate the effects of TMZ and topotecan, although combination of olaparib with these anti -cancer agents did not induce any additional target organ toxicities to those seen with single agent administration. Monotherapy Data from the development program indicate that olaparib is generally well tolerated at monotherapy doses up to 400 mg bd (capsule formulation) and 300 mg bd (tablet formulation) in patients with solid tumors. Administration of olaparib monotherapy has been associated with a dverse reactions generally of mild or moderate severity (CTCAE Grade 1 or 2) and generally not requiring treatment discontinuation. 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

The effects are generally transient but treatment delays are common and alternative administration schedules/toxicity management processes have been evaluated within some of these studies. When this type of toxicity has occurred it has been managed by routine clinical practice including dose delays, dose reductions, intermittent dosing and/or the use of supportive care measures, including G- CSF. 1.3.3 Clinical experience Clinical experience with olaparib is fully described in the current version of the olaparib Investigator’s Brochure. 1.3.3.1 Olaparib in mCRPC Failure to accurately repair DNA damage can lead to the accumulation of mutations, and an increased cancer risk [83, 84]. Not surprisingly, mutations in DNA repair genes have been associated with several cancer predisposition syndromes [85-87]. It has also been shown across a variety of malignancies that when DNA damage repair deficiency occurs – often as a result of homozygous loss of function mutations in BRCA 1/2 , ATM and other genes involved in homologous recombination – alternative DNA repair mechanisms are required to prevent genomic instability and c ell death. Poly (ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) has been shown to be a key mediator in this respect. As such, strategies to inhibit PARP activity have been shown to be effective in a number of cancers with impaired homologous recombination [70, 88-91] . In addition, more recent data has shown that PARP inhibition may be an effective strategy to augment the antitumor effects of other DNA damaging agents (e.g. alkylating and platinum chemotherapies) in cancers with intact DDR pathways [91, 92]. As part of our participation in the SU2C/AACR/PCF Prostate Cancer Dream Team, we have found that ~20% of CRPC patien ts harbor biallelic loss of a DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway gene [35]. In addition, more recent studies from our group have demonstrated that in men with metastatic prostate cancer , there is a high incidence (~12%) of deleterious alteration in DDR genes [87] . This data provides a strong rationale for a precision oncology approach to treating advanced prostate cancer with drugs that impair DDR (e.g. PARP inhibitors). Proof of concept for this approach i s derived from the TOPARP Trial [88]. This was a Phase II study testing olaparib 400 mg by mouth twice daily in men with metastatic CRPC. The primary endpoint was response rate, which was defined as either an objective radiographic response SHU5(&,67FULWHULDYD36$UHGXFWLRQRIIURPEDVHOLQH LH , PSA 50 response) or a FRQILUPHGUHGXFWLRQLQFLUFXODWLQJWXPRUFHOOV &7&V IURPFHOOVSHUP/RIEORRGWR  cells per 7.5 mL of blood. Fifty patie nts were enrolled, and all were post- docetaxel. Forty -nine patients received prior abiraterone or enzalutamide. Sixteen patients (33%) met the primary endpoint. Responses to olaparib were enriched in the subset of patients with homozygous deletions, delete rious mutations, or both in DDR genes (e.g. BRCA1/2 , ATM , Fanconi’s anemia genes, and CHEK2 ) (Figure 10). In this cohort, response rate was 88%. The observed safety profile of olaparib was consistent with that observed in other solid tumor trials.

E nrollment was allowed on the basis of a panel of genes involved in the HR repair pathway. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) in the group with BRCA1 , BRCA2 and/or ATM mutations (Cohort A). A second cohort consisted of patients with mutations in other HR repair -associated genes (Cohort B). Secondary endpoints were analyzed in a hierarchical fashion to control for trial -wide type 1 error associated with multiple testing, which occurred in the following order: objective response rate (Cohort A), PFS (combined Cohorts A and B), time to pain progression (Cohort A), and overall survival (Cohort A). The primary endpoint was met, with a PFS of 7.4 months vs. 3.6 months (P<0.001) in the olaparib vs. control groups for Cohort A. Secondary endpoints also favored the olaparib group, with an objective response rate in Cohort A of 33% vs. 2% in control group (P<0.001), median PFS of 5.8 months vs. 3.5 months for combined Cohorts A and B (P<0.001), median overall survival of 18.5 months vs. 15.1 months for Cohort A (P=0.02) and median overall survival of 17.5 months vs. 14.3 months for combined Cohorts A and B (P=0.0063). These results led the FDA to approve olaparib for mCRPC patients with somatic or germline alterations in ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D and/or RAD54L. Of note, PARP inhibitors have also been shown across multiple preclinical tumor models to potentiate the antitumor effects of DNA damaging cytotoxic agents (e.g. alkylating agents, platinum chemotherapy) as well as radiation [72, 75-78]. Importantly, t hese effects were not restricted to cell lines with biallelic loss of DNA damage pathway genes. Proof of concept for combining PARP inhibitors with DNA damaging agents is provided by the I-SPY 2 TRIAL. This study was a multi -center, randomized, Phase II “platform” trial testing multiple experimental regimens added to a control “backbone” regimen. Patients with high -risk primary breast cancer planning to undergo surgery were eligible to receive neoadjuvant therapy per protocol [89]. The control arm consisted of 12 weekly cycles of paclitaxel followed by 4 cycles, every 2-3 weeks of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide. One of the experimental arms combined the PARP inhibitor veliparib 50 mg by mouth twice daily and carboplatin AUC 6 concurrently with the weekly paclitaxel . The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate as assessed at the time of surgery. In the subset of patients with triple negative breast cancer (i.e. HER2 negative, ER/PR negative), the estimated rate of pCR was 51% (95% Bayesian probability interval [PI], 36 to 66%) in the veliparib- carboplatin arm compared to 26% (95% PI, 9 to 43%) in the control group. This translated to an 88% predicted probability of success in the Phase III setting. Importantly, t his study was not restricted to patients with loss of DNA repair pathway genes, however, it was noted that more patients in the veliparib -carboplatin arm (12/72, 17%) had de leterious mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 compared to control (2/44, 5%). Several other studies testing olaparib in combination with DNA damaging therapies are underway or have recently completed.

All patients had potential contributing factors for the development of MDS/AML, having received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents. Many had also received other DNA damaging treatments. The majority of reports were in germline BRCA mutation carriers and some of the patients had a history of previous cancer or of bone marrow dysplasia. If MDS and/or AML are confirmed while on treatment with olaparib, it is recommended that olaparib should be discontinued and the patient be treated appropriately. New Primary Malignancies other than MDS/AML New primary malignancies have been reported in <1% of patients. There were other contributing factors/potential alternative explanations for the development of the new primary malignancy in all cases, including documented BRCA mutation, treatment with radiotherapy and extensive previous chemotherapy including carboplatin, taxanes, anthracyclines and other alkylating and DNA damaging agents. Pneumonitis Pneumonitis has been reported in <1.0% patients treated with olaparib monotherapy in clinical studies. Reports of pneumonitis had no consistent clinical pattern and were confounded by a number of pre-disposing factors (cancer and/or metastases in lungs, underlying pulmonary disease, smoking history, and/or previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy). When olaparib was used in clinical studies in combination with other therapies there have been events with a fatal outcome. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough and fever, or a bnormal chest radiologic finding is observed, olaparib treatment should be interrupted and prompt investigation initiated. If pneumonitis is confirmed, olaparib treatment should be discontinued and the patient treated appropriately. 1.4 Research hypothesis We hypothesize, that co -treatment with BAT and olaparib will result in high response rates, and that these responses will be most pronounced in the subset of patient with DNA damage repair deficiencies. Because most patients experienc e improvements in quality of life following treatment with high -dose testosterone, we expect combination olaparib plus BAT to be safe and well tolerated. In addition, because the DNA damaging effects of BAT are restricted to prostate cancer cells with high AR expression, this combination should be synthetically lethal to tumor cells and result in minimal toxicity to normal tissues. 1.5 Rationale for conducting this study There is ample evidence to support testing BAT in combination with olaparib. Preclinical models have repeatedly shown that SPT is able to induce DNA damage, an effect that ca n be 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"
29,page_29,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Olaparib (AZD2281, KU-0059436); Testosterone Consortium Study Number 9984 Edition Number 1.6 Date February 24, 2021 30(93) augmented through inhibiting the ability of TOP2B to repair dsDNA breaks [6, 10, 11]. The antitumor effect of SPT also appears to be enhanced when combined with DNA damaging doses of radi ation [53]. Further supporting the importance of DNA damage as it relates to the clinical effects of SPT, is the observation that mutations in DNA damage repair genes (e.g. BRCA 1/2 , ATM ) may predict for response to BAT. Combining BAT with the PARP inhibitor olaparib is expected to result in enhanced clinical activity because PARP inhibitors have (i) been shown to impair DNA damage repair , and (ii) to potentiate the effects of other DNA damaging therapies (e.g. platinum chemotherapy and radiation) [75, 89] . Olaparib monotherapy has also shown preliminary signs of efficacy in heavily pretreated mCRPC patients with biallelic loss of DNA damage repair pathway genes [88]. Therefore, testing BAT in combination with olaparib is likely to be an effective clinical strategy. Both BAT and olaparib have already shown evidence of clinical efficacy in the Phase II setting. Therefore the primary objective of this stu dy will to evaluate efficacy . This will be determined by assessing PSA response rates after 12-weeks of combination therapy, as recommended by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) [95]. B ecause PARP inhibitors have been previously shown to potentiate the effects of other DNA damaging agents – independent of DNA damage repair gene mutation status – we expect olapa rib will also potenti ate the clinical effects of BAT, result ing in high response rates compared to historical controls. However, since both BAT and olaparib appear most effective in patients with biallelic loss of DNA damage repair genes, we anticipate that BAT plus olaparib combination therapy will also be most effective in this subset of patients. In order to explore the effects of BAT plus olaparib in men with DNA damage repair deficiency, we will require that 50% of the study cohort have biallelic loss of DNA damage repair genes previously reported to associate with response to olaparib in mCRPC patients [88]. 1.6 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment As stated above, BAT has been reported to have clinical activity in patients with mCRPC that is refractory to second-generation AR- signaling inhibitors (i.e. , enzalutamide), and is currently being tested in an ongoing randomized Phase II trial in men post- abiraterone [clinicaltrials.gov: NCT0228692] [11, 56] . Becau se BAT likely inhibits tumor growth in high AR prostate cancer cells by inducing dsDNA damage, we expect that combining it with olaparib to impair DNA damage repair will potentiate the clinical effects of BAT – improving response rates compared to BAT monotherapy . If effective, patients enrolled to this study would benefit by receiving an effective combination therapy that is otherwise unavailable. Only patients with mCRPC post- abiraterone and/or enzalutamide will be enrolled to this study. Because standard treatment options in this group only afford a modest survival benefit (Figure 2), any potential risks associated with clinical trial participation (as opposed to pursuing standard therapy) are justified. In contrast to chemotherapy, BAT carries minimal toxicity and is associated with improvements in quality (Figure 5B). Furthermore, because BAT -induced DNA damage is limited to cells with high AR expression , we anticipate that this combination will induce synthetic lethality in prostate cancer cells only – thus resulting in a favorable safety profile. 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES 4.1 Overall study design and flow chart This will be a single arm, Phase II study designed to evaluate the clinical activity of bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) plus olaparib in patients with asymptomatic metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (i.e. progressive prostate cancer in spite of serum testosterone <50 ng/dL) that has alread y progressed on abiraterone and/or enzalutamide (Figure 11) . While DNA damage repair (DDR) deficiency is not required to be eligible for the study, all patients must have next -generation sequencing performed at baseline to assess DDR status. The study will require that 50% of enrolled subjects have homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in one or more of the DDR genes listed in Appendix 5. The other 50% of patients must have an intact DDR pathway (i.e. no mutations/deletions in genes listed in Appendix 5). All patients will continue on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (i.e. surgical or medical castration), and should have a two-week washout from their most recent mCRPC therapy and weaned from steroids prior to enrollment. Eligible patients will initiate T enanthate or T cypionate 400 mg intramuscular every 28 days, which has been shown to result in rapid fluctuations between supraphysiologic and near castrate serum T levels in men maintained on ADT [11]. Patients will also receive olaparib 300 mg by mouth twice daily. One treatment cycle will be defined as 28 -days, and consist of 1 dose of T enanthate or T cypionate on Day 1 combined with continuous daily dosing of olaparib (Days 1-28). PSA will be measured on Day 1 of each treatment cycle prior to receiving T enanthate or T cypionate. Radiographic assessment with bone and CT scans will occur every 12- weeks. The primary endpoint will be PSA after 3 -cycles of BAT plus olaparib (i.e. 12- weeks). Patients will be permitted to continue until disease progression by radiographic (per RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 ) or clinical criteria (e.g. increasing pain), whichever comes first [95, 96]. Prior to completing 3 -cycles of treatment, patients should not discontinue treatment for PSA progression alone; however, if after 3- cycles the PSA has not decreased 50% from baseline (i.e. PSA 50 response) that patient may withdraw from the study if their treating physician feels it is in their best interest . It is also essential that PSA be measured before injection of Testosterone given that some patients may experience a transient increase in PSA immediately following T dosing. PSA values obtained at timepoints other than those required per protocol will be ignored and not used for the purpose of determining disease progression. Blood and tumor tissue for secondary analyses and correlative studies will be collected. Metastatic biopsies will be obtained at baseline , on Day 8 of Cycle 1 and again upon progression when possible. This tissue will be used for molecular studies and to measure intratumoral androgen levels.

STUDY ASSESSMENTS 6.1 Efficacy Efficacy will be determined by assessing PSA and radiographic changes (e.g. bone scan, CT scan) while on study . Ideally, these assessments will be performed at SCCA/UWMC, however, if necessary due to extenuating circumstances (e.g. insurance coverage issues) these may be performed at an outside lab/imaging center. 6.2 Safety The Principal Investigator (Michael Schweizer, MD) is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. 6.2.1 Definition of adverse events An adverse event is the development o f an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. An undesirable medical condition can be sympto ms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laboratory findings, electrocardiogram). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, i ncluding run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs. 6.2.2 Olaparib adverse events of special interest Adverse events of special interest [AESI] are events of scientific and medical interest specific to the further understanding of olaparib’s safety profile and require close monitoring and rapid communication by the investigators to AstraZeneca. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. Adverse Events of Special Interest for olaparib are the Important Potential Risks of MDS/AML, new primary malignancy (other than MDS/AML) and pneumonitis. ANY event of MDS/AML, new primary malignancy, or pneumonitis should be reported to AstraZeneca Patient Safety whether it is consider ed a non-serious AE [eg non- melanoma skin cancer] or SAE, and regardless of investigator’s assessment of causality or knowledge of the treatment arm. A questionnaire will be sent to any investigator reporting an AESI, as an aid to provide further detailed information on the event. During the study there may be other events identified as AESIs that require the use of a questionnaire to help characterise the event and gain a better understanding regarding the relationship between the event and study treat ment. 6.2.3 Assessment of severity Assessment of severity is one of the responsibilities of the sub -investigators and Principal Investigator in the evaluation of AEs and SAEs. Severity will be graded according to the NCI 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

The determination of severity for all other events not listed in the CTCAE should be made by the treating physician (i.e. Sub-Investigator, Principal Investigator ) based upon medical judgment and the severity categories of Grade 1 to 5 as defined below. Grade 1 (mild) An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with u sual activities of daily living. Grade 2 (moderate) An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. Grade 3 (severe) An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the subject. Grade 4 (life threatening) An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with an imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that affect or limit the ability of the subject to perform activities of daily living (i.e., eating, ambulation, toilet ing, etc). Grade 5 (fatal) Death (loss of life) as a result of an event. 6.2.4 Definitions of serious adverse event A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., screening, run-in, treatment, wash -out, follow -up), at any dose of the study drugs that fulfil ls one or more of the following criteria: x Results in death x Is immediately life -threatening x Requires in- patient hospitali zation or prolongation of existing hospitalization x Results in persistent or significant disab ility or incapacity x Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect x Is an important medical event that may jeopardi ze the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be assessed by the investigator(s) in consultation with the Principal Investigator and communicated to AstraZeneca. 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

If no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Important Medical Event’ criterion should be used. In certain situations, however, medical judgement on an individual event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant tumor event should be assess ed and reported as a Non- Serious AE. For example, if the tumor is included as medical history and progression occurs during the study, but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the malignant tumor, the AE may not fulfill the attribu tes for being assessed as Serious, although reporting of the progression of the malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, some types of malignant tumors, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that does not require hospitalization, may be assessed as Non -Serious; examples include Stage 1 basal cell carcinoma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer removed via cone biopsy. The above instruction applies only when the malignant tumor event in question is a new malignant tumor (i.e., it is not the tumor for which entry into the study is a criterion and that is being treated by the IP under study and is not the development of new or progression of existing metastasis to the tumor under study). Malignant tumors that – as part of n ormal, if rare, progression – undergo transformation (e.g., Richter's transformation of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia into diffuse large B cell lymphoma) should not be considered a new malignant tumor. 6.2.5 Assessment of relationship All AEs will be evaluated for relationship to the medical treatment or procedure. The treating physician (i.e. , Sub-Investigator, Principal Investigator) should document his/her opinion of the relationship of the event to study medication as follows: x Unrelated - The adverse eve nt is clearly not related to the investigational agent(s). x Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s). x Possible -The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s). x Probable -The adverse event is most like ly related to the investigational agent(s). x Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s). 6.2.6 Early stopping due to adverse events This study will stop early if >3 subjects experience a SAE determined to be at least possibly related to the study drugs, with the following exceptions: x +RVSLWDOL]DWLRQODVWLQJKRXUV x Non-life threatening hematologic toxicities (e.g. febrile neutropenia without evidence of septic shock , anemia) 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

Adverse events will be assessed by the treating physician (i.e., Sub-Investigator, Principal Investigator) for severity, relationship to the investigational product, and possible etiologies. Adverse event assessments will then be verified by the Principal Investigator who will also determine whether the event meets criteria of an SAE and therefore requires immediate notification to AstraZeneca . The following variables will be collected for each AE: x AE (verbatim) x The date when the AE started and stopped x Changes in NCI CTCAE grade and the maximum CTCAE grade attained x Whether the AE is serious or not x Causality rating against olaparib (yes or no) x Action taken with regard to olaparib x Causality rating against testosterone (yes or no) x Action taken with regard to testosterone x Outcome In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs as applicable: x Date AE met criteria f or serious AE x Date treating physician (i.e. Sub-Investigator, Principal Investigator ) became aware of serious AE x Reason AE is considered serious x Date of hospitalization x Date of discharge x Probable cause of death x Date of death x Autopsy performed x Description of AE x Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study.

Every effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all events, even if the events continue after discontinuation/study completion. If a subject dis continues from treatment for reasons other than disease progression, and therefore continues to have tumor assessments, drug or procedure- related SAEs must be captured until the patient is considered to have confirmed PD and will have no further tumor assessments. The treating physician (i.e. Sub-Investigator, Principal Investigator) is responsible for following all SAEs until resolution, until the subject returns to baseline status, or until the condition has stabilized with the expectation that it will remain chronic, even if this extends beyond study participation. 6.2.7.1 Adverse events after the 30 day follow up period For Pharmacovigilance purposes and characterization , any case of MDS/AML or new primary malignancy occurring after the 30 day follow up period should be reported to AstraZeneca Patient Safety whether it is considered a non -serious AE [e.g., non-melanoma skin cancer] or SAE, and regardless of investigator’s assessment of causality or knowledge of the treatment arm. Investigators will be asked duri ng the regular follow up for overall survival if the patient has developed MDS/AML or a new primary malignancy and prompted to report any such cases. At any time after a patient has completed the study, if an Investigator learns of any SAE including sudden death of unknown cause, and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the event is causally related to the investigational product, the investigator should notify AstraZeneca, Patient Safety. If patients who are gaining clinical benefit are allowed to continue study treatment post data cut off and/or post study completion then all SAEs must continue to be collected and reported to Patient Safety within the usual timeframe. Otherwise, after study treatment completion (i.e. , after any schedul ed post treatment follow -up period has ended) there is no obligation to actively report information on new AEs or SAEs occurring in former study patients. This includes new AEs/SAEs in patients still being followed up for survival but who have completed the post treatment follow up period (30 days). Follow -up of unresolved adverse events Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last visit in the study are followed up by the treating physician (i.e. Sub-Investigator, Principal Investigator ) for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. After 90 days, on ly subjects with ongoing investigational product- related SAEs will continue to be followed for safety. 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Sect ion 6.2.4. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disa bility may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE. Adverse Events based on signs and symptoms When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. Adverse Events based on examinations and tests Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandate d laboratory values, vital signs should only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product. If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e .g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. Note: Cases where a subject shows an AST or $/7[8/1 or WRWDOELOLUXELQ[8/1PD\ need to be reported as SAEs, please refer to Appendix 1 ‘Actions required in cases of combined increase of Aminotransferase and Total Bilirubin – Hy’s Law’, for further instructions. Disease progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of new metastasis or progression of existing metastasis should be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study. 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

New primary malignancies are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after the inclusion of the patient into the study. They do not include metastases of the original cancer. Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are considered to be disease progression. Lack of efficacy When there is deterioration in the patient ’s clinical condition, there may be uncertainty as t o whether this is lack of efficacy or an AE. In such cases, unless the Sponsor or the reporting physician considers that the study treatment contributed to the deterioration of the condition, or local regulations state to the contrary, the deterioration s hould be considered to be a lack of efficacy and not an AE. Deaths All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol-defined 30-day post-study follow- up period after the administration of the last dose of study treatment, must be reported as follows: x Death clearly the result of disease progression should be reported to the study monitor at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the eCRF but should not be reported as an SAE. x Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease under study, the AE causing the death must be reported to the study monitor as a SAE within 24 hours (see Section 6.2.7 for further details). The report should contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of progression of disease, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death. This information can be captured in the ‘death eCRF’. x Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE. A post mortem maybe helpful in the assessment of the cause of dea th, and if performed a copy of the post- mortem results should be forwarded to AstraZeneca within the usual timeframes. 6.2.8 Reporting of serious adverse events Investigators and othe r site personnel must report to AstraZeneca, any serious or unexpected adverse events that occur.

All SAEs have to be reported to AstraZeneca, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product. All SAEs will be documented. The investigator is responsible for informing the IRB and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local requirements. Non-serious adverse event s and SAEs will be collected from the time consent is given, throughout the treatment period and up to and including the 30 day follow-up period. After withdrawal from treatment, subjects must be followed -up for all existing and new AEs for 30 calendar da ys after the last dose of trial drug and/or until event resolution. All new AEs occurring during that period must be recorded (if SAEs, then t hey must be reported to AstraZeneca). All study -related toxicities/ SAEs must be followed until resolution, unle ss in the Investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying disease. 6.2.9 Laboratory safety assessment Full hematology assessments for safety (hemoglobin, red blood cells [RBC], platelets, mean cell volume [MCV], mean cell hemoglobin concentration [MCHC], mean cell hemoglobin [MCH], white blood cells [WBC], absolute differential white cell count (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils) and absolute neutrophil count or segmented neutrophil count and Band forms should be performed at each visit and when clinically indicated.

Given our rapidly evolving understanding of prostate cancer pathobiology and genetics, it is impossible to prospectively define all the relevant biomarkers for the patient population enrolled on this study. All samples will be collected at the timep oints indicated in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 of the protocol. Details regarding the collection, processing, shipping and storage of samples for exploratory research will be described in the Laboratory Manual. Examples of the studies to be conducted may include, but will not be limited to those described below. Additional studies aimed at understanding response and resistance to the study drugs may be added as new information becomes available. 6.3.1 DNA Damage Repair Gene Status All patients will undergo targeted next -generation sequencing in order to evaluate for the prese nce of a DDR gene alteration at baseline. This will be accomplished using the UW- OncoPlex platform, which has been validated for use with tumor tissue derived DNA and cell - free tumor DNA (ctDNA) [97]. The preferred sample for sequencing is one taken following the completion of the most recent prior line of therapy. Samples taken at this time reflect the current D DR status of the tumor and are considered clinically most relevant. A fresh metastatic biopsy is therefore preferred for UW -OncoPlex testing. If patient refuses metastatic biopsy or it is felt that this cannot be conducted safely, the most recent tissue sa mple may be used, RULIDSDWLHQWKDVD36$QJP/ , a plasma sample may be used for ctDNA 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

Optional biopsies will be requested at timepoints indicated in S ections 5.2 and 5.3. Note: If prior to enrolling, a patient has already had their tumor sequenced using a clinical grade next- generation sequencing assays (e.g. FoundationOne, Caris, etc), these results may be used for determining baseline DDR gene mutational status. Tumor tissue should still be obtained as outlined above to confirm DDR status using UW -OncoPlex, however. 6.3.2 Protein expression studies Protein expression studies will be conducted on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and/or tumor tissue using immunofluorescence (IF) an d immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Expression of full-length AR (AR- FL), AR splice variants (AR -Vs), Ȗ-H2AX as well as potentially other proteins will be assessed. IHC will be will be performed using commercially available antibodies and standard lab techniques. CTCs for protein studies will be isolated using the RareCyte platform, which involves density- based enrichment followed IF staining and digital microscopy[98]. 6.3.3 Transcript profiling studies Transcript profiling studies will be conducted on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and/or tumor tissue. Transcript profiling on tumor tissue will be performed using RNA-seq, qRT-PCR or other gene expr ession profiling methods as appropriate (e.g. NanoString) , and will follow standard lab techniques . AdnaTest will be used to isolate CTCs for transcript expression studies [45]. AdnaTest isolates CTCs using antibody coated magnetic beads, which are designed to select populations of prostate cancer cells, and is suitable for transcript profiling studies. Blood samples will be processed using AdnaTest and used for multiplexed qRT-PCR studies. 6.3.4 Tissue and Serum Androgen Levels Tissue and serum androgens (e.g. T and DHT) and hormonal substrates (e.g. DHEA- S) will be determined in serum and metastatic biopsy specimens using liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry (LC/MS) according to previously described methods[99-102]. 6.4 Patient reported outcomes (PRO) The FACT-P and IIEF q uality of life questionnaires will be administered periodically throughout the duration of the study (Appendix 4). Patients will be provided with blank questionnaires and encouraged to complete these at home prior to scheduled clinic visits as outlined in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 .

Each dosing container will contain sufficient medication for at least 28 days plus overage. Olaparib will be dispensed to patients on Day 1 and every 28 days thereafter until the patient completes the study, withdraws from the study or closure of the study. Study treatment is available as tablet s containing 50mg of olaparib . Patients will be administered olaparib twice daily at 300 mgs bid continually. 300 mg olaparib should be taken at the same time each day, approximately 12 hours apart with one glass of water. The olaparib tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, dissolved or divided.

Should any patient enrolled on the study miss a scheduled dose for whatever reason (e.g., as a result of forgetting to take the tablets or vomiting), the patient will be allowed to take the scheduled dose up to a maximum of 2 hours after that scheduled dose time. If greater than 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, the missed dose is not to be taken and the patient should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time. Dose Reductions For guidance on dose reductions for management of AEs refer to Section 8.2.6.

A dose reduction is recommended for patients who develop moderate renal impairment (calculated creatinine clearance by Cockcroft -Gault equation or based on a 24 hour urine test of between 31 and 50 ml/min) for any reason during the course of the study: the dose of olaparib should be reduced to 200mg BD. Because the CrCl determination is only an estimate of renal function, in instances where the CrCl falls to between 31 and 50 mL/min, the investigator should use his or her discretion in determining whether a dose change or discontinuation of therapy is warranted. Olaparib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine cleara nce  30 ml/min) or end- stage renal disease; if patients develop severe impairment or end stage disease it is recommended that olaparib be discontinued. 8.2.3 Testosterone Testosterone esters are less polar than free testosterone. Testosterone esters in oil injected intramuscularly are absorbed slowly from the lipid phase; thus, testosterone enanthate or testosterone cypionate can be given at intervals of two to four weeks. These two forms of testosterone exhibit identical pharmacokinetic properties and may be used interchangeably in this study based on availability at the pharmacy [54] . These agents are administered as intramuscular injections given deep in the gluteal muscle. They should not be given intravenously. Testosterone cypionate is in cottonseed oil with benzyl alcohol as a preservative.

General ly, the amount of this sex -hormone binding globulin in the plasma will determine the distribution of testosterone between free and bound forms, and the free testosterone concentration will determine its half -life. About 90 percent of a dose of testostero ne is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites; about 6 percent of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver. Testosterone is metabolized to various 17 -keto steroids through two different pathways. The half -life of testosterone enanthate is approximately 4.5 to 8 days, and has been shown to consistently result in supraphysiologic serum T levels following an intramusc ular dose of PJ (Figure 12) [54].

Androgens may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Dosage of the anticoagulant may require reduction in order to maintain satisfactory therapeutic hypoprothrombinemia. 2. Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone. 3. In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and, therefore, insulin requirements. Drug/Laboratory test interferences Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased t otal T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions in the male have occurred with some androgens: 1. Endocrine and urogenital: Gynecomastia and excessive frequency and duration of penile erections. Oligospermia may occur at high dosages. 2. Skin and appendages: Hirsutism, male pattern of baldness, seborrhea, and acne. 3. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Retention of sodium, chloride, water, potassium, calcium, and inorganic phosphates. 4. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, cholestatic jaundice, alterations in liver function tests, rarely hepatocellular neoplasms and peliosis hepatis. 5. Hematol ogic: Suppression of clotting factors II, V, VII, and X, bleeding in patients on concomitant anticoagulant therapy, and polycythemia. 6.

No routine prophylactic anti- emetic treatment is required at the start of study treatment, however, patients should receive appropriate anti- emetic treatment at the first onset of nausea or vomiting and as required thereafter, in accordance with local treatment practice guidelines. Alternatively, olaparib tablets can be taken with a light meal/snack (eg , 2 pieces of toast or a couple of biscuits). 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

If a patient cannot restart study treat ment within 4 weeks for resolution of intercurrent conditions not related to disease progression or toxicity, the case should be discussed with the primary investigator (Dr. Michael Schweizer) . All dose reductions and interruptions (including any missed doses), and the reasons for the reductions/interruptions are to be recorded in the eCRF. Study treatment should be stopped at least 3 days prior to planned surgery. After surgery study treatment can be restarted when the wound has healed. No stoppage of study treatment is required for any needle biopsy procedure. Study treatment should be discontinued for a minimum of 3 days before a patient undergoes radiation treatment. Study treatment should be restarted within 4 weeks as long as any bone marrow toxicity has recovered. Because the AEs related to olaparib may include asthenia, fatigue and dizziness, patients should be advised to use caution while driving or using machinery if these symptoms occur.

Live virus and live bacterial vaccines should not be administered whilst the patient is receiving study medication and during the 30 day follow up period. An increased risk of infection by the administration of live virus and bacterial vaccines has been observed with conventional chemotherapy drugs and the effects with olaparib are unknown. Rest ricted concomitant medications Strong or Moderate CYP3A inhibitors Known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, boosted protease inhibitors, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil) should not be taken with olaparib. If there is no suitable alternative concomitant medication then the dose of olaparib should be reduced for the period of concomitant administrati on. The dose reduction of olaparib should be recorded in the eCRF with the reason documented as concomitant CYP3A inhibitor use. • Strong CYP3A inhibitors – reduce the dose of olaparib to 100mg bd for the duration of concomitant therapy with the strong inhi bitor and for 5 half lives afterwards. • Moderate CYP3A inhibitors - reduce the dose of olaparib to 150mg bd for the duration of concomitant therapy with the moderate inhibitor and for 3 half lives afterwards. • After the washout of the inhibitor is complete, the olaparib dose can be re -escalated. Strong or Moderate CYP3A inducers Strong (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine, enzalutamide and St John’s Wort) and moderate CYP3A inducers (eg. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil ) of CYP3A should not be taken with olaparib. If the use of any strong or moderate CYP3A inducers are considered necessary for the patient’s safety and welfare this could diminish the clinical efficacy of olaparib. If a patient requires use of a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer or inhibitor then they must be monitored carefully for any change in efficacy of olaparib. P-gp inhibitors It is possible that co -administration of P -gp inhibitors ( eg amiodarone, azithromycin ) may increase exposure t o olaparib.

These changes may only be made b y the Principal Investigator (i.e., Michael Schweizer , MD ). 10. STUDY MANAGEMENT 10.1 Training of study site personnel Prior to opening this study for accrual, each participating site will be required to have a Site Initiation Visit (SIV). The SIV will involve a pr esentation by the Principal Investigator to review the protocol in detail. The SIV should be attended (in person or virtually) by the Principal Investigator , study coordinator, investigational drug services representative and any other sub- investigators. I f any of the aforementioned personnel are unable to attend the SIV, the participating site will be responsible for distributing the protocol and SIV presentation for review. Training should be documented on delegation logs at each participating site. 10.2 Monitoring of the study Trial monitoring will be in accordance with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC)/University of Washington Cancer Consortium Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. Under the provisions of this plan, FHCRC Clinic al Research Support coordinates data and compliance monitoring conducted by consultants, contract research organizations, or FHCRC employees unaffiliated with the conduct of the study. Independent monitoring visits occur at specified intervals determined by the assessed risk level of the study and the findings of previous visits per the institutional DSMP. In addition, protocols are reviewed at least annually and as needed by the Consortium Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), FHCRC Scientific Review Committee (SRC) and the FHCRC/University of Washington Cancer Consortium Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Additionally, scheduled meetings will take place weekly and will include the Principal Investigator (Michael Schweizer, MD), research nurse, data manager, and, when appropriate, the collaborators, sub- investi gators, and biostatistician involved with the conduct of the protocol. During these meetings the Sub -Investigators/ Principal Investigator will discuss matters related to: safety of protocol participants, validity and integrity of the data, enrollment rate relative to expectation, characteristics of participants, retention of participants, adherence to protocol (potential or real protocol violations), data completeness, and progress of data for secondary objectives. 10.2.1 Source data Source data will be maintaine d in study binders or electronically in secure servers as appropriate. Servers will be maintained at SCCA/UWMC and any hard copies of source data will be kept in a locked office or locked filling cabinets. 11. EVALUATION AND CALCULATION OF VARIABLES Prostate cancer has a tendency to metastasize to bone and lymph nodes and is often associated with non- measurable metastatic disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria, even in its later stages [96, 105]. To maximize patient eligibility, those with non -measurable disease at baseline (per RECIST 1.1) will be permitted to enroll. Because evaluating for objective radiographic response will not be possible in all patients enrolled , we wil l determine the effects of treatment on PSA .

Measurable vs. non- measurable lesions will be d efined as follows: x Measurable lesions - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter t20 mm using conventional techniques or t10 mm with spiral CT scan. x Non-measurable lesions - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <10 mm with spiral CT scan) and those that can truly not be measured (i.e., bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, lym phangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques). All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should within the 28 -day screening period. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Ideally iodinated contrast should be used, but if this is not possible (e.g. contrast allergy, renal insufficiency), then all subsequent scans should also forgo the use of contrast. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is required. Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” Lesions All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseli ne sum LD.

A similar review of laboratory, vital signs, ECG and other clinical data will be performed for identification of OAEs. Examples of these are marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain events that lead to intervention (other than those already classified as serious), dose reduction or significant additional treatment.

Examples of studies to be conducted may include, but are not limited to: evaluating for differences in response and disease progression in patients with/without mutations in genes involved in homologous recombination, studies to determine intratumoral androgen levels us ing LC/MS, assessing for evidence of dsDNA breaks, evaluating AR and AR-V expression at the protein and transcript levels, s equencing tumor DNA, and tumor transcript profiling studies.

IMPORTANT MEDICAL PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED BY THE INVESTIGATOR 13.1 Overdose There is currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose with olaparib and possible symptoms of overdose are not established. Olaparib must only be used in accordance with the dosing recommendations in this protocol. Any dose or frequency of dosing that exceeds the dosing r egimen specified in this protocol should be reported as an overdose. The Maximum Tolerated Dose is 300 mg bid (tablet). Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be treated symptomatically and should be managed appropriately. x An overdose with assoc iated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose CRF module. x An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose CRF module. If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day , i.e., immediately but no later than the end of the next business day of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designa ted AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site. For overdoses associated with SAE, standard reporting timelines apply, see Section 6.2.7 . For other overdoses, reporting should be done within 30 days. 13.1.1 Paternal exposure Male patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 3 months following the last dose. Pregnancy of the patient’s partners is not considered to be an adverse event. However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) should if possible be followed up and documented. The outcome of any conception occurring from the date of the first dose until 3 months after the last dose should be followed up and documented. 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. During the course of the stud y the treating physician (i.e. S ub-Investigator, lead/ Principal Investigator ) will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry. The Principal Investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. The Principal Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). The Principal Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.

For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e. on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur. Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases In order to identify cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination: 9984IRB Approved Document Release Date: 03/25/2021 Printed on 3/25/2021"

Subsequent to this contact the treating physician (i.e. sub- investigator, Principal Investigator ) will: o Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. o Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed with the Study Physician. o Complete the 3 Liver eCRF Modules as information becomes available. x If at any time (in consultation with the treating phsyician) the PHL case meets serious criteria, report it as an SAE using sta ndard reporting procedures Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met. No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the treating physician contacts the Principal Investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP.

Actions Required for Repeat Episodes of Potential Hy’s Law This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit. The requirement to conduct follow -up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence. The Principal Investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met and answer the following question: x Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met found to be the disease under study e.g. chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe infection or liver disease, or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior to starting study treatment and at their first on study treatment visit as described in Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and After Starting Study Treatment ?

Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of olaparib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childb earing potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly effective form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential (as listed below). Male patients should not donate sperm throughout the period of taking olaparib and for 3 months following the last dose of olaparib. Acceptable Non -hormonal birth control methods include: x Total/True abstinence: When the patient refrains from any form of sexual intercourse and this is in line with their usual and/or preferred lifestyle; this must continue for the total duration of the trial and for at least 3 months after the last dose of st udy drug . [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post- ovulation methods, or declaration of abstinence solely for the duration of a trial) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception] x Vasectomised sexual partner PLUS male condom.
