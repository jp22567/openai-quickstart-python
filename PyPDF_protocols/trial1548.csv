Introduction Cough is one of the most common presenting symptoms for patients seeking care from primary care specialists, allergists, otolary ngologists, or pulmonologists worldwide. The importance of cough as a clinical problem globally has led to multiple societies p ublishing guidelines on the diagnosis and management of cough [Morice, A. H., et al 2004] [Chung, K. F., et al 2006] [Morice, A. H., et al 2006] [The committee for The Japanese Respirato ry Society guidelines 2006] [Kardos, P., et al 2010] . In these clinical guidelines, cough is categorized based upon the duration of the cough; within each category (ie, acute, subacute , and chronic) are likely diagnostic possibilities [Irwin, R. S., et al 2006] . Acute cough is present for less than 3 weeks. Cough that has been present for longer than 3 weeks is considered either subacute (3 to 8 weeks) or chronic (>8 weeks). This protocol will evaluate acute cough. Acute cough is a common condition, most often due to an acute viral upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ). Viral URTIs can be diagnosed when patients present with an acute respiratory illness with accompan ying sy mptoms and signs related t o the nasal passages ( eg, rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat, sneezing, nasal obstruction, and postnasal drip), with or without fever, lacrimation, and irritation of the throat. In the absence of any treatment, the prevalence of acute cough due to a URTI ranges from 83% within the first 48 hours of the cold to 26% on Day 14 [Curley , F. J., et al 1988] . Cough due to a viral URTI is usuall y transient and self -limited. If cough is significantl y bothersome to the patie nt, sy mptomatic treatment is appropriate. Regrettably , there is a paucity of over -the-counter (OTC) treatments available that have established efficacy based on well -controlled clinical trials. In addition, many of these OTC agents ( eg, diphenhy dramine, dextromethorphan) have undesirable side effects. Codeine, a prescription narcotic, while widely used, has not been shown to be efficacious against acute cough due to a URTI in prospective, blinded, controlled trials [Freestone, C. 1997] . Therefore, a significant unmet need exists for an agent to demonstrate efficacy and a tolerable side effect profile in prospective, randomized, placebo- controlled clinical studies. Mechanism of Cough Each cough occurs through the stimulation of a complex reflex arc. Cough is initiated following activation of airway sensory nerves in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Airway sensory nerves are tailored to detect changes in the physical and chemica l environment, and ,if required , elicit protective reflex events such as cough. These reflexes are normally protective ;however ,in disease, airway reflexes can become hy persensitized , leading to an increase in sy mptoms and a pathologic cough. Adenosine t riphosphate ( ATP )is released b y damaged, stressed, and inflamed tissues. P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors are ligand -gated ion channels that respond to ATP and are almost exclusively localized on C -fiber sensory neurons, which innervate the upper and lower airways and are the main nerve fibers responsible for cough. The action of ATP at sensory neurons in the periphery and spinal cord contributes to neural excitability and may cause hypersensitivity through binding to P2X3 -containing receptors and stimulating of C- fiber neurons [North, R. A. 2004] [Khakh, B. S. 2006]. Antagonism of P2X3 -containing receptors is predicted to normalize afferent sensitivity , based on data from P2X3 knock -out mice and 04RPX4 059WF7"

A., et al 2000] [Souslova, V., et al 2000] . ATP and P2X3 -containing receptors have been shown to be involved in airways sensitiz ation and their involvement provides a rationale for P2X3 antagonism in the treatment of cough. The current trial will evaluate MK -7264 in acute cough. Study Rationale 3.1 The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MK-7264 on acute cough symptoms in healthy participants 18 through 55 years of age who are infected with human rhinovirus type 16 (HRV -16). Evaluation of efficacy will be based on objective cough counting and symptoms of viral URTI over 7 days. Additionally , this trial will perform a cough challenge to evaluate the antitussive effect of MK -7264. Current therapies for acute and subacute cough (ie, narcotic, non-narcotic, and OTC medications) have limited or unproven efficacy and an undesirable side effect profile. This trial aims to provide proof of concept for use of MK- 7264 in the treatment of acute cough; positive results in this trial will support continued study of MK-7264 for the treatment of acute cough. Background 3.2 Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB ) for detailed background information on MK- 7264 [IB Edition 16 2017] . Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 3.2.1 MK- 7264, a P2X3 receptor antagonist, has been evaluated in clinical studies for treatment of chronic cough, interstitial cy stitis/bladder pain s yndrome, osteoarthritis pain, and asthma. MK- 7264 has also been evaluated in an extensive nonclinical program. MK- 7264 is an oral medication provided as a film -coated tablet. The MK -7264 tablets provided for thi s trial contain 45 mg of MK -7264 . Based on results of an efficacy interim analysis (IA), a lower dose arm (15 mg of MK -7264) may be added to this study . The placebo tablet sprovided in this trial are indistinguishable from the MK -7264 high-and low - dose tablets in appearance , respectivel y. The placebo tablets contain no MK -7264, but contain the same inactive excipients as those included in the active tablets . Benefit/Risk Assessment 3.3 It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will direc tly benefit from treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information about the safet y and effectiveness of an investigational medicine. MK- 7264 has been evaluated in an extensive nonclinical program. To date, there is l ittle evidence from nonclinical studies that MK -7264 has an y direct cellular or direct target organ toxicity . 04RPX4 059WF7"

In those studies ,patients with chronic cough who took MK -7264 showed a reduction in awake cough frequency and improvement in patient -reported outcomes (PROs) [IB Edition 16 2017] . The current stud y (P013) will be the first study to evaluate MK-7264 in participants with acute cough; however, as noted in Section 3, based on the involvement of ATP and P2X3 -containing receptors in airway s sensitization, combined with the efficacy observed in the Phase 2 chronic cough studies, it is reasonable to expect that MK-7264 will also be effective in reducing acute cough. Additionall y, in the completed and ongoing clinical studies (Phase 1 and Phase 2) , no major safet y concerns have been noted. Taste - related a dverse experiences (eg, dysgeusia, ageusia, h ypogeusia) were the most frequentl y reported adverse events (AEs) in the clinical studies, with doses up to 1800 mg twice dail y (BID)for 14 day s. Subjects also described oral paresthesias (tingling sensation in the mouth and/or throat). I n man y instances, subjects reported oral paresthesia or hypoesthesia concurrent with taste alterations dy sgeusia/h ypogeusia/ageusia). Arationale for taste modification exists with P2X2/3 antagonism because of the putative participation of ATP, acting via this receptor, in transducing taste signa ls from taste buds cells to gustatory afferents. Attenuation of taste acuit y is considered more of a tolerability concern as opposed to a safet y concern, and is anticipated to be fully and rapidly reversible after discontinuation of the study treatment and amenable to monitoring in clinical studies. Overall, based on growing clinical evidence supporting efficacy and lack of significant safet y findings in completed and ongoing nonclinical and clinical studies (see IB for details , Section 3.2), the benefit-r isk balance of MK -7264 is assessed as positive. T he risks and side effects related to this trial are expected to be manageable. Because HRV - 16 causes the common cold, participants can expect to have a combination of one or more of the following s ymptoms after inoculation with the virus: runny nose, itch y nose, congested nose, sneezing, itch y eyes, headache, low -grade fever, sore throat, and/or cough. During the course of treatment, participants will be medicall y monitored 24 hours a day at a clinic. During the ATP cough challenge, β -agonist will be available if participants experience bronchoconstriction; if this ty pe of treatment is required, participants will not be exposed to further cough c hallenge son that day , but may participate in the cough challenge s on subsequent day s.Appropriate medical intervention will be provided throughout the trial, as needed. Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participants participati ng in this clinical study may be found in the accompanying IB and informed consent documents (Section 3.2) . 04RPX4 059WF7"

The total trial duration for each participant is approximately 50 day s, including a screening period of up to 28 day s, a 7 -day treatment period, 1 day for discharge from the clinic, and a 14 -day safet y follow -up period after the last dose of trial treat ment. An efficacy IA is planned for the trial after approximately 50 randomized participants complete (or discontinue earl y from) the treatment period (Day 1 to Day 7). Details of t he efficacy IA are described in Section 10.7.1. Screening Period The Screening Period (~ Day -28 to Day -2) should be only as long as it is needed to complete all screening activities. On Day -2, eligible participants will be admitted to the clinic. Participants will remain confined to the clinic until completion of the tr eatment period on Day 7. Between Day -2 (Visit 2) and Day -1 (Visit 3), participants will be under observation to ensure that they are healthy (ie, do not show any signs/s ymptoms of a community -acquired URTI or any other 04RPX4 059WF7"

During this t ime, safet y labs will be evaluated to ensure lab values do not meet criteria for exclusion and are not clinically significant. Treatment Period On Day 1 (Visit 4), participants who continue to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized according to the S ponsor’s computer -generated allocation schedule via an interactive voice response s ystem/integrated web response s ystem (IVRS/I WRS). During Stage 1 of the trial (ie, all enrollment prior to the efficacy IA), approximately 50 eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either MK -7264 45 mg BID or placebo. An efficacy IA will be performed when approximately 50 randomized participants in Stage 1 complete (or discontinue earl y from) the Treatment Period (Day 1 to Day 7). Enrollment ( ie, screening and randomization) will be paused once Stage 1 enrollment is complete, pending the results of the efficacy IA. In Stage 2 ( ie, all enrollment post -efficacy IA), if a decision is made to include a lower dose of MK -7264 based on the efficacy IA results, participants will be randomized to MK -7264 45 mg BID, MK- 7264 15 mg BID, or placebo in a ratio (1:2:1, respectivel y) that will provide approximately 50 participants per group at the end of the trial. If the MK- 7264 15 mg BID treatment group is not included in Stage 2, depending on the re - estimated sample size during the efficacy IA as described in Section 10.7 .1, a total of 100 to 188 participants (50 to 94 per treatment group for Stages 1 and 2 combin ed) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either MK -7264 45 mg BID or placebo. Specific procedures to be performed during the study , as well as their prescribed times and associated visit windows, are outlined in the Study SoA -Section 2. Details of each procedure are provided in Section 9 –Study Assessments and Procedures. This trial will use an adaptive design based on pre -specified criteria. There is one planned efficacy IA when approximately 50 randomized participan ts have completed (or discontinued early from) Stage 1 of the trial . The results of the efficacy IA will be reviewed and the decision regarding trial modifications will be made b y the standing internal Data Monitoring Committee (siDMC). The following actions are possible decisions from the siDMC, based on the results of the efficacy IA: The trial may be stopped for futility The sample size may be re -estimated Continue the trial as planned A lower dose of MK -7264 (15 mg BID) may be added Details are described in Section 10 .7.1.

Scientific Rationale for Study Design 5.4 Rationale for Study Design 5.4.1 Conducting studies that evaluate treatment in p articipants with naturall y occurring URTIs is challenging because it is difficult to identify and enroll pa rticipants during the earl y stage of the illness. URTI s are short -lived and self -limite d. In addition, with naturally occurring URTI s,it is not possible to know when infection begins or to determine with certaint y the duration of the illness at the time that the patient presents for enrollment [Gwaltney , J. M. Jr., et al 2003] . Due to these limitations, the induced rhinovirus URTI model will be used to evaluate MK -7264 in this trial. In thisrhinovirus infection model, the virus is inoculated into the nose of susceptible volunteers to produce an induced URTI. Therefore, the incubation period of the infection and the duration of illness are known. Comparisons between naturally occurring infections and induced infections have demonstrated that there may be differences in the severity of s ymptom s or ty pes of symptoms, but in general the illnesses associated with the two ty pes of infection were more similar than they were different; this may be due to selection bias of the natural cold patients [Rao, S. S. , et al 1995] . Overall, the induced rhinovirus model is still the preferred model for evaluating treatments for the common cold. This model has the advantage of replicating the actual pathology of an acute URTI caused b y rhinovirus and incorporates kn owledge of the timing and evolution of the URTI into the study design. Further, in this protocol, all participants will be required to demonstrate viral shedding within 72hours of inoculation of HRV -16in order to continue in the trial and be included in the analyses; thus, this model will provide a controlled environment for evaluation of URTI in participants with the same virus and with a similar duration of illness (infection). It is anticipated tha t approximately 15% to 20% of participants will not demonstrate viral shedding within the 72 hour timeframe ; these participants will be discontinued from study treatment anddischarged from the clinic (See Section 9.1.11) . The natural history of URTI , as w ell as the onset and duration of cough, have not been well described. Data published in 1988 by Curley et al suggests that 80% of patients infected with the common cold will develop cough [Curley , F. J., et al 198 8]. Consultation with cough experts and centers experienced with induced rhinovirus studies suggests that the proportion of patients infected with rhinovirus who develop cough is between 60% to 80%. Data published by Gwaltney et al in 2003 suggest that the me an total s ymptom severit y scores for participants with experimental rhinovirus colds peak 48 hours after viral inoculation [Gwaltney , J. M. Jr., et al 2003] .These sy mptoms are dramaticall y reduced by Day 5, and likely disappear around Day 7. These findings further support the use of the induced infection model (to ensure treatment and evaluation as earl y as possible in the course of the illness) and evaluation of participants over the course of 7 day s of treatm ent. 04RPX4 059WF7"
27,page_27,"Product: MK -7264 27 Protocol/Amendment No.: 013 -00 MK-7264 -013-00 Final Protocol 13-Oct-2017 ConfidentialRationale for Cough Challenge in a Subset of Participants 5.4.2 Inhalation cough challenges allow for quantification of cough and the assessment of antitussive effects of specific therapies. Cough challenges rel y on the delivery of tussive agents, such as capsaicin, citric acid, or ATP, as aerosols administered from jet or ultrasonic nebulizers. There are 2 main methods used for cough challenges: single -dose and dose-response. Single -dose inhalation challenges involve the administration of one concentration of the tussive agent. This method has been used for the screening of a large population of participants to detect those with reproducible cough. The second method is the dose - response cough challenge and involves the inhalation of incremental concentrations of tussive agent interspersed with inhalations containing placebo to increase challenge blindness. This trial will perform a modified dose -respo nse cough challenge; details will be provided in the Procedure sManua l. A large number of tussive agents have been tested in cough challenges, with capsaicin and citric acid demonstrating the best reproducibility . Recent studies have suggested a role for ATP -activated P2X3 receptors in the pathoph ysiology of chronic cough. In a small trial evaluating h ypersensitivity to ATP in chronic cough patients, chronic cough patients had increased sensitivity to ATP compared with healthy volunteers. There were no reports of bronchospasm in thattrial [Fowles, H. E. 2015] . In P013 , an ATP cough challenge will be conducted during Stage 1. All participants in Stage 1 will u ndergo the ATP cough challenge during the screening and treatment periods. I t is expected that ~ 5 to 10% of participants may not respond to cough challenge during the screening period. ATP has been selected as the tussive agent for the cough challenge based on the hy pothesis that patients infected with rhinovirus have increased sensitivity to ATP cough c hallenge. In summary , the ATP cough challenge is included in this trial as it may allow a better evaluation of the antitussive effect of MK -7264. Rationale for Endpoints 5.4.3 Efficacy Endpoints 5.4.3.1 The primary efficacy endpoint is awake cough sper hour (based on 2 4-hour sound recordings using an objective cough -counting device ) on Day 3 of the treat ment period (defined in Section 10.4.1). Cough counting will begin on Day 1 ( ie, after randomization, inoculation with the rhinovirus, and first dose of study treatment ) and continue over the course of 7 day s of treatment. Cough count will be measured using a digital recording device (VitaloJAK™ cough monitor, Vitalograph, Buckingham, United Kingdom) . Worn similar to a Holter monitor with a sensor affixed to the partic ipant ’s chest wall with adhesive and a microphone attached to the participant ’s clothing, the device provides high fidelit y recordings and facilitates signal processing to accuratel y identify and quantify cough. Digital recordin gs will be processed in Vitalograph’s centralized reading center, where recordings are condensed using a computer algorithm before human anal ysts identify and tag individual coughs. The output of this process is a count of coughs for each 24 -hour recording period, as well as cou gh counts for portions of the day when the participant is awake and when they are asleep. 04RPX4 059WF7"
28,page_28,"Product: MK -7264 28 Protocol/Amendment No.: 013-00 MK-7264-013-00 Final Protocol 13-Oct-2017 ConfidentialAs approximately 83% of participants with a URTI are expected to cough within the first 48hours of infection [Curley , F. J. , et al 1988] , the goal of the trial is to demonstrate that MK-7264 is effective in the treatment of acute cough, as evidenced b y a decreased frequency of awake cough son Day 3 in participants who are infected with rhinovirus. In unexplained or treatme nt refractory chronic cough, cough frequency is much higher during the day . This pattern is expected to be similar with acute c ough, but to assess concretely ;P013 will include 24-hour cough counts as an exploratory endpoint. An assessment of cough from t he participant’s perspective is also important for evaluating the response to a given therap y.PROs associated with cough can be measured in terms of cough frequency , intensity , and severit y; disruptions due to cough; and cough -specific quality of life. The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be measured as change from baseline on Day 3 of the treatment period in this trial: Cough Severit y visual analog scale (VAS ) Cough Severit y Diary (CSD ) Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ ) -acute The Cough Severity VAS is a single -item question naire asking the participant to rate the severit y of their cough “ today ” using a 100 mm VAS anchored with “ No Cough ” at 0 and “Extremely Severe Cough ” at 100. Similar to the well -established use of VAS in chronic pain, the Cough Severity VAS provides a quick and easily interpreted subjective assessment to monitor improvement of acute cough during treatment. The CSD is a 7- item, disease -specific PRO measure with a recall period of “today ”.The measure evaluates three domains: frequency of cough (3 items), intensit y of cough (2 items), and disruption due to cough (2 items); each item is rated on an 11 -point scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater severity. A CSD total score and 3 domain scores (ie, frequency , intensit y, disruption) can be calculated. The L CQ-acute is a 19- item health -related quality-of- life (HRQoL) questionnaire specific for acute cough which contains three domains ( ie, phy sical, psy chological, and social), calculated as a mean score for each domain ranging from 1 to 7 and total score ranging from 3 to 21. Each item on the L CQ-acute assesses symptoms or the impact of sy mptoms on HRQoL in the last 24 hours using a 7- point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL. The following exploratory efficacy endpoints will also be measured: 1. 24 -hour cough count (based on 24- hour sound recordings) on Day 3 2.Awake cough count on Day s 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 3.Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Syndrome Symptom Survey (WURSS - 24 )as change from baseline on Day 3 4.Cough reflex sensitivity (C2 and C5 on Day s 1, 4, and 7) measured b y standardized methodology incorporating an ATP cough challenge (Stage 1 onl y) 04RPX4 059WF7"

The WURSS -24 assesses symptoms or the impact of sy mptoms on HRQoL ‘over the last 24 hours ’using an 8 -point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 7. Higher scores indicate worse HRQoL. MK- 7264 has been shown to reduce cough reflex sensitivity , as measured by ATP cough challenges, in healthy participant s as well as participants with chronic cough [IB Edition 16 2017] . Stage 1 of P013 will evaluate whether similar effects also occur in participant s with acute cough. The secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints will add supportive information to the prim ary efficacy endpoint of awake coughs per hour on Day 3 of treatment . Safety Endpoints 5.4.3.2 In support of the safet y objective to evaluate the safet y and tolerability profile of MK -7264, the safet y and tolerability endpoints will be assessed by clinical evaluat ion of AEs and inspection of other trial parameters including vital signs, ph ysical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG ), and standard laboratory safet y tests at time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). Adverse events are graded and recorded according to Appendix 4 . Additional safet y monitoring may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 5.4.3.3 The pharmacokinetics (PK) of MK -7264 will be evaluated by measuring mean max imum observed concentration [Cmax], mean minimum observed concentration [Cmin,], time to reach Cmax[Tmax],and area under the concentration time -curve [AUC 0-] on Day s 1, 2, 4, and 7 in healthy adult participants infected with rhinovirus. Blood samples will be collected on Day s 1, 2, 4, and 7, as outlined in Section 9.6.1 .The relationship between MK -7264 plasma concentrations and cough frequencies/side effects will be explored. Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research 5.4.3.4 Planned Genetic Analysis 5.4.3.4.1 Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to therap y, susceptibility to, and severit y and progression of disease. Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology ; and/or molecular subty pe of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a sample will be collected for DNA anal ysis from consentin g participants.

Rationale for the Use of Placebo 5.4.4 The pl acebo arm is included in this trial to maintain the study blinding, allowing for an unbiased assessment of efficacy and safet y. Additionally , in the event that a lower MK -7264 dose group is added to the trial in Stage 2 (after the efficacy IA), the placebo arm will help ascertain whether the twoactive doses are equally effective or equally ineffective. No rescue medication will be permitted in the trial. Participants will be medically monitored during the trial and provided appropriate tr eatment, if warranted. Participants may discontinue the trial at an y time if they find the treatment intolerable or for any other reason . Justification for Dose 5.5 Rationale for Dose Interval and Study Design 5.5.1 In this trial, MK -7264 45 mg (and potentially MK -7264 15 mg if an additional treatment arm is added in Stage 2) will be orall y administered in tablet form BID based on the safet y and PKefficacy results observed to date. Based on PKstudies conducted to date, MK -7264 is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmaxof 1 to 2 hours and a half -life of approximately 7 to 10 hours ,and is consistent with a BID dosing schedule. In the clinical development program, oral doses of MK -7264 up to 1800 mg BID for 14 day s were evaluated in Phase 1 studies and oral doses of up to 600 mg BID have been evaluated in Phase 2 studies. Overall, MK -7264 has been generally safe and well tolerated. Across studies, taste -related AEs (eg, dysgeusia, ageusia, hy pogeusia) and tingling sensation in the mouth and/or throat were the most frequentl y reported events. These AEs have been reversible and are amenable to monitoring. In participants with chronic cough, improved tolerability (relative to higher doses of MK- 7264) and efficacy have been observed at doses of MK -7264 ≤50 mg BID. Dos es from 7.5mg to 200 mg BID were studied in participants with chronic cough (in P010 Cohort 1) 04RPX4 059WF7"

The mechanism of action of MK -7264 and related clinical study results demonstrate that the efficacy of MK -7264 in decreasing cough, and the prevalence of the most common AE, dysgeusia, are both dose -related. In order to provide patients and prescribers theflexibility to balance efficacy and tolerability based on individual clinical situations, the MK -7264 development program has targeted twodoses (15 mg BID and 45 mg BID) to study . The 45 mg BID dose has been selected for Stage 1 of this trial to evaluate whether this dose will effectivel y reduce acute cough with a side effect profile that is tolerable to patients. During Stage 2 of the trial (after the efficacy IA), a third treatment group with a lower dose of MK -7264 (15 mg BID) may be added, based on the results of the IAand PK modeling, taking both efficacy and safet y/tolerability into consideration. For additional details on MK -7264, refer to the IB (Section 3.2) . 6.Study Population Health y male and female participants between the ages of 18 and 55years(inclusive) will be enrolled in this study .

Study treatment will begin in the morning (before 1 1amapproximately ) on the day of treatment randomization (Day 1). After randomization, the study participant will first have the VitaloJAK ™attached. The participant will then be inoculated with HRV -16 and then administered the first dose of study treatment. The VitaloJAK will then be immediately turned “ on”after the first dose is administered. As dosing is BID, the next dose of study treatment on Day 1 should be taken orally in the evening, approximately 12 hours after the morning dose. Subsequent dosing through Day 7 will be performed in the same manner . In Stage 1, all participant s will be administered 1 tablet of study treatment BID (total daily dose: 2 tablets). In Stage 2, if there are 2 treatment arms, all participant s will be administered 1 tablet BID (total daily dose: 2 tablets). If there are 3 treatment arms (in order to maintain the blinding of the 2 different MK -7264 dose images) ,all participant s will be administered 2 tablets of study treatment BID (totally daily dose: 4 tablets).

Efficacy Assessments 9.2 Compliance with the efficacy and safety assessments (along with study treatment use) is essential, and an y non -compliance noted b y the investigator or designee should result in consultation with the participant on corrective measures needed to ensure compliance. Cough Monitoring –VitaloJAK ™Recording Device 9.2.1 The assessment of awake coughs per hour (based on 24 -hour sound recordings) will be evaluated using the VitaloJAK™ cough monitor, a 510k approved (Premarket Notification per the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act) that has been implemented successfull y in clinical studies of potential cough therapies, including two Phase 2studies of MK -7264. The VitaloJAK™ cough monitor recording device uses two input channels. The first channel records sounds from the lungs and trachea through a chest contact sensor, which is attached to the skin at the top of the sternum with adhesive . The second channel captures ambient sounds through a lapel air microphone. Sounds are stored on a high -capacity compact flash (CF)II card. The device will be carried in a cloth belt bag worn around the participant ’s waist, and it will record all sounds the participant makes during cough monitoring. When the digital recording arrives at the central reading center, a human analyst uses standardized criteria to id entify transitions between awake and asleep states.

It is calculated as: Awake coughs per hour = Total number of cough events during the monitoring period (24- hour interval) the participant is awake / Total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period the participant is awake Awake is time between waking up and sleep during the 24 -hour monitoring period. Analysis P opulations 10.5 Efficacy Analysis Populations 10.5.1 The modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS )population will serve as the primary population for the anal ysis of efficacy data in this study . The mFAS population consists of all randomized participants who receive at least one dose of stud y treatment and have confirmation of viral shedding within 72 hours of administration of HRV -16. The Per Protocol (PP) population excludes participant s due to major deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the results of the primary efficacy endpoint. Potential deviations that may result in the exclusion of a participant from the PP population will be specified in the sSAP. The final determin ation on major protocol deviations, and thereb y the composition of the PP population, will be made prior to the final unblinding of the database and will be documented in a separate memo. A supportive anal ysis using the PP population may be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint if the proportion of the participants with major protocol deviations is >10%. Participant s will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized for the analysis of efficacy data using both the mFAS and PP popul ations.

The APaT population consists of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of stud y treatment. Participant s will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment they actually received for the anal ysis of safet y data using the APaT population. At least one laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained subsequent to at least one dose of study treatment is required for inclusion in the analy sis of each specific parameter. To assess change from baseline , a baseline measurement is also required. Details on the approach to handling missing data for safet y anal yses are provided in Section 10.6. 04RPX4 059WF7"

The primary efficacy endpoint for the study is the awake cough sper hour on Day 3 of treatment. It will be analyzed using a longitudinal data anal ysis (LDA )model. In this model, the response vector consists of daily awake cough sper hour at each post -baseline visit;and covariates will include treatment, visit, the interaction of treatment by visit, gender , and site. The unstructured approach will be used to model the covariance of the repeated cough measurements over time within participant s.

Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses 10.6.2 Safety and tolerability will be assessed b y clinical review of all relevant parameters including AEs, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG measurements. The anal ysis of safet y results will follow a tiered approach ( Table 7). The tiers differ with respect to the anal yses that will be performed.

Purpose Merck, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in compliance with the high est ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant safety is the overriding concern in the design of clinical trials. In all cases, Merck clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national regulations and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. B. Scope Such standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by Merck irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (eg, contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials which are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials which are not under the control of Merck. II.Scientific Issues A. Trial Conduct 1.Trial Design Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices o f Merck or comparator products. Alternatively, Merck may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine participant preferences, etc. The design (ie, participant population, duration, sta tistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial. Research participants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 2.Site Selection Merck selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous performance in Merck trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated by Merck personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the tria l. 3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity Trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of Good Clinical Practice. Merck reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness and consistency. Data are verified v ersus source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per Merck policies and procedures, if fraud, misconduct or serious GCP -non-Compliance are suspected, the issues are promptly investigated. When necessary, the clinical site will be clo sed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees notified and data disclosed accordingly. B. Publication and Authorship To the extent scientifically appropriate, Merck seeks to publish the results of trials it conducts. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing. In such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues of multipli city. Merck’s policy on authorship is consistent with the requirements outlined in the ICH -Good Clinical Practice guidelines. In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the trial, performance or interpretati on of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. Merck funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications. 04RPX4 059WF7"

Participant Protection A.IRB/IEC review All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB/IEC before being initiated at each site. Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the IRB/IEC prior to implementation, except that changes required urgentl y to protect participant safety and well -being may be enacted in anticipation of IRB/IEC approval. For each site, the IRB/IEC and Merck will approve the participant informed consent form. B.Safety The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical tria ls is that participant welfare is of primary importance. Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local standard of care. Participants are never denied access to appropriate medical care based on participation in a Merck clinical trial. All participation in Merck clinical trials is voluntary. Participants are enrolled only after providing informed consent for participation . Participants may withdraw from a Merck trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them. C.Confidentiality Merck is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, t o the greatest extent possible. Unless required by law, only the investigator, sponsor (or representative) and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential medical records that might identify the research participant by name. D.Genomic Re search Genomic Research will only be conducted in accordance with informed consent and/or as specifically authorized by an Ethics Committee. IV.Financial Considerations A.Payments to Investigators Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is Mer ck’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of Merck trials. Merck does not pay incentives to enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly chall enging, additional payments may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts. Merck does not pay for participant referrals. However, Merck may compensate referring physicians for time spent on chart review to identify potentially e ligible participants. B.Clinical Research Funding Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by Merck, and that the investigator or sponsoring institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the loc al IRB/IEC may wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, publications resulting from Merck trials will indicate Merck as a source of funding. C.Funding for Travel and Other Requests Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be consistent with local guidelines and practices including, in the U.S., those established by the American Medical Assoc iation (AMA). V. Investigator Commit ment Investigators will be expected to review Merck’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. * In this document, ""Merck"" refers to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. and Schering Corporation, each of which is a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

An y specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified will be destro yed. d. Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s) Collection of specimens for Future Biomedical Research will be performed as outlined in the SoA. In general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for Future Biomedical Research, these will usuall y be obtained at a time when the participant is having blood drawn for other study purposes. 4.Confidential Participant Information for Future Biomedical Research In order to optimize the research that can be conducted with Future Biomedical Research specime ns, it is critical to link participant' clinical information with future test results. I n fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical study data to the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Kno wing participant characteristics like gender, age, medical history and treatment outcomes are critical to understanding clinical context of anal ytical results. To maintain privacy of information collected from specimens obtained for Future Biomedical Resea rch, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All specimens will be single -coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below. At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the Future Biomedical Research specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain an y personally identify ing information embedded within it. The link (or key ) between participant identifiers and this unique code will be held at the study site. No personal identifiers will appear on the specimen t ube. 5.Biorepository Specimen Usage Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for anal yses using good scientific practices. Anal yses utilizing the Future Biomedical Research specimens may be performed b y the Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a universit y investigator) designated b y the Sponsor. The investigator conducting the anal ysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party anal yses will conform to the specific scope of anal ysis outli ned in this sub- study . Future Biomedical Research specimens remaining with the third part y after specific anal ysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor. 6.

If medical records for the main study are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently , the participant's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to main study use only . If specimens were collected from study participants specificall y for Future Biomedical Research, these specimens will be removed from the biorepository and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator confirmin g withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any anal yses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destru ction or already performed prior to the request being received b y the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research study data and results. No new analy ses would be generated after the request is received. In the event that the medical r ecords for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the investigator is no longer required b y regulatory authorities to retain the main study records) or the specimens have been completel y anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the partic ipant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed. 7. Retention of Specimens Future Biomedical Research specimens will be stored in the biorepository for pote ntial analysis for up to 20 y ears from the end of the main study . Specimens may be stored for longer if a regulatory or governmental authorit y has active questions that are being answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions have been adequatel y addressed. Specimens from the study site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to the Sponsor -designated biorepository . If a central laboratory is not utilized in a particular study , the study site will shi p directly to the Sponsor -designated biorepository . The specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility which operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destroy ed according to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the biorepository database. 8.Data Security Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated study administrator research personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highl y secure, and is accomplished using network securit y policies and practices based on international standards to protect against unauthorized access. 9.Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants No information obtained from exploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the participant, famil y, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the participant include: Lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive capability , and concerns regarding misinterpretation. 04RPX4 059WF7"
