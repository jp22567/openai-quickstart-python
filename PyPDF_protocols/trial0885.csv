5,page_5,"Version 10/7/2020 6 of 57 1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 1.1 Introduction Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer . HNSCC originates in the squamous cell mucosa of the oropharynx (OP), oral cavity, larynx and hypopharynx. OPSCC is one of the most common subtypes of HNSCC and the incidence of OPSCC ha s risen significantly over the last decade.1 Last year, 16,000 new cases of OPSCC were diagnosed in the USA. Previously, t he primary cause of OPSCC was smoking; however, currently the majority of cases (>9 0%) are due to the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).2 HPV- related OPSCC is expected to comprise the majority of HNSCCs by 2030.1 HPV- related OPSCC has a better prognosis compared to smoking -induced HPV- unrelated disease. O nly 10 -15% of patients with HPV -related OPSCC develop disease relapse after initial therapy compared to 40- 60% of patients with HPV - unrelated disease. Also, patients with HPV -related OPSCC are younger and healthier than patients with HPV -unrelated disease and thus deaths due to non- OPSCC causes are much lower in HPV -related OPSCC . As a result, the 5 year overall survival (OS) of patients with HPV -relate d OPSCC is 70 -90% compared to 30% for HPV -unrelated dis ease (Figure)3: Overall survival by p16 staining (p16+ is a surrogate marker of HPV) The current standard of care therapy for HPV -related and HPV -unrelated OPSCC is the same, even though the chance s for cure and OS are far better with the former diagnosis. Treatment options include surgery and adjuvant radiation- based therapy or definitive chemoradiation therapy (DCRT). Both options result in intense and frequent acute toxicity and long- term morbidity that impair quality of life (QOL). The current focus for HPV -related OPSCC is to investigate less intense therapy with the goal to reduce treatment -related toxicity while maintaining the l ow relapse risk. The focus for HPV- unrelated disease is to investigate more intense therapy"
6,page_6,"Version 10/7/2020 7 of 57 to reduce relapse risk . This protocol will evaluate two less intense post -operative adjuvant radiation- based therapy approaches in patients with HPV -related OPSCC who have a low (Arm 1) or very low (Arm 2) risk for disease relapse . A standard, intense post - operative CRT pathway will be reserved for patients with a high risk for disease relapse (Arm 3). 1.2 Outcomes of HPV -related OPSCC after Surger y and Adjuvant Therapy Washington University has published a large body of data on outcomes of patients with HPV -related OPSCC treated with primary surgery and post -operative adjuvant radiation therapy (POART) or chemoradiation therapy (POACRT). In a retrospective report of 84 patients treated with transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) (median follow -up: 53 months ), OS at 2 and 5 years was 94% and 88%, respectively.4 The risk of recurrence was 7%. Most of these patients had small primary tumors (T1- 2:74% ). OS was adversely impacted by advanced T stage ( T3- 4) and positive margins. In a retrospective report of 204 patients treated with TLM , the OS at three years was 86% and the relapse risk was 13%.3 Advanced T stage (T3-4) and positive margin were adverse prognostic factor s (Figures):"
7,page_7,"Version 10/7/2020 8 of 57 Other reports identified that five or more pathologic positive neck nodes was also an adverse prognostic factor (Figure)5: Seventeen percent of patients with OPSCC have five or more positive neck nodes , but even these patients had a favorable five year disease- specific survival (DSS) of 80%.6 1.3 Acute and Long Term Toxicities of Surgery and Adjuvant Therapy for HPV- related OPSCC The treatment -related toxicity burden experienced by patients with HPV -related OPSCC is substantial. Adverse events (AEs) due to surgery with modern trans - oral techniques usually resolve after 3-4 weeks. Swallowing function after TLM and adjuvant therapy w as good at two years in 93% of patients with T1- 3 disease but in only 40% of patients with T4 base of tongue (BOT) disease.4 Shoulder dysfunction due to injury of cranial nerve XI is frequent but temporary in most cases, except those patients with bulky, i nfiltrative neck nodal disease. In contrast to surgery , the toxicity of POACRT is much more significant. Acute AEs include mucositis, dysgeusia, dry mouth, weight loss, fatigue, renal dysfunction, myelosu ppression, tinnitus , and high frequency hearing loss. Chronic AEs include xerostomia, dysgeusia, dental caries, difficulty swallowing, pain, hearing loss, carotid artery atherosclerosis, and fatigue. These AEs impair global patient - reported quali ty of life (PRQOL), and social, functional, physical, and emotional domains."
8,page_8,"Version 10/7/2020 9 of 57 1.4 Steps Already Taken to Reduce Treatment -Related AE in Patients with HPV -related OPSCC The goal of p rimary surgery is to remove all gross disease at the primary tumor site and remove the involved and at risk neck nodes , to result in a state of microscopic disease. Nearly all cases can be performed by trans -oral procedures (TLM or TORS), which are much mess morbid compared to open surgical techniques. The vast majority of patients with HPV -related OPSCC do not need to undergo reconstruction procedures and their associated morbidities. Reconstruction procedures using free - or pedicle -flaps are usually only required for management of bulky or infiltrative tumors (T4 or N3). The goal of POART is to eliminate microscopic tumor i n at risk zones that may have been left behind after surgery. A series of studies in patients with OPSCC showed that changes in radiation technique, doses , and port volumes can be safely performed without loss of efficacy and resulted in improvement in PRQ OL and reduction in toxicity. The shift from 3D CRT to IMRT resulted in a reduction in grade 3 acute (mucositis, dysphagia, and pain) and delayed (xerostomia and dysphag ia) toxicities .7 Elimination of POART to the primary tumor site resulted in a risk of l ocal recurrence of 3% in patients with T1- 2 disease compared to 17% in patients with T3- 4 disease.6 Rates of temporary percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube requirements were 6% with no primary bed radiation vs 41% with primary bed radiation. Thes e data support elimination of radiation to the primary tumor bed in patients with T1 -2 disease. In HPV -related OPSCC, no difference in local -regional recurrence -free survival occurred between post - operative adjuvant IMRT doses of 60 Gy compared to 66Gy (98.5% vs 98.1% at 2 years, respectively) .8 In OPSCC patients with a clinically uninvolved contralateral neck, eliminating coverage of POART to the contralateral high level II neck and retropharyngeal"
9,page_9,Version 10/7/2020 10 of 57 nodes was associated with a minimal risk for failure in these regions and an improved PRQOL.9 1.5 HPV- Related OPSCC is More Radiosensitive than HPV -Unrelated OPSCC The molecular basis of the favorable outcomes of HPV -related OPSCC treated with CRT has not been clearly determined. One report did find that HPV positive HNSCC cell lines were more radiosensitive than HPV negative HNSCC cell lines.10 The increased radiosensitivity of HPV positive HNSCC cell lines was not due to increased apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in G1 a result of the effect of the E6 viral protein on wt p53. Impaired DNA double strand break repair capacity was found to be the likely basis for the increased radiosensitivity of HPV positive HNSCC cell lines.
10,page_10,"Version 10/7/2020 11 of 57 Additional pre- clinical data support the increased radiosensitivity of HPV positive OPSCC cell lines.11 Also, HPV positive cell lines appear to retain some p53 function as shown by the ability of cisplatin or radiation to induce the p53 target gene GADD45.12 In HPV positive cell lines, cisplatin repressed E6 expression and induced p21, p53, and BAX expression resulting in induction of apoptosis.13 Clinical data s upport that HPV -related OPSCC is more radiosensitive than HPV - unrelated OPSCC. The rate of tumor regression during week one of IMRT was greater in HPV -related OPSCC than HPV -unrelated OPSCC (33% difference in gross tumor volume [GTV] p< 0.001 and the average absolute change in GTV was -22.9 cc/week vs -5.9 cc/week, respectively p< 0.001).14 1.6 Selection of Appropriate Candidates with HPV -Related OPSCC for De-Intensification of CRT ? Recognition that patients with AJCC/UICC 7th edition stage III/ IV HPV- related OPSCC had a substantially better prognosis than those with stage III /IV HPV- unrelated OPSCC resulted in development and implementation of a new staging system specific to HPV- related OPSCC . The new staging system correlated prognosis for each stage better than the old staging system. Investigato rs at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre showed that the AJCC/UICC TNM 7th edition clinical staging system distinguished OS prognosis among the different stages of HPV -unrelated OPSCC , but it did n ot do so for HPV -related OPSCC.15 Five year OS for HPV -unrelated OPSCC was 70% (stage I), 58% (stage II), 50% (stage III), and 30% (stage IV). Five year OS for HPV -related OPSCC was 88% (stage I), 78% (stage II), 71% (stage III), and 74% (stage IV). This group performed r ecursive partitioning analysis (RPA) on a large internal dataset and d ivided HPV -related OPSCC into three groups: I ( 59%; T1-3 N0 -2b), II (16%; T1-3 N2c), and III ( 26%; T4 N3) with 5 year OS of 82%, 76%, and 54%, respectively."
11,page_11,"Version 10/7/2020 12 of 57 Weaknesses of the Princess Margaret report included data from a single institution and lack of validation in a separate cohort. The International Collaboration o n Oropharyngeal cancer Network for Staging ( ICON -S) report addressed these weaknesses by performing a multicenter validation study using clinical (not pathologic) staging methods .16 T stages remained similar except that T4a and T4b were bundled into T4 bas ed on the same OS between these T4 subsets. Clinical N stages were d ivided into N1 (ipsilateral neck nodes), N2 (bilateral or contralateral neck nodes), and N3 (> 6 cm neck node). The proposed ICON -S clinical classification was stage I (T1 -2, N0 -1), stage II (T1 -2N2 or T3N0- 2), stage III (T4 or N3), and stage IV (metastatic). An exploratory analysis showed that lower neck nodal involvement had a significant adverse impact on OS in stage III but no effect in sta ges I -II. Also, OS was similar for patients with < 5 neck nodes and > 5 neck nodes, across all stages."
12,page_12,"Version 10/7/2020 13 of 57 The tables below summarize the new AJCC 8th edition clinical and pathologic staging systems for HPV- related OPSCC: The ICON -S clinical staging system determined that stages I -II HPV -related OPSCC had excellent prognoses (5 year OS > 80%) with current therapy and would be appropriate candidates for trials evaluating de- intensification of current CRT. ICON -S stages I and II represented 83% of patients in this analysis. Patients with ICON -S stage III disease (17% of all patients) had a poorer prognosis (5 year OS 60%), and would not be appropriate candidates for trials evaluating de- intensification of current therapy. 1.7 Current Trials of De -intensification Therapy in HPV -related OPSCC Nine trials evaluating strategies to de- intensify CRT in patients with HPV -related"
13,page_13,"Version 10/7/2020 14 of 57 OPSCC are either ongoing or recently completed with results awaiting maturation of data. Five of these trials use the surgical platform and four use the definitive radiation platform. The lowest dose of once daily radiation being investigated in all current trials of de -intensification is 50 Gy , with one exception. The Mayo Clinic trials are evaluating 30- 36 Gy RT ; however, RT is delivered in an accelerated scheme, which is known to be more toxic than once daily radiation schemes. Note that risk stratification factors vary in each of these trials , making comparisons challenging. Surgery Trials: ECOG 3311 is a phase III trial that treats post -operative patients who have intermediate risk (IR) features with POART 50 vs 60 Gy to the primary tumor site and bilateral neck nodes. Chemotherapy is not given to these patients. The PATHOS trial also compar es POART 50 Gy vs 60 Gy in patients with IR disease. The DART phase III trial (Mayo Cinic) compares arm 1: 30 Gy in 150 cGy bid x 12 doses (IR) or 36 Gy in 180 cGy bid x 12 doses (HR: ECE) + docetaxel 2 doses vs arm 2: 60 GY in 200 cGy doses, both with weekly cisplatin x 7 . The SIRS phase II trial ( Mt Sinai ) uses POART 50 Gy, but is limited to patients with T1 -2 IR disease. MC 1273 phase II trial ( Mayo Clinic ) used POART 36 Gy (180 cGY bid) + docetaxel (2 doses). Definitive Radiation Trials: NRG HN002 is a phase III trial that compares definitive RT 60 Gy in 6 weeks + weekly cisplatin x 6 vs accelerated definitive RT 60 Gy in 5 weeks ( 6 doses per week). This trial does not include patients with T4, N2c or N3 disease, or patients with > 10 pack -year history of smoking. RTOG 1016 is a phase III trial comparing accelerated definitive RT 70 Gy over 6 weeks (with 2 fractions one day per week) + HDB cisplatin x 2 vs cetuximab x 8. ECOG 1308 was a phase II trial in which all patients were treated with induction chemotherapy followed by definitive RT 54 Gy + cetuximab (if complete response to induction chemotherapy) or RT 69.3 Gy + cetuximab (if not complete response to induction chemotherapy). A single arm phase II trial (University of California) treated patients with two cycles of induction paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by either 54 Gy IMRT + paclitaxel (CR or PR) or 60 Gy IMRT + paclitaxel (< PR).17 The results of these trials (except ECOG 1308 and the University of California trials ) are not available yet , as many are still accruing and none have mature follow - up. 1.8 Rational e for 42 Gy IM RT + Chemotherapy for HPV -related OPSCC Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) due to radiation therapy is an important concept related to the lik elihood and severity of acute and long term toxicity in an attempt to cure malignancy with a radiation therapy approach. When other modalities are used, NTCP can be extended to account for the overall complication probability due to the sum of all treatment modalities involved. It is anecdotally evident that lower dose and/or lower volume of radiation correlate with less toxicity, but it was not until the advent of 3D radiation therapy technology that"
14,page_14,"Version 10/7/2020 15 of 57 NTCP could be quantified. The Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) study18 summarized the latest understanding of organ specific dose/volume/outcome data. Based on QUANTEC, there is much to be gained by reducing radiation therapy dose to 42 Gy for HPV related OPSCC. The organs related to swallowing function include the pharyngeal constrictors, larynx, and esophagus. For the pharyngeal constrictors, a mean radiation dose of less than 50 Gy reduces the risk of symptomatic dysphagia and aspiration to less than 20%. For the larynx, a mean dose of < 50 Gy reduces the risk of aspiration to less than 30%, and the risk of laryngeal edema is less than 20% with a mean dose of less than 44 Gy. For the esophagus, if the volume receiving 50 Gy is less than 40%, the risk of grade 2 or above toxicity is no more than 30%. T he increase in NTCP with dose has an exponential component. Therefore at doses above 50 Gy, the ris k of damage increases exponentially with rising dose. However , the reduction in NTCP also has an exponential component, meaning that a dose of 42 Gy would significantly reduce normal tissue risk relative to 50 Gy in the QUANTEC data above, and relative to the 60 Gy standard dose for OPSCC in the postoperative setting. Like HPV -related OPSCC, anal canal SCC is also caused by HPV. Anal SCC is treated non- operatively with CRT. Radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy (5 -FU and Mitomycin C) is the standard of care treatment for non- metastatic anal canal SCC. The treatment plan for T2N0 disease is 42 Gy elective nodal and 50.4 Gy anal tumor planning target volumes (PTV) in 28 fractions and for T3 -4N0-3 disease is 45 Gy elective nodal, 50.4 Gy for < 3 cm or 54 Gy for > 3 cm metastatic nodal and 54 Gy anal tumor in 30 fractions. Use of IMRT reduced acute GI and GU mucosal toxicity compared to non- conformal radiation.19 In anal SCC, mitomycin C and 5 -FU are the standard chemotherapy agents given with RT. In OPSCC, cisplatin is the standard agent given with RT. Mitom ycin C has not been tested in HP V-related OPSCC. However, cisplatin and 5- FU was compared to mitomycin C and 5 -FU with RT in anal SCC20. The OS was not different between the two regimens. The rates of distant metastasis were not significantly different between the two groups (15% with mitomycin C and 19% with cisplatin). In anal SCC, the total dose of cisplatin given during RT is 150 mg/m2; whereas, in HPV -related OPSCC, the total dose of cisplat in given during RT is 300 mg/m2. The studies of CRT in anal SCC showed that a radiation dose of only 42 Gy and a total cisplatin dose of only 150 mg/m2 were effective in eliminating microscopic disease in most patients . Is it possible that a dose of only 42 Gy would also eliminate microscopic disease in patients with HPV -related OPSCC? The optimal platform to test this question is in patients who undergo surgery to resect all gross disease at the primary tumor site and neck nodes. Many of t hese patients still have microscopic disease at the primary tumor site or in neck nodes"
15,page_15,"Version 10/7/2020 16 of 57 and thus all patients are treated with adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of disease recur rence. The standard radiation dose used in this setting is 60 Gy, and most of these patients also receive concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/m2/dose for up to three doses. Based on studies in anal SCC, 42 Gy of RT should eliminate microscopic disease in most patients with OPSCC who have undergone complete resection of all gross disease. Studies in anal SCC used a total cisplatin dose of 150 mg/m2; however, these patients were managed non -operatively and thus all patients had gross disease when CRT was initiated. For this reason, a total dose of cisplatin lower than 150 mg/m2 seems reasonable to explore in patients with OPSCC who have undergone complete resection of all gross disease. In HNSCC, 5 -FU has not been shown to add benefit to RT. De-intensification of adjuvant therapy by reduction in radiation dose from 60 Gy to 42 Gy and in the total cisplatin dose from 300 to 100 mg/m2 should result in a substantial reduction in acute toxicity and improvement in QOL, but this is only acceptable if there is not an increase d risk of disease relapse. 1.9 “The MINT Trial” The overarching goal of the MINT trial is to reduce treatment -related toxicity while maintaining efficacy. Patients with HPV -related OPSCC will undergo resection of the primary tumor site and involved/at risk regional neck nodes. Based on the clinical and pathologic stagi ng and the details of the pathology report, patients will be assigned to one of three adjuvant t reatments : • Arm 1 (extracapsular extension ( ECE) or positive margin but not clinical or pathologic T4 or clinical N3 disease) will be treated with POAmCRT (42 Gy RT + cisplatin 1 dose) • Arm 2 (no ECE , no positive margins , and not clinical or pathologic T4 or clinical N3 disease ) will be treated with POAmRT (42 Gy RT, no cisplatin) • Arm 3 (clinical or pathologic T4 or clinical N3 disease) will be treated with POART (60 Gy RT ). If there is pathologic evidence of ECE or positive margin, 3 cycles of cisplatin will be given concurrently with POART (60Gy). Intermediate risk patients will be assigned to A rm 1 where they will be treated with de-intensified CRT: 42 Gy of RT (vs 60 Gy) and cisplatin 1 dose (vs 3). Reduction in treatment -related toxicity is expected in Arm 1. Low risk patients will be assigned to A rm 2 where they will be treated with de- intensified RT: 42 G y (vs 60 Gy) and no cisplatin at all . Reduction in treatment - related toxicity is expected in A rm 2. High risk patients will be assigned to A rm 3 where they will be treated with st andard intensive therapy, so reduction in t reatment -related toxicity is not expect ed in this group."
16,page_16,"Version 10/7/2020 17 of 57 Mucosal damage is the key mediator of most of the acute toxicity for POART and POACRT. The primary endpoint for the MINT trial is weight loss, a reliable, easily measured and practic al surrogate marker of m ucosal toxicity . Historical data showed that the percent weight loss during POACRT in patients with HPV - related OPSCC was 7.39% . The primary hypothesis of this trial is that the percent weight loss of patients in A rm 1 during POAmCRT will be 3. 7% (50% reduction). Secondary endpoints of mucosal toxicity to be determined include the proportion of patients who had PEG tubes placed, who experienced a doubling of the serum creatinine from baseline (a surrogate of dehydration and/or cisplatin toxicity), and who remain ed on narcotics at 6 weeks after POAmCRT. The secondary hypothesis for this trial is the proportion of patients with the composite endpoint of PEG tube placement/doubling of the serum creatinine/requirement for narcotics at 6 weeks after POAmCRT will be reduced from the historical control of 72.6% to 36.3% (50% reduction). Similar endpoints will be monit ored for A rm 2, although the number of patients in this arm is expected to be small based on historical data. As such, we wi ll not develop formal hypothesis t esting for Arm 2, but will report the toxicity data in descriptive form. Patients (and clinicians) will not accept an increased risk of disease recurrence even with a significant reduction in toxicity with de- intensified therapy .21 To address this concern, we will establish rates of disease recurrence for Arm 1 that will be unacceptable. Our historical control data showed that the absolute risk of disease recurrence in patients with the characteristics of A rm 1 was 10% and that 89% of these recurrence events occurred by 24 months after completion of therapy. The upper threshold for disease recurrence in Arm 1 will be 20% by 24 months after completion of therapy. In Arms 2 and 3, w e will report the proportion of patients with di sease recurrence, but will not develop f ormal hypotheses testing because Arm 2 patients will be too few in number and Arm 3 patients will receive standard POACRT . 2.0 STUDY ENDPOINTS AND OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objective 1. To determine the percent weight loss in patients during POAmCRT (Arm 1) starting at Day 1 and ending on the last day of RT . 2.2 Secondary Objectives 1.

Based on the clinical and pathologic staging and the"
19,page_19,"Version 10/7/2020 20 of 57 details of the pathology report, patients will be assigned to one of three adjuv ant treatments. Arm 1 (ECE or positive margin but not clinical or pathologic T4 or clinical N3 disease) will be treated with POAmCRT (42 Gy RT + cisplatin 1 dose). Arm 2 (no ECE , no positive margins , and not clinical or pathologic T4 or clinical N3 diseas e) will be treated with POAmRT (42 Gy RT, no cisplatin). Arm 3 (clinical or pathologic T4 or clinical N3 disease) will be treated with POART (60 Gy RT). If there is pathologic evidence of ECE or positive margin, 3 cycles of cisplatin will be given concurrently with POART (60Gy). Please note that because weight loss is the primary endpoint, a specific scale must be chosen at each facility. It is the responsibility of the research coordinator to ensure that the same scale is used for all patients at that f acility. Patient weight will be assessed with clothes on (no outer layers such as jackets) and shoes off. 5.1 Baseline Assessment The baseline assessment will include the following tests or procedures and must occur within 35 days (PET scan within 42 days) of enrollment: 1. Clinical exam ination to document extent of primary tumor by laryngoscopy performed in the office or in the operating room (depending on the ease of the exam and the primary tumor site) and palpable involved regional neck nodes. 2. Documentation of s ite of primary tumor ( HPV- related oropharynx or CUP ), location and level of clinically involved neck nodes (right or left neck , Level I-V), T stage (1 -4), N stage (0 -3), and overall clinical stage ( I-III by AJCC Cancer Staging Manual Eigh th Edition) . 3. Documentation of demographic information, including gender (M/F), age (years), height (cm), weight (Kg), and BSA (m2). 4. Documentation of baseline patient symptoms using NCI-CTCAE v ersion 4.0. 5. Documentation of ECOG performance status ( Appendix 1). 6. Complet ion of QOL questionnaires (Appendices 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). 7. Documentation of Comorbidity Index ( Appendix 2). 8. Laboratory evaluations : CBC, CMP, magnesium, PT/PTT, serum pregnancy test if patient is a female of childbearing potential. 9. CT scan of the neck (IV contrast preferred) to document and measure the extent of the primary tumor size and involved regional neck nodes . 10. FDG -PET/CT scan (whole body) to document and measure the FDG avidity at the primary tumor site and at the involved regional neck nodes. 11. OPTIONAL: Speech and swallowing assessment including a modified barium swallow (MBS) study and the Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck Cancer (PSS -HN) questionnaire (Appendix 8). 5.2 Standard of Care Surgery"
20,page_20,"Version 10/7/2020 21 of 57 Patients will undergo a typical preoperative workup in preparation for surgery, including routine lab work, electrocardiogram, and a preoperative assessment by anesthesiology. Patients will undergo surgical resection of the primary tumor via a transoral approach, including conventional transoral surgery, transoral laser microsurgery (TLM), or transoral robotic surgery (TORS). The choice of surgical technique will be based on surgeon preference, tumor characteristics, and tumor site. Margin status will be assessed intra -operatively on frozen section and confirmed on permanent section. At the time of transoral resection, patients will also undergo surgical management of cervical lymph nodes via a conventional selective neck dissection. For oropharyngeal tumors, this most often includes dissection of Levels II -IV. If the tumor approaches within one centimeter of midline, the patient will undergo bilateral neck dissections. The pathology repo rt documents m argin status, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and extracapsular extension (ECE) . Margins will be considered positive if gr oss or microscopic disease is present at the margins based on the surgical pathologist’s judgement. E CE will be defined as tumor extending beyond the lymph node capsule into the surrounding soft tissue (AJCC 8th Edition Staging Manual). ECE will be measured when possible; however, extensive ECE or soft tissue metastases may preclude this measurement. 5.3 Interim Assessment The interim assessment will include the follow ing tests or procedures and should occur within 14 -42 days of surgery : 1. Clinical examination. 2. Documentation of key data from the pathology report: T (1 -4) and N (0 -3) stage, ECE status (+/ -) and extent of ECE ( mm), margin status (+/ -). 3. Arm assignment (based on pathology data) 4.

Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT ) or intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is to be used exclusiv ely for this study. IMRT or IMPT will be delivered once per day Monday through Friday per routine clinical practice in Arm 3. In Arms 1 and 2, one BID treatment will be given during the course of therapy. If patient logistics prohibit the one BID treatment, once daily treatments throughout will be acceptable. The total dose to the postoperative tumor bed will be : • Arm 1 : 4200 cGy in 21 fractions of 200 cGy each over 4 weeks • Arm 2: 4200 cGy in 21 fractions of 200 cGy each over 4 weeks • Arm 3 : 6000 cGY in 30 fractions of 200 cGy each over 6 weeks Additional regions in the ipsilateral and contralateral neck at risk for microscopic disease in the cervical lymph nodes will receive: • Arm 1 : 3780 cGy in 21 fractions of 180 cGy each • Arm 2: 3780 cGy i n 21 fractions of 180 cGy each • Arm 3 : 5200 cGy in 30 fractions of 173 cGy each 5.5.1 CT Simulation As per routine practice , computed tomography (CT) will be the primary image platform for targeting and treatment planning. Prior to the scan, the patient will be given IV contrast according to institutional protocols ( provided the patient has normal renal function and no allerg ies to contrast ). The patient will be positioned supine on the CT simulator table (head toward the gantry). The head will be placed on standard or customized headrest so as to have the neck slightly extended. Alternatively, a custom head/shoulder mold ma y be used for immobilization. An immobilization mask will then be fashioned. A CT dataset will be acquired from the top of the head through 5 cm below the clavicular heads with no more than 5 mm axial slices. Three localization marks will be drawn and wir ed on the patient’s immobilization mask at the angle of the mandible bilaterally and midline. These marks will serve to establish an internal reference from which an isocenter is placed midline, midplane, at the level of the angle of the mandible. 5.5.2 Virtu al Simulation and Contouring"
24,page_24,"Version 10/7/2020 25 of 57 The CT scan will be exported to a commercially available virtual simulation software package. Guidelines for delineating each lymph node level will be based on the international consensus for delineation of head and neck lymp h nodes ( http://www.rtog.org/hnatlas/main.html ). These guidelines were derived in part from W ashington University School of M edicine institutional data and are consistent with routine clinical practice at Washington University .

However the most likely mechanism of antitumor action of this drug resides in its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis, and to a lesser degree, RNA and protein synthesis. It has also been shown that Cisplatin binds to DNA and produces inter -strand cross -links. Also cisplatin is not phase- sensitive and its cytotoxicity is similar in all phases of the cell cycle. Additional information can be found in the package insert. 6.1.3 Supplier Cisplatin is commercially available as 1 mg/mL in both 50 mL multiple dose vial and 100 mL multiple dose vial. 6.1.4 Dosage Form and Preparation The stability of cisplatin in solution is dependent upon the chloride ion concentration present in the diluent. Cisplatin should be diluted into an IV solution containing NaCL at a minimum chloride ion concentration of 0.040 mol/L (0.2% NaCL). Needles, syringes, catheters and IV administrations sets containing aluminum mus t be avoided during preparation and administration due to cisplatin- aluminum reaction causing precipitation and"

Mannitol 12.5 to 25 gm may be added per institutional guidelines. 6.1.5 Storage and Stability The dry, unopened vials should be stored at room temperature (15° - 25° C). The unopened container should be protected from light and stored in the carton until contents are used. Do not refrigerate. Cisplatin remaining in the amber vial following initial entry is stable for 28 days protect ed from light or for 7 days under fluorescent room light. 6.1.6 Administration Patients will receive cisplatin via IV infusion over 60 minutes. Adequate hydration must be maintained during and after administration as described in the treatment section. It is recommended that a ll patients should be premedicated with antiemetics. 7.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS At each of the scheduled visits noted in the study calendar, an assessment of adverse events (AEs) will be made by the treating physician with toxicity grading using the NCI CTCAE version 4. Patients without AEs will continue on study treatment as planned. Patients who develop grade 1- 2 or selected grade 3 (nausea/vomiting/fatigue) AEs will be supported symptomatically and encouraged to continue on study treatment as planned. Modifications in their therapy may be necessary and will be detailed below. Management of specific AEs is noted below. 7.1 Cisplatin Dose Modifications (Arm 3 only) 7.1.1 Ototoxicity Grade 3- 4 hearing loss /tinnitus is an indication to consider discontinuation of the drug. 7.1.2 Kidney Impairment Calculated Creatinine Clearance Percent Dose to Give ≥ 50 mL/min 100% < 50 mL/min 0% (withhold treatment for this dose and repeat serum creatinine weekly after additional hydration), then for next chemotherapy dose : If CrCl was already < 50 mL/min and is now: The percent dose to give is:"

Delays are allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. 8.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES 8.1 Tumor Acquisition Protocol All patients will be strongly encouraged to participate on this companion protocol (HRPO # 201102323) for future correlative studies. Tumor samples will be collected in the operating room by trained research personnel, processed and stored according to established protocols. Correlative studies may be conducted to further determine potential molecular markers of risk in HPV -positive or opharyngeal cancer. These studies may include DNA sequencing for mutational analysis and copy number variations. HPV viral load and integration versus episomal status may also be assessed. Additionally, gene expression studies, including expression of vir al genes, may be conducted on all samples and correlated with other tumor characteristics and outcomes. Future studies may also include the creation of PDX models as well as immunohistochemistry."

For the purposes of this protocol, adverse events related to the standard of care surgery will not be collected and documented on CRFs . 10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1 Study Design This is a three- arm non-randomized Phase II trial. All the enrolled patients will undergo resection of the primary tumor site and involved/at risk regional neck nodes. Patients will be assigned to one of three adjuvant treatments based on the clinical and pathologic staging and the details of the pathology report. 90%, 5%, and 5% of the patients are expected to be in Arm 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The overarching goal is to reduce treatment -related toxicity while maintaining efficacy. Weight loss is a reliable, easily measured and practical surrogate marker of mucosal toxicity. Therefore, the primary objective is to determine the percent weight loss of patients during POAmCRT in Arm 1. The second ary objectives are to evaluate the proportion of PEG tube placements, determine the serum creatinine changes in patients receiving POAmCRT, evaluate the narcotics administration of patients 6 weeks after POAmCRT, document the measures of Quality of Life (Q OL) at baseline/during treatment/one year after completion of treatment on all arms, and determine the disease recurrence free survival (RFS) at 24 months post -treatment in each arm. 10.2 Sample Size Calculation The primary endpoint is percent weight loss from Day 1 of treatment to last day of RT. The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint only. Our historical data showed that the mean and standard deviation of percent weight loss during POACRT in patients with HPV -related OPSCC are 7.39% and 5.46%, respectively. The primary hypothesis of this trial is that the percent weight loss of patients in Arm 1 during POAmCRT will be 3.7% (50% reduction). Twenty patients will have 80% power to detect the percent weight loss difference if assuming the standard deviation of 5.46% using a two- sided one- group t test at the type I error of 5%. We will enroll 2 4 patients in Arm 1 accounting for 15% drop- out22. We estimate that 14 patients will be enrolled in Arm 2 and 6 patients will be enrolled in Arm 3 for a total of 4 0 patients. In December 2019, we reached the 40 patient enrollment mark. However, Arm 1 had enrolled only 13 of the target of 20 patients at that time . In June 2020, we plan"
38,page_38,"Version 10/7/2020 39 of 57 to increas e enrollment to re ach 7 additional patients on Arm 1, or 20 additional patients onto any arm, whichever comes first. 10.3 Accrual We perform surgery in 60-80 patients per year at Washington University with similar characteristics and estimate approximately 30-40 patients/year may be eligible for and will participate in this trial. We anticipate enrollment of approximately 2-3 patients per month. 10.4 Statistical Analyses 10.4.1 Patient Disposition The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for discontinuation, and the amount of therapy administered will be summarized by patient and by reason for discontinuation by arm. 10.4.2 Protocol Deviations All significant deviations will be summarized by patient and by type of deviation. 10.4.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Subject demographic and clinical characteristics will be summarized to characterize the population. Descriptive summaries will include means, standard deviations, medians, ranges for continuous variables and frequency and percentage for categorical variabl es. They are presented by total and each arm, respectively. 10.4.4 Endpoint Analysis The primary endpoint is percent weight loss. Weight (kg) will be collected weekly during radiation within each arm. The percent weight loss from the baseline is calculated at any post -baseline. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) model with identity link function will be used to analyze this percent weight loss data, in which the correlation among the repeated measures from the same patient need be considered. The autoregr essive of first order as working correlation structure will be used. The GEE model includes baseline weight and time points. The p -value is estimated to assess whether the percentages of weight loss across all time points are different. Least square means for percent weight loss at each time point and mean differences between any time points will be estimated, and their standard errors will be calculated within the use of GEE sandwich method when accounting for within- patient correlation."
39,page_39,"Version 10/7/2020 40 of 57 The secondary endpoints include proportion of PEG tube placements for all enrolled patients, the serum creatinine changes in patients receiving POAmCRT, proportion of the narcotics administration of patients 6 weeks after POAmCRT, the measures of Quality of Life (QOL), and RFS. Proportions of PEG tube placements for all enrolled patients and the narcotics administration of patients 6 weeks after POAmCRT and their associated 95% confidence intervals will be calculated assuming a binomial distribution23. The serum creatini ne is measured at the baseline and six weeks after POAmCRT. The paired t -test will be considered to test the change. QOL are measured at baseline/during treatment/one year after completion of treatment on all arms. Similarly, the GEE model will be used to analyze the longitudinal QOL data. Disease recurrence rate at 24 months post -treatment (DRR -24) in each arm is calculated for each arm. The proportion and 95% CI from binomial distribution will be shown for Arm 1. If 95% upper CI is smaller than 20%, then the risk of disease recurrence is deemed as acceptable. If 95% lower CI is larger than 20%, then the risk of disease recurrence is deemed as unacceptable. Given our small sample size, there are some uncertainties. Therefore, we do not test the hypothesi s about (DRR -24) but provide a preliminary data for planning future studies. Data on the toxicity in each arm will be collected for each subject, including frequency, type, and severity of adverse events. All analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Insti tute, Cary, NC) at the two -sided 5% significance level. 11.0 DATA SUBMISSION SCHEDULE Case report forms with appropriate source documentation will be completed according to the schedule listed in this section.
