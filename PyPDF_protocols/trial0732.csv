We plan to use fMRI-directed Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS), a high frequency TMS paradigm, for the treatment of severe, uncontrollable worry. While worry is a universal human experience, severe and excessive worry has been recently linked to increased risk of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, increased risk of conversion to Alzheimer ’s disease as well as to higher risk of all-cause mortality in midlife and late-life. Severe, uncontrollable worry has been repeatedly associated with reduced quality of life and impaired functioning. Current treatment choices (antidepressant/anxiolytic medications and psychotherapeutic interventions) have been proven moderately efficacious in reducing anxiety/depression burden, but ineffective in reducing worry severity, a phenomenon that may contribute to the high relapse rates associated with mood and anxiety disorders. Our research indicated that worry severity is associated with hyperactivation in specific regions such as orbital frontal cortex, superior parietal gyrus, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. In this pilot study, we aim to explore the efficacy of targeting one of these regions with iTBS. Based on our results, the most accessible target is the right superior parietal gyrus (rSPG) – a region that remained significantly associated with severe worry after controlling for ef fects of comorbid depression or overall anxiety. As this region showed an increased in cerebrovascular flow in association with worry severity, we propose to use iTBS (5x/week for 2 weeks) to modulate cortical plasticity in this region and consequently , to reduce worry severity.TMS during wakefulness has been shown to alter subsequent sleep [4], Further , changes in sleep in response to TMS has been associated with how participants respond to the TMS as a treatment [5]. Thus, we plan to measure sleep throughout the protocol to determine whether sleep changes as a function of TMS and whether sleep changes are associated with treatment response. 4.* What kind of study is this?

There is sufficient private office space available for investigators and project staff. ARGO - Neuroscience of Aging Research Laboratory Director: Carmen Andreescu, MD The ARGO research group is part of the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Psychiatry and the Western Psychiatric Hospital of UPMC. ARGO is located on the 5th floor of the Oxford Medical Building and encompasses both research and educational activities affiliated with geriatric psychiatry, including mood/anxiety disorders and disorders of cognition. ARGO's space includes a reception area, a shared conference room, multiple offices for faculty, staff and students, secure storage for study data and private, quiet room for testing. The computer lab contains networked image processing workstations. ARGO is fully equipped to conduct neuroimaging analyses, interventional research studies (e.g., TMS) and data management. On-going studies aim to relate the cognitive and affective symptoms in the elderly to functional and structural neuroanatomy, and to use targeted interventions to improve symptoms associated with mood/anxiety/cognitive disorders. ARGO also includes the Tetra analytical group, run by Dr. Helmet Karim. Tetra conducts neuroimaging and statistical analysis of neuroimaging data, as well as supporting analysis of EMA and actigraphy data. This group helps support neuroimaging analysis, development of new neuroimaging pipelines and standardization of these pipelines for widespread use. This group is composed of 3 analysts with several years of combined experience. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, ARGO staff adapted many assessment tools for virtual assessment, which they are now using regularly. Data storage and backup will use a Dell server with 109 terabytes of available storage. The server is connected to 46 dif ferent workstations throughout the research lab. The data are backed up weekly to Arcserve. The workstations have all necessary software for structural and functional neuroimaging analysis, including Matlab, SPM toolboxes, ePrime, AFNI, NIS, ITK,"

Additionally, the computers run the Microsoft Office software suite, including Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. All computers utilize the University of Pittsburgh Office of Academic Computing (OAC) Network. The ARGO Lab includes 8 offices and a computer lab, which contains the networked image processing workstations. Office space is provided for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students, post-doctoral fellows, research assistants, research administrator, and faculty. Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC) of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (http://www.mrctr.upmc.edu/mrrc/home/overview): The MRRC at Presbyterian Hospital and the Biomedical Science Tower, Pittsburgh is a state-of- the-art facility with space for imaging systems, support laboratories, technical support staff, image processing, and offices. The building housing the scanners is located relatively close to our offices at the Oxford building. Scanning Instrumentation: The MRRC houses two 3T Siemens full-body parallel imaging systems equipped with an ultra-fast gradient system (maximum amplitude: 40 mT/m, slew rate 400 T/m/s, rise time: 100 us) as well as a 7T scanner. The scanners have full conventional images capabilities (T1/T2; High Resolution T1 (MPRAGE); FLAIR; DTI; BOLD). The instrumentation is designed to handle the high data rates and storage required by fMRI. All researchers conducting studies at the MRRC are provided with accounts on the computational cluster. Computers for stimulus presentation, equipment for acquisition of physiological data, and a computer laboratory for data analysis are all available at the MRRC. Quality assurance and safety activities include daily signal stability scans and required safety training sessions for all researchers. All conventional and echo planar MR imaging and MR angiographic functions are supported with optimized image contrast and signal at 3T and 7T strength. For fMRI scanning, echo planar imaging with the shortest echo spacing is provided with an automatic correction of B0 drift during the acquisition. The magnet rooms are magnetically, acoustically, and RF shielded. Quality assurance procedures are in place. These include daily signal stability scans for echo planar imaging (maximum 1% peak-to-peak over a continuous eight-minute acquisition with a 64x64 matrix size) and daily signal-to-noise measurements with the standard RF head coil and cylindrical phantom. The MR Center has maintenance agreements with Siemens that guarantee service whenever daily stability scans fail to meet the required specifications. The systems are interfaced to a high-speed local area network (CDDI-based LAN) for data transfer to the computers in GPN lab in for analysis. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Under supervision of Co-I Ferrarelli, the Neuroscience Clinical and Translational Research Center (N-CTRC) recently purchased a state-of-the-art, research-dedicated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) device capable of delivering TBS and rTMS protocols. The system includes a variety of coils which are designed to provide relatively focused stimulation and are specifically designed to deliver demanding stimulation protocols. Additional services and resources at the N-CTRC include computing resources (PCs in each room, stimulus presentation control room). An exam room is available to conduct participant assessments, blood draws with basic processing, 12-lead EKGs, and other nursing functions."

The study of the TMS device does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety , or welfare of a subject. TMS involves stimulating directly and non-invasively a cortical area while EEG allows measuring the response of that area and the rest of the brain to TMS. TMS has been introduced about 30 years ago, and although some initial studies reported more serious side effects, including the occurrence of single episode seizure in a handful of participants, there have been no reported significant side effects since safety guidelines have been initially introduced in 1998[1], and then again updated in 2008[2]. Our study will perform TMS well within the safety guidelines, and the co-investigator leading the TMS component of this study (Fabio Ferrarelli) has more than a decade long experience with this technique, and has used it in the past in studies involving both healthy subjects [3-5] and patients with schizophrenia[6, 7]."

Both UPMC and non-UPMC records will be requested. Medical record review will take place strictly for screening purposes only to ensure the participant can safely undergo a 3T MRI. The formal phone screening, following the attached script, will ensure the individual meets eligibility criteria and can safely undergo a 3T MRI. If a potential participant has had surgery with implantable devices or has a history of metal in the body (e.g. an injury or accident), a review of the medical records will be necessary to ensure the potential participant can safely undergo 3T MRI. We would obtain either surgical reports to indicate the composition of any implanted objects to confirm MRI- compatibility and/or any prior imaging (x-rays, CT scans, and MRIs) to look for any metallic objects and/or see if the potential participant has safely completed MRIs in the past. Both UPMC and non-UPMC medical records will be requested. In the case of records at a non-UPMC facility, the potential participant will be asked to sign a release of information form, following the script in the Recruitment Phone Screen. This form will be mailed to the potential participant for their signature or it can be signed electronically using our secured REDCap database. Documentation of a verbal release on an ROI may also be used, utilizing two staf f members, one serving as a witness. The ROI will be sent to the non-UPMC facility , who will send the requested medical records back for review and MRI clearance."

If the initial visit takes place remotely, the participant will receive $10 for their time. Participants will receive payment for TMS sessions as follows. The first week participants will receive $75 total. To promote retention, payments will increase the longer participants stay enrolled. Participants will receive $125 for completing TMS sessions at the the end of Week 2. Participants will also receive $75 for completing the MRI scan along with $10 travel reimbursement. Participants will receive a $50 bonus for sleep and physical activity monitoring as long as they complete 6/7 days each of the 3 weeks that they are asked to wear the watch. Participants will receive an additional $10 for travel reimbursement if they are required to come in for an additional visit as detailed in the consent document. Participants will receive $15 for completion of the 1-month follow-up. This will result in a total payment of up to $370. Participants who miss TMS sessions will receive partial payment. This includes $15 per session during Week 1, and $25 per session during week 2. Participants will receive payment for coming to the fMRI visit, even if the scan cannot be completed (i.e. technical issues). The scan will be rescheduled if at all possible. Participants who do not complete 6/7 days each of the 3 weeks of sleep/actigraphy monitored will not receive any compensation for this task. Participants will not be compensated if they do not complete the entire battery of assessments for the 1-month follow-up. This includes returning the Penn State Worry Questionnaire. 5.

The following is a list of specific aims and hypotheses to be tested: AIM 1: Test target engagement (parietal cortex) activation following TBS. H 1: TBS will be associated with a relative decrease in BOLD signal in the parietal cortex, during a worry-induction fMRI task. H 2: TBS will be associated with a relative decrease in worry-rest rSPG-dACC functional connectivity. 2. * Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge including preliminary data. Provide for the scientific or scholarly background for, rationale for, and significance of the research based on existing literature and how it will add to existing knowledge: Twenty percent of older adults in the community report severe worry. While worry is a universal human experience, severe and excessive worry in older adults has been recently linked to increased risk of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, increased risk of conversion to Alzheimer’s disease as well as to higher risk of all- cause mortality. As worry is a transdiagnostic construct, it is present in several mood and anxiety disorders, including major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Current treatment choices in late-life (antidepressant/anxiolytic medications and psychotherapeutic interventions) have been proven moderately ef ficacious in reducing anxiety/depression burden, but ineffective in reducing worry severity, a phenomenon that may contribute to the high relapse rates associated with mood and anxiety disorders in the geriatric population. These elements support the need for novel, experimental interventions specifically designed to target the neural basis of severe worry in late-life. In our current research (R01 MH108509) we focus on describing the behavior of canonical neural networks during resting state and during worry induction in participants with low-to-high worry. Our research indicates that simple induction of worry activates a distinct set of regions (caudate/thalamus, visual cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate). Given the universality and potential evolutionary benefits of worry, we believe that the neural network associated with worry induction supports a normal, physiologic experience. However, the regions involved in maintaining worry (hippocampus, thalamus) as well as those associated with severe worry (orbitofrontal cortex, superior parietal gyrus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus) support a pathological phenomenon and may represent ideal targets for interventions. In this pilot proposal we intend to test the engagement of therapeutic targets during TBS. Based on our preliminary results, the most accessible and relevant target is the parietal cortex – a region that in our K 23 sample remained significantly associated with severe worry after controlling for effects of comorbid depression or overall anxiety. As parietal cortex cerebrovascular flow increased in association with worry severity, we propose to use inhibitory TBS [high frequency TMS at 1 Hz] to modulate cortical plasticity and consequently reduce worry severity . To test target engagement, we will use the in-scanner worry induction paradigm designed by Dr . Andreescu and her mentors during her K23 award and currently use to probe worry"

Given the exploratory nature of this proposal and based on our preliminary data, we will use two measures of target engagement: 1) the relative decrease in BOLD signal in the parietal cortex and 2) the relative decrease in rSPG-dACC functional connectivity. The reasons why this research is significant is as follows: 1. Severe worry in late-life carries a significant health care risk. Worry is defined as a complex affective and cognitive process, negative-affect laden, and relatively uncontrollable [6]. While worry is a universal human experience that may confer an evolutionary advantage by modifying threat-related decision- making, severe and excessive worry has been recently linked to increased risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease [7], and with increased risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events, after controlling for depression and vascular risk factors. Severe worry is also associated with interruption in functioning and reduced quality of life and with a higher risk of all- cause mortality in midlife and late-life. 2. Severe worry in late-life responds poorly to traditional interventions. Traditionally, severe worry has been confined to categories such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), multiple lines of research support the presence of severe worry in several other anxiety and mood disorders. Thus, while GAD is built around the concept of severe, uncontrollable worry, only 20% of severe older worriers qualify for a GAD diagnosis. This evidence supports a major recent shift in the conceptualization of worry as a transdiagnostic entity most suitable for dimensional investigations. Current late-life GAD treatment choices, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant pharmacotherapy, have proven moderately efficacious in reducing overall burden of anxiety but ineffective in reducing worry severity. The ineffectiveness of current treatments in reducing worry severity may be at the root of the chronic, relapsing course of late-life GAD, which is one of the least likely mental disorders to remit and most likely to relapse. 3. Novel circuit-based targets for intervention. Several neuroimaging studies have investigated both activation and functional connectivity among various brain regions involved in GAD – in adolescents and young adults. Our team has published exclusively on the neural markers of GAD in older adult participants. Also, very few studies used fMRI paradigms specifically tailored to induce worry or analyzed specifically the effect of worry severity at rest or during task. Our current results point toward two different networks that may benefit from targeted interventions: the one associated exclusively with severe worry (amygdala-parahippocampus- rOFC- rSPG) and the one associated with maintenance/the protracted quality of worry (insula-caudate/thalamus-amygdala- parahippocampus). We decided to target in this application the network associated with worry severity due to both the richer literature regarding the pernicious effect of severe worry on both public health and treatment response but also due to accessibility for TMS of the rSPG. Overall, the worry severity network seems to implicate excessive limbic/paralimbic activation potentially amplified by the cognitive anticipation of the negative affective value of future events processed through the OFC as well as probable attempts to cognitively control the arousal and dysphoria through structures such as dACC and SPG. This speculation is in line with newer interpretations of pathologic worry that suggest severe worriers both maintain"

The secondary endpoints include the removal of a participant from the study for the following reasons: The investigators may remove someone from the study if we discover that s/he no longer meets study eligibility (e.g., has a surgery involving a metallic implant), for non-compliance with the study protocol, or if the study is not believed to be in her/his best interest. 4. Provide a description of the following study timelines: Duration of an individual subject's active participation: up to 5 weeks Duration anticipated to enroll all subjects: We anticipate it will take 3 years to complete enrollment of all subjects. Estimated date for the investigator to complete this study (complete primary analyses): 12/31/2021 5. List the inclusion criteria: Participants must have completed Dr. Andreescu's study R01MH108509/STUDY19050150. Penn State Worry Questionnaire score of 55 or above. 6. List the exclusion criteria: 1) Any form of psychosis or Bipolar Disorder, dementia, or a history of substance abuse within the last six months 2) Use of antidepressants within the last five to fourteen days (adequate washout interval to be determined by the PI based on each specific antidepressant). For fluoxetine, the washout interval will be six weeks. However, for participants who are prescribed low dose psychotropics for pain, sleep disturbances, and/or medical conditions (e.g. amitriptyline for peripheral neuropathy, low dose trazodone as a sleep aid), these will be allowed in most circumstances. We will include participants on certain dosages of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants (for medical reasons) as follows: amitriptyline up to 50 mg/d, doxepin up to 50 mg/d, trazodone up to 100 mg/d, and imipramine up to 50 mg/d.

Analysis of Structural MRI We will collect measures of gray matter volume (MPRAGE), WMH load (T2- weighted FLAIR), and white matter micro-structural integrity (DTI). These structural measures will be extracted using methods developed and validated by the Co-I Dr . Aizenstein to take into account the variability of elderly brain images.

Regional WMH volumes: The automated WMH segmentation method developed by the Co-I Dr . Aizenstein is an iterative algorithm that automatically selects ‘seeds’ of WMH lesions and applies fuzzy connectedness to segment WMH lesions around the seeds (8). Using an automated method, the segmented WMH voxels are localized to the different white matter tracts defined on the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) White Matter Atlas (9). The WMH matter extraction algorithm has been shared with the neuroimaging community through our website (http://www.gpn.pitt.edu), where it can be requested for download. The same atlas used for localizing the WMH volumes is also used for generating tract-specific DTI measures. The DTI data is first pre- processed using tract-based spatial statistics. DTI summary measures are then generated using a 4-tissue class model, which treats normal appearing white matter as distinct from WMH. The other 2 classes (gray matter and CSF) are included to ensure accurate segmentation, but are not part of the planned analyses for this study. The global WMH burden and FA will be included as primary variables in Aim 3. As described above, we will also extract regional DTI and WMH measures for all white matter tracts. Secondary analyses will explore the role of tract-specific white matter alterations in tracts associated with emotion regulation (e.g. uncinate fasciculus, cingulum bundle). Analysis of functional MRI Our primary analyses of the BOLD-contrast fMRI dataset will follow an ROI approach that has been optimized by our group for analyzing fMRI in the elderly . We will also perform full-brain voxelwise secondary analyses. All standard processing steps are done in SPM8 [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk /spm/ software/ spm8]. Additional custom software for alignment of elderly brain MRI’s will also be used. Preprocessing. (1) Functional images for both rest and task are realigned using a two-pass procedure to correct for head movement; (2) Each subject’ s T1 weighted structural image is co-registered across the sessions to the mean realigned EPI; (3) The T1-weighted volume is then segmented to generate a non-linear deformation mapping from native to MNI space; (4) EPI are then normalized to the ICBM MNI template using the non-linear deformation field; (5) Normalized functional images are then smoothed by using a 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel to reduce spatial noise and accommodate inter-subject anatomical variability. All preprocessing output files are then inspected to verify that all steps worked. Residual head motion and related global signal fluctuations are then estimated and the outlier time points saved for use in the first-level model as nuisance variables using the Artifact Detection T ool (ART) to detect and adjust for motion outliers in the fMRI time series data [http://www.nitrc.org/projects/artifact_detect/]. Our group has shown how, by using highly deformable registrations, we can get accurate segmentation and reduce T ype 1 error in fMRI studies of elderly participants. Level One Analyses for Resting State: Resting BOLD time series will be de-trended, de-spiked, mean-centered and adjusted for the confounding covariance due to hemodynamic response, movement and physiological noise. The hemodynamic response will be modeled by the SPM default canonical hemodynamic response function and its derivative. The movement parameters from realignment are used as the movement regressors. The physiological noise will be modeled using the component base model (10) with 5 principal components of the BOLD time series from a white matter mask and 3 principal components from a CSF mask. The masks are constructed using the SPM MNI template of 95% and 75% probability map for white matter and CSF respectively; they are further eroded to avoid the partial volume ef fect. The adjusted time series are then band-pass filtered to the resting state frequency domain, ranging from 0.01 to 0.1HZ. For the functional connectivity analyses we will use the primary eigenvariate of the time-series extracted from the anatomic ROI using REX"
21,page_21,"2/11/22, 10:48 AM Print: STUDY19020109 - TINA https://www.pittpro.pitt.edu/pittpro/sd/ResourceAdministration/Project/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity.Entity%5BOID%5BD27056B30D6913469 … 22/63(http://web.mit.edu/swg/ rex/rex.pdf). This method extracts the time series that explains the maximum variance of all the time-series in the ROI (12). The eigenvariate time-series for each ROI will be correlated (Pearson correlation) with the eigenvariate time-series for the corresponding seed for each network-of-interest. The correlations will be transformed to Fisher Z statistics for group analysis. In addition, functional connectivity map for each seed and subject will also be generated by using the general linear model (GLM) with the seed time-series as independent variable and the movement parameters generated in the realignment as nuisance variables for exploration analysis. Level Two Analyses for Resting State: The resulting connectivity measures (Fisher Z transform of the Pearson correlation) will be exported to R [http://www.r-project.org], where statistical analyses will be conducted to test the association of each of these measures with the identified clinical factors. For the exploratory whole brain seed-to-voxel analysis, the functional connectivity maps will be analyzed across individuals using second-level design matrices. Level One Analyses for the Worry Regulation Task: The BOLD- contrast time-series images will first be filtered with a high pass filter of 128 sec. Condition effects for the worry regulation task will be determined in SPM8 for each subject using contrasts analysis (e.g., ‘worry induction > rest’) employed in the GLM framework. Specifically, the hemodynamic response of each condition will be modeled by a boxcar function convolved with the SPM canonical HRF with time delay as covariate to allow for increased variability in HRF with age. The movement parameters will be included in the GLM as nuisance variables. The GLM, which contains regressors of hemodynamic response for each task and the movement parameters, will be solved using robust regression to minimize the ef fect of outliers. The contrast maps representing the effects of tasks on the BOLD-contrast signal compared with that at baseline will be generated and tested in level two analyses. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses will be used to test Aims 2-3. These analyses enable us to examine the degree to which the worry regulation conditions (induction/ reappraisal/ reappraisal+acceptance) affect the temporal covariation of the BOLD signal between the ROIs in the SN and ECN. For PPI analyses, we will use as seed regions the RAI and the right dlPFC. The RAI seed is extracted from the right insula cortex defined in the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas in the WFU Pick-Atlas (11). From the insular cortex, we extract the right AI cortex (landmarked anterior of the central insular sulcus) using ITK165. The right dlPFC is defined as the right Brodmann area (BA) 46 in the Talairach Daemon database from the WFU Pick-Atlas (11). Each seed time-series is extracted from the first principal component of BOLD signal in all voxels within the RAI and within the right dlPFC seed. Next, each seed time-series is mean-centered and submitted to a deconvolution algorithm using the canonical SPM8 HRF. Following deconvolution, an interaction vector is created, representing the product of the deconvolved BOLD signal time-series and a vector coding for task condition. The interaction vector is subsequently re-convolved with the SPM8 HRF, creating a PPI vector. Finally, all three vectors, corresponding to the PPI task-by-seed activity term, the seed activity , and the HRF convolved task vectors are entered as regressors in an individual GLM design matrix wherein one PPI GLM is executed for each participant and seed region. Individual GLMs are then estimated, and the contrast maps, which represent the modulation effect of worry regulation on connectivity (PPI map), are generated for Level 2 analysis. Second Level Functional Connectivity Analyses for the W orry Regulation Task: As a result of first level analysis, the PPI maps generated for each individual identify regions exhibiting greater functional connectivity with the RAI in the worry induction as compared with the rest condition, and with the RAI and the dlPFC in the worry reappraisal as compared to the rest. Individual PPI maps are then entered into regression analyses, wherein we test the association of task-"

This description of activities should be complete and of sufficient detail to permit an assessment of associated risks. Screening Procedures We plan to recruit up to forty participants with moderate and severe worry (e.g. Penn State Worry Questionnaire of 55 or higher) from the current R01 MH108509 with the goal of thirty participants completing the study. The Penn State Worry Questionnaire will be re-administered at the screening visit to ensure that participants still meet this criterion. Prior to the screening visit, a phone screen that includes MRI safety screening questions will be administered. This will be done to assess the possibility of any new implants since their participation in R01 MH108509. Should the participant have any history of surgeries involving implants, following consent, we will obtain a copy of any medical records related to the procedure/s to confirm whether he/she may safety complete the MRI scans. For participants with a questionable history of MRI-incompatible metallic fragments, an X-ray of the suspected body area will be performed to rule out such possibility . The day of the MRI scan, women of child bearing potential will be asked to complete a pregnancy test. All participants will undergo a secondary MR safety screen administered by MRRC personnel. Clinical Assessments The following measures will be administered both before and after the TMS intervention: 1) Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)* 2) Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 3) Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) *The Penn State Worry Questionnaire may be collected using Pitt RedCap software. Sleep and Physical Activity Monitoring As an optional component of the study, participants will be asked to complete a sleep diary and possibly wear an actigraphy monitor, depending on availability of the actiwatch, for at least 4 days prior to and throughout the TMS intervention. This is to determine their in-and-out of bed times, sleep onset, wake times, and how these may change during the TMS intervention. Since the sleep and activity monitoring occurs in conjunction with the TMS intervention, this may require the participant to come in for an additional visit, at least 4 days prior to the beginning of the TMS intervention, to collect the actiwatch and sleep diary. In this circumstance, the participant would be reimbursed an additional $10 for travel. The actiwatch and sleep diary can also be sent to the participant by mail.

Accounting for set-up time and possible technical issues, participants will be informed that visits may last up to 45 minutes, but on average will take about 20 minutes. MRI scan The MRI scan will take place within 2 weeks of completion of the TMS sessions and will last approximately 1 hour. Scanning will be conducted on a 3 Tesla Siemens PRISMA scanner located in the MR Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh, using a 32-channel head coil (the same scanner and coil that is used for the current R01 study). We will gather functional MRI data (during rest and task) and structural MRI data including gray-matter volumetric estimates from T1-weighted images, white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH) estimated from T2-FLAIR images and white matter microstructure integrity estimates from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Functional MRI: The fMRI acquisition includes a 10-minute resting state acquisition (eyes open) followed by the worry induction task. We have chosen to use a 10-min acquisition as recent data has showed that the reliability is improved by increasing the scan length from 5 to 10 minutes. T2*-weighted BOLD-contrast functional image acquisition will use multiband (acceleration of 3) gradient-echo echoplanar imaging (EPI): TR/TE = 1800ms/30ms, Matrix= 96x96 with 60 slices, Voxel size = 2.5x2.5x2.5 mm3, parallel to AC-PC. The most inferior functional scan will be inferior to the most inferior aspect of the temporal lobes. Note regarding psychotropic medications: In most cases, participants will be required to be medication free at the time of scanning (e.g., antianxiety and antidepressant medications). However , participants will be allowed to continue taking low doses of psychoactive medications when used to treat medical conditions, pain, and sleep disturbances. The dose range for the most common antidepressants that are prescribed for medical reasons are as follows: amitriptyline up to 50 mg/d, doxepin up to 50 mg/d, trazodone up to 100 mg/d, and imipramine up to 50 mg/d. As for other medications, each case will be reviewed individually and the PI will decide if the participants are eligible for the study and if they may continue the current medication. Participants will be required to be medication free at the time of scanning (e.g., antianxiety and antidepressant medications). Participants will be asked to refrain from benzodiazepines 48 hours prior to the MRI. We will review participants' lists of medications at their clinical visit and will inform them whether it will be necessary for them to refrain from any of their usual medications. Participants will be told (as per the consent form) that they may decide that they do not wish to refrain from taking such medications prior to their scan. If so, they will be considered ineligible for the study. Participants on high doses of benzodiazepines (e.g., greater than or equivalent to 2 mg of lorazepam) will be excluded, given the complexity and potential complications of benzodiazepine taper/withdrawal. Individuals who are needing to refrain from benzodiazepines 48 hours prior to the MRI will be given a taper plan by a physician investigator. At this time, participants will additionally be provided with a phone number (our 24-hour participant line) to call if they experience any concerns or difficulties during the taper process. Additionally, the day prior to the MRI scan, research staff will contact the participant to ensure that the taper is well tolerated. Participants will be told that they may resume taking their medication at any time. Research staff will again follow-up with participants the day of the scheduled scan (Monday if scheduled scan was a Friday).

Participants who have decompensated and are requiring further treatment/monitoring will be advised to follow-up with their prescribing doctor . Until it is determined that the participant has returned to their normal state and/or is under the care of another provider, follow-up calls will be made by research staff. Transportation Participants may be offered transportation to and from all visits via Corporate Sedan/VauxCo Limousines or a taxi service. Subject name and address will be given to the driver, but no description of the research study will be made available. Due to high cost of these transportation services, whether transportation services are offered will be evaluated on a case by case basis. Participants who will be offered transportation will be those who are unable to afford transportation to and from Oakland for all of their study visits or when other transportation dif ficulties arise (i.e. no bus service available in their area, their usual vehicle breaks down). Follow-up Procedures A follow-up call will be made the day following the MRI scan (Monday for scans occurring on a Friday) for participants needing to taper off medications. Additionally, a follow-up call will be made 1 month following their last TMS session. The 1-month follow-up call will include a general assessment of well-being and potential adverse reactions, along with over the phone administration of the HARS and MADRS. Research staff will send a copy of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire either via a link using Pitt RedCap or mail (including a postage-paid envelope) for the participant to complete and return.

Consent will be obtained after performing certain screening procedures, but prior to performing any of the research interventions/interactions. If the consent process occurs via videoconferencing, we will use Pitt REDCap software to capture an electronic signature, or the consent form will be sent to the potential subject by the study team via U.S. mail or email, depending on the participant's preference and ability to print the form, prior to the scheduled video-call. The consent form will then be discussed with the potential subject during the video-call prior to signing consent. If consent needs to be completed electronically through REDCap, the participant will sign using either a touchpad, computer mouse, or touchscreen. Although REDCap has features that are consistent with 21 CFR 11, it has not been validated for compliance with 21 CFR 11. If the participant signs the physical consent form sent via mail or email, they will be asked to send the staff member an email of a photo or scanned copy of the last page of the consent form as documentation of signed consent. The participant would then return the consent form either by mail using a postage-paid envelope provided by the study team, or they would return it at their in-person visit. The screening questionnaire will allow the investigators to determine the potential subject's eligibility as well as his or her safety in undergoing an MRI scan (e.g. metal in body). Conducting this interview with brief screening would reduce participant burden by eliminating an extra visit to the research site should they not be eligible to participate. The screening script will include obtaining verbal consent prior to asking the screening questions. 2. * Describe the steps that will be taken to minimize coercion and undue influence, including assurance that there is sufficient time for subjects to make an informed decision: A physician investigator who is also a co-investigator will review the consent form with the participant. This will occur either in person, via phone call, or via videoconference. The purpose of the research study, the procedures involved in the conduct of the study, potential risks and benefits, and the rights of study participants will be discussed with the potential subject prior to the attainment of written informed consent. Participants will be allowed as much time as they need to consider participation after the consent form is reviewed. They will be encouraged to voice any questions or concerns at that time, prior to signing the consent form. Participants will be able to ask the physician investigator clarifying questions either in person, or via phone call, prior to signing the consent form. Subjects will be provided with a clear explanation of the objectives, procedures, risks and benefits of the study and all questions will be answered. A Physician Investigator of the study will then obtain consent.

If the physician investigator conducts the consent process via phone call or videoconferencing, he or she will sign the consent form retroactively once available to do so. 3. For studies that involve multiple visits, describe the process to ensure ongoing consent: We believe that consent is an ongoing process in any study, and we will continue to educate subjects about the nature of the research and address any questions that may arise throughout the course of the study. In cases where the need to re-consent participants arises, we will either re-consent participants at their next visit or we will re-consent virtually prior to their next visit through the videoconferencing methods as detailed above (#1). New procedures will not be implemented until the new consent form is signed. A study team member will review all listed changes with the participant, highlighting the dif ferences between the version the participant originally signed and the new version of the consent form. Participants will be presented with the option of withdrawing from the study if the participant is not in agreement with the new information.. A listed physician investigator will sign consent for changes related to risk or to procedures that would normally require physician involvement outside the research context. 4. * Steps to be taken to ensure the subjects’ understanding: During the consent process, questions will be asked of subjects to ensure they understand the nature of the research, the risks and potential benefits of participation, and their rights as research subjects. 5. * Are you requesting an exception to the IRB policy related to the informed consent process: Yes No"

We believe we meet the following criteria: The respective research procedures present no more than minimal risk of harm to the involved participants and involve no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. We believe the information being obtained is the same type of information that would be collected on patients setting up an appointment for their condition. 2. * Select the regulatory criteria applicable to your request: 45 CFR 46.117(c)(1) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern. 45 CFR 46.117(c)(2) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context 45 CFR 46.117(c)(3) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm.* Address why the specific research procedures for which you are requesting a waiver of the requirement to obtain a signed consent form presents no more than minimal risk of harm to the research subjects: The screening questions present no more than minimal risk of harm to the involved participants and involve no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. The information being obtained is the same type of information being collected on patients setting up an appointment for their anxiety. In addition, written informed consent will be obtained at the screening visit prior to any research activities.* Justify why the research involves no procedures for which written informed consent is normally required outside of the research context: The screening document will act as documentation of verbal consent for the screening interview. We will first read the screening script followed by (with permission from the participant) the screening questions.

Only the medical records necessary to determine MRI eligibility will be reviewed, this includes surgical reports from surgeries involving implantable devices and/or any imaging reports to look for metallic objects and/or see if the individual has safely completed past MRIs. Temporary storage of the medical records will take place until the individual’s enrollment status is confirmed. The identifiers will be securely stored in locked file cabinets. Access is strictly limited to study team members involved in determining eligibility; the records will not be used or disclosed for any other purpose. We will do everything possible to protect the identity of research participants. Review of medical records will only be performed by study team members who are confirming eligibility and ability to safely undergo an MRI. Only the medical records necessary to determine MRI eligibility will be reviewed. Identifiable medical records will be stored separately from the research records. 2. * Describe your plan to destroy the identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent with conduct of the research, unless there is a health or research justification for retaining the identifiers or such retention is otherwise required by the law: The investigators may continue to use and disclose, for the purposes described above, identifiable information, including identifiable medical information, related to this research for at least seven years. The University of Pittsburgh policy for the retention of research records and/or data is seven years after the final reporting or publication of the study. Identifiers will be destroyed after that. If the individual does not go on to sign consent to the study, the medical records will immediately be destroyed. 3. * Describe written assurances that the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required by law, for authorized oversight of the research project, or for other research for which the use or disclosure of PHI would be permitted by this subpart: Use and disclosure of medical records will be limited to those listed on the front page of the consent form and their research staff, authorized representatives of the University of Pittsburgh Office of Research Protections, and authorized representatives of the UPMC hospitals for the purpose of fulfilling orders made by investigators, addressing correct payment for tests and procedures ordered by investigators, and/or internal hospital operations (i.e. quality assurance).

The study investigators do not have clinical access to these medical records; therefore, the waiver/alteration is necessary to review the records for screening after the participant provides their verbal agreement, but before written consent can be obtained. 5. * Indicate why the research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of the PHI: Access and use of PHI through the review of medical records for UPMC participants with implantable devices and metal in the body is a necessary part of the recruitment and screening procedures to determine if the participant can safely undergo an MRI. Screening cannot practicably be conducted without access to this PHI. 6. * Explain why the nature and amount of the medical record information to be collected is felt to be the minimum necessary to conduct this research study: Only surgical reports from surgeries involving implantable devices and/or any imaging reports to look for metallic objects and/or see if the individual has safely completed past MRIs will be reviewed.

We will not be placing any information in participants' medical records. We may also access medical histories to confirm that participants are eligible to safely participate. Medical record review will only take place following consent. 2. * Describe what protected health information will be obtained from a non- UPMC/Pitt covered entity for research purposes and how the HIPAA requirements will be met: For participants that have had surgeries involving implants outside of the UPMC system, we will ask participants to sign a release of information form. W e will then request paper copies of medical records from the facility that performed the surgery . The paper copies will be kept separately from the research data, since records will contain identifiers.

The plan might include establishing a data monitoring committee and a plan for reporting data monitoring committee findings to the IRB and the sponsor: We will monitor accrual and any changes in the risk-to-benefit considerations of the study. A regular review of accrued data will be done to ensure the validity and integrity of the data and also to ensure that there is no change to the benefit-to-risk ratio of the study. All consents and assessment forms undergo a rigorous quality- assurance review. In addition, an ongoing review of study procedures will be done to ensure that the privacy of subjects and confidentiality of data is not violated. There will also be adequate provisions for monitoring the collected data to ensure the safety of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of the research data. The PI and the clinical evaluators associated with the study will be responsible for these reviews during weekly research meetings in which each participant is discussed throughout the longitudinal course of their participation in the protocol. In addition subjects are not always compliant with the procedures despite the researchers’ best efforts. We will report annually the deviations in completing research assessments related to subject safety. Any internal adverse events involving fatal or life- threatening circumstances, though none are anticipated, will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of learning of the event. If only incomplete information is available, the IRB will, at a minimum, be notified of the adverse event during this time frame, with subsequent follow-up submission of a more detailed written report. All other internal Adverse Events meeting University of Pittsburgh reporting guidelines will be submitted to the IRB within 10 working days of the investigator learning of the event. Any external adverse events which are unexpected, serious, and suggest that the research places subjects or others at greater risk than was previously recognized, and related to the research intervention will be reported to the IRB within 30 working days of the investigator learning of the situation. Study procedures will comply with IRB policies for reporting of serious and unexpected adverse events. 2. * Describe your plan for sharing data and/or specimens: We may share de-identified information with other investigators in order to answer new research questions. If an individual has agreed (or does in the future) to participate in other studies, we will also share collected information between these studies. Each study would have already collected identifying information from the individual. Sharing information avoids duplication of certain interviews and tests, and it also provides new knowledge and allows us to answer new research questions. We may share identifiable information with authorized representatives of UPMC (including the University of Pittsburgh Office of Research Protections) for the purpose of oversight of the research study or for services they provide to the research team. Additionally, identifiable information (which may include identifiable medical information) may be shared with authorized representatives of the UPMC hospitals or other affiliated health care providers (such as MRRC technicians) for the purpose of (1) fulfilling orders, made by the investigator, for hospital and health care services (e.g., laboratory tests, diagnostic procedures) associated with research study participation; (2) addressing correct payment for tests and procedures ordered by the investigator; and/or (3) for internal hospital operations (i.e. quality assurance)."

For comparison, this is a small fraction (about 1-2 %) of the annual radiation exposure (20 rems) permitted to the most sensitive organs of radiation workers by federal regulations. There is no minimal level of radiation exposure that is recognized as being totally free of the risk of causing genetic mutations (abnormal cells) or cancer.

They will be further trained and periodically observed to ensure that they are respectful and sensitive to the needs and feelings of the subjects. Furthermore, they are trained to recognize signs of significant stress or irritability and will be instructed that they should gently terminate the interview whenever distress is observed. Risks associated with MR imaging include claustrophobia, ringing in the ears, and the magnetic field which can attract ferromagnetic objects toward the magnet. Care will be taken to minimize distress due to claustrophobia by thoroughly training all project staff who come in contact with subjects, to ensure that they are sensitive to a subject’s distress and will be capable of dealing with them in a courteous manner. In addition, subjects will be screened for potential contraindications for MR scanning, including metal in their body and claustrophobia, and will be excluded from the study when appropriate. Trained MR technologists will complete a thorough secondary safety screen about medical history to insure there is no metal in the participant's body that could potentially be attracted by the scanner. The presence of such metal is exclusionary. All subjects are required to wear ear plugs in the scanner to protect their hearing. Despite all preparation, some subjects experience discomfort associated with confinement and remaining stationary for a long period of time. Testing or scanning of any subject who becomes distressed will be terminated immediately. To monitor for any potential side effect of TMS each participant will be interviewed at the beginning and at the end of the TMS protocol to assess for possible side ef fects. The risk of seizures is minimized by the low frequency TMS used in this study (there are no documented seizures in individuals undergoing the TMS protocol in this study). We will have participants wear an earplug in their right ear that will greatly attenuate the click sound generated from the discharge of the TMS coil. W e will also provide the participants the option to place gauze between their teeth to prevent teeth rattling and discomfort caused by TMS activation of jaw muscles. Furthermore, participants will also be asked to notify at any time during the assessment whether they experience any discomfort. All the most commonly reported side ef fects related to TMS tend to occur during the stimulation or immediately afterwards. V ery infrequently, some subjects have experienced a delayed onset headache due to the activation of superficial scalp muscles from the TMS coil. To address this issue, we will notify participants during the TMS protocol of this possibility and instruct them to take an analgesic if the pain were not to subside. Participants will be instructed to place ice on their scalp in the case prolonged scalp discomfort. Additionally, there have been no reported significant side effects resulting from TMS since safety guidelines have been initially introduced in 1998[1], and then again updated in 2008[2]. Our study will perform TMS well within the safety guidelines, and the Co-I leading the TMS aspect of this study (Fabio Ferrarelli) has more than a decade long experience with this technique, and has used it in the past in studies involving both healthy subjects [3-5] and patients with schizophrenia[6, 7]. As far as participants who are tapering off of benzodiazepine medication, the risk to participants will be minimized as the taper plan will be supervised by a physician and our staff will be following up with participants throughout the process. Participants will also be able to contact us at any time with concerns through our 24- hour participant line."

Financial risks - will the subject or insurer be charged for any research required procedures? Yes No 4. Describe the steps that will be taken to protect subjects’ privacy: Research interventions will be completed in private suites and of fices. No unneeded sensitive information will be collected, except that which is necessary to achieve the aims of the research study. The experimental procedures including during the MRI occur at the MR research center which is specifically equipped for research studies in order to maintain the confidentiality of subjects. Participants are provided with a locked, private room in which they can change their clothing and store their belongings in individually padlocked lockers. 5. What steps will be taken in the event that a clinically significant, unexpected disease or condition is identified during the conduct of the study: Participants will be made aware of any unexpected events or conditions and appropriate referrals will be facilitated (either to PCP or other healthcare professional). Appropriate clinical follow-up will be made in the event that a clinically significant, unexpected disease or condition is identified during the conduct of the research study. In addition, participants who experience clinical deterioration or unexpected clinically significant psychiatric symptoms will be referred to the appropriate level of care (inpatient or outpatient). Participants will be informed that the brain imaging scan used for this study is tailored for research purposes and should not be viewed as a clinical evaluation. If at the time of the scan the MRRC technologist detects a potential incidental finding, the MRRC Medical Director will be contacted immediately. The images will then be reviewed by a neuroradiologist in the Neuroradiology Reading Room. An investigator will share verbally results/impressions deemed clinically significant with the participant and a clinical follow-up referral will be provided as appropriate. If there is no provider, participants will be advised to seek a provider. Images will be sent to the participant's doctor with the written request of the participant (using a HIPAA authorization request). Participants (or their insurance) will be responsible for all costs related to referrals for care for any incidental findings discovered during the course of this study . 6. Describe the potential benefit that individual subjects may experience from taking part in the research or indicate if there is no direct benefit. Do not include benefits to society or others: Participants in this study are subjects with severe worry. We anticipate a decrease in the level of experienced worry following TMS. There are however no known benefits of the TMS protocol at this time regarding reducing severity of worry . Participants will be informed in writing that there are no guarantees that they will benefit from study procedures. However, the potential benefits of participation in this study include receiving TMS that could be beneficial. Additionally, participants may derive benefits from the psychiatric evaluations by having the opportunity to talk about personal"

Finally, participation in the proposed research may help inform and improve the development of novel treatment strategies that could ultimately benefit patients, including the participants themselves. 7. Do you anticipate any circumstances under which subjects might be withdrawn from the research without their consent? Yes No * Describe the circumstances and any procedures for orderly termination: A participant may be removed from the research study at any time by the investigators if we discover that they do not meet study eligibility requirements, if they are unable to complete study procedures according to schedule, or if the study is not believed to be in their best interest. 8. Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, including partial withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection and data already collected: Any identifiable research or medical information which is recorded, which results from subject participation in this research study prior to the date that subject formally withdrew consent may continue to be used and disclosed by investigators."

Common Risks: If an x-ray is necessary, this will involve exposure to radiation. The maximum amount of radiation exposure that you would receive from the additional X-ray exam is approximately 0.3 rem (a unit of radiation exposure) to the area of the body evaluated with minimal exposure of other areas of your body. For comparison, this is a small fraction (about 1-2 %) of the annual radiation exposure (20 rems) permitted to the most sensitive organs of radiation workers by federal regulations. There is no minimal level of radiation exposure that is recognized as being totally free of the risk of causing genetic mutations (abnormal cells) or cancer. However, the risk associated with the amount of radiation exposure that you will receive from this additional X-ray exam is considered to be low and comparable to everyday risks. 3.
