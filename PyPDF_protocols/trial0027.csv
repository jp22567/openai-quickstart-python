The HRQOL of parents/caregivers will also be assessed. Study Objectives: Primary:  To assess proxy- and self-reported disease-specific HRQOL of peanut-allergic subjects aged 4 to 17 years, inclusive, receiving AR 101 in combination with standard of care versus standard of care alone for approximately 18 months Secondary:  Safety and tolerability of AR101 To characterize changes over the cour se of the study in the following:  Disease-specific HRQOL of parents/caregivers  Relationship between clinical efficacy of AR101 (change in level of sensitization to peanut allergen) and HRQOL of subjects and parents/caregivers Exploratory: To assess the following:  Self-reported assessments of control and confidence; reassurance, worry, an d severity of allergic reactions based on food challenge outcomes; and overall HRQOL  Changes in nondisease-specific measures of HR QOL, anxiety, and depression in subjects and parents/caregivers  Health state utility estimates for economic analysis  Changes in peanut skin prick test (SPT) mean wheal diameters associated with AR101 treatment  Changes in control of pre-existing concomitant atopic disease (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis)  Relationship between basophil activation, clini cal efficacy of AR101, and changes in HRQOL  AR101 treatment experience among subjects and parents/caregivers Study Design: This is a phase 3b, randomized, open-label, European study of the HRQOL of AR101 in combination with standard of care (AR101 herein) compared with standard of care alone in approximately 200 peanut-allergic subjects aged 4 to 17 years, inclusive. Standard of care includes avoidance of peanuts/peanut-containing foods, and education on recognition and management of allergy symptoms and appropriate use of rescue medications (eg, epinephrine auto-injectors). HRQOL of parents/caregivers will also be assessed. The safety and tolerability of AR101 will be evaluated. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned 2:1 to AR101 treatment or standard of care alone. Randomization will be stratified b y age group (4-12 years and 13-17 years).

Subjects receiving AR101 treatment will have 3 consecutive AR101 dosing periods before exiting (completing) the study: initial dose escalation, up-dosing, and maintenance. Subjects receiving standard of care alone will have approximately 18 months of observa tion before exiting (completing) the study. Subjects in both treatment groups will have a graded open-la bel food challenge (OLFC) up to a maximum single highest dose of 1000 mg of peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative), approximately 12 months after randomization. AR101 Treatment Group Initial dose escalation: Subjects randomly assigned to AR101 treatment will begin with a stepwise dose escalation of AR101 (up to 5 single doses of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, and 6 mg) administered at 20- to 30-minute intervals as tolerated at the study site.  Subjects who tolerate at least 3 mg of AR101 on day 1 will return to the study site on day 2 to receive a single confirmatory 3 mg dose under direct observation. Subjects who tolerate the 3 mg confirmatory dose with no or mild symptoms that are not dose-limiting will begin the up-dosing period.  Subjects who do not tolerate at least 3 mg of AR101 on day 1 or day 2 will stop AR101 treatment and discontinue early from the study. Up-dosing: The up-dosing period will be approximat ely 6 months (22-40 weeks). Dose escalation will occur approximately every 2 weeks. Daily AR101 doses during up-dosing will be 3, 6, 12, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, and 300 mg/d ay. The first dose of AR101 at each new dose level will be administered under direct observation at the study site; the remaining doses at each dose level will be administered daily at home as tolerated. Subjects able to tolerate 300 mg for 2 weeks will begin the maintenance period. Subjects unable to tolerate 300 mg/day for 2 weeks within 40 weeks of up-dosing will stop AR101 treatment and discontinue early from the study. Maintenance: Subjects will continue AR101 daily dosing at 300 mg/day for an additional 12 months (52 weeks) with study site visits every 4 weeks. After at least 6 months (up to 7 months) of maintenance treatment (approximately 12 months after randomizati on/first dose of AR101), subjects will have a graded OLFC up to a maximum single highest dose of 1000 mg of peanut protein (3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 600, 1000 mg [2043 mg cumulative]).  Subjects who tolerate 1000 mg of peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative) at the OLFC will continue AR101 daily at 300 mg/day and will have the option to consent for a real-world peanut challenge (RWPC) within 4 weeks (preferably within 1 week ) after the OLFC. During the RWPC, subjects will eat a food containing 500 to 600 mg of peanut protein under direct observation at the study site. Subjects who complete the RWPC (regardless of the outcome) will continue daily maintenance treatment with AR101 at 300 mg/day for a total of 52 weeks of maintenance until study exit.  Subjects who tolerate at least 300 mg but < 1000 mg of peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative) at the OLFC or tolerate 1000 mg of peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative) but do not consent to the optional RWPC will continue daily maintenance treatment with AR101 at 300 mg/day for a total of 52 weeks of maintenance until study exit.  Subjects who do not tolerate at least 300 mg of peanut protein at the OLFC will stop AR101 treatment and discontinue early from the study. Standard of Care Treatment Group Subjects receiving standard of care alone will have ap proximately 18 months of observation before study exit, with an OLFC approximately 12 months after randomization. Subjects receiving standard of care alone who complete the OLFC will not have an RWPC. Both Treatment Groups Early discontinuation: Subjects with unresolved adverse events at early discontinuation or who had gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events of interest will have sa fety follow-up. Subjects who discontinue AR101 treatment early before completing 9 months of maintenance, and their parents/caregivers, will complete relevant follow-up HRQOL questionnaires. Study exit: Subjects with unresolved adverse events at study exit or who had GI adverse events of interest will have safet y follow-up.

Statistical Methods: The statistical methods and data presentations for reportin g the study results will be described in detail in the statistical analysis plan. No in terim analyses are planned. Randomization will be central and treatment allocation will be 2:1 (AR101 treatment or standard of care alone). Randomization will be stratified by age group (4-12 years and 13-17 years). HRQOL Analyses: All HRQOL analyses will be performed using the intent-t o-treat (ITT) population unles s otherwise specified. The ITT population will be defined as all subjects wh o receive any part of 1 dose of study product and complete 1 study visit if assigned to AR101 treatment, or who complete 1 study visit after the screening visit if assigned to standard of care alone. The ITT population will be analyzed according to randomized treatment. No single endpoint is speci fied as primary because the study is no t designed or inte nded to support a labelling claim. The primary analysis will be on a family of proxy- and sel f-reported disease-specific HRQOL measures that assess HRQOL of the pe anut-allergic subject (FAQLQ-PF, FAQLQ-PFT, FAQLQ-CF, FAQLQ-TF, FAIM-PF, FAIM-PFT, FAIM-CF, and FAIM-TF). Data summaries will be presented across time and accompanied by inferential anal yses. Data will also be summarized separately by age group as appropriate for th e questionnaire evaluated. Analysis of Other Questionnaires: Details of the analyses for other questionnaires (EQ-5D, FAQL-PB, HADS, and TSQM-9) and bespoke questions (global assessment of HRQOL, assessment of control of peanut allergy and confidence in managing allergic reactions, assessment of experien ces related to food cha llenges, and assessment of experience and satisfaction with AR101 treatment at study exit) will be presented in the statistical analysis plan. Efficacy Analyses: All efficacy analyses will be performed using the IT T population unless otherwis e specified. Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment. The proportion of subjects tolerating a single dose of 300 mg (443 mg cumulative), 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative), and 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein with no or mild symptoms in the OLFC after approximately 12 months of study treatment w ill be compared between treatment groups using the Fisher exact test. Desensitization response rates and associated 95% CIs will be presented for each treatment group using exact Clopper-Pearson CIs. Additional efficacy endpoints include the following:  The maximum dose reached with no or mild symptoms at the OLFC, assessed by tabulating the number and percentage of subjects by maximum dose at the OLFC and by treatment group"

Safety data will be listed and summarized by treatment received. Descriptive statistics will be used. Safety data will be collected from signed informed co nsent/assent through early discontinuation or study exit, and through at least 30 days after early discontinuatio n or study exit for subjects with unresolved adverse events or through at least 6 months after early disc ontinuation or study exit for subjects with GI adverse events of interest. Adverse events will be classified by system organ class and coded to preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) . Adverse events will be classified by severity using the Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) grading system for allergic reactions, European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) guidelines for anaphylaxis, and National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Advers e Events (CTCAE) for all other adverse events. The safety of AR101 treatment versus standard of ca re alone will be evaluated by the analysis of the incidence of nonserious and serious adverse events, severity of adverse events, incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse events, incidence of dose modifications (AR101 treatment only), and incidence of early treatment discontinuation due to adverse events and due to chronic or recurrent GI adverse events. Separate summaries will be presented for anaphylaxis, allergic reaction adverse ev ents, use of epinephrine, and accidental and nonaccidental food allergen exposure. Summary sta tistics will be provided for the Asthma Control Test (ACT), lung function da ta, and laboratory data if relevant. Other Analyses: Additional endpoints to be assessed over the course of the study include the following:  Changes from baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Scor e (TNSS) scores in su bjects with pre-existing allergic rhinitis  Changes from baseline in scoring atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) scores in su bjects with pre-existing atopic dermatitis  Changes in peanut SPT mean wheal diameters Sample Size Considerations: This study will use multiple HRQOL questionnaires to assess changes across time in the HRQOL of subjects receiving AR101 treatment versus standard of care alone and their parents/caregivers. The sample size for this study is based on estimate s for the FAQLQ-PF. A sample size of 144 subjects randomly assigned in a ratio of 2:1 to AR101 treatment (96 subjects) or standard of care alone (48 subjects) provides at least 80% power to detect a treatment di fference of 0.75 in the ad justed mean total FAQLQ-PF scores at 18 months. The sample size calculation is based on an alpha of 0.05 and tests are assumed to be 2-sided. The common standard deviation is assumed to be 1.5. Approximately 25% of subjects are estimated to drop out or discontinue early from the study. Therefore, approximately 200 subjects (134, AR101 treatment; 67, standard of care alone) will be randomly assigned to study treatment."

AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 15 of 122 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Peanut allergy is a common and serious condition that disproportionately affects children and is associated with severe r eactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis. The prevalence of peanut allergy has been rising in the Western world and is esti mated to be approximately 2% to 3% in children ( Turner, 2017) ; the cumulative incidence of childhood peanut allergy in the United Kingdom is approximately 0.7% (Grimshaw, 2016 ). The current standard of care for the management of peanut allergy is peanut avoidance, and education of the patient and family on recognition and manage ment of allergy symptoms and appropriate use of rescue medications (eg, epinephr ine auto-injectors). Despite efforts at strict peanut avoidance, accidental exposure remains a major concern because allergic responses may be triggere d by minute quantities (milligrams) of peanut protein. Strict adherence to an avoidance diet can be complicat ed by difficulty in interpreting food labels ( Joshi, 2002), the presence of undeclared or hidden allergens in commercially prepared foods ( Vierk, 2002; Altschul, 2001), and inattention to or mistrust of food warning labels ( Vierk, 2007 ). Foods prepared outside the hom e (eg, at school, daycare centers, restaurants, homes of family/friends) presen t additional sources of accidental exposure. Accidental food allergen exposures are comm on, with 55% of peanut-allergic patients experiencing at least 1 allergic reaction over approximately 5 years ( Sicherer, 1998). The burden of avoidance and constant fear of accidental exposure can negatively affect the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for patie nts with peanut aller gy and their families (Anagnostou, 2014; Avery, 2003; Primeau, 2000 ). Early clinical studies of peanut oral immunot herapy (OIT) demonstrated promising safety and efficacy of this approach in peanut-allergic patients ( Anagnostou, 2014; Yu, 2012; Varshney, 2011 ; Blumchen, 2010 ; Hofmann, 2009 ; Jones, 2009 ). Each of these studies included an oral food challenge to evaluate desensitization after completion of a period of dosing with increasing amounts of peanut flour, pea nut protein, or whole crushed roasted peanuts, followed by a period of maintenan ce therapy, and showed that peanut OIT was generally well tolerated and coul d induce a clinically meaningful level of desensitization. Symptoms associated with peanut OIT in cluded rash, wheezing, rhinorrhea, sneezing, itching, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most symptoms were mild, consistent with a transient, low-grade allergic reaction, and tended to diminish in frequency with increasing duration of treatment. Additionally, studies suggest peanut OIT may induce favorable immunologic changes over time ( Wam bre, 2017; Kim, 2011 ; Varshney, 2011 ; Blumchen, 2010 ; Jones, 2009 ). The results of these studies and other experience with OIT in peanut and other common food allergies ( Beyer, 2012 ; Burks, 2012 ; Keet, 2012) provided the rationale for initial clinical development of AR101 ch aracterized oral desensitization immunotherapy (CODIT™) for subjects with peanut allergy. AR101 consists of peanut flour characterized for quantities of specifi c allergenic peanut proteins, and is formulated with bulking and flow agents in graduated doses. The goal of continuous treatment with AR101 is to induce and maintain a state of cl inically meaningful desensitization to peanut protein, defined as the ability to consume a minimum of 300 mg of"
16,page_16,"Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 16 of 122 peanut protein with no or mild symptoms. This state of desensitizati on is hypothesized to be sufficient to protect a peanut-a llergic patient in case of an accidental exposure to peanut despite maintaining a peanut-avoidant diet. Although threshold exposure levels for allergic reactions may vary within the peanut-all ergic population, a cro ss-study, retrospective analysis performed by the Voluntary Incident al Trace Allergen Labelling (VITAL) 2.0 study group ( Allen, 2014 ) found that 0.2 mg of peanut protein e licited an allergic reaction in 1% of peanut-allergic patients and 2.1 mg of peanut protein elicited an allerg ic reaction in 5% of peanut-allergic patients. In 1 well-documented case of accidental peanut ingestion, the amount ingested was calculated to be approximately 45 mg ( McKenna, 1997). More recently, an observational survey conducted in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg (MIRABEL study) estimated the am ount of food triggering an accidental allergic reaction in 238 peanut-allergic patients. The median estimated real-lif e eliciting dose was 125 mg (range , 34-177 mg) of peanut protein. The e liciting dose was < 5 mg of peanut protein in 0.9% of patients, 5 to < 50 mg in 34.1%, 50 to < 100 mg in 8.3%, and ≥ 100 mg in 56.7% ( Deschildre, 2016 ). Accordingly, desensitization to at least 300 mg of peanut protein is expected to provide a clinically meaningful level of protection against most accidental exposures to peanut. 1.2 Summary of Relevant Clinic al Experience With AR101 AR101 has been evaluated as a treatment for pe anut allergy in more than 1000 children and adults in 2 phase 2 studies (ARC001 and ARC002) and 6 phase 3 studies (ARC003, ARC004, ARC007, ARC008, ARC010, and ARC 011); most studies are ongoing. 1.2.1 Phase 2 Studies ARC001 and ARC002 ARC001 was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of AR101 in peanut-all ergic subjects aged 4 to 26 year s. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 55 subjects: 29 in the AR101 group and 26 in the placebo group. The 2 groups were well matched overall for baseline ch aracteristics, including baseline sensitivity in the screening double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Subjects began treatment with an initial dose-escalation phase on day 1 at 0.5 m g, dose-escalating up to 6 mg. Subjects tolerating at least 3 mg on day 1 began up-dosing on day 2 at their maximum tolerated dose (3 or 6 mg). Initial dose esca lation was discontinued in subjects who could not tolerate at least 3 mg of th e study product. Subjects then received AR101 or placebo daily for about 24 weeks, dose-escalating every 2 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 300 mg/day. Twenty-three of 29 AR101-treate d subjects (79%) re ached the target maintenance dose of 300 mg/day by the end of the up-dosing period and 6 subjects withdrew from the study before reaching the target dose. After a 2-week maintenance period at 300 mg/day, subjects had an exit DBPCFC w ith up to 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein or placebo (oat flour). All 23 AR101-treated subjects tolerated at least 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) of p eanut protein with no more than mild symptoms during the exit DBPCFC, compared with 5 of 26 subjects in the placebo group, resulting in a treatment difference of 60% (p < 0.0001 by Fisher exact te st). Further, 18 AR101-treated subjects (62%) tolerated 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein during the exit DBPCFC,"
17,page_17,"Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 17 of 122 compared with none in the placebo group, resu lting in a treatment difference of 62% (p < 0.0001 by Fisher exact test) ( Bird, 2018; AR101 investigator brochure). The open-label follow-on study ARC002 evaluate d the safety and efficacy of AR101 in 47 eligible peanut-allergic s ubjects who participated in the ARC001 originating study. Former placebo-treated subjects began AR101 up-dosing to 300 mg/day, followed by 2 weeks of daily dosing at 300 mg/day and a post-up-dosing DBPCFC. At the post-up-dosing DBPCFC, former placebo-treate d subjects exhibited a high rate of desensitization, with 20 of 21 subjects (95%) tolerating the 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) dose of peanut protein. No moderate or severe adverse events were reported and no subject required epinephrine. These findings are consis tent with those of the originating study exit DBPCFC in AR101-treated subjects . A total of 40 subjects ov erall, in both the former placebo-treated and AR101-treated groups, be gan a 12-week maintenance period at 300 mg/day, followed by a DBPCFC. The DBPCFC was considered passed if the subject tolerated at least 300 mg of pea nut protein with no or mild symptoms. Of the 40 subjects overall, 100%, 90%, and 60% of the subjects tolerated a peanut pr otein dose of 300 mg (443 mg cumulative), 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative), and 10 00 mg (2043 mg cumulative), respectively. Moderate or severe adverse even ts were reported in a minority of subjects at the 2 highest doses. Two subjects each required a single dose of epinephrine ( Bird, 2016; AR101 investigator brochure). The results from these phase 2 AR101 studies de monstrate the persistence of desensitization during maintenance treatment with AR101 at 300 mg/day and indicate that treatment with AR101 may result in a substantia lly higher tolerated dose of pe anut allergen than the dose used for maintenance. Further, desensitizat ion to 300 to 600 mg of peanut protein, the equivalent of approximately 1 to 2 whole peanut kernels ( Baumert, 2017 ), is clinically relevant and expected to reduce the risk of allergic reaction to most accidental exposures to peanut. 1.2.2 Phase 3 Pivotal Study ARC003 ARC003 was an international, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of AR101 in a CODIT re gimen in peanut-allergic children and adults aged 4 to 55 years. Preliminary analysis of the final study data is in progress for the database locked in January 2018. Of total of 554 subjec ts enrolled, 499 subjects were aged 4 to 17 years. The ITT population for the primary analysis included 496 subjects aged 4 to 17 years (372 in the AR101 group and 124 in the placebo group); 67.2% of AR101-treated subjects tolerated a si ngle highest dose of at least 600 mg of peanut protein (1043 mg cumulative) with no more than mild symptoms in the exit DBPCFC compared with 4.0% of placebo-treated subjects, re sulting in a treatment difference of 63.2% (p < 0.0001; 95% CI: 53.0, 73.3). In addition, 50.3% of AR101-treated subjec ts tolerated a single highest dose of 1000 mg of peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative), compared with 2.4% of placebo-treated subjects (p < 0.0001; 95% CI: 38.0, 57.7). Of subjects aged 4 to 17 years, 296 AR101-treated subjects and 116 placebo-treated subjects had an evaluable exit DBPCFC (completer population). A singl e highest dose of peanut protei n was tolerated with no more than mild symptoms in the exit DBPCFC by 96.3% of AR101-treated completers versus 8.6% of placebo completers for at least 300 mg (443 mg cumulative), 84.5% versus 4.3% for"

AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 18 of 122 at least 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative), a nd 63.2% versus 2.6% for 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative). The overall safety profile of AR101 was similar to that observed in the phase 2 studies of AR101 and previous studies of peanut OIT ( Anagnostou, 2014; Yu, 2012; Varshney, 2011 ; Blumchen, 2010 ; Hofmann, 2009 ; Jones, 2009 ). 1.3 Summary of Relevant Nonclinical Experience With AR101 AR101 has not been tested in animals. B ecause AR101 is based on a food that has not shown toxicologic issues, nonclin ical studies were not requir ed by regulatory authorities before using AR101 in human studies. 1.4 AR101 Benefits and Risks Assessment Peanut is a common food with a well understood safety profil e, and does not cause apparent side effects in humans except for allergic re actions in patients w ith peanut allergy. Based on all available data for AR101 for peanut allergy to date, the be nefit-risk profile of the product in this indication is positive. Fina l data analysis is in progress for the phase 3 study ARC003, and preliminary results indicate robust efficacy and a similar safety profile compared with results in the phase 2 studies. The AR101 development program has focused on se nsitive peanut-allergic individuals, with no subject in study ARC001 able to consume more than 43 mg of cumulative peanut protein during the screening DBPCFC w ithout having an allergic reac tion. A total of 79% of the AR101-treated subjects in the ITT population in ARC001 successfully consumed 443 mg of cumulative peanut protein in the exit food ch allenge, an amount well above the average eliciting dose in an accide ntal exposure to peanut ( Section 1.1 ), and 100% of AR101-treated subjects in the completer popula tion successfully consumed that amount of peanut protein. Comparable results were seen in the follo w-on study ARC002 for subjects receiving AR101 after placebo treatm ent in ARC001. While most subjects exposed to food allergen OI T experience adverse ev ents, the majority of adverse events associated with AR101 have been mild to moderate hyp ersensitivity events, consistent with the low-grade and repeated stimulation of the immune system required to produce desensitization during allergen immunotherapy. A total of 76 subjects from ARC001 and ARC002 (55 unique ARC001 subjects and 21 AR101 rollovers) experienced adverse reactions (treatment-related adverse ev ents). The most common in > 20% of subjects were hypersensitivity (48.7%), abdominal pa in (26.3%), and vomiting (21.1%). Other hypersensitivity-related adverse reactions to AR101 have been characterized most frequently (6.6-17.1%) by the following symptoms in decr easing order: urticaria, sneezing, throat irritation, upper abdominal pain, oral pruritus, allergic cough, nausea, nasal congestion, and oropharyngeal pain. All adverse reactions were mild (grade 1) or moderate (grade 2) intensity; none were considered by investigators to be severe. All adverse reactions were nonserious except 1 serious adverse event of hypersensitivity. Consistent with desensitization, the rate of adverse events appears to improve by study phase. Ongoing maintenance treatment with AR101 in study A RC002 has demonstrated continued improved tolerance compared with up-dosing treatm ent."
19,page_19,"Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 19 of 122 Overall, AR101 produced a high rate of desensiti zation to a clinically meaningful level of peanut protein in phase 2 and 3 studies, indicating that AR101 has the potential to provide treated individuals the benefit of reducing the risk of severe and life-th reatening or fatal allergic reactions, which continues to ju stify the acceptable associated risk. The AR101 investigator brochure has additional information re garding the safety profile, benefits, and risks of AR101. 1.5 Purpose of the Study The purpose of this study is to compare the HRQOL of AR101 CODIT in combination with standard of care (peanut avoidance, educat ion) versus standard of care alone in peanut-allergic subjects aged 4 to 17 years, inclusive. The HRQOL of parents/caregivers will also be assessed. 1.6 Rationale for Study Design The aim of this study is to assess the effects of AR101 treatment on HRQOL of subjects and their parents/caregivers. Although death resulting from peanut allergy may be rare ( Turner, 2015), peanut-allergic individuals and their families may experience lo w HRQOL due to high levels of anxiety and stress due to increased awareness that pean ut allergy may be fatal. Peanut-allergic individuals face a burden of strict peanut a voidance during everyday life, including constant fear of accidental exposure and the inability to pr edict the severity of al lergic reactions due to accidental exposure, despite maintaining a pean ut-avoidant diet. Food-allergic individuals frequently have trouble managing their social lif e because of the need for strict avoidance of the allergenic food, and face the disbelief of others about their condition, often resulting in anxiety, social isolation, and ev en mental health problems ( Mills, 2007). In many cases, the effects of food allergy on quality of life ma y be greater for caregivers than for the food-allergic children ( Valentine, 2011 ), and the disruption caused by food allergy may have wider implications for the productivity and live lihood of caregivers as well as repercussions for siblings and other family members (Gupta, 2013 ; King, 2009) . Studies in children comparing the HRQOL burden of peanut allergy with type 1 diabetes or rheumatologic disease showed that the burden was comparable to or worse for peanut-allergic children compared with children with these chronic diseases ( Avery, 2003; Primeau, 2000 ), highlighting the need for safe and effec tive treatments for peanut allergy. Peanut OIT studies have reported a significant improvement in quality of life following successful desensitization (DunnGalvin, 2017 ; Anagnostou, 2014; Factor, 2012). In phase 2 studies, AR101 has been shown to produce a high rate of desensitiza tion to a clinically meaningful level of peanut pr otein. Therefore, important benefits of treatment with AR101 may include significant improvement in the HRQOL for patients and their parents/caregivers, reduced anxiety from the fear of life-threat ening anaphylaxis or death from accidental exposure, and the ability to lead a normal day to day life."

However, assessment of HRQOL can be complex for infre quent episodic conditions such as peanut allergy. Food allergy HRQOL is unusual becaus e it is not characterized by daily or frequent symptoms that would allow patients to perceive changes in their health status; rather, it is characterized by beliefs and expectations about the risk of anaphyl axis occurring due to unpredictable accidental exposures and the expected benefits of interventions that reduce this risk. Experiencing an HRQOL benefit from tr eatment is entirely dependent on patient (and parent/caregiver) knowledge that they have been receiving an active tr eatment and have been successfully desensitized to the food allergen in question. An open-label study of HRQOL of patients on standard of care alone and their parents/caregivers will enable a more real-w orld comparison of treatments than a blinded study. In a blinded study setting, patients in both treatment groups would be required to follow the same study site visit schedule, which is necessarily frequent during up-dosing with food allergens to safely achieve the desired level of desensitization. As this visit frequency is much higher than real-world standard of care practice, it could significant ly affect patient and parent/caregiver responses to questionnaires. In an open-labe l study, the visit schedule for patients receiving standard of care alone can be less frequent and would more closely align with real-world standard of care practice. Th erefore, an open-label study design is preferred when assessing the real-world impact of AR101 treatment versus standard of care on HRQOL. Additionally, previous studies have shown that the DBPC FC also influences HRQOL, because the information it impart s helps reduce uncertainty about the status of the patient’s allergy and may reduce anxiety abou t their ability to manage an allergic reaction arising from accidental exposure ( Franxman, 2015 ; Soller, 2014). As a DBPCFC is not part of the diagnostic pathway for peanut allergy, the ARC0 09 eligibility criteria include a range of other relevant clinical and patient factors. However, all subjects will have an open-label food challenge (OLFC) approximately 12 months af ter randomization to st udy treatment (AR101 or standard of care alone). Because approximately 20% of children are estimated to outgrow their peanut allergy and periodic re-evaluations are recommended (Sampson, 2014; Skolnick, 2001 ), the OLFC results will be used to confirm peanut allergy for subjects who complete 18 months of standard of care alone as part of the eligibility to receive AR101 in an open-label follow-on study. HRQOL outcomes have been assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of AR101, including ARC003 (P ALISADE), ARC007 (RAMSES), and ARC010 (ARTEMIS), and in their open-label follow-on stud ies. However, ARC009 is anticipated to yield more meaningful HRQOL results and to better reflect the true-life patient/parent (caregiver) experience of AR101 treatment in combination with standard of care compared with standard of care alone, and thus will pr ovide relevant HRQOL evidence for treatment decision-makers."

AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 22 of 122 Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned 2: 1 to AR101 treatment or standard of care alone. Randomization will be stratified by age group (4-12 years and 13-17 years). Subjects in both treatment groups and their parents/ca regivers will have disease-specific and nondisease-specific HRQOL assessments at screening and periodica lly thereafter. Subjects receiving AR101 treatment will have 3 consecutive AR101 dosing periods before exiting (completing) the study: initial dose escalation, up-dosing, and maintenance. Subjects receiving standard of care alone will have approximately 18 m onths of observation before exiting (completing) the study. Subjects in both treatment groups will have a graded OLFC up to a maximum single highest dose of 1000 mg of peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative), approximately 12 months after randomization. AR101 Treatment Group Initial dose escalation: Subjects randomly assigned to AR101 treatment will begin with a stepwise dose escalation of AR101 (up to 5 single doses of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, and 6 mg) administered at 20- to 30-minute intervals as tolerated at the study site.  Subjects who tolerate at least 3 mg of AR 101 on day 1 will return to the study site on day 2 to receive a single confirmatory 3 mg dose under direct observation. Subjects who tolerate the 3 mg confirmatory dose with no or mild symptoms that are not dose-limiting will begin the up-dosing period.  Subjects who do not tolerate at least 3 mg of AR101 on day 1 or day 2 will stop AR101 treatment and discontinue early from the study. Up-dosing: The up-dosing period will be appr oximately 6 months (22-40 weeks). Dose escalation will occur approximately every 2 weeks. Daily AR101 doses during up-dosing will be 3, 6, 12, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, and 300 mg /day. The first dose of AR101 at each new dose level will be administered under direct observation at the study site; the remaining doses at each dose level will be admi nistered daily at home as tolerated. Subjects able to tolerate 300 mg for 2 weeks will begin the maintenance period. Subjects unable to tolerate 300 mg/day for 2 weeks within 40 weeks of up-dosing will stop AR101 treatment and discontinue early from the study. Maintenance: Subjects will continue AR101 daily dosing at 300 mg/day for an additional 12 months (52 weeks) with study site visits ever y 4 weeks. After at least 6 months (up to 7 months) of maintenance treatment (approxima tely 12 months after randomization/first dose of AR101), subjects will have a graded OLFC up to a maximum single highest dose of 1000 mg of peanut protein (3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 600, 1000 mg [2043 mg cumulative]).  Subjects who tolerate 1000 mg of peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative) at the OLFC will continue AR101 daily at 300 mg/day and will have the option to consent for a real-world peanut challe nge (RWPC) within 4 weeks (preferably within 1 week) after the OLFC. During the RWPC, subjects will eat a food containing 500 to 600 mg of peanut protein under direct observation at the study site . Subjects who complete"

Subjects receiving standard of care alone who comple te the OLFC will not have an RWPC. Both Treatment Groups Early discontinuation: Subjects with unresolved adverse events at early discontinuation or who had GI adverse events of interest will have safety follow-up ( Section 5.5 ). Subjects who discontinue AR101 treatment early before completing 9 months of maintenance, and their parents/caregivers, will complete relevant follow-up HRQOL questionnaires ( Section 5.3.1). Study exit: Subjects with unresolved adverse ev ents at study exit or who had GI adverse events of interest will have safety follow-up ( Section 5.5 ). AR101-treated subjects who complete approximately 12 months of mainte nance treatment at 300 mg/day will have the option to enroll in an open-label follow-on study to continue AR101 treatment until it becomes commercially available or its develo pment is terminated.

The study periods will include screening and treatment. The treatment period for subjects receiving AR101 will include initial dose es calation, up-dosing, and maintenance. The treatment period for subjects receiving standard of care alone will include observation. The timing of all study procedures is provi ded in the schedules of activities. The interactive response system user manua l will contain the information needed for registering subject stat us (eg, assigning subject identification [ID] numbers, indicating screen failure, and end of study). 5.1 Screening Period The 28-day screening period will be from day -28 through day -1. The screening period will commence after signed informed consent/assent is obtained, followed by assigning a subject ID number and performing screening procedures. For the purposes of this study, there will be no day 0. 5.1.1 Informed Consent Study site personnel must explain to potential study participants all aspects of the study, including all scheduled visits and activities . Study site personnel must obtain signed informed consent and assent (as appropriate ) before any study-specific procedures are conducted unless the procedures ar e part of routine standard of care. The informed consent process must be documented in the subject’s source documents ( Section 13.1.3). 5.1.2 Subject Identification Numbers After obtaining signed informed consent/a ssent, study site personnel will access the interactive response system to assign a s ubject ID number for each potential study participant. This unique number will be used to identify the subject for the remainder of the study. For subjects who provide written informed consent/assent and subsequently do not meet eligibility criteria or withdraw consent, study site personnel will document the screen failure or consent withdrawal in the subject’s s ource documents. The documentation will include demographics and medical history, the reason for screen failure, and procedures performed. 5.1.3 Screening Procedures Screening procedures are listed in the schedule of activities in Appendix 3. All screening procedures must be completed within 28 da ys after signed informed consent/assent is obtained."

All screening procedure results and relevant medical, allergy, and food allerg en exposure history must be available before eligibility can be determined. All inclusion criteria must be met and none of the exclusion criteria may apply. No eligibility waivers will be granted. Rescreening may be considered in certain circumstances on a case-by-case basis following approval from the medical monitor. HRQOL questionnaires and bespoke questions are to be comple ted after determination of eligibility and before randomi zation as required according to Appendix 4 and Appendix 6, and in the order given in Table 1 . 5.2 Treatment Periods 5.2.1 Treatment Period Visit Windows For subjects receiving AR101 tr eatment, up-dosing visits have a visit window of ±3 days (ie, 3 days before or after the scheduled visit day) and maintenance vis its have a visit window of ±7 days. The initial dose-escalation day 1 visit has no visit window. Day 2 should be the next consecutive day after day 1. If circumstances (eg, an intercurrent illn ess) create a safety risk, day 2 may be delayed up to 7 days after day 1. For subjects receiving standard of care alone, all study visits ha ve a visit window of ±7 days, except the day of randomization. Study treatment will continue daily during vi sit windows. Study product supplies must be considered when scheduling visits. 5.2.2 Randomization Procedures After confirmation of eligibility and completion of HRQOL questionnaires and bespoke questions per Appendix 4 and Appendix 6, study site personnel will access the interactive response system to assign subjects to ra ndomized study treatment (AR101 treatment or standard of care alone), which is to begin within 28 days af ter signed consent/assent and should be the same day as randomization. Randomized study treatm ent may start within 3 days after randomization only if starting the same day is not feasible (eg, for certain unexpected circumstances that may create a safe ty risk, such as intercurrent illness). A longer window may be allowed on a case- by-case basis following approval from the medical monitor. 5.2.3 General Study Visit Procedures Day 1 will be the first day of randomized study tr eatment (AR101 or standard of care alone).

AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 41 of 122 6.2 AR101 Product Characteristics The AR101 active pharmaceutical ingredient is in itially sourced as raw peanuts, Arachis hypogaea, and is processed into food-grade, 12% defatted, roasted peanut flour that contains approximately 50% peanut protein (wt/wt). The peanut flour, which contains peanut allergens, is characterized for its relativ e composition of key allergenic proteins (Porterfield, 2009) by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and is tested for potency (relative to a re ference standard) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to demonstrate consistency between lots. The AR101 drug product consists of the peanut flour formulated with bulking and flow agents in graduated doses. The drug product is encapsulated in hydr oxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) or filled in foil-laminate sachets and supplied in color-c oded pull-apart capsules at 5 dosage strengths (0.5, 1, 10, 20, and 100 mg) and 300 mg sachets. Additional details will be provided in the AR101 investig ator brochure and pharmacy manual. 6.2.1 Packaging of AR101 Capsules containing study product are packaged in blister cards that are assembled into dosing kits. Each individual blister of a blis ter card contains a dose for a single day. Each dosing kit supplies 2 weeks of daily dosing for a single dose level plus another 7 days of daily dosing at the same dose level to accomm odate potential visit scheduling issues and wasted or lost product. Foil-laminate sachets for maintenance dosing are packaged in paperboard cartons for storage and dispensing to study subjects. The label will vary depending on indi vidual country re quirements. 6.2.2 Storage of AR101 The study product should be stored in accordance with the product label and in a secure location at 2°C to 8°C. Temperature excursio ns may be allowed with specific instructions from Aimmune. Study sites will maintain temperat ure logs for all refrigerators used to store study product during the study. 6.2.3 Directions for Administration of AR101 The first dose at each dose le vel will be removed from the dosing kit for the assigned dose level and administered under me dical supervision at the study site. Once a dose is removed from the dosing kit, the kit must be dispensed to the subject, held at the study site for destruction, or returned to the sponsor designe e according to the procedures in the pharmacy manual. Once opened, dosing kits cannot be used for any other dosing interval or any other subject. Subjects will be inst ructed to store the dosing kit in the refrigerator and return unused study product to the study site at the next visit."

The daily dose at home should be taken as part of a meal or heavy snack except on days the dose is given at the study site (the subject should not have an empty stomach).  Subjects are to avoid activities likely to increase allergic reactiv ity (eg, exercising or taking hot showers or baths) within 3 hours after dosing.  For subjects engaging in st renuous exercise before the planned dosing time, dosing should be delayed until any signs of a hype rmetabolic state (eg, flushing, sweating, rapid breathing, and/or rapid h eart rate) have abated.  Dosing should not occur within 2 hours before bedtime.  In case of illness or symptoms such as wheezing, worsening asthma, fever, vomiting, or diarrhea, the subject or parent/caregiver is to wit hhold the dose of study product and notify the study site of the symptoms and for possible dose adjustments. Dose Preparation The same procedures will be followed for pr eparing and administering study product at the study site or at home. Study site doses may be prepared by site staff, the subject, or the parent/caregiver under direct su pervision of study site staff fo r training purposes. Doses at home will be prepared by the subject or supervising adult using a vehicle food (eg, applesauce, yogurt, pudding, or other age-appropriate semiso lid matrix food) to which the subject is not allergic. The vehicle food volume should be appropriate so the entire dose can be consumed in a few spoonfuls/mouthfuls in one sitting. The vehicle food must not be heated above room temperature before a dding the study product or consumption. Capsules constituting the dose should be pulled ap art, gently rolled between the finger and thumb over the vehicle food, and then lightly tapped at the end of each half of the capsule to ensure full delivery of the study product. When us ing a sachet packet, the packet is to be cut over the vehicle food and the entire contents em ptied into the food. Th e sachet should then be gently squeezed and shaken to ensure full delivery of the study product. Subjects should avoid inhaling the study product, which may i nduce an allergic react ion or worsening of asthma. The study product should be mixe d thoroughly with the vehicle food before administration. Dose Timing The study product should be consumed as prom ptly as possible after mixing. If not consumed within 4 hours after mixing into a vehicle, the mixture s hould be discarded and a new dose prepared. If preparing a new dose is not feasible (eg, due to limited supply), the study product-vehicle food mixture may be stored for up to 24 hours under conditions appropriate for the vehicle food matrix. If c onsumption is delayed more than 24 hours, the mixture must be discarded and a new dose mixed and consumed."
43,page_43,"Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 43 of 122 The dose should be administered at the same tim e each day (within a 4-hour period), with a target interval of at least 8 hours between doses. Per inve stigator judgment, a dose at home may be split into 2 portions (may be unequal) and given 8 to 12 hours apart if tolerability is a concern. The daily dose at home should be taken as part of a meal or heavy snack. Dosing at the evening meal is recommended so that child ren may be observed and supervised by their parents/caregivers for seve ral hours after dosing. Subjects must take their dose following their as signed dosing schedule, except as needed to treat an adverse event. Dose modifications due to adverse events are described in Section 8.5.3 . Subjects should not make up a missed dose if mo re than 6 hours has elapsed after the usual time of dosing. Procedures for missed cons ecutive doses of study product during up-dosing and maintenance are described in Section 8.5.5. 6.3 Treatment Compliance Accountability for the study product capsules/ sachets will be performed to document compliance with the dosing regimens; noncomp liance may lead to early discontinuation (Section 5.3 ). Subjects or parents/caregivers will be asked to bring all study product packaging, along with any unused capsules/sachet s, to study visits. Study site personnel must make reasonable efforts to obtai n study product packaging and any unused capsules/sachets from subjects who do not routin ely return them at study site visits. 7 PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY Prior and concomitant medications include all vitamins, herbal remedies, and over-the-counter and pres cription medications. 7.1 Prior Medications All prior medications within 90 days before st art of study treatment mu st be recorded on the case report form and in the subject’s source documents. 7.2 Concomitant Medications All concomitant medications, including those for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, must be recorded on the appropriate case report form. If the use of any medication during the study is due to an adverse event, the adverse event must be recorded on the adverse event case report form and in the subject’s source documents. The use of any medication with known or high pot ential for cardiovascul ar side effects is discouraged (eg, antipsychotics, antiarrhyt hmics, antihypertensive s, antineoplastics, cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors [chronic use], nonste roidal anti-inflammatory drugs [chronic use]) because subjects may be at increased risk of anaphylaxis that may result in decreased blood pressure when severe. Additionally, epin ephrine used to treat anaphylaxis may result"

An asse ssment of the benefits and risks of using a medication with known cardiovascular side e ffects at the same time as AR101 should be discussed with a medical monitor before its use. Antihistamines and other medications that could in terfere with the assessment of an allergic reaction must be discontinued for 5 half-lives of the medication before the SPT, first dose of AR101, and food challenges. The prescribing info rmation must be reviewed to determine the half-life of each medication for th e subject’s relevant age group. Symptomatic treatment should be used to s upplement dose reduction and not as a substitute for it. Medications for the prophylaxis of symp toms of chronic or recurrent adverse events (eg, H1 or H2 histamine blockers, proton pump inhibitors, inhaled beta -adrenergic agonists) should not be started in advance of symptoms ; exceptions may be allowed on a case-by-case basis following approval by the medical monitor. The use of such medications should be minimized, and then discontinued at the earliest opportunity as medi cally appropriate. Systemic steroid use is limited to ≤ 3 weeks. Up-dosing must not occur until 3 days after oral corticosteroids are disc ontinued. Topical steroid use is allowed after an SPT. 7.3 Rescue Medications All rescue medications (ie, any medication used to treat symptoms of an acute allergic reaction) must be recorded on the case report form. The adverse event requiring the use of rescue medications must be recorded on th e adverse event case report form and in the subject’s source documents. Medications for the treatment of individual acute allergic reactions (eg, antihistamine, epinephrine, IV fluids, beta-adrenergic agoni st [eg, albuterol by i nhaler or nebulizer], oxygen, glucocorticosteroids) are to be used as indicated. An epinephrine auto-injector device will be provide d or prescribed as appropriate to subjects and parents/caregivers who do not have one.

The primary adverse event resulting in death should be identified. Life-threatening At immediate risk of deat h from the adverse event (eg, from the combination of severe anaphylaxis and a grade 4 allergic reaction per Section 8.4 ). Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Does not include prolonged hospitalization for extended observation (eg, to watch for a delayed or biphasic reaction) or planned hospitalization (eg, for an elective procedure). Disability or permanent damage Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. Congenital abnormality or birth defect Important medical event An event that may jeopa rdize the health of the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the other outcomes. In general, anaphylaxis classified as an important medical event should require an emergency department visit with intensive therapy (determined by the investigator, but may include interventions such as intravenous epinephrine, intubation, or admission to an intensive care unit; 1-2 intramuscular injections of epinephrine are typically not considered intensive therapy). If anaphylaxis of mild or moderate severity and without administration of intensive therapy is reported as an important medical event, a clinical assessment by the investigator and reason for the assessment must be included in the event narrative. Source: ICH E2A and US Code of Federal Regulations: 21 CFR 312.32 [75 FR 59961]. Unexpected adverse events: Adverse events for wh ich the nature or severity is not consistent with the reference safety information. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactio ns (SUSARs): Adverse events assessed as serious, related to study product, and unexpected, which are subject to expedited reporting to regulatory authorities and study investigators. Adverse events of interest: A dverse events of interest are an y adverse events (serious or nonserious) identified for ongoing monitori ng during the study and require rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor as described in Section 8.5.6 . 8.3 Assessment of Causal Relationship The investigator will assess the re lationship of an adverse event to study product as related or not related (ie, if there is a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the event), and document the relationship in th e subject’s source documents."

The particular event may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). Severity is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria. Investigators will grade the severity of adverse ev ents. The severity of an adverse event is to be recorded on the case report form and in the subject’s source documents. Three different severity grading systems will be used depending on type of adverse event: allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, or all other adverse events. Brief descriptions of the 3 severity grading systems are provided. Severity of allergic reactions will be graded using the Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) grading system (adapted from Burks, 2012), with scores ranging from 1 (transient or mild discomfort) to 5 (death) ( Table 9 ). Table 9: CoFAR Severity Grading System for Allergic Reactions Grade 1 Mild Grade 2 Moderate Grade 3 Severe Grade 4 Life-Threatening Grade 5 Death Transient or mild discomforts (< 48 hours), no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required. Symptoms that produce mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; no or minimal intervention/therapy is required. Hospitalization is possible. Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization is possible. Parenteral medication(s) are usually indicated. Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant medical/ therapy. Intervention is required; hospitalization is probable. Death Symptoms may include pruritus, swelling or rash, abdominal discomfort, or other transient symptoms. Symptoms may include persistent hives, wheezing without dyspnea, abdominal discomfort/ increased vomiting, or other symptoms. Symptoms may include bronchospasm with dyspnea, severe abdominal pain, throat tightness with hoarseness, transient hypotension, or other symptoms. Symptoms may include persistent hypotension and/or hypoxia with resultant decreased level of consciousness associated with collapse and/or incontinence, or other life-threatening symptoms.

The assessment a nd treatment of allergic reactions resulting from accidental and nonaccidental food allergen exposure should follow the same guidelines as allergic reactions resu lting from study product. 8.5.1 Assessment of Allergic Reactions Allergy symptoms may occur during AR101 treatment as observed in other desensitization protocols. Subjects must be observed for at least 90 minutes after completion of a dose or dose escalation at the study site , with vital sign measurements (blood pressure and heart rate) and assessment for symptoms of allergic react ion performed every 30 minutes. The postdose observation period may be shortened to 30 minutes during maintenance if no allergy symptoms occurred during the prev ious 3 maintenance visits. The length of observation will be extended beyond 90 minutes if symptoms of allergic reaction develop as follows:  Mild symptoms: observe for 90 minutes or at least 1 hour after symptoms resolve, whichever is longer.  Moderate symptoms: observe for at l east 2 hours after symptoms resolve.  Severe symptoms: observe for at least 3 hours after symptoms resolve either at the study site or an emergency facility, as appropriate. Consider extended overnight observation for subjects experienci ng protracted symptoms. The assessing physician will determine whether th e allergy symptoms meet the criteria for dose-limiting symptoms ( Section 8.5.1.2). The severity of symptoms of an allergic reaction will be assessed as described in Section 8.4 . Signs and symptoms of allergic reactions will be recorded on the case report form and in the subject’s source documents. 8.5.1.1 Assessment of Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is defined by a number of signs and symptoms, alone or in combination, that occur within minutes up to a few hours after exposure to a provoking agent. Anaphylaxis can be mild, moderate, or severe ( Section 8.4 ). Adverse events of anaphylaxis are considered adverse events of interest and require rapid reporting as described in Section 8.6.2 ."

When multiple symptoms are present, the severity of the most severe symptom will be used to determine whether symptoms are dose limiting and the dose or dose level is to lerated. Possible assessments of symptom severity, dose-limiting symptoms, a nd dose tolerability are shown in Table 12 ."

For mild dose-related symptoms occurring ≥ 7 times within 2 weeks, the dose level is to be considered not tolerated. Moderate symptoms: A study product dose associated with moderate allergy symptoms will be assessed as not tolerated, except on rare occasions such as a transient, self-limited symptom in a single organ system that requires no intervention, resolv es completely, and is typically subjective. If a study product dose associated with moderate symptoms is assessed as tolerated by the investigator, an explanation must be provided on the case report form. Severe symptoms: A study product dose associated with severe allergy symptoms will be assessed as not tolerated. 8.5.2 Treatment of Allergic Reactions Treatment of allergic reactions is guided by the type of symptoms and severity as determined by the investigator, and supplements dose adjustme nt. Rescue medications for acute allergic reactions include antihistamines, epinephrine, IV fluids, a beta-a gonist (eg, albuterol by inhaler or nebulizer), oxygen, and gl ucocorticosteroids as indicated ( Section 7.3 ). Mild acute allergic reactions are mostly tran sient and self-limiting and require no therapeutic intervention, whereas other react ions may require treatment (generally antihistamines). Treatment for chronic or recurrent allergic reactions should be used minimally and discontinued as soon as clinically appropriate. Treatment for chronic or recurrent allergic reactions should not be started in advance of symptoms; however , exceptions may be allowed on a case-by-case basis following approva l from the medical monitor. Moderate acute allergic reactions will generally require therapeutic intervention; some rare events may be so transient that no specific tr eatment is required. For moderate reactions requiring treatment, antihistamines and/or epinep hrine is to be administered as indicated. Severe acute allergic reactions will generally require treatment with epinephrine. If the severity of the reaction is uncertain, epinephrine administ ration is likely appropriate. A medical monitor will be available to answer qu estions or to assist in decisions related to the study protocol."

For other mild symptoms, either:  Advance to the next dose of study product in 30 to 60 minutes.  Treat with antihistamine, then resume dos e escalation within 60 minutes after the previous dose if signs and symptoms re solve to minimal or residual, and the investigator considers continued dosing to be safe. If only 1 or 2 doses of antihistamine are used to treat mild symptoms, the initial dose escalation may continue. If a second medication (eg, epinephrine or a beta-agonist) or > 2 doses of antihistamines are needed, stop the initial dose escalation and discontinue the subject early from the study, even if the symptoms are assessed as mild. Use of epinephrine, although unlikely to be us ed to treat mild dose-related symptoms, will stop the initial dose escalation and discontinue the subject early from the study. Moderate For moderate symptoms not worsening in intensity or distribution over time, the investigator may take a stepwise approach to treatment. If symptoms do not begin to resolve within 30 minutes, initiate therapy w ith antihistamines or administer epinephrine immediately. Initiate other therapies sequentially or concurrently per investigator judgment.

The process algorithm for dose adjustments for dose-related symptoms occurring at a new dos e or dose level given at the study site or for symptoms of a dose-related allergic reac tion reported during daily dosing at home is shown in Figure 3 and described in Table 14 . Because of the potential for reduced reliability in reporting symptoms during dosing at home, administration of study product at the study si te under medical supe rvision is strongly encouraged any time that acute allergy symp toms are reported, incl uding mild symptoms occurring with a dose that is su spected to be not tolerated. The dose escalation may be delayed or the dose le vel reduced if the tolerability of a dose level is uncertain, at i nvestigator discretion ( Section 8.5.1.2). In general, a reduced dose of study product is to be given at the study site under medical supervision and continued for 2 weeks at home. The lowest dose level of study product is 3 mg. Symptomatic treatment should be used to s upplement dose reduction and not as a substitute for it. Symptomatic treatment of adverse events should be discontinued before attempting dose re-escalation at the study si te. However, if treatment fo r chronic or recurrent adverse events cannot be withdrawn successfully, it may be administered concurrently with study product dose re-escalation. A dose re-escalation attempt s hould be made within 4 weeks after a dose reduction, unless dose escalation is to be delayed further due to administration of epinephrine ( Table 15 ). Study product dosing will stop and the subject will discontinue early ( Section 5.3 ) if any of the following conditions are met for dose adjustment:  The dose level cannot be escalated after 3 c onsecutive failed attempts with at least 2 weeks between each escalation attempt.  The dose reduction cannot be to lerated after 3 attempts to reduce the dose level."

In addition, the study product dose level may be temporarily reduced for decreased study product tolerability during menses. The amount of dose reduction may range from 1 dos e level (ie, the previous dose level) to approximately 50% (rounded down to the nearest feasible whole dose) at the discretion of the investigator. The lowest dose level is 3 mg. If the dose is reduced for reasons other than allergic reactions to study product, the reduced dose will be given for 2 weeks and the subject is to be fully recovered (ie, baseline status) for at least 3 days, depending on the severity of th e illness per investigator assessment, before attempting dose re-escalation at the study site. Treatment for an intercurrent illness or disease should be discontinued before dose re-e scalation. However, if the treatment cannot be withdrawn successfully, it may be administ ered concurrently with study product. The process of dose re-escala tion for reduced doses due to reasons other than allergic reactions will depend on the degree and duration of the dos e reduction as described in"

A dose re-escalation attempt should be made within 4 weeks after a dose reduction. The study product may also be withheld as part of the treatment for intercurrent adverse events at the discretion of the investigator ; dose continuation after temporary withholding will follow the procedure for missed study product doses ( Section 8.5.5 ). Study product dosing will stop and the subjec t will discontinue early from the study (Section 5.3 ) if any of the following conditi ons for dose adjustment are met:  The dose level cannot be escalated after 3 c onsecutive failed attempts with at least 2 weeks between each escalation attempt.  The dose reduction cannot be to lerated after 3 attempts to reduce the dose level.

EoE presents with varied symptoms of esophageal dysfunction that differ between children and adults (Dellon, 2013; Dellon, 2011 ). In children, the symptoms are often nonspecific and may include feeding difficulties, failure to th rive, abdominal pain, regurgitation, nausea, and vomiti ng. In adults, the most frequent symptoms are dysphagia and food impaction; less frequent symptoms include heartburn, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Special attention should be paid to these symptoms, which may suggest esophageal dysfunction, particul arly when the symptoms are new in onset during the study, chronic or recurrent, or experienced as a complex of multiple symptoms. Investigators are encouraged to request consultation from an out side physician or conduct additional testing to assist in the diagnosis or management of chr onic or recurrent GI a dverse events at their discretion. If a subject is seen by a gastroenterologist, study s ite personnel must obtain the records for the visit and the test results, including those from endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy if performed, and retain them in the subject’s source documents. If GI symptoms develop that suggest a chroni c or recurrent reaction to study product, the dose level should be reduced ( Table 14 ). The level of the dose reduction should be guided by the severity of the symptoms. Symptomatic treatment is permitted ( Section 7.2 ), but should be used to supplement dose reduction a nd not as a substitute for it. GI adverse events of interest are as follows:  GI adverse events with prolonged dose interruption, defined as withholding study product for > 7 days due to GI adverse events, including dose-limiting chronic or recurrent GI adverse events at doses ≤ 20 mg/day that require the dose to be withheld for 4 weeks  GI adverse events that result in early discontinuation or are ongoing at early discontinuation GI adverse events of interest will be considered adverse events of interest and require rapid reporting as described in Section 8.6.2 . Parents/caregivers and subjects aged ≥ 8 years will be asked to complete the PEESS v2.0 questionn aire while the subject is symptomatic and thereafter at intervals as described in Section 5.5.1 . Additional information about the PEESS v2.0 questionnaire is provided in Section 9.3.4. After early discontinuation or study exit, subjects who had GI adverse events of interest will have safety follow-up for at least 6 months as described in Section 5.5.1. 8.5.6.3 Accidental and Nonaccidenta l Food Allergen Exposure Accidental food allergen exposure is any known or suspected exposure to a food to which the subject is allergic, including pea nut, whether or not the exposure results in an adverse event. Nonaccidental food allergen expos ure is any intentional exposure to a food to which the subject is allergic, including pea nut, whether or not the exposure results in an adverse event."

Subjects and parents/caregivers will be asked to contact the st udy site after any food allergen exposure, even if it does not resu lt in symptoms. The subject ma y be asked to return to the study site. Subjects and parents/caregive rs will complete the EQ-5D questionnaire when allergy symptoms due to food allergen exposure are reported to the st udy site and assessed as severe, and 1 week later (Appendix 4, Appendix 5, Appendix 6). 8.5.6.4 Adverse Events With Severe Symptoms Adverse events assessed by investigators as seve re by any of the 3 severity grading systems (CoFAR for allergic reactions, Table 9 ; EAACI for anaphylaxis, Table 10 ; or CTCAE for all other adverse events, Table 11 ) are considered adverse events of interest and require rapid reporting as described in Section 8.6.2 . Severe allergy symptoms will result in early discontinuation during initial dos e-escalation days 1 and 2 ( Table 13 ) and may result in early discontinuation during up- dosing and maintenance (Table 14 ). 8.5.6.5 Adverse Events Requiring Use of Epinephrine Adverse events, especially allergic reactions, ma y result in epinephrine use, as described in Section 8.5.2 . Adverse events requiring use of epine phrine are considered adverse events of interest and require rapid reporting as described in Section 8.6.2. 8.5.7 Other Notable Events Other notable events include overdose and pregnancy. 8.5.7.1 Overdose An overdose is defined as any dose of study pr oduct greater than the pr escribed dose within a 24-hour period. The medical monitor must be c ontacted as soon as possi ble in the event of a study product overdose. The subject is to be monitored closely for any adverse events and treated for symptoms. The amount of the overdos e and its duration are to be recorded in the subject’s source documents. All overdose events require ra pid reporting as described in Section 8.6.2 whether or not the event is associated with an adverse event. 8.5.7.2 Pregnancy and Other Reproductive Considerations Peanut OIT increases the risk of allergic reactions and may incr ease the risk of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can cause a dangerous decrease in blood pressure, which could result in compromised placental perfusion and significan t risk to a fetus during pregnancy. In"

Therefore, all female s ubjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test before the first dose of study product and a negative urine test during the treatment period and must avoid pregnancy during the study. All postmenarchal female subjects will be provided with age-appropriate counseling and information about contraception per the standard of care at the study si te. The information should include adequate information about th e use, effectiveness, and side-effects of contraceptive methods, and be conducted in as pr ivate a setting as possible using a sensitive, patient-centered approach. Sexually active females of childbearing potential will be required to use one of the following types of contraception:  A highly effective method of birth control, de fined as one that resu lts in a low failure rate (ie, < 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, as follows: – Combined (estrogen- and progestog en-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (o ral, intravaginal, or transdermal). – Progestogen-only hormonal contraception a ssociated with inhi bition of ovulation (oral, injectable, or implantable). – Intrauterine device (IUD). – Intrauterine hormone-rel easing system (IUS). – Bilateral tubal occlusion. – Vasectomized partner. – Sexual abstinence.  If a highly effective single method of bi rth control is not used, an effective, double-barrier method of contraception should be used (eg, male condom in conjunction with a cervical cap, diaphr agm, or contraceptive sponge with spermicide). Where local requirements are more stringent, a highly effective method of birth control must be used. Females of childbearing potenti al are defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner and women whose partners have been sterilized by vasectomy or other means, unless they meet th e following criteria: at least 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea, 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels > 40 IU/L, or at least 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hyste rectomy or hysterectomy. 8.6 Adverse Event Reporting Safety reporting to regulatory authorities wi ll be implemented according to global and country-specific regulations."

Adverse events may be identified during study visits. All signs and symptoms associated with an adverse event, whether or not related to the study product, must be fully and completely documented for all subjects (ie, both treatment groups) on the adverse event case report form and in the subject’s source documents. In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form, as well as documented in the subject’s source documents. Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as avai lable, and is prefe rred to listing all the individual signs and sympto ms. If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator is to record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event. For multiple symptoms of allergic reactions/hypersensitivit y, each individual symptom is to be entered separately on the case report forms. 8.6.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period Collection and reporting of adverse event info rmation will begin at the time the screening informed consent/assent form is signed and will continue for all subjects through early discontinuation or study exit ( Figure 4 ). Adverse event reporting and follow-up will continue after early discontinuation or study ex it in the following circumstances:  Subjects with ongoing adverse events will have safety follow-up for at least 30 days until the adverse events resolve or stab ilize, the subject withdraws consent for follow-up, or the study is terminated.  Subjects who have GI advers e events of interest (Section 8.5.6.2) will have safety follow-up for 6 months or until chronic or r ecurrent GI symptoms resolve or stabilize, whichever is last.

The FAQLQ-PF questionnaire includ es 3 domains (emotional imp act, food anxiety, and social and dietary limitations) and consists of 26 items for children aged 4 to 6 years and 30 items for subjects aged 7 to 12 years (DunnGalvin, 2008). The FAQLQ-PFT includes 4 domains (with social and dietary limitations scored as separate domains) and consists of 27 items. Each item contains response options from 0 (no impact) to 6 (extreme impact) and is scored on a 7-point scale from 1 to 7. For the FAQLQ-PF, each domain is scored as an average of the item scores, with the total score represen ting the mean of the 3 domain scores. For the FAQLQ-PFT, the total score is the average of completed item scores. The FAIM questionnaires were developed to measure construct validity of the FAQLQ (van der Velde, 2010 ). The FAIM-PF and FAIM-PFT measure parent/caregiver perception of disease severity and expect ation of allergen exposure outco me for their child/teenager. The FAIM-PF will be completed by parents/caregivers of subjects aged ≤ 12 years and consists of 8 items. The FAIM-PFT will be completed by parents/caregivers of subjects aged 13 to 17 years and consists of 4 items. Each question contains response options from 0 (low likelihood of a bad outcome) to 6 (extremely likel y to have a bad outcome) and is scored on a 7-point scale from 1 to 7. 9.1.2 FAQLQ-CF/FAIM-CF and FAQLQ-TF/FAIM-TF Questionnaires Subjects aged 8 to 12 years will complete th e FAQLQ-CF (child form), which includes 4 domains (emotional impact, allergen avoidance, dietary restrictions, a nd risk of accidental exposure) and consists of 24 items ( Flokstra-de Blok, 2009 ). Subjects aged 13 to 17 years will complete the FAQLQ-TF (teenager form ), which includes 3 domains (with dietary"

Each item contains response options from 0 (no impact) to 6 (extreme impact) and is scored on a 7-point scal e from 1 to 7. Each domain is scored as an average of the items completed, with the tota l score representing the mean of all items completed. The FAIM-CF and FAIM-TF consist of 6 items each; each item contains response options from 0 (low likelihood of a bad outcome) to 6 (extremely likely to have a bad outcome) and is scored on a 7-point scale from 1 to 7. Subjects completing the FAQLQ-CF/FAIM-CF or FAQLQ-TF/FAIM-TF are to prov ide their own responses. The parent/caregiver can help read or explain the meaning of a question, but the response should be se lected only by the subject. 9.1.3 FAQL-PB Questionnaire The FAQL-PB questionnaire is a self-adminis tered, 17-item questionnaire that measures quality of life in parents/caregiver s of children with food allergy ( Knibb, 2013; Cohen, 2004). Each item is presented on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (not troubled) to 7 (extremely troubled), and the index is scored as a summated rating scale, with a higher FAQL-PB score indicating a grea ter burden on the family. 9.1.4 HADS Questionnaire The HADS consists of 7 questions to assess an xiety and 7 questions to assess depression over the last week (Zigmond, 1983). Each question is presented on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3. Composite scores are categorized as follo ws: 0 to 7, normal; 8 to 10, mild; 11 to 14, moderate; and 15 to 21, severe. 9.1.5 EQ-5D Questionnaires EQ-5D questionnaires are used to assess health utility in subjects and parents/caregivers. The EQ-5D-5L (5-Levels) is completed by pa rents/caregivers and subjects aged 13 to 17 years. The EQ-5D-5L consists of a descriptive system of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and 5 levels (1, no problems; 2, slight problems; 3, moderate problems; 4, severe problems; 5, extreme problems), and a visual analog scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health) (van Reenen, 2015 ). Subjects aged 8 to 12 years will complete the EQ-5D-Y (Youth) questionnaire, which consists of a descriptiv e system of 5 dimensions and 3 levels (no problems, some problems, and a lot of problems), and a visual analog scale (van Reenen, 2014 ). Parents/caregivers of subjects aged 4 to 7 years will complete the EQ-5D-Y proxy version, which rates how the paren t/caregiver rates the h ealth of the child. 9.1.6 Assessments of Control and Confidence The parent/caregiver form and teenager form fo r the assessment of cont rol of peanut allergy and confidence in managing allergic reactions each include 2 items: 1 related to perceived"

Each item is scored on a 4- point scale from 1 to 4, with lower values indicating less control or confidence. The parent/caregiver will complete the parent/caregiver form and subjects aged ≥ 13 years will complete the teenager form. 9.1.7 Global Assessments of HRQOL The parent/caregiver form and teenager form for global assessment of HRQOL each include 5 items: 4 items related to the subject’s HRQOL (with the same domains as the related FAQLQ questionnaires) and 1 gl obal HRQOL item. The child form does not include the global HRQOL item. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale from 1 to 5, with lower values indicating better HRQOL. The parent/caregiver will complete the parent/caregiver form, subjects aged ≥ 13 years will complete the teenager form, and subjects aged 8 to 12 years will complete the child form. 9.1.8 Assessments of Food Challenge Outcomes The parent/caregiver form and patient form for the assessment of food challenge outcomes each include 3 items. The items assess the parent/caregiver and subject’s level of reassurance based on the result of the food cha llenge, level of worry about future allergic reactions due to accidental p eanut exposure based on the result of the food challenge, and rating of severity of the allerg ic reaction to the food challe nge. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale from 1 to 4, with lower values indicating no reassurance/ worry or no reaction. The parent/caregiver will complete the parent/caregiver form and subjects aged ≥ 13 years will complete the patient form. 9.1.9 TSQM-9 Questionnaire The generic TSQM-9 questionnaire is a 9-item in strument used to evaluate subject treatment satisfaction (Bharmal, 2009). Higher scores indicate great er treatment satisfaction. 9.1.10 Exit Questionnaire Bespoke exit questionnaires were develope d to assess parent/car egiver and subject experience and satisfaction with study treatment. The exit parent/caregiver form includes items related to both parent/caregiver and s ubject experience with study treatment, and will be completed by the parent/caregiver. The exit patient form includes items related to subject experience with study treatment, and is completed by subjects aged ≥ 13 years. 9.1.11 Qualitative Exit Interview The qualitative exit interview will follow a se mistructured interview guide and explore subject and/or parent/c aregiver experience living with pea nut allergy before and after AR101 treatment, as well as their treatment experience. The duration of the exit interview will be up to 60 minutes. The exit interview will be scheduled as soon as possible after the study exit or early discontinuation visit, at a time convenient for the subjec t and/or parent/caregiver, and"

The exit interv iew will be conducted in a random sample of parents/caregivers and subjects aged ≥ 13 years at study exit or early discontinuation. 9.2 Measures of Desensitization Desensitization will be measured using the SPT, OLFC, and RWPC according to the schedules of activities. 9.2.1 Skin Prick Test Peanut SPT mean wheal diameters will be meas ured to assess the immunomodulatory effects of AR101 treatment. SPTs for peanut extract wi ll be performed after antihistamines are discontinued for at least 5 ha lf-lives of the medication, a ccording to the schedules of activities. Details are provi ded in the study manual. 9.2.2 Open-Label Food Challenge Subjects receiving AR101 treatment will have an OLFC after at least 6 months (up to 7 months) of maintenance treatment with AR101 at 300 mg/day to assess the level of desensitization to peanut protein. Subjects re ceiving standard of care alone will have an OLFC approximately 12 months after randomization. The OLFC will be conducted within a single day and consistent with accepted food challenge procedures. The OLFC will cond itionally test single doses of peanut protein (3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 600, and 1000 mg) using a food challenge mixture containing defatted peanut flour, administered sequentially at 20- to 30-mi nute intervals up to a single highest dose of 1000 mg of peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative) . The OLFC is described in detail in Appendix 1, including all requirements befo re, during, and after the OLFC. 9.2.3 Real-World Peanut Challenge Subjects receiving AR101 treatment who tolera te the 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) OLFC dose of peanut protein will have the option to consent for an RWPC under direct observation at the study site within 4 weeks (preferably wi thin 1 week) after the OLFC. The RWPC is described in detail in Appendix 2, including all requirements be fore, during, and after the RWPC. 9.3 Safety and Other Assessments 9.3.1 Lung Function Tests and Assessments of Asthma Control Lung function tests will be performed according to the schedules of activities. Lung function tests include PEFR for subjects aged ≥ 6 years and attempts of PE FR for subjects aged 4 to 5 years. Spirometry (FEV 1) will be obtained if PEFR shows a clinically relevant reduction or for symptoms of clinical deterioration (e g, active wheeze on physical examination)."

AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 75 of 122 For subjects with asthma, the evaluation of asthma severity will be assessed using the classification in Table 19 . Asthma control in subjects with pre-existing asthma will be assessed using scores from the Asthma Control Test (ACT) ( Schatz, 2006 ) and by the incidence of asthma rescue medication use. The ACT is a self-administe red, 5-item questionnaire for subjects aged ≥ 12 years, used to evaluate the level of asthma control in the la st 4 weeks. Each question is presented on a 5-point scale, with lower numbers indicati ng worse asthma control. A composite score of more than 19 indicates well-controlled asthma. The Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) is a 7-item questionnaire used to evaluate the level of asthma control in subjects aged 4 to 11 years with pre-existing asthma ( Liu, 2007 ). Subjects complete the first part of the questionnaire, which c onsists of 4 questions and a choice of 4 responses from 0 (worse asthma) to 3 (controlled asthma) for each question. The parent/caregiver may help the subject read or understand the question if needed, but only the subject should select the res ponse. The parent/caregiver completes the second part of the questionnaire, which consists of 3 questions and a choice of 6 responses from 0 (worse asthma) to 5 (controlled asthma) for each ques tion. Parents/caregivers are asked to recall asthma symptoms in the last 4 weeks and comple te their portion of th e questionnaire without influence from the subject’s responses. A co mposite score of more than 19 indicates well-controlled asthma."

The TNSS (short form) consists of 3 questions that addre ss nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and nasal itch/sneezing ( Downie, 2004). Each question has a choice of 4 responses that range from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). The subject is asked to recall symptoms over the last week to allow calculati on of the symptom score. 9.3.3 SCORAD Index The scoring atopic dermatitis (S CORAD) index is used to as sess the severity of atopic dermatitis and will be administered only to subjects with pre-existing atopic dermatitis (European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis, 1993 ). The SCORAD index is based on the combination of the following:  Extent of lesions (accounts for a bout 20% of the total score).  Intensity, based on 6 items (erythema, edem a/papulation, oozing/crusts, excoriations, lichenification, and dryness), each graded from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) according to reference photographs (accounts for about 60% of the total score).  Subjective items (pruritus and sleep loss) . The subject (aged >7 years) or parent/caregiver will indicate the average va lue for pruritus and sleep loss on a visual analog scale (accounts for about 20% of the total score). 9.3.4 PEESS v2.0 Questionnaire The PEESS v2.0 ( Martin, 2015 ; Franciosi, 2011 ) is used to assess the frequency and severity of EoE symptoms in the last month and will be administered only for subjects with GI adverse events of interest ( Section 5.5.1 , Section 8.5.6.2 ). The PEESS v2.0 consists of 4 domains (dysphagia, GERD, nausea/vomiting, a nd pain) and 20 items. Each item contains response options from 0 to 4. A higher total or domain score indicates more frequent and/or severe symptoms. The parent/caregiver completes the Parent Report and subjects aged ≥ 8 years complete the Children and Teens Report. The PEESS v2.0 was not designed to establish a diagnosis of EoE; the use of this questionnaire to monitor the clin ical course of GI symptoms mu st be considered exploratory. However, the PEESS v2.0 has shown content and construct validity ( Martin, 2015 ; Franciosi, 2011) and is a promising tool for following the clinical course of EoE or an EoE-like immune-mediated GI syndrome. The questionnaire has the potential to reveal trends toward symptomatic improvement or worsening that may otherwise go undetected. 9.3.5 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs The investigator will perform physical examinati ons according to the schedule of activities."
78,page_78,"Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 78 of 122 Physical examinations will include an age-ap propriate assessment of systems (eg, general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, ski n, heart, lungs, lymph node s, GI, genitourinary, neurologic, and skeletal) per stan dard of care at the study site or as clinically indicated by symptoms. Symptom-directed physical examinati ons will concentrate on typical target organ areas for an allergic response, includi ng the skin, oropharynx, and upper and lower respiratory, GI, and cardi ovascular systems. Vital sign measurements will include blood pr essure, heart rate, and temperature. Weight and height will be measured at specific visits according to the schedule of activities. 10 STATISTICAL METHODS 10.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans The statistical methods and data presenta tions for reporting the study results will be described in detail in the statistical analysis plan. Randomization will be central and treatment allocation will be 2:1 (AR101 treatment or standard of care alone). Randomization will be stratified by age group (4-12 years and 13-17 years). Data for demographic and baseli ne characteristics, HRQOL scor es, efficacy, and safety will be summarized by treatment group (AR101 treatm ent vs standard of care alone). Summary statistics will include the mean, number of observations, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values for continuous vari ables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05 and tests will be 2- sided, unless otherwise specified. CIs will be calculated at the 95% le vel, reflecting a type I error rate of 0.05. Missing values for efficacy variables will not be replaced or imputed; no interpolation or extrapolation will be applied to missing values. 10.2 Analysis Populations The ITT population (ie, full analysis set) will be defined as all subjects who receive any part of 1 dose of study product and co mplete 1 study visit if assigned to AR101 treatment, or who complete 1 study visit after the sc reening visit if assigne d to standard of care alone. The ITT population will be used for all HRQOL and effic acy analyses unless otherwise specified, and analyzed according to randomized treatment. If no subjects r eceive the incorrect treatment, the ITT population will be the sa me as the safety population. The AR101 completer population will be defined as all AR101-treated subjects in the ITT population who complete the exit visit (ie, do no t discontinue early). The standard of care completer population will be defined as all subjects in the ITT population receiving standard"
79,page_79,"Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 79 of 122 of care alone who complete the OLFC after 12 months of observation and who complete the exit visit. The AR101 per protocol population may be defined if it is sufficiently different from the AR101 completer population. The AR101 per protocol population will include all subjects in the AR101 completer population who have no majo r protocol deviations. The standard of care per protocol population will be defined as al l subjects in the sta ndard of care completer population who have no major protocol deviations. The safety population will be defined as all subjects who receive any randomized study treatment (ie, who receive any part of 1 dos e of study product and complete 1 study visit if assigned to AR101 treatment or who complete 1 study visit after the screening visit if assigned to standard of care alone). The safety population will be used for all safety analyses and analyzed according to treatment received. 10.3 Determination of Sample Size This study will use multiple HRQOL questionnai res to assess changes across time in the HRQOL of subjects receiving AR101 treatment versus standa rd of care alone, and their parents/caregivers. The sample size for this study is based on estim ates for the FAQLQ-PF. A sample size of 144 subjects randomly assigned in a ratio of 2:1 to AR101 treatment (96 subjects) or standard of care alone (48 subjects) provides at least 80% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.75 in the adjusted mean total FAQLQ-PF scores at 18 months. The sample size calculation is based on an alpha of 0.05 and te sts are assumed to be 2-sided. The common standard deviation is assumed to be 1.5 ( DunnGalvin, 2010 ). Approximately 25% of subjects are estimated to drop out or discontinue early from the study. Therefore, approximately 200 subjects (134, AR101 treatment; 67, standard of care alone) will be randomly assigned to study treatment. 10.4 Interim Analyses No interim analyses are planned. 10.5 Analyses of HRQOL The primary objective assesses HRQOL of s ubjects receiving AR101 treatment versus standard of care alone for approximately 18 months. No single endpoint is specified as primary becau se the study is not designed or intended to support a labelling claim. The primary analyses will be on a family of proxy- and self-reported disease-specific HRQOL measures that assess the HRQOL of the peanut-a llergic subject. The ITT population will be used for these analyses. Data summaries will be presented across time and accompanied by inferential analyses."

AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 80 of 122 The relevant disease-specific HRQOL questionnaires (FAQLQ-PF, FAQLQ-PFT, FAQLQ-CF, FAQLQ-TF, FAIM-PF, FAIM-PFT, FA IM-CF, and FAIM-TF) are described in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. As the number of items and domains vary by instrument, the exact algorithms used to calculate the total and domain scores, where defined, and the rules for handling missing data will be described in the statistical analysis plan. Missing data for follow-up questionnaires completed after early discontinuation will not preclude the execution of the primary analyses. Data will also be summarized separately by age group as appropriate for the questionnaire evaluated. Descriptive statistics for the FAQLQ-PF questio nnaire, completed by the parent/caregiver of subjects aged 4 to 12 years, will be presente d for the total score, domain scores, individual questions, and changes from baseline across time. As a supporting analysis, analysis of covari ance (ANCOVA) will be performed on the ITT population to assess the change fr om baseline in the total F AQLQ-PF score and each of the domain scores at study exit (approximately 18 months). Adjustment will be made for treatment and country as main effects; baselin e score will be fitted as a covariate. The least squares mean of the treatment differe nces for AR101 treatment versus standard of care alone will be presented together with th e corresponding 2-sided 95% CI and p-value. The null (H 0) and alternative (H 1) hypotheses for these analyses (ie, total FAQLQ-PF score and each domain score) are as follows:  H0: there is no difference between groups in the mean change from baseline for AR101 treatment and standard of care alone  H1: there is a difference between groups in the mean change from baseline for AR101 treatment and standard of care alone Such that: H0 μAR101 = μstandard of care alone H1 μAR101 ≠ μ standard of care alone where μAR101 is estimated by the mean change from baseline from the ANCOVA in the AR101 treatment group and μstandard of care alone by the mean change from baseline from the ANCOVA in the standard of care alone group These analyses may be repeated for the comp leter population and the pe r protocol population (if defined). Similar data presentations and analyses will be provided for the other disease-specific HRQOL questionnaires (FAQLQ-PFT, FAQL Q-CF, FAQLQ-TF, FAIM-PF, FAIM-PFT, FAIM-CF, and FAIM-TF). Full details will be provided in th e statistical analysis plan."

Other questionnaires include the EQ-5D, FAQL-PB, HADS, and TSQM-9. Bespoke questions in clude global assessmen t of HRQOL, assessment of control of peanut allergy and confidence in managing al lergic reactions, assessment of experiences related to food challenges, and assessment of experience and sa tisfaction with AR101 treatment at study exit. 10.7 Analysis of Efficacy Desensitization response rates during the OLFC will be compared between treatment groups as follows:  The proportion of subjects tolerating a singl e dose of 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) of peanut protein with no or mild symptoms in the OLFC after approximately 12 months of study treatment  The proportion of subjects tolerating a si ngle dose of 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein with no or mild sy mptoms in the OLFC after approximately 12 months of study treatment  The proportion of subjects tolerating a si ngle dose of 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein with no or mild sy mptoms in the OLFC after approximately 12 months of study treatment The ITT population and Fisher exact test will be used for these analyses. For each endpoint, subjects tolerating the indicated single challenge dose of pea nut protein will be considered responders; subjects who do not tolerate the indi cated single challenge do se of peanut protein will be considered nonresponders. Nonresponders will also include subjects who withdraw consent or discontinue early before having the OLFC, and subjects who do not reach the 300 mg/day dose or maintain a 300 mg daily dose of study product for 12 months. Desensitization response rates and associated 95% CIs will be presented for each treatment group using exact Clopper-Pearson CIs. Th e 95% CI for the treatment difference (desensitization rate for AR101 treatment minus desensitization rate for standard of care alone) will be based on exact unconditional confidence limits using the score statistic. Additional efficacy endpoints will be assessed as follows: The maximum dose reached with no or mild symptoms at the OLFC will be assessed by tabulating the number and per centage of subjects by maximu m dose at the OLFC and by treatment group. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics with equally spaced scores (row mean score differences statistic) stratified by country will be used to test for a treatment difference. The maximum severity of symptoms occurring at each challenge dose of peanut protein during the OLFC will be assessed by tabulating the number and percentage of subjects by"

The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics with equally spaced scores (row mean score differences statistic) stratified by country will be used to test for a treatment difference. The proportion of subjects successfully comple ting the RWPC with no or mild symptoms after approximately 13 months of AR101 treat ment will be assessed by presenting the response rate and the associated 95% CI using an exact Clopper-Pearson CI. The maximum severity of symptoms during th e RWPC after approximately 13 months of AR101 treatment in eligible subjects who cons ented to the RWPC will be assessed by tabulating the number and percentage of subjects by maximum severity. Full details will be provided in th e statistical analysis plan. 10.8 Analysis of Safety All safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. Safety data will be listed and summarized by treatment received. Descriptive statistics will be used. Safety data will be collected from signed informed consent/assent through early discontinuation or study exit, and through at leas t 30 days after early discontinuation or study exit for subjects with unresolved adverse events or through at least 6 months after early discontinuation or study exit for subjects with GI adverse events of interest. Adverse events will be classified by system orga n class and coded to preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (M edDRA). Adverse events will be classified by severity using the CoFAR grading system for allergic reactions, EAACI guidelines for anaphylaxis, and CTCAE for all other adverse events ( Section 8.4 ). Summaries of the safety of AR101 treatment a nd standard of care alone during the study will include the following:  Overall summary of adverse events  Incidence of all nonserious and serious adverse events  Incidence of adverse events by severity grade  AR101 treatment only: – Incidence of adverse events dur ing up-dosing and maintenance – Incidence of adverse events with onset < 90 minutes after AR101 dosing at the study site – Incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse events – Incidence of treatment-related adverse events during up-dosing and maintenance – Incidence of treatment-related adverse events with onset < 90 minutes after AR101 dosing at the study site"

The data management plan will include a list of the standard operating procedures that apply to this study. Adverse events and medications will be coded using MedDRA and the WHO-DD, respectively. The dictionary versions will be named in the data management plan. 13.2.2 Case Report Forms The study will use an electronic data capture system, and a guide will be provided for completing case report forms. All case report fo rms are to be fully completed, reviewed, and signed by the investigator or subinvestigat ors listed on the Form FDA 1572 or other appropriate local regulator y authority documents. 13.2.3 Study Monitoring The sponsor or designee will monitor this study in accordance with current GCP guidelines. By signing this protocol, the investigator grants permission to the s ponsor or designee and appropriate regulatory authori ties to conduct onsite monitoring of all appropriate study documentation. To ensure the accuracy of data collected on the case report forms, it is mandatory that sponsor representatives (eg, st udy monitor) have direct access to original source documents (eg, paper or electronic subj ect records, subject charts, and laboratory reports) needed to verify the entries on case report forms. During the review of these documents, the anonymity of the subject will be respected with strict adherence to professional standards of confidentiality. A study monitor will contact and visit the site regularly and will be allowed, on request at a mutually acceptable time, to inspect the various original medical records/source documents (paper or electronic) relate d to the study. The study mon itor will be responsible for inspecting the case report forms at regular in tervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the complete ness and correctness of all case report form entries. The investigator agrees to coopera te with the study monitor to ensure that any problems detected during these monitoring visits are resolved. 13.2.4 Study Audits During the study and after study completion, it is likely that one or more quality assurance audits will be conducted by the sponsor or author ized representatives, or both. The purpose of the audit is to ensure that the study is (or was) conducted and monitored in compliance with the protocol as well as recognized GC P guidelines and regulations. These audits will also increase the likelih ood that the study data and a ll other study documentation can withstand a regulatory authority in spection. If such audits are to occur, they will be arranged for a reasonable and agreed upon time."

All records must be made available to the sponsor, authorized representatives, and appropriate regulatory ag encies, upon request. Current ICH GCP guidelines and local and national regulations require the investigator to ensure that investigational pr oduct deliveries from the sponsor are received by a responsible person (eg, pharmacist), and the following:  That such deliveries are recorded, for ex ample, on the sponsor’s investigational product accountability log or othe r sponsor-approved pharmacy log  That investigational product is handled and stored safely and properly in accordance with the label and the study protocol  That investigational product is only admi nistered or dispensed to study subjects in accordance with the protocol  That any used or unused investigational pr oduct is returned by the subject at each required visit  That any unused investigational product is returned to the sponsor-designated facility or standard procedures fo r the alternative di sposition of unused investigational product are followed and only after appr oval by the sponsor representative  A detailed accounting of any investigational product accidentally or deliberately destroyed Investigational product inventory and accountability records for the investigational products will be kept by the study site. Investigati onal product accountability throughout the study must be documented. The following guidelines are therefore pertinent:  The investigator agrees not to supply investigational product to any persons except the subjects in this study.  The investigator/pharmacist will keep the i nvestigational products in a pharmacy or other locked and secure storage facility under controlled storage conditions as required by the investigational product label, accessible only to those authorized by the investigator to dispense th ese investigational products.  The investigator/pharmacist will maintain an investigational product inventory. The inventory will include details of materials received and a clear record of when they were dispensed and to which subject.  The investigator/pharmacist agrees to c onduct a final investigational product supply inventory and to record the results of th is inventory on the investigational product accountability record at the c onclusion or termination of this study. It must be possible to reconcile delivery records with those of used and returned investigational product. Any discrepancies must be accounted for. Appropriate forms of deliveries and returns must be signed by the person responsible."

A copy of the st andard institutional pr ocedure for destroying investigational products will be provided to the sponsor or designee upon request for review and approval before the first onsite destru ction. Unused inves tigational product not destroyed at the site must be returned to the sponsor-designate d facility at the end of the study or upon expiration. 13.4 Retention of Records The investigator must make original study data (paper or el ectronic) accessible to the study monitor, other authorized sponsor representa tives, and regulatory ag ency inspectors upon request. A file for each subject must be maintained that includes the signed informed consent and assent forms and copies of all source documentation related to that subject. The investigator must ensure the reliability and av ailability of source documents from which the information on the case report form was derived. Investigators must maintain all study documentation for at least 2 years following the approval of the investigational product, or until 2 years after the investigational product program is discontinued, or longer if requi red by local regulations. Study documentation includes but is not limited to all essential documents as defined in ICH E6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The sponsor or designee will not ify the investigator when any records may be discarded, but investigators must comply with local and national regulations. 13.5 Protocol Deviations The investigators and study site staff will conduct the study in accordance with the approved protocol. Any intentional or unintentional change, divergence , or departure from the study design or procedures will be considered a prot ocol deviation. Protocol deviations will be documented in accordance with the study manual and may include electronic data capture or other means. Where necessary, the investigator may deviate from the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to a study subject, although every effort should be made to discuss this with the sponsor medical monitor in advance. 13.6 Study Termination The sponsor will terminate this study following co mpletion of the study objectives, or earlier if deemed necessary. The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study anytime and for any reason. When the sponsor is aware of information on matters conc erning the quality, efficacy, and safety of the investigational products, as we ll as other important information that may affect proper conduct of the clinical study, the sponsor may terminate the study and send a written notice"

If an investigator or the invest igator’s EC intends to terminate participation in the study, the investigator must immediately inform the sponsor and provide the reason for it. 14 USE OF STUDY INFORMATION AND PUBLICATION The results of this study will be published or presented at scientific meetings in a timely, objective, and scientific ally and clinically m eaningful manner that is consistent with good science and industry and regulator y authority guidance, while addressing the need to protect the intellectual property of Ai mmune (sponsor), regardless of the study outcome. The data generated in this c linical study are Aimmune Confidentia l Information and the exclusive property of the sponsor. The sponsor’s writte n approval is required before disclosing any information related to this c linical study, and no investigator-initiated publications may be published until all protocol-defined primary and secondary endpoints are published in a manuscript. Every attempt will be made to minimize the interval between the completion of data analysis and publication of the study resu lts. The sponsor, in consultation with the authors, will make the final decisions on the timing of presentation of study endpoint data and the publication venues (congresses/journals). Each investigator agrees to submit al l manuscripts or c ongress abstracts and posters/presentations to the spons or prior to submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information, provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available to the investigator, and ensure scientific and clinical accuracy. The processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and presentations based on the data from this study will be detailed in the investigator’s clinical study agreement. Any formal publication of the study in which input of sponsor personnel exceeded that of conventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and the appropriate sponsor personnel. Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and all authors must meet the criteria for authorship established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Uniform Requirements for Manus cripts or stricter local criteria (ICMJE, 2015; updated ICMJE reco mmendations, 2016). The sponsor does not compensate for authorship of a publ ication and all authors will be required to disclose, as part of the publication submission, any potential conflic ts of interest, including pertinent financial or personal relationships with the sponsor or related entities, including sponsors of competing products that might be perceive d to be a source of bias. Authorship is decided on an individual basis and the sponsor’s publicati ons committee and sponsor representatives will mutually determine authors and their sequen ce on individual public ations based on the relative contribution of each author to the study and/or publication. Investigators in this study agree to have th eir name listed as an investigator in any publication reporting results from this study, whether or not they are an author on the publication."

AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 96 of 122 Appendix 1: Open-Label Food Challenge Procedures An open-label food challenge (OLFC) is a pr ocedure performed under medical supervision by feeding a test food product (peanut) in measured, increasing doses. Food allergic reactions can potentially deve lop and may be severe (eg, resulting in anaphylaxis). Incremental dosing may reduce the risk of severe allergic reac tions by allowing the procedure to stop for medical treatment when a reaction becomes apparent. The acceptable and safe procedures for study subjects participating in an OLFC as part of this protocol are described herein; additional proc edures may be required as spec ified in the protocol schedule of activities. The OLFCs conducted under this protocol wi ll follow procedures consistent with the Practical Allergy (PRACTALL) guidelines for safety, assessment, and scoring (Sampson, 2012 ). The food challenge consists of peanut (d efatted peanut flour mixture containing approximately 33% peanut protein [wt/wt]) mixed in a vehicle (matrix) food. The peanut flour mixture includes additional nonallergenic, powdered flavoring agents to help further mask the distinctive flavor of peanut and a sm all amount of oat flour. The OLFC will use the dosing schedule shown in Table 1 . Table 1: OLFC Challenge Doses Dose Number Peanut Protein Dose (m g) Cumulative Peanut Protein (mg) 1 3 3 2 10 13 3 30 43 4 100 143 5 300 443 6 600 1043 7 1000 2043 OLFC, open-label food challen ge. PROCEDURES General Safety Considerations A study physician will supe rvise all OLFCs. Personnel involved in an OLFC must be specifi cally trained in the management of acute allergic reactions. All necessary medications for tr eatment of an allergic reac tion and resuscitation equipment must be readily available, including epinephr ine, oxygen, antihistamines (both H1 and H2), beta-adrenergic agonists, corticostero ids, and intravenous (IV) fluids."

Study site staff should inform the subject and parent/caregiver in advance of the scheduled OLFC to communicate the following:  Review the events of the day (eg, study procedures, modality of the OLFC, possibility of extended observation) and addr ess any potential problems.  Confirm and document the appointment da te and time in the subject’s source documents.  Explain that the OLFC will be rescheduled in case of illness or symptoms such as wheezing, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea; the subject and parent/caregiver are to notify the study site if such symptoms develop before the OLFC.  Establish that the subject’s other atopic diseases (eg, asthma, eczema, rhinitis) are stable.  Instruct that the subject is to avoid antih istamines and other curre nt medications that may affect safety or interfere with the OLFC assessment for 5 half-lives of the medication before the OLFC begins. Re view the prescribing information to determine the half-life of each medication for the subject’s relevant age group.  Instruct that food and fluids (except for water and clear liqui ds) are to be withheld for 2 hours before the OLFC.  Instruct the subject to wit hhold the dose of study product on the day of the OLFC.  Determine the subject’s prefer ence/tolerance for the foods that may be used for the OLFC (chocolate or vanilla pudding, or appl esauce). Identify foods that must not be used for masking the product tested due to allergy. On the Day of the OLFC Check the protocol schedule of activities and complete any required procedures as specified before starting the OLFC. Confirm the following:  Subject has not administered study product.  Negative urine pregnancy test for all female subjects of childbearing potential.  No recent or active illnesses. Reschedule the OLFC if the subject is experiencing symptoms of an acute infection (eg, fever, recent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or any other illness that may interfere with the s ubject’s safety or interpretation of the results.

DOSING AND MONITORING DURI NG THE OLFC PROCEDURE Before Each Dose of the OLFC Measure and record vital signs (blood pr essure, heart rate, and temperature). Perform a focused physical examination, concen trating on typical targ et organ areas, and review vital signs.  The main target organ areas for an allergic response include the skin, oropharynx, and upper and lower respiratory, gastrointest inal, and cardiovascular systems.  Pay special attention to the subject’s ove rall appearance and demeanor, as early signals of anaphylaxis frequently display as changes from baseline in mood, level of anxiety, or concentration. Such changes can be subtle, especially in children who may not possess adequate verbal skills to describe their psychological distress. Progress to the next dose level after waiting 20 to 30 minutes if no dose-limiting symptoms or signs (physical fi ndings) of an allergic reaction are pres ent and the subject is willing. Doses may not be repeated in this OLFC."

The assessing physician is responsible for de termining whether the symptoms meet the criteria for dose-limiting symptoms. Suggested guidelines for the assessment of severity of specific symptoms of an allergic reaction are provided in Table 3 . When multiple symptoms are present, the severity of the most severe symptom will be used to determine whether symptoms are dose-limiting and the chal lenge dose level is tolerated. Table 3: Guide for Assessment of Allergic Reaction Symptom Severity by Organ System Organ System Mild Symptoms Mod erate Symptoms Severe Symptoms Skin Limited (few) or localized hives, swelling (eg, mild lip edema), skin flushing (eg, few areas of faint erythema) or pruritus (mild, eg, causing occasional scratching) Systemic hives (eg, numerous or widespread hives), swelling (eg, significant lip or face edema), pruritus causing protracted scratching, more than a few areas of erythema or pronounced erythema Severe generalized urticaria/angioedema/ erythema Respiratory Rhinorrhea (eg, occasional sniffling or sneezing), nasal congestion, occasional cough, throat discomfort Throat tightness without hoarseness, persistent cough, wheezing without dyspnea Laryngeal edema, throat tightness with hoarseness, wheezing with dyspnea, stridor Gastrointestinal Mild abdominal discomfort (including mild nausea), minor vomiting (typically a single episode), and/or a single episode of diarrhea Persistent moderate abdominal pain/cramping/ nausea, more than a single episode of vomiting and/or diarrhea Severe abdominal pain/cramping/repetitive vomiting and/or diarrhea Cardiovascular/ Neurologic Subjective response (weak, dizzy), or tachycardia Moderate drop in blood pressure and/or > 20% from baseline, or significant change in mental status Cardiovascular collapse, signs of impaired circulation (unconscious) General recommended actions for subjects experiencing allergy symptoms are as follows: Severe symptoms: All severe allergy sympto ms are dose-limiting a nd indicate that the current portion of the OLFC is positive.  Stop the OLFC, immediately initiate a ppropriate treatment, and closely monitor the subject. Moderate symptoms: Moderate allergy symptoms are considered dose-limiting with rare exceptions, and indicate that the current portion of the OLFC is positive.  Stop the OLFC, immediately initiate a ppropriate treatment, and closely monitor the subject."

AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 101 of 122 Mild symptoms: It may be difficult to pred ict whether mild symptoms will resolve or progress to more serious symptoms. In this si tuation, safety is paramount. Certainty about the outcome must be weighed against the risk to the subject. In the event of mild symptoms, the determination of tolerability and progression to the next dose in the OLFC must be based on clinical judgment. The following general guidelines may help de termine whether a dose associated with the emergence of a mild symptom or symptoms was tolerated. A dose eliciting only mild symptoms may be considered tolerated if the symptoms are characterized by the following:  Are isolated to a single organ system  Resolve with no pharmaceutical intervention  Do not worsen in intensity or distribution over time  Resolve or show definite signs of resolving in under 1 hour  Do not include objective wheezing An example of a mild symptom that may pe rmit continued dosing is mild, self-limited pruritus that resolves without treatment. However, if an allergic response to dosing is characterized by mild symptoms that do not meet all of these criteria (eg, the subject has mild symptoms occurring in 2 or more organ systems or requires treatment of any type, th e symptoms show progression in severity or distribution over time, the reacti on is protracted or includes objective wheezing), then the dose may be assessed as not tolerated even t hough the individual alle rgy symptoms may be mild. Stop the OLFC and initia te appropriate treatment . At the physician’s discretion, the intervals between doses may be extended (eg, to 35 or 40 minutes) to determine whether the observed signs and symptoms represent a worsening allergic reaction. In this case:  Close observation is mandatory.  Measure vital signs (blood pressure, heart ra te, temperature) at least every 15- to 20-minutes postdose for the duration of the extended observation and record them in the subject’s source documents. The physician may elect to stop the OLFC due to subjective symptoms or if the subject refuses to proceed (eg, due to significant anxi ety) even if no objective allergy symptoms are documented. OLFC OUTCOMES AND TREATMENT / OBSERVATION Negative OLFC Release the subject if no sympto ms are detected by the end of the 2-hour observation period after the last dose."

AR101 ARC009 Protocol Amend 1.0 11 Apr 2018 - FINAL Aimmune Confidential Information Page 102 of 122 Positive OLFC Treatment of subjects with symptoms: Trea t subjects with any symptoms elicited by the OLFC per the accepted medical practices at the study site. R ecord all treatments administered for allergic reactions during an OLFC in the subject’s source documents and on case report forms. Following the initial treatment: Repeat treatments as needed, at the discretion of the physician. Monitor vital signs (blood pressure, heart ra te, temperature) at least every 15 minutes until symptoms resolve, then 30 and 60 minutes after symptoms resolve, then hourly until releasing the subject. Monitor pulse oximetry if laryngeal, lower re spiratory, or cardiovascular symptoms are present. Follow these guidelines for further observation based on symptom severity:  For severe symptoms, observe the subj ect for a minimum of 3 hours after the symptoms resolve, either at the study site or an emergency facility, as appropriate. Consider extended overnight observation if symptoms are protracted.  For moderate symptoms, observe the subject for a minimum of 2 hours after the symptoms resolve, and longer if necessary.  For mild symptoms, observe the subject for a minimum of 2 hours or for 1 hour after the symptoms resolve, whichever is longer. Do not release a subject with symptoms or with abnormal vital signs if changed from baseline. As appropriate, arrange for c ontinued observation at the study site, an emergency facility, or an extended-stay (inpatie nt) unit. Record signs and symptoms that changed from baseline in the subject’s source documents. Generally, if the emergence of allergy symptoms halts the OLFC, consider the last symptom-eliciting dose to be “not tolerated” and record it as such on the case report form.  Exceptions to this guidance may include situ ations where the OLFC is halted (eg, due to anxiety or refusal to continue) and symp toms are mild and not considered to be dose-limiting. POST-OLFC INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW-UP Before releasing the subject, study site staff should inform the subject a nd parent/caregiver of the following: The subject may resume eating and drinking with out restrictions 30 minutes after the last OLFC dose is administered. Subjects who tole rate at least 300 mg of peanut protein at the OLFC will resume study treatment (AR101 or standard of care alone) the day after the OLFC. Review the possibility of delayed allergy symptoms and provide guidance on how to recognize anaphylaxis."
