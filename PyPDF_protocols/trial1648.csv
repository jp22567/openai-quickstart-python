Sustained use of SCS is associated with significant side effects, including growth retardation in children, as well as osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular advers e events, muscular weakness, skin atrophy and cataract. This translates in an advantage for AE avoidance for those patients that do not use any SCS. Alternative asthma therapies that reduce the need for SCS are urgently needed, especially if given orally, such as fevipiprant. The overall purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of fevipiprant (150 mg and 450 mg once daily), compared with placebo, as add-on to GINA 2018 treatment step 4 or 5 standard -of-care (SoC) asthma therapy, in terms of avoidance of SCS use over 52 weeks. This will be measured in patients with inadequately controlled severe asthma (Asthma Control Questionnaire score (ACQ -5) ≥ 1.5) and high eosinophil counts (eosinophil count at Screening Vis it ≥ 250 cells/µl), and in the overall patient population regardless of eosinophil counts. Primary Objective(s)In patients with severe asthma and high eosinophil counts receiving flexible SoC asthma therapy, to demonstrate a reduction in the use of SCS w ith fevipiprant, compared with placebo. In all patients with severe asthma receiving flexible SoC asthma therapy, to demonstrate a reduction in the use of SCS with fevipiprant , compared with placebo. Secondary ObjectivesTo evaluate the effect of fevipiprant and flexible SoC asthma therapy, compared with placebo and flexible SoC asthma therapy in terms of proportion for patients with no SCS use from the overall population To evaluate the effect of fevipiprant and flexible SoC asthma therapy, compared with placebo and flexible SoC asthma therapy in terms of general safety / tolerability in the overall population To evaluate the effect of fevipiprant and flexible SoC asthma therapy, compared with placebo and flexible SoC asthma therapy in terms of proportion of patients receiving continuous SCS during ≥ 30 days, at ≥ 7.5mg/day of prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) in the overall population To evaluate the effect of fevipiprant and flexible SoC asthma therapy, compared with placebo and flexible SoC asthma therapy in terms of Asthma Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ+12) in the overall population To evaluate the efficacy fevipiprant and flexible SoC asthma therapy, compared with placebo and flexible SoC asthma therapy, with respect to change from b aseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ -5) in the overall population To evaluate the effect of fevipiprant and flexible SoC asthma therapy, compared with placebo and flexible SoC asthma therapy in terms of time to first prescription of biologic therapy in the overall population To evaluate the effect of fevipiprant and flexible SoC asthma therapy, compared with placebo and flexible SoC asthma therapy in terms of difference in dayt ime and nighttime symptom scores"

The randomization will be stratified according to patients peripheral bloo d eosinophil count (< 250 cells/μl or ≥ 250 cells/μl). Primary analy sis: The primary endpoint of the study is total systemic corticosteroid dose in mg prednisone/prednisolone or equivalent over 52 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint will be analyzed in subpopulation of patients with eosinophil count ≥ 250 cells/µl and in overall population. Demonstration of total systemic corticosteroid SCS dose used in mg over 52 weeks of treatment for subpopulation of patients with eosinophil count ≥ 250 cells/µl andin overall population will be evaluated using the following primary null hypothesis: H01 450 eosinophil subgroup: the distribution of the total SCS dose (in mg) in Fevipiprant 450 mg QD plus SoC is equivalent to the distribution of the total SCS dose (in mg) in placebo plus SoC in patients with eosinophil count ≥ 250 cells/µl H02 150 eosinophil subgroup: the distribution of the total SCS dose (in mg) in Fevipiprant 150 mg QD plus SoC is equivalent to the distribution of the total SCS dose (in mg) in placeb o plus SoC in patients with eosinophil count ≥ 250 cells/µl H03 450 overall population: the distribution of the total SCS dose (in mg)in Fevipiprant 450 mg QD plus SoC is equivalent to the distribution of the total SCS dose (in mg) in placebo plus SoC for the overall population"
13,page_13,"Novartis Confidential Page 14 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 H04 150 overall population: the distribution of the total SCS dose (in mg)in Fevipiprant 150 mg QD plus SoC is equivalent to the distribution of the total SCS dose (in mg) in placebo plus SoC for the overall population The familywise type I error rate will be controlled at the two-sided 5% level across the primary null hypotheses using graphical approach.The total systemic corticosteroid dose in mg prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) over 52 weeks of treatment will be analyzed us ing the Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney rank sum test (Van Elteren test). For overall population analysis will be stratified by randomization stratum –blood eosinophils levels (≥ 250 cells/µl and < 250 cells/µl). For subgroup with blood eosinophils ≥ 250 cells/µl, analysis will not include stratification factor. The summary statistics for total SCS dose by treatment group will be provided. The total SCS dose data will be aggregated into monthly data for analysis. For the patients discontinuing treatment early, the total SCS dose for 52 weeks will be obtained as annualized SCS dose. For example if patient took 280 mg for 7 months then for 12 months patient will be taking 280*12/7 = 480mg total SCS dose. Efficacy data collected during the use of biologics will be set to missing, since use of biologics can confound efficacy data. After replacing SCS dose with missing, patient will not have data available for all 12 months, thus total SCS dose will be obtained as annualized dose. Secondary analy sis: The proportion of pat ients with free of SCS use over 52 weeks treatment will be summarized by treatment and analyzed using logistic regression in overall population. The model will include treatment and randomization strata as covariates. The proportion of patients requiring ≥7.5mg systemic corticosteroid dose in mg prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) per day continuously for at least 30 days in 52 weeks treatment period will be summarized by treatment and analyzed using logistic regression in overall population. The mode l will include treatment and randomization strata as covariates. The AQLQ+12 and ACQ -5 score will be analyzed using a MMRM with an unstructured covariance structure with factors for treatment group, time and randomization stratum, as well as the baseline values as continuous linear covariates. The time to first prescription of biologic therapy from first dose of study treatment received over 52 weeks of treatment will be summarized by treatment group. Between -treatment differences will be evaluated using cox regression model. Change from baseline in each endpoint (daytime and nighttime symptom score) will be analyzed using mixed models repeated measures (MMRM) model with factors as treatment group, randomization strata, time interval, time interval by treatment group interaction and the associated baseline as continuous linear covariate. Safety analysis will be based on safety set and analysis will be presented by treatment group. Safety summaries will be provided based on on-treatment data. The on-treatmen t period lasts from the date of first administration of study treatment to 14 days after the date of the last actual administration of any study treatment. Key words Efficacy and safety of QA W039, OCS avoidance, placebo -controlled, add -on to standard of care, flexible background therapy, uncontrolled severe asthma, female and male patient >= 18 years"

Despite existing therapies, there is still significant unmet medical need in asthma, with an estimated 300 million people affected worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 15 million disability – adjusted life years are lost annually due to asthma, representing 1% of the total global burden. It is estimated that asthma accounts for about 1 in every 250 deaths worldwide (Masoli et al 2004). Severe asthma is defined as asthma that requires treatment with high dose of inhaled corticosteroids (I CS) plus a second controller and/or s ystemic corticosteroids (SCS), including both oral (OCS) and injectable administration, to prevent it from becoming ""uncontrolled"" or that remains ""uncontrolled"" despite this therap y. Severe asthma is a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple phenotypes ( American Thoracic Societ y 2000 ). In severe asthma, large cumulative doses of corticosteroids and, in particular, SCS are used to treat patients to maintain control. In a matched cohort study on patients suffering with severe asthma and receiving OCS or not, Zazzali at al. assessed an United States (US) commercial health care claims and found OCS use to be common: 60% of patients with asthma filled at least one OCS prescription over a 2 -year period, ( Zazzali et al 2015 ). Patients in the high -OCS group had a mean prednisone -equivalent dose exposure of 4592 mg during the 2 years-study period, compared with 0 mg for the no-OCS group. Moreover, according to data from the Healthcare Cost and U tilization Project (HCUP), corticosteroids were the most common cause of drug- related complications in 2004, accounting for 10% of all drug-related complications and 141,000 hospital stays in the US (Elixhauser A, HCUP Statistical Brief #29. April 2007). Although effective in patients with severe asthma, the use of SCS may be associated with serious sy stemic side effects such as osteoporosis, cataract, glaucoma, hy pothalamic -pituitary - adrenal axis suppression disorders (i.e. iatrogenic form of Cushing’s syndrome, adrenal insufficiency , and growth inhibition), myopathies (such as myalgia and muscle atrophy ), psychiatric disorders, diabetes, hypertension and an increased risk of infection (Schäcke et al2002). Given the prevalent use of SCS in patients with severe asthma, it is important to characterize the adverse effects associated with SCS treatment in asthmatic patients to better understand the comparative risks. Hence, the review of several recent studies helps understa nd the range of toxicity presented b y SCS: In a recent anal ysis of the UK Optimum Patient Care Research Database (OPCRD) and British Thoracic Societ y (BTS) Difficult Asthma registry , most subjects (92% –93%) with severe asthma examined had at least one cond ition linked to sy stemic corticosteroid exposure, with significantly higher prevalence rates than in subjects with mild/moderate asthma and in subjects without asthma ( Sweeney et al2016). In a retrospective study using administrative claims data from a subset of asthma patients from a U.S. large commercial database between 2003 and 2014, Dalal et al. found that patients continuously exposed for > 6 months with low (< 5 mg/day), medium (≥ 5-10 mg/day ) and high (> 10 mg/d ay) systemic corticosteroid exposure had a 1.36- fold, 2.28- fold, and 2.42 -fold risk, respectivel y, of developing bone -and muscle -related complications,"
15,page_15,"Novartis Confidential Page 16 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 such as fractures, relative to patients without exposure to systemic corticosteroid (Dalal et al 2016 ). De Vries et al. reported a significantl y increased risk of developing fractures among obstructive airway disease patients exposed to an SCS compared to those never exposed. The total period of follow-up for each patient was taken as the time period from the first SCS prescription until the end of data collection for the UK General Practice Database. This total period of time was then divided into periods of current exposure and past exposure, with patients moving between current and past exposure. Each period of current exposure started with a SCS prescription and ended 3 months after the expected duration of SCS therapy . Depending on the t ype of fracture, they estimated a relative risk vary ing from 1.37 to 5.65 for pati ents with a cumulative dose of SCS between 1 gm and 5 gm, and from 3.00 to 10.61 for patients with a cumulative dose > 5 gm ( DeVries et al 2007). Lefebvre et al provided preliminary evidence that higher doses and conti nuous exposure to OCSs were associated with increased risk of AEs ( Lefebvre et al2015 ). The published literature shows that there is a correlation between intermittent or short burst SCS use and AEs, and also a cumulative toxic effect of multiple bursts. I n a retrospective cohort study of asthmatic patients 18 y ears and older in the 2000- 2014 US MarketScan data set, subjects taking 4 or more OCS prescriptions within the y ear had 1.29 times the odds of experien cing a new AE within the y ear. Each y ear of this kind of exposure resulted in 1.20 times the odds of having an AE per year. These patients had significantl y greater odds of AEs for osteoporosis, hy pertension, obesity , type 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal ulcers/bleeds, fractures, and cataracts (odds, 1.21 -1.44 depending on the AE). This indicates a cumulative burden on SCS exposure. Exposure to 1 to 3 OCS prescriptions per year was also statistically significantly associated with the development of current and future AEs ( Sullivan et al 2018). These studies showcase that intermittent or short bursts of OCS use increases the risk of the well -known side effects and comorbidities of SCS, and an additive effect of repeated doses . Hence, SCS -avoidance strategies, even of short- term bursts, are important to improve patient and populations well-being. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is one of the major prostanoid inflammatory mediators identified in asthma. The PGD2 type 2 receptor (DP2) usually mediates pre-inflammatory effects. Fevipiprant (QAW039) is a DP2 competitive antagonist in investigation in asthma. I t exerts its effect by binding to DP2 receptors on eosinophils, Th2 and ILC2 cells in the blood and tissues; thus, inhibiting migration and activation of these cells into the airway tissues and reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Chevalier et al 2005). Since these are the major effector cells and soluble factors driving airway inflamm ation in asthma, treatment with fevipiprant should result in a decrease in these parameters of airway inflammation as well as a clinical improvement in asthma, thus leading to a decrease of SCS therap y needs and a correlated decrease of the SCS -related AEs . In support of this premise are the results of Phase 2 studies of fevipiprant (Studies A2201, A2206, and A2208) in which fevipiprant demonstrated an improvement in lung function (i.e., forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) in the overall population of patients with a range of asthma severities (Study A2206), an improvement in asthma control in patients with more severe asthma as defined by a baseline predicted FEV1 < 70% (Study A2201) or in patients with a baseline Asthma Control Questionnaire -7 total score ≥ 1.5 (Study A2208), and a 71% greater reduction from baseline in sputum eosinophils for"
16,page_16,"Novartis Confidential Page 17 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 fevipiprant compared to placebo (geometric mean) in patients with severe asthma and sputum eosinophilia over 12 weeks of treatment. The current SCS avoidance study (Study A2323) presents a novel concept: it will measure future total systemic corticosteroid use when fevipiprant is added to SoC, compared with placebo, in severe asthma patients (Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] step 4 & 5) who are not on chroni c or maintenance use of SCS (i.e. regular SCS use for over 6 months) within the last year prior to study enrollment. This is different to the approach of the OCS sparing studies, which measure reduction of OCS in patients already using chronic OCS at basel ine. Considering that only a very small proportion of severe asthmatic patients (3.8%) use chronic OCS, and between 38% (US MarketScan database) and 59% (Bourdin et al 2018) of severe asthmatic patients receive bursts of SCS every year, we consider clinicall y and scientifically relevant to assess the use of fevipiprant to prevent or reduce the use of SCS in a real world setting where patient -individualized treatment is allow ed along GINA guidelines step 4 and 5, allowing flexibility (step -up and step- down) of background control therapy and add-on other maintenance treatment options. The flexibility of the background therapy allows the investigator to increase or decrease doses of medications, or to add or remove medications in the background therapy based on the level of asthma control (see Section 5.5.5 ). The background therapy will be determined by the investigator however a standardized guidance will be provided as a support documentation. 1.2 Purpose The overall purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of fevipiprant (150 mg and 450 mg once daily [OD]), compared with placebo, as add-on to GINA treatment step 4 or 5 standard - of-care (SoC) asthma therapy , in terms of avoidance of SCS use over 52 weeks. This will be measured in patients with inadequately controlled severe asthma and high eosinophil counts (eosinophil count at Visit 1 ≥ 250 cells/ µl) and in the overall patient population regardless of eosinophil counts. This stepwise approach is in line with the fevipiprant LUSTER pivotal exacerbation studies (Studies A2307 and A2314). Inadequate control is defined as partly controlled or uncontrolled asthma ( GINA 2018) with a value of Asthma Control Questionnaire score (ACQ -5) ≥ 1.5."

The study will include: a Screening period of up to 2 weeks to assess eligibility ; a Run-in period of 4 or 10* weeks to evaluate maintenance of asthma control and to collect baseline safet y data. Upon completion of the Run- in period, all patients who met eligibility criteria will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (Fevipiprant 150 mg or 450 mg or placebo once daily ) in a ratio 1:1:1. Randomized patients will be stratified according to their peripheral blood eos inophil count (< 250 cells/μl or ≥ 250 cells/μl); a Treatment period of 52 weeks and a Follow -up period of 2 weeks following the last dose of study drug to collect additional data for safet y variables.

The study will allow for flexible therapy , meaning that patients can be escala ted or de-escalated on their SoC therap y or add any other controller (this is explained in more detail in Section 5.5.5 ) 3.2 Rationale for study design The overall purpose of this study is to determine the ability of fevipiprant (150 mg and 450 mg once dail y) plus flexible SoC asthma therap y, com pared with placebo plus flexible SoC asthma therap y, to reduce the use of SCS in patients with severe asthma and high eosinophil counts (eosinophil count at Visit 1 ≥ 250 cells/ μl) as measured by total SCS use over 52 weeks. The study will also determine the ability of fevipiprant (150 mg and 450 mg OD) plus flexible SoC asthma therap y, compared with placebo plus flexible SoC asthma therapy , to reduce use of SCS use in the overall study population. The patient population will be described in more detail in the Section 4 below. The study will allow for flexible background therap y. As ment ioned previously, there is a correlation between SCS use and AEs. Sustained use of SCS is associated with significant side effects, including growth retardation in children, as well as osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular adverse events, muscular weaknes s, skin atrophy and cataract (Schäcke et al 2002). This translates in an advantage for AE avoidance for those patients that do not use any SCS. Alternative asthma therapies that reduce the need for SCS are urgently needed, especially if given orally, such as fevipiprant. Unlike SCS, fevipiprant can target factors that contribute to asthma severit y such as eosinophils. Hence the primary endpoint of this study is comparing the total SCS use and expecting a lower SCS use es pecially for those patients who normally would receive high SCS doses. This should translate in lowering the toxicity . Most of the clinical importance would be based on the reduction of the percentage of patients who are the highest users. Given the mentio ned correlation, they are the ones with the highest rate of AEs, so they would benefit the most. The reduction in number of AEs would be especially relevant for those with predisposing conditions. Almost all patients with severe asthma (92% -93%) had at lea st one condition linked to systemic corticosteroid exposure, (Optimum Patient Care Research Database), so the vast majority of the population would fall into this category . For yearl y SCS usage, 30 days is considered the time threshold for high usage (Dalal et al 2016; Zazzali et al2015 ). This encompasses both burst and chronic use. 3.3 Rationale for dose/regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment Fevipiprant will be adm inistered at doses of 150 mg and 450 mg once daily as oral film- coated tablets (FCTs) in this study . A 450 mg once dail y dose was selected for inclusion in the study based on the following: At a dose of 450 mg once daily , > 98% receptor occupancy is expect ed for the entire dosing interval in a “t ypical patient” at stead y state allowing inhibition of eosinophil migration over the entire treatment interval."
20,page_20,"Novartis Confidential Page 21 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 A 500 mg once dail y dose of fevipiprant was efficacious on the endpoint of pre -dose FEV1 in a sub -set of patients with percent predicted FEV1 < 70% at baseline in Study [CQAW039A2201] (proof -of-concept stud y). A 450 mg total dail y dose was also efficacious on the endpoint of pre -dose FEV1 in study [CQAW039A2206] . A total daily dose of 450 mg (225 mg twice daily ) was evaluated in Study [CQAW039A2208] in patients with severe asthma as add -on to SoC asthma therap y. In this study , fevipiprant caused significant reduction of sputum eosinophilia in patients with severe e osinophilic asthma. The reduction in sputum eosinophils was comparable to that observed with the anti -IL5 antibodies, Mepolizumab ( Pavord et al2012) and Reslizumab (Castro et al2011; Castro et al 2015). An association between reduction of eosinophilic airway inflammation and frequency of exacerbations has been reported in the literature (Haldar et al2009; Pavord et al 2012 ; Wenzel et al 2013; Takaku et al 2013 ), suggesting fevipiprant may also cause a reduction in the frequency of asthma exacerbations in patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma. The dose of 150 mg once daily was selected for inclusion in the study because it was the lowest dose of fevipiprant with “maximal efficacy ” on the endpoint of FEV1 in a prior dose-ranging study (Study [CQAW039A2206] ) in patients with moderate -to-severe asthma (GINA2018 treatment steps 4 and 5) as add- on to low -dose I CS. This dose is ½ log lower than highest dose. Since the fevipiprant dose of 150 mg was considered the optimal dose (i.e., lowest dose providing maximal efficacy ) in a prior dose-ranging study , doses lower than 150 mg will not be included in this study 3.4 Rationale for choice of comparator During the run-in period the background medication will be standar dized and all patients will receive: Salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. delivered by DPI (dry-powder inhaler) marketed as Seretide®Accuhaler®or Seretide®Diskus®depending on the countries, +/-tiotropium or any Long -acting muscarinic antagonist (LA MA) approved for asthma and/or Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists (LTRAs). During treatment period patients will be given fevipiprant or placebo as add on therap y in addition to the run- in treatment medications The use of placebo will permit the assessment of reduction of incidence of total dose of systemic corticosteroids within 52 weeks in patients who are treated with fevipiprant and SoC, in comparison to those continuing solely on existing SoC asthma therapy. Additionally , the use of placebo will permit a controlled evaluation of the safet y of fevipiprant in these patients. This study does not include an active comparator since fevipiprant will be given as add-on therap y to standard of care asthma therap y in patients with severe asthma (GI NA2018 treatment steps 4 and 5)."
21,page_21,"Novartis Confidential Page 22 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 3.5 Purpose and timing of interim analy ses/design adaptations Flexible scenario If the results of [CQAW039A2307] /[CQAW039A2314] studies are available before completion of recruitment of the CQAW039A2323 study, and in the case that an optimal dose of fevipiprant has been identified, the study team will decide whether to drop any fevipiprant dose or continue with current doses. There will not be an interim analysis for this study . Any change would be made based on external data and hence there would not be any alpha adjustment. At the decision point, the study team will assess the criterion below: [CQAW039A2307] /[CQAW039A2314] results do not recommend one of the fevipiprant dose due to safety concerns / lack of efficacy : In CQAW039A2323 study , recruitment in the corresponding treatment arm will be stopped. To keep the blind the ongoing patients on this arm will be switched to the other fevipiprant dose at the next drug dispensing visit. Final anal ysis will be based on comparison of selected fevipiprant arm and placebo arm at 5% significance level. The primary hypothesis will be tested first in the subgroup with blood eosinophil s ≥ 250 cells/µl and then in the overall population for the selected fevipiprant dose. Data collected on the non -optimal arm will be summarized but will not be used for statistical inference. Any modifications in CQAW039A2323 study will be contingent upon number of patients recruited at the decision point. At this decision point, CQAW039A2323 study data will not be unblinded to make a decision. The decision will be completely based on final results of [CQAW039A2307] /[CQAW039A2314] studies. Thus, there will not be any interim analysis performed for CQAW039A2323. This will control the ty pe I error rate adequatel y. Based on [CQAW039A2307] /[CQAW039A2314] results, one dose is selected for launch, and the decision is made that there is no need to compare the contr ol arm with the dose not selected. Then the testing strategy will be to only perform the comparison between the control arm and the dose selected. This flexible scenario strategy could reduce the total number of patients required to be enrolled in the stud y. 3.6 Risks and benefits Fevipiprant is a potent and highly selective oral DP2 antagonist being developed as a potential therap y for patients with severe asthma. DP2 is a receptor for PGD 2which mediates the activation and migration of T helper 2 (Th2) cells and eosinophils, some of the key inflammatory cell types in asthma. Recruitment of these cells into the lung is partly responsible for the intermittent airway obstruction which leads to wheezing and shortness of breath characteristic of asthma. The overall clinical experience with fevipiprant includes 24 studies: 15 (nine in healthy volunteers and six in patients) have completed and 9 (five in patients and four in health y"
22,page_22,"Novartis Confidential Page 23 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 volunteers) are ongoing. The completed phase 2 studies consist of four in patients wit h asthma, one in patients with allergic rhinitis and one in patients with atopic dermatitis (Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for information on the studies of fevipiprant). As of January 2018, over 2830 subjects have been exposed to fevipiprant i n the clinical program. Three Phase 2 studies in patients with asthma evaluated the effect of fevipiprant across the range of asthma severities (mild to severe). In these studies, fevipiprant demonstrated an effect on lung function (FEV1) in patients with moderate -to-severe asthma, and an improvement in quality of life scores and asthma control questionnaire scores in severe patients uncontrolled at baseline. In one study , fevipiprant also demonstrated a reduction in sputum eosinophils in patients with severe asthma. The potential benefits of fevipiprant therapy need to be balanced against its potential risks. Potential side effects of fevipiprant include: increased heart rate, non-serious arrhythmia such as palpitations, headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting , nasophary ngitis, somnolence and dizziness. In humans, one major metabolite of fevipiprant has been identified which is formed by glucuronidation (acyl glucuronide) and partially binds to plasma proteins. In the literature, in vivo binding of acyl glucuro nides to proteins has been reported to be associated with rare idiosy ncratic drug reactions (IDRs), although a causal connection of protein adduction to IDRs remains uncertain ( Regan et al 2010). There have been no IDRs observed with fevipiprant treatment in completed clinical trials as of January 2018. Taking fevipiprant at the doses used in this study with the cholesterol- lowering drug simvastatin has been shown to cause a small increase in the peak blood level of simv astatin. The risk to patients in this trial will be minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria and study procedures and close clinical monitoring. Patients on doses of simvastatin > 20 mg, doses of atorvastatin >40mg, doses of pravastatin >40mg, or doses of pitavastatin > 2mg per day (Elsby et al 2012 ; Deng et al 2008; Noé et al2007; Kalliokoski a ndNiemi 2009 ), as well as patients on any statins with high creatine kinase (CK) levels (> 2 X ULN (upper limit of normal)) at screening will be excluded from the study . Patients on statin medication who are included in the study will have regular monitor ing for relevant symptoms and be subject to discontinuation based on persistent myalgia and/or blood CK levels (Jacobson 2008). Cardiovascular risks will be monitored based on changes in vital signs, ECGs and biochemica l parameters. Monitoring of liver function tests (LFT) and renal function will be conducted as described in Section 14and Section 15, respectivel y, of this protocol. Surveillance of adverse event s for identification of idiosy ncratic drugs will be conducted. Refer to the [QAW039 Investigator’s Brochure] for further information about risks and benefits. 4 Population 4.1 Inclusion criteria Population eligible for inclusion in this study must fulfill allofthe following criteria: 1.Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to participation in the study and before any assessment is performed including any adjustment to asthma medication. 2.Male and female patients aged ≥18 y ears"

The investigational treatment (tablets) will be supplied in bottles. The matching placebos for QAW039 will be identical in appearance to their active counterparts and will be identicall y packaged."
27,page_27,"Novartis Confidential Page 28 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 5.1.2 Additional treatment On the start of the run-in period all patients will be given standard of care treatment (SoC) to be taken daily for the duration of the study: Open label salmeterol /fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. (Seretide ®delivered as powder via Diskus®/Accuhaler®) All patients will be provided with prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) tablets as the OCS for use during the study . Prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) will either be supplied to the investigator sites locall y by Novartis or be provided by the study center and reimbursed by Novartis. The stud y patients will have a written asthma plan, provided b y the Inve stigator, with instructions and information on how to self-manage their asthma daily , including taking medications appropriately and information on how to recognize and handle worsening asthma, and when, how, and who to contact in an emergency . The investi gator should fill in the medication and dosage the patient should be taking during self -management. Adjustments and follow -up of the asthma worsening/exacerbation event can be managed either on the phone or during an unscheduled visit. Unscheduled visits c an be necessary to evaluate the best treatment escalation for the patient’s current situation. This follows common medical practice, by which patients are prescribed OCS to be self-administered at home based on symptoms (Partridge 2004). The study patients will be instructed to make every effort to call the Investigator before taking the oral steroid and if not possible , as soon as they can, but not later than 48 hours after OCS intake has started. All patients will be provided with Short -acting Beta-agonist (SABA) (salbutamol/albuterol) which they will be instructed to use throughout the study as rescue medication to treat asthma symptoms on an ‘as needed basis’. SABAs will either be supplied to the investigator sites locally by Novartis or be provided by the study center and reimbursed by Novartis. 5.2 Treatment arms Patients will be assigned at randomization visit to one of the following 3 treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1:1 QAW039 150 mg once daily (one tablet of blinded QA W039 at 150 mg dosage strength to be given together with one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 450 mg) QAW039 450 mg once daily (one tablet of blinded QAW039 at 450 mg dosage strength to be given together with one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 150 mg) Placebo to QAW039 once daily (one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 150 mg and one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 450 mg) Patients will be instructed to take their investigational treatment (QAW039 or placebo) once daily in the morning without regard to tim e of food intake. SoC asthma therapy will be taken as directed b y the investigator. 5.3 Treatment assignment and randomization At randomization visit, all eligible subjects will be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to one of the treatment arms. The investigator or his/her delegate will contact the IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the patient, which will be used to link the patient to a"
28,page_28,"Novartis Confidential Page 29 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 treatment arm and will specify unique medication numbers for the first packages of study drug to be dispensed to the patient. The randomization number will not be communicated to the caller. The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure the treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from subjects and investigator staff. A patient randomization list will be produced by the IRT provider using a validated system that automates the random assignment of patient numbers to randomi zation numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produced by or under the responsibility of Novartis Global Clinical Supplies using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the investigational drug(s). Randomization will be stratified by peripheral blood eosinophil counts at Run-in Visit (< 250 cells/ml or ≥ 250 cells/ml). The randomization scheme for subjects will be reviewed and approved by a member of the Randomization Group. 5.4 Treatment blinding This study consists of a double -blind, double -dummy , randomized treatment period. Subjects, investigator staff, persons performing the as sessments, and data analy sts will remain blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock, using the following methods: (1) Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not be accessible by anyone else involved in the study. (2) For each dose level of QAW039, the identity of the treatment will be concealed by the use of matching placebo identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, taste, and odor to QAW039. A double -dumm y design is used because the identity of the study drug cannot be disguised, as the drug products are visibly different in size. Unblinding will only occur in the case of patient emergencies (see Section 5.5.9) and at the conclusion of the study .

Once assigned to a patient, the Subject Number will not be reused. Upon signing the informed consent form, the patient is assigned the next sequential number by the investigator. The investigator o r his/her staff will contact the IRT and provide the requested identify ing information for the patient to register them into the IRT. The site must select the case report form (CRF) book with a matching Subject Number from the electronic data capture (EDC) system to enter data. If the patient fails to be treated for any reason, the IRT must be notified within 2 day s that the patient was not treated. The reason for not being treated will be entered on the Screening period Study Disposition CRF. 5.5.2 Dispensing th e study drug Each stud y site will be supplied with study drug in packaging of identical appearance. The study drug packaging has a 2-part label. A unique medication number is printed on each part of this label which corresponds to one of the 3 treatment arms. Investigator staff will identify the study drug package(s) to dispense to the patient by contacting the IRT and obtaining the medication number(s). Immediatel y before dispensing the package to the patient, investigator staff will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that patient’s unique subject number. 5.5.3 Handling of study and additional treatment 5.5.3.1 Handling of study treatment Study treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safel y and properl y, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designees have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according to the instructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the"
30,page_30,"Novartis Confidential Page 31 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective Novartis Country Organization Quality Assurance. Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requ irements of each country . They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the patient except for the medication number. The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by monitors during site visits or remotely and at the completion of the trial. Patients will be asked to return all unused study treatment and packaging at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation of study treatment. At the conclusion of the study , and as appropriate during the course of the study , the investigator will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the Novartis monitor or to the Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at each site. 5.5.3.2 Handling of additional treatment The following non -study treatment and rescue medication has to be monitored: salmeterol /fluticasone 50 /500 μg b.i.d. or 50/250 μg b.i.d via Diskus®/Accuhaler®used as SoC prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) tablets (oral corticosteroids) used as rescue or preventive medication SABA (such as salbutamol 100 mcg or albuterol 90 mcg) tiotropium or ""an y LAMA approved for asthma"" LTRA (if started prior of study entry ) The non-investigational treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safely and properl y, and kept in a secured location to which only the investiga tor and designees have access. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of the non- investigational treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by monitors during site visits or remotely and at the completion of the trial. Patients will be asked to return all unused non -study treatments and packaging at the end of the study or at the time of disco ntinuation from the study . 5.5.4 Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment Study treatment will be double -blind, double -dummy , and placebo -controlled during the treatment period. QAW039 will be supplied as tablets. Since the tablets for QAW039 150 mg and QAW039 450 mg are not identical, treatment will be double -dummy and patients will take 2 tablets of study medication (one tablet of blinded QAW039 at 150 mg dosage strength to be given together with one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 450 mg or onetablet of blinded QAW039 at 450 mg dosage strength to be given together with one tablet blinded placebo to"

During the run -in period all eligible patients will start: Salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg b.i.d. delivered by DPI (dry-powder inhaler) is marketed as Seretide®Accuhaler®or Seretide®Diskus®depending on the countries +/-tiotropium (or anyLAMA approved for asthma) and/or LTRAs. If a patient experiences an asthma exacerbation during the run-in period, the patient is considered run -in failure and can be re-screened only once 6 weeks after full recovery from the exacerbation. At Randomization Visit, patients will be stratified according to their peripheral blood eosinophil counts at Run-In Visit (< 250 cells/ml or ≥ 250 cells/ml). Each randomized patient will then enter a 52 -week treatment period where they will receive one of the following 3 treatments: (i) QAW 039 150 mg once daily or (ii) QAW039 450 mg once daily or (iii) placebo once daily given on top of their individual background asthma treatment. All patients in this study will continue to receive their asthma medications as background treatment. The inves tigational treatment will be dispensed in medication packs (bottles) at dispensation visit during the treatment period to cover the treatment period between patient visits and to allow for late visits and other unforeseen events. All dosages prescribed anddispensed to the patient and all dose changes during the stud y must be recorded on the appropriate CRF. At clinic visits, patients will receive a witnessed dose of study medication. These in-clinic witnessed doses will be given after the completion of all pre-dose assessments (see Section 6 ) and should be given at approximately the same time at each clinic visit. Between clinic visits, patients will take study medication once daily in the morning. Patients will be instructed to take their study medication at approximately the same time each morning. All kits of study treatment assigned by the IRT will be recorded/databased in the I RT. The investigator must promote compliance by instructing the patient to take the study treatme nt exactly as prescribed and by stating that compliance is necessary for the patient’s safet y and the validity of the study . The patient must also be instructed to contact the investigator if he/she is unable for an y reason to take the stud y treatment as p rescribed . 5.5.5 Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment For patients who are unable to tolerate the protocol -specified dosing scheme, dose interruptions of investigational drug are permitted in order to keep the patient on study drug. The following guidelines must be followed: Any interruption of study medication should be for the shortest time period possible. Any interruption of an y duration must be recorded. To reflect as near as possible the clinical practice setting in this trial, there is freedom to use flexible asthma background therap y, allowing to escalate (“step -up”) and de-escalate (“step - down”) the asthma background medication."
32,page_32,"Novartis Confidential Page 33 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 Stepping -up asthma treatment As recommended by GINA guidelines (GINA2018 ), the treating physician may “step-up” patient’s background medication and/or add-on maintenance treatment options if they remain uncontrolled or experience asthma exacerbations. Examples of background medication and add- on other maintenance trea tment options: tiotropium (or any LAMA approved for asthma), oral or injectable corticosteroids, biologic therap y (only those approved for asthma, not in investigation and according to SmPC and local regulations), among others. These medications should be used according to approved local labels. Patients with “step -up” or add-on maintenance treatment(s) should continue on study treatment. NOTE: LTRAs are not allowed as part of the stepping -up asthma treatment. Stepping -down treatment when asthma is well con trolled As per GINA guidelines and as part of periodic reassessment of disease control the investigator should consider stepping down treatment once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained to find the minimum effective treatment that controls symptoms and exacerbations while minimizing side -effects (GINA2018). The treating ph ysician may “step -down” patient’s background medication according to GINA. The reduction of the dose of the ICS will be allowed after the investigator has withdrawn any other add-on medication such as OCS or tiotropium (or any LAMA approved for asthma). GINA guidelines recommend choosing an appropriate time for step- down (no respirator y infection, patient not travelling) and document baseline status (symptom control and lung function), provide a written asthma action plan, monitor symptoms, and book a follow -up visit. These changes must be recorded on the Prior and Concomitant Medications CRF. 5.5.6 Rescue medication At Run -InVisit all patients will be provided with a SABA, (primary rescue medication such as salbutamol 100 mcg or albuterol 90 mcg) which they will be instructed to use throughout the study as rescue medication on an ‘as needed basis’. Patients will be advised that between visits they can take their rescue medication for symptoms of asthma. Rescue medication (i.e., SABAs) will either be supplied to the investigator sites locally by the Novartis CPO or provided by the study center and reimbursed by Novartis. Nebulized salbuta mol/albuterol is not allowed as rescue medication and will not be supplied. As part of their written asthma plan, patients will receive OCS (add on rescue medication such as prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) tablets) to use as instructed by the treating physician. There will be an asthma plan (given as a reference) , which is described in Section 20and that will be used to standardize the initial rescue treatment of the acute asthma exacerbation and/or symptoms. To standa rdize measurements, patients will be instructed not to use their rescue medication upon rising in the morning on days requiring spirometric assessments indicated in Table 6-1, unless absolutely necessary . If SABA medication is taken within 6 hours prior to spirometry at any of the scheduled visits, the visit should be rescheduled to the next possible day. However, if spirometry is performed within 6 hours of the use of rescue medication then this information will be recorded by the study site staff. Daily use of SABA medication (the number of puffs taken in the previous 12 hours) will be recorded (once in the morning and once"
33,page_33,"Novartis Confidential Page 34 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 in the evening) by the patient on the eDiary as well as OCS intake. Unless clinically indicated, the typeof rescue medication (i.e., SABA) a patient uses, the device used to deliver the medication (e.g. dry powder or HFA) and the way it is administered (e.g. with a spacer device) should not be adjusted. 5.5.7 Concomitant medication The medications in Table 5-2are only permitted under the circumstances given. This table is not considered all-inclusive. Medications should be assessed for adherence to the indication and other inclusion/exclusion criteria. Table 5-3indicates the wash -out periods for allowed asthma medications prior to spirometr y assessments The investigator must instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications he/she takes after the patient was enrolled into the study . All medications, procedures and significant non-drug therapies (including physical therap y and blood transfusions) administered after the patient was enrolled into the study must be recorded in the concomitant medications / significant non -drug therapies eCR F. Each concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria/prohibited medication.

Most often, study treatment discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency condition. Emergency treatment code breaks are performed using the IRT. When the investigator contacts the system to break a treatment code for a subject, he/she must provide the requested subject identifying information and confirm the necessit y to break the treatment code for the subject. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified subject and a fax or email confirming this information. The system will automatically inform the Novartis monitor for the site and the study team that the code has been broken. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to the IRT/code break cards at any time in case of emergency . The investigator will provide: protocol number name (if available) subject number In addition, oral and written information to the subject must be provided on how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency, or when he/she is unavailable, to ensure that un -blinding can be performed at an y time. Study drug must be discontinued after emergency unblinding. Study drug must also be discontinued for any patient whose treatment code has been inadvertently broken or for any other non- emergency reason.

Study completion for a patient will occur after he/she has completed 52 weeks of treatment (through the follow -up visit) or they have prematurely withdrawn. Completion of the study will be when all randomized patients have completed 52 weeks of treatment and the post -treatment follow -up visit. Patients who have been screened when enrolment target has been met willbe allowed to proceed onto study participation. At the time of study completion or early termination, all patients will be placed on the appropriate asthma treatments as per the investigator judgement. For all patients a safet y follow -up visit should be conducted (e.g. by telephone) 14 days after last dose of stud y drug. The information to be collected at this follow up visit includes adverse events, and SAEs. When the patient has completed all scheduled study assessments or prematurely withdrawn from the study , the investigator must contact the IRT to record the patient completion /discontinuation and complete applicable eCRF. 5.6.2 Discontinuation of study treatment Discontinuation of study treatment for a subject occurs when study treatment is stopped earlier than the protocol planned duration, and can be initiated by either the subject or the investigator. The investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given subject if, he/she believes that continuation would negatively impact the subject's well -being . Study treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances: Withdrawal of informed consent (and the investigator must prematurel y withdraw the patient from the study ); Pregnancy ; Female subjects non -compliant with the chosen effective method of contraception during the study : The investigator must provide appropriate advice on the continued use of effective contraception for at least one week (at least 5 half-lives of QAW039) after stud y drug discontinuation and follow up with the subject as appropriate at least to the end of this period; Any protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the patient’s safety ; Liver laboratory test abnormality / event (see Section 14): Abnormal liver laboratory results r equiring discontinuation –refer to Table 14-2 - Appendix 2; If the investigator considers it appropriate after the confirmation of a liver safet y monitoring signal:"
37,page_37,"Novartis Confidential Page 38 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 ALT or AST ≥ 2.5 x ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN ( Section 14); Any laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator, taking into consideration the subject’s overall status, prevents the subject from continuing participation in th e study; Premature unblinding of study treatment for a patient for an y reason; please refer to Section 5.5.9; Total white blood cell count < 1000 cells/µL ; If patients on statin therapy complain of persistent muscle pain wi thout any obvious cause for greater than 3 day s accompanied b y increase in CK levels > 10 x UL N or persistent intolerable muscle pain regardless of the accompany ing CK level; If a patient develops a medical condition that requires consistent use of prohibi ted treatment as per Section 5.5.8 or if patient exhibits a behavior of non -compliance regarding prohibited medication. If discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to under stand the primary reason for the subject’s premature discontinuation of study treatment and record this information. Subjects who discontinue study treatment or who decide they do not wish to participate in the study further should NOT be considered withdr awn from the study UNLESS they withdraw their consent (see withdraw of informed consent section,). Where possible, they should return for the assessments indicated in the Assessment schedule ( Table 6-1). After study treatment discontinuation, at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following data should be collected at clinic visits or via telephone visits: new / concomitant treatments including OCS use adverse events / Serious Adverse Events If they fail to return for these as sessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g. telephone, e - mail, letter) should be made to contact the subject/pre -designated contact as specified in the lost to follow -up section. This contact should preferably be done according to the study visit schedule. If the patient cannot or is unwilling to attend any visit(s), the site staff should maintain regular telephone contact with the patient, or with a person pre-designated by the patient. This telephone contact should preferably be done according to the study visit schedule. The information alread y collected during the study including patient's samples will still be used according to applicable laws. The investigator must also contact the IRT to register the patient’s discontinuation from study treatm ent. 5.6.3 Withdrawal of informed consent Subjects may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any time. Withdrawal of consent occurs onl y when a subject: Does not want to participate in the study anymore, and Does not allow fu rther collection of personal data"
38,page_38,"Novartis Confidential Page 39 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) to understand the primary reason for the subject’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. Further attempts to contact the subject are not allowed unless safety findings require communicating or follow -up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the subject’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed in the assessment table. Novartis will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data resulting from the anal ysis of a subject’s samples until their time of withdrawal) according to applicable law. For US: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used for further testing/anal ysis in accordance with the terms of this protocol and of the informed consent form. For EU and RoW: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will no longer be used, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored according to applicable legal requirements. 5.6.4 Loss to follow -up For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the investigator must show ""due diligen ce"" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A subject should not be considered as lost to follow -up until due diligence has been completed or until the end of the st udy 5.6.5 Early study termination by the sponsor The study can be terminated by Novartis at any time for any reason. This may include reasons related to the benefit/ risk assessment of participating in the study , practical reasons (including slow enrollment), orfor regulatory or medical reasons. In taking the decision to terminate, Novartis will alway s consider the subject welfare and safet y. Should early termination be necessary , subjects must be seen as soon as possible (provide instruction for contacting the subject, when the subject should stop taking drug, when the subject should come for a final visit) and treated as a prematurel y withdrawn subject. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s interests. The investigator or sponsor depending on the local regulation will be responsible for informing IRBs/IECs of the early termination of the trial. 6 Visit schedule and assessments Visits must be scheduled to allow randomized study drug to be taken in the morning."

Patients must be seen for all visits on the designated day, or as close to it as possible. Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Patients, who discontinue study treatment before completing the study and will accept to remain in the study , will return for study visits as described in Section 5.6. If they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort should be made to contact them as specified in Section 5.6. At the very least, patients should be asked if they can be contacted by phone by study personnel at the date they would have been scheduled to end the follow up period (2 weeks after premature drug discontinuation) to ask about surgery and procedures, SAEs, AEs and asthma exacerbations. The following assessments are scheduled to be performed in order as follows: Patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires (i.e. AQLQ and ACQ), ECG, Vital signs (pulse rate, bod y temperature and blood pressure), blood sample/urine samples, followed by spirometry ."

Adverse events that are not SAEs will be followed b y the investigator or prim ary care ph ysician and collected onl y in the source data. All patients who have signed informed consent and have received high dose ICS/LABA medication, but discontinue prior to randomization (run -in failures) should have all data for the visits they atten ded and the summary pages (Adverse Event, Concomitant Medication, Dosage Administrative Record) completed. All adverse events occurring after informed consent is signed should be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF. Investigators will have the discretion to record abnormal test findings on the medical history CRF whenever in their judgment, the test abnormality occurred prior to the informed consent signature. 6.2 Patient demographics/other baseline characteristics Patient demographic and baseline characteristic data to be collected on all patients include: Age (calculated) Sex Race and ethnicity Patients initials (where allowed by local legislation) Height and Weight BMI (calculated) Baseline ph ysical examination (not databases other than in the context of releva nt medical history ) Vital signs ECG Date of diagnosis of asthma Relevant medical history/ current medical condition present before signing the informed consent Smoking history and status Asthma Quality of Life (AQLQ+12) Asthma Control (ACQ-5) Blood eosinop hil counts at Run- in Visit Prior concomitant medication (Both asthma related and non- asthma related) Pre and post -bronchodilator spirometry (run -in spirometry and reversibility testing)"
44,page_44,"Novartis Confidential Page 45 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 6.3 Treatment exposure and compliance Study drug compliance will be assess ed by the investigator and/or study personnel at designated visits by recording tablet counts from the previously dispensed bottles. This information must be captured in the source document at each visit. All study drug dispensed and returned must be recor ded in the Drug Accountability Log. Where necessary , the Investigator will discuss compliance issues with the patient. Start and end dates of only missed doses of study drug administered since the last dispensing visit will be recorded in the eCRFs (study drug dosage administration record summary page) at visits specified in the table of assessments ( Table 6-1). All doses of study drug taken at the clinic visits must be from the newl y assigned medication bottles, except at EOT Visit when the medication returned by the patient should be used. 6.4 Efficacy The following assessments of efficacy will be performed: Systemic Corticosteroids use Health Status (PROs: AQLQ+12, ACQ -5) Biologic therap y administered during the treatment period 6.4.1 Systemic corticosteroids use All patients will be provided with Oral Corticosteroids that can be used according to the asthma plan. The total amount of daily OCS (number of tablets taken in the previous 12 hours) will be recorded morning and evening b y the patient, in the eDiary /PEF Investigators should instruct patients to record any OCS intake during the treatment period, on the eDiary /PEF device. At each study visit investigators and/or study personnel will count the number of OCS capsules taken (as partof the drug accountability ), review OCS intake recorded on the eDiary by the patient, interview the patient on doses taken and enter it on the eCRF along with the start date, end date and the reason for the OCS intake. Patients will be asked to return all unused non-study treatments and packaging at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation from the study . During certain circumstances (e.g. Hospitalization) patients might be taken injectable corticosteroids. This data will also be collected on the eCRF. 6.4.2 Health status (Patient Reported Outcomes) A patient -reported outcome (PRO) is any report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directl y from the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else. Patient -reported outcomes may provide quantitative information for patients regarding the ‘impact on daily life’, which is of key importance, for patients and their physicians and also for health technology assessments.In this study , two PROs are used to assess the impact of uncontrolled asthma and the disease’s management: Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ+12) and the shortened version of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ -5).All PROs"
45,page_45,"Novartis Confidential Page 46 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 should alway s be completed before any other assessments are performed to avoid influencing the responses. When occurring at the same visit they are to be completed in the following order: AQLQ+12 and ACQ -5. 6.4.2.1 Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (A QLQ+12) The AQLQ+12 is a 32-item disease specific questionnaire designed to measure functional impairments that are most important to patients with asthma (the questionnaire is included in Section 19). It consists of 4 domains symptoms, emotions, exposure to environmental stimuli and activit y limitation. Patients are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each item on a 7-point scale (Juniper et al1992 , Juniper et al 1993, Juniper et al2005b). The overall AQLQ score is the mean response to all 32 questions. Clinically important differences in scores between any two assessments have been determined by the authors of the AQLQ. Changes in scores of 0.5 to 1.0 are considered clinicall y meaningful; 1.0 to 1.5 as moderate and > 1.5 as marked clinicall y important differences for an y individual domain or for the overall summary score ( Juniper et al 1994). The AQLQ shou ld be completed by the patient at the investigator's site as per the Assessment Schedule table (see Section 6). 6.4.2.2 Asthma Control Questionnaire (A CQ-5) In this study , the ACQ -5 will be used to assess improvements in asthma symptom control. The original ACQ consists of 7 items: 5 items on symptom assessment, 1 item on rescue bronchodilator use, and 1 item on airway calibre (% FEV1 predicted). As the Spirometr y assessments are performed centrall y, the rescue bronchodilator use and % FEV1 predicted are not included in the version of ACQ chosen for this study . The ACQ -5 will be self -administered at the clinic and it only takes a few minutes to complete. Patients will be asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and to respond to the symptom questions on a 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6=maximum impairment). The questions are equally weighted and the ACQ -5 score is the mean of the 5 questions and therefore between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrol led) (Juniper et al1999; Juniper et al 2005a ). The ACQ -5 should be completed by the patient at the investigator's site as per the Assessment Schedule table (see Section 6). 6.4.3 eDiary All patients will be provided with a patient electronic diary (referred to as eDiary /ePEF) to record daily asthma symptoms, peak flow, rescue medication (salbutamol/albuterol) and OCS use. Patients will be instructed to routinel y complete the patient diary twice daily –at the same time each morning and each evening, approximately 12 hours apart. The eDiary /ePEF recordings are to be reviewed at the clinic visits as detailed in Table 6-1until study completion. Sites and patients will receive appropriate training and guidance on the use of the eDiary device. The study will use the asthma diary (Santanello et al1997 ). The information detailed below will be collected in the eDiary /ePEF. Day time asthma sy mptoms will be rated on a 0 to 6 scale and nocturnal asthma s ymptoms will be rated on a 0 to 3 scale"
46,page_46,"Novartis Confidential Page 47 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 6.4.3.1 Daily Symptom Scores The asthma diary contains daytime and nocturnal asthma symptom questions as delineated below.

The measurements will be performed, using an eDiary /ePEF provided to the patients. Patients should be encouraged to perform mornin g and evening PEF measurements BEFORE the use of any rescue medication, and patients will be asked to record if they have taken their SABA medication 6 hours prior to the peak flow assessment. At each time point, the patient will be instructed to perform 3consecutive maneuvers within approximately 10 minutes. These PEF values are captured in the eDiary /ePEF"
47,page_47,"Novartis Confidential Page 48 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 6.4.4 Worsening of asthma (and related eDiary alerts) Asthma worsening criteria will be programmed into the eDiary /ePEF apart from criterion 4 below. The data captured in the eDiary /ePEF will be used to alert the patient and/or investigator to possible signs of worsening asthma. The investigator should instruct the patient to contact the investigator if the patient develops one or more of the following asthma worsening criteria at any time during the trial from the run- in onwards. Patients may also receive an alert via their eDiary requesting them to contact their investigator: 1.An increase in SABA use on at least 2 of an y 3 consecutive days exceeding the equiv alent of 8 puffs/day (diary alert) *; 2.Nighttime awakenings requiring SABA use on at least 2 out of an y 3 consecutive nights (diary alert)*; 3. <60% of PEF compared to baseline (diary alert)*; or 4. Urgent unscheduled clinic visit due to asthma- related deterioration. *Note: The baseline for the run-in period is set the start of Run-in. The baseline during the treatment is set at the beginning of treatment (Day 1). If patients develop any of the above criteria, the patient should notify the investigator and be evaluated by the investigator and treated as clinically appropriate. If any of these criteria are met while a patient is in the treatment or run -in periods of the study, they may be withdrawn if, in the opinion of the investigator, it is appropriate to do so. Worsening of asthma s ymptoms may require unscheduled evaluation between visits. Study site personnel must be available to monitor and document the patient’s progress until the asthma worsening has resolved. 6.4.5 Biologic therapy administered during the treatment period As part of the flexible therapy , investigators are allowed to prescribe biologics from randomization visit onwards. Given the delay to get access to the treatment in some countries, the date of prescription b y the investigator should be recorded in addition to the start date and end date of the treatment. The dose, unit and reason for the treatment will also be collected. 6.4.6 Appropriateness of efficacy assessments The measures described above are standard outcome measures in asthma studies. 6.5 Safet y The following safet y assessments will be performed: Medical history and phy sical examination Adverse events including serious adverse events Asthma Exacerbations"
48,page_48,"Novartis Confidential Page 49 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 Height and weight ECG Laboratory evaluations (Hematology , Blood chemistry including HbA1c, Urinaly sis) Pregnancy (female patients); additional pregnancy testing might be performed if requested by local requirements Serious asthma outcomes (asthma -related hospitalizations, intubations or deaths) Spirometry will also be used to monitor the safet y of patients during the study . Patients will be provided with an eDiary /ePEF. The data captured in the eDiary /ePEF will be used to alert the patient and/or investigator to possible signs of worsening of asthma. A central laboratory will be used to an alyze and report blood chemistry /hematology /urinal ysis and urine chemistries. A central ECG vendor will be used to collect, assess and report ECGs. 6.5.1 Medical history and phy sical examination A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening Visits and EOT visit, or TD (if a patient discontinues investigational treatment but continues with study participation). It will include the examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, ba ck, lymph nodes, extremities, vascular and neurological. If indicated based on medical history and/or symptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast, and pelvic exams will be performed. Information for all phy sical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the study site. Significant findings that are present prior to informed consent being granted must be included in the Relevant Medical History /Current Medical Conditions screen on the patient’s eCRF. Significant findings made after inform ed consent is given which meet the definition of an Adverse Event must be recorded on the Adverse Event screen of the patient’s eCRF. 6.5.2 Asthma Exacerbations The following definitions of exacerbations are used in this study . A mild asthma exacerbation is defined as one or more of the following: Increase of asthma s ymptoms An increase in SABA use on at least 2 of an y 3 consecutive days exceeding the equivalent of 8 puffs/day (diary alert) Nighttime awakenings requiring SABA use on at least 2 out of an y 3 consecutive nights (diary alert) <60% of PEF compared to baseline (diary alert) A moderate asthma exacerbation is defined as treatment with ‘rescue’ systemic corticosteroids for greater than or equal to 3 days either as an outpatient or in emergenc y depa rtment visits (Emergency department visit less than or equal to 24 hours)."
49,page_49,"Novartis Confidential Page 50 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 A severe asthma exacerbation is defined as: Treatment with ‘rescue’ sy stemic corticosteroids for greater than or equal to 3 day s and hospitalization; or Treatment with ‘rescue’ sy stemic corticosteroids for greater than or equal to 3 day s and emergency department visit (greater than 24 hours*); or Death due to asthma *An emergency room visit greater than 24 hours is considered to be a hospitalization. ‘Rescue’ systemic corticosteroi ds are tablets, suspension, or injection, or an increase of a patient’s maintenance systemic corticosteroids of ≥2 fold (i.e., at least doubling of the maintenance dose of sy stemic corticosteroids). A single depo -injectable dose of corticosteroid will be considered the equivalent to a 3-day course of systemic steroids (Reddel et al2009). Endotracheal intubations will be captured on the CRF. Scheduled spirometry should not be performed during an exacerbation until it hascompletely resolved. If patients experience an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids, hospitalization, or emergency room visit during the screening period, they may be re -screened once with the re-screening of the patient occurring 6 weeks or more after recovery from the asthma exacerbation. In case of an asthma exacerbation, the patient should be encouraged b y the site to contact it for advice. If necessary , an unscheduled visit to the site may be arranged. 6.5.3 Vital signs Vital signs will be performed at site visits specified in the table of assessments (Table 6-1). Measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature. 6.5.4 Height and weight Height in centimeters (cm) will be measured at the visits specified in the table of assessments (See Table 6 -1). Body weight (to the nearest 0.1 kilogram [kg] in indoor clothing, but without shoes) will be measured at the visits specified in the table o f assessments (See Table 6-1). Body Mass Index (BM I) will be calculated as the weight in kg divided by the height in meters squared. 6.5.5 Laboratory evaluations A central laboratory will be used for analysis of all specimens detaile d in this section.

Other reflex testing will be performed as outlined in the laboratory manual. 6.5.5.2 Clinical chemistry BUN/urea, creatinine, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, gamma - glutam yl transpeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, iron, bicarbonate, cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, glucose, uric acid, amy lase, lipase, CK -MB and Troponin - I (in response to CK results outside of the normal range), HbA 1c (collected at start of Run-in Visit and EOT only) and immunoglobulins (total and specific IgE, as specified in the laboratory manual), will be measured according to the assessment schedule in Table 6-1. Other reflex testing will be performed as outlined in the laboratory manual. If the total bilirubin concentration is increased 1.5 times and above the upper limit of normal range, the total bilirubin will differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting bilirubin. All patients with laboratory tests containing clinically significant abnormalities should be followed until the values return to within the normal ranges or until a clinical explanation is identified, even after study medication has discontinued. 6.5.5.3 Urinaly sis Urine for urinal ysis and urine chemistry will be collected according to the collection schedule in Table 6-1. All samples for urinal ysis and urine chemistry will be sent to the central laborator y for anal ysis. The urinal ysis evaluati on by the central laborator y will include a urine dipstick for specific gravity , protein, glucose, leukocy tes and blood and, if required, a microscopic examination. Urine chemistry and microscopic examination of the urine will be performed by the central laboratory as delineated in Section 15“Specific Renal Alert Criteria and Actions” and in Section 7.4 “Renal Safety Monitoring” of this protocol. Other reflex testing will be performed as outlined in the laboratory manual. 6.5.6 Electrocardiogram (ECG) ECGs will be measured according to the assessment schedule in Table 6-1. At Screening Visit, an ECG will be measured to test for eligibility for trial inclusion. ECGs must be recorded according to the ECG investigator manual in the supine position to ensure a stable baseline. The preferred sequence of cardiovascular data collection during stud y visits is PRO collection first, followed by ECG, and then other study procedures. TheFridericia QT correction formula (QTcF) must be used for clinical decisions. Single 12 lead ECGs are to be collected with ECG machines supplied by the core laboratory . Full details of all procedures relating to the ECG collection and reporting will be contained in an investigator manual to be provided to each investigator site. The original trace will be sent electronically for central review directl y fro m the ECG machine.

Each page of the ECG tracing must be labeled with study number (CQAW039A2323), subject initials (where this is allowe d according to local regulations), subject number, date and time, and filed in the study site source documents. For any ECGs with subject safet y concerns, two additional ECGs must be performed to confirm the safet y finding and copies forwarded to the centr al ECG laboratory for assessment. Clinically significant ECG findings prior to dosing with study drug must be discussed with the Novartis responsible person or designee. Clinically significant abnormalities must be recorded on the relevant section of the medical history /Current medical conditions/AE CRF / e(CRF) page as appropriate. In the event that the central cardiologist reports that an ECG is abnormal, then the investigator must comment as to whether the ECG abnormality is either clinically significant or clinically insignificant. If necessary a cardiologist may be consulted. 6.5.7 Pregnancy All women of child bearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test at start of Run -In Visit and a urine pregnancy test at all site visits. No pregnancy testing will beperformed when the visit is performed as a telephone call. Pregnancy testing will begin at the visit a patient is first identified as being of child bearing potential. In countries where monthly pregnancy testing is required for women of child -bearing pot ential by local laws or regulations, these patients will perform home urine pregnancy testing on the day of all telephone visits. These female patients will report the results of their home urine pregnancy test as “positive” or “negative” to study site staff as part of the telephone visit and the results will be recorded in source documents. A positive urine pregnancy test requires immediate interruption of study medication until serum β-hCG is performed and found to be negative. If positive, the patient must be discontinued from the study treatment. 6.5.8 Appropriateness of safety assessments The safet y assessments selected are standard for this indication/patient population. 6.6 Other assessments Not applicable 6.6.1 Clinical Outcome A ssessments (COA s) Please refer to Section 6.4.2"

Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. The investigator has the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual subject and identify ing adverse events. Novartis qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or proble ms. The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non -directive questioning of the subject at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered b y"
53,page_53,"Novartis Confidential Page 54 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 the subject during or between visits or through physical examin ation findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments. Adverse events must be recorded under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by the following information (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to Section 7.2.1) 1.The severit y grade mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities severe: prevents normal activities 2.its relationship to the study treatment. If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression of underl ying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) the assessment of causalit y will usually be ‘Not suspected’. The rationale for this guidance is that the symptoms of a lack of efficacy or progression of underly ing illness are not caused by the trial drug, they happen in spite of its administration and/or both lack of efficacy and progression of underly ing disease can only be evaluated m eaningfull y by an anal ysis of cohorts, not on a single subject 3.its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing, an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported. 4.whether it constitutes a SAE (see Sect ion7.2.1 for definition of SAE) and which seriousness criteria have been met 5.action taken regarding with study treatment 6.All adverse events must be treated appropriatel y.

Adverse events (including lab abnorm alities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underly ing signs and s ymptoms. Adverse event monitoring should be continued for at least 14 days (or 5 half-lives or end of study visit, whichever is longer) following the last dose of study treatment Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB). Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms they are considered clinically significant they require therapy"
54,page_54,"Novartis Confidential Page 55 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to b e non -typical in subjects with the underl ying disease. Alert ranges for laboratory and other test abnormalities are included in Section 13. 7.2 Serious adverse events 7.2.1 Definition of SA E An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing)] undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following criteria: fatal life-threatening Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the su bject was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the I CH-E2D Guidelines). results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition under study . elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre - existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deteriorat ion in the subject’s general condition treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopar dizes the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the subject or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Such events should be considered as “medi cally significant”. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse. (please refer to the ICH- E2D Guidelines) All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met."
55,page_55,"Novartis Confidential Page 56 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. 7.2.2 SAE reporting To ensure patient safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days following the last administration of study treatment must be reported to Novartis safet y within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requi rements are to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site. All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. If the SAE is n ot previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment, a Chief Medical Office and Patient Safety Department associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for health authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. Any SAEs experienced after the 30 day period following the last administration of study treatment should only be reported to Novartis Safety if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. 7.3 Liver safety monitoring To ensure subject safety and enhance reliability in determining the hepatotoxic potential of an investigational drug, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of liver events has to be followed. The following two categories of abnormalities / adverse events have to be consider ed during the course of the study (irrespective of whether classified/reported as AE/SAE): Liver laboratory triggers, which will require repeated assessments of the abnormal laboratory parameter Liver events, which will require close observation, follow-up monitoring and contributing factors are recorded on the appropriate CRFs Please refer to Table 14-1 -Appendix 2in Section 14for complete definitions of liver laboratory triggers and liver even ts."

During the study , Novartis employ s several methods of ensurin g protocol and GCP compliance and the quali ty/integrit y of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of data capture / data entry , the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized Novartis CRA organization. Additionally , a central analy tics organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis clinical teams to assist with trial oversight. The invest igator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject’s file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by the subject (a signed cop y is given to the subject). The investigat or must give to the filed monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the data capture and/or data entry . Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be disclosed. 8.2 Data collection Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the Electronic Case Report Forms using fully validated software that conforms to US CFR 21 Part 11 requirements. Designated investigator site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they have been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies and, by generating appropriate error messages, allow the data to be confirmed or corrected before transfer of the data to the CRO working on behalf of Novartis. The Investigator must certif y that the data entered into the Electronic Case Report Forms are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the patient data for archiving at the investigational site. 8.3 Database management and quality control Novartis personnel will review the data entered by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy . Electronic data queries stati ng the nature of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values and sent to the investigational site via the EDC sy stem. Designated investigator site staff are required to respond promptly to queries and to ma ke an y necessary changes to the data.

Data from these patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to which the patient was assigned at randomization. The full anal ysis set (FAS) will include all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. It was considered reasonable to limit the FAS to patients who took trial medication, because the decision on whether or not treatment is started will not be influenced by the treatment group assignment due to the effective treatment blinding procedures described in Section 5.4.

Directed edges between the vertices specify how the local significance levels are propagated in case of significant results. Initiall y, 50% of the alpha is assigned to each of the primary null hypotheses regarding the subgroup with blood eosinophils ≥ 250 cells/µl for the Fevipiprant 450 mg QD and Fevipiprant 150 mg QD doses, respectively . Once this first primary null hypothesis for a dose has been rejected, the alpha will be distributed to the other null hypothesis regarding the overall population for the same dose. If the null hypothesis regarding the primary endpoint for the overall population is rejected for a dose, then alpha is reassigned to the primary null hypotheses regarding the subgroup with blood eosinophils ≥ 250 cells/µl for the other dose. Alpha will only be reassigned from the null hypotheses for a dose to the null hypotheses for the other dose once all null hy potheses for the dose to which the alpha was originally assigned have been rejected. Statistical model for primary variable The total systemic corticosteroid dose in mg prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) over 52 weeks of treatment will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney rank sum test (Van Elteren test). For overall population analy sis will be stratified by randomization stratum – blood eosinophils levels (≥ 250 cells/µl and < 250 cells/µl). For subgroup with blood eosinophils ≥ 250 cells/µl, anal ysis will not include stratification factor. The summary statistics for total SCS dose by treatment group will be provided. The details and justification of primary as well as supplementary estimands are detailed in Estimand charter or statistical anal ysis plan (SAP). The primary estimand will quantify the treatment effect based on on- treatment data. The total SCS dose data will be aggregated into monthly data for analysis. The primary estimand will account for different post -randomization events as follows: Use of rescue medications: Efficacy data collected during use of rescue medication will be used for analy sis."
63,page_63,"Novartis Confidential Page 64 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 Early discontinuation of study treatment (prior to completing 52 weeks of treatment period): For the patients discontinuing treatment early , the total SCS dose for 52 weeks will be obtained as annualized SCS dose. For example if patient took 280 mg for 7 months then for 12 months patient will be taking 280*12/7=480mg total SCS dose. Use of biologics prior to discontinuation of treatment: Efficacy data collected during the use of biologics will be set to missing, since use of biologics can confoun d efficacy data. After replacing SCS dose with missing patient will not have data available for 12 months, thus total SCS dose will be obtained as annualized dose. 9.4.3 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations Some patients may discontinue early and may not complete the entire study duration. For the patients discontinuing treatment early, the total SCS dose for 52 weeks will be obtained as annualized SCS dose. For example if patient took 280 mg for 7 months then for 12 months patient will be taking 280*12/7=480mg total SCS dose. Efficacy data collected during the use of biologics will be set to missing, since use of biologics can confound efficacy data. After replacing SCS dose with missing, patient will not have data available for all 12 months, thus total SCS dose will be obtained as annualized dose. 9.4.4 Sensitivity analy ses The details on sensitivity anal ysis will be provided in SAP. 9.5 Analysis of secondary variables 9.5.1 Efficacy variables Proportion of patients with no SCS use over 52 weeks of treatment The proportion of patients with no SCS use over 52 weeks treatment will be summarized by treatment and analyzed using logistic regression in overall population. The model will include treatment and randomization strata as covariates. Estimates of the odds ratio between treatment groups will be display ed along with associated 95% confidence intervals and two-sided p- values. Proportion of patients requiring ≥ 7.5mg systemic corticosteroid dose in mg prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) per day continuously f or at least 30 days The proportion of patients requiring ≥ 7.5mg systemic corticosteroid dose in mg prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) per day continuously for at least 30 days in 52 weeks treatment period will be summarized by treatment and analy zedusing logistic regression in overall population.

Thus, higher scores indicate better asthma - related HRQOL. There is a mean score calculated for each of the four domains, as well as an overall qualit y of lifescore, which is the mean score of all 32 items. The resultant overall scores will be between 1 and 7. The developer suggests no more than 10% of missing data. This means no more than 3 missing responses for the overall score and no more than 1 missing response per domain. For the symptoms and activit y domain scores, one missing value per domain is allowed. For the emotional function and environmental stimuli domain scores, no missing values are allowed. If these limits for missing questions are exceeded, the variable will be considered missing and imputation method will be detailed in statistical analy sis plan. The minimal important difference (MID), defined as “the smallest difference in score which patients perceive as beneficial and would mandate, in the absence of troublesome side effects and excessive cost, a change in the patient’s management,” of 0.5 has been established for this questionnaire as clinically significant ( Juniper etal1994). The AQLQ score will be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with an unstructured covariance structure with factors for treatment group, time and randomization stratum, as well as the baseline AQLQ as continuous linear covariates. The null hypothesis will be tested for overall population for each dose group using this model versus two-sided alternative hypotheses. For each dose group the null hypothesis is that the treatment difference compared to placebo at the week 52 visit is equal to zero, while the alternative h ypothesis is that the treatment difference to placebo at week 52 visit is not equal to zero. Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) The ACQ measures asthma symptom control and consists of 7 items. It includes the 5 most important symptoms, 1 about rescue bronchodilator use and 1 about airway calibre (FEV1 % predicted pre -bronchodilator). Patients will be asked to recall their experiences during the past one week and to response items 1-6 (night -time waking, symptoms on waking, activit y limitation, shortness of breath, wheeze, and rescue short -acting β2-agonist use) on a 7-point scale (0 –totally controlled, 6 –extremely poorly controlled). The ACQ -5 score calculated based on the 5 questions of the 5 most important sy mptoms. The 5 questions of the A CQ-5 are equally weighted. The ACQ -5 score is the mean of the responses to the 5 questions. The resultant score will be between 0 and 6. A score of 1.5 at baseline indicates patients who entered the stud y had inadequatel y controlled asthma (Juniper et al 2006).

The null hypothesis will be tested for overall population for each dose group using this model versus two-sided alternative hypotheses. For each dose group the null hypothesis is that the treatment difference compared to placebo at the week 52 visit is equal to zero, while the alternative h ypothesis is that the treatment difference to placebo at week 52 visit is not eq ual to zero. Time to first prescription of biologic therapy from first dose of study treatment received over 52 weeks of treatment The time to first prescription of biologic therap y from first dose of study treatment received over 52 weeks of treatment will be summarized by treatment group. Between -treatment differences will be evaluated using cox regression model. Change from baseline in daytime and nighttime symptom scores in 52 weeks of treatment Change from baseline in each endpoint (daytime and nightt ime symptom score) will be analyzed using mixed models repeated measures (MMRM) model with factors as treatment group, randomization strata, time interval, time interval by treatment group interaction and the associated baseline as continuous linear covari ate. Estimates of the LS means between treatment groups will be display ed along with associated 95% confidence intervals and two- sided p -values. 9.5.2 Safety variables For all safet y analyses, the safet y set will be used. All listings and tables will be presente d by treatment group. Safety summaries (tables, figures) include only data from the on-treatment period with the exception of baseline data which will also be summarized where appropriate (e.g. change from baseline summaries). In addition, a separate summa ry for death including on treatment and post treatment deaths will be provided. In particular, summary tables for adverse events (AEs) will summarize only on-treatment events, with a start date during the on-treatment period (treatment -emergent AEs). The o n-treatment period lasts from the date of first administration of study treatment to 14 days after the date of the last actual administration of any study treatment. Adverse events All information obtained on adverse events will be display ed by treatment g roup and subject. The number (and percentage) of subjects with treatment emergent adverse events (events started after the first dose of study medication or events present prior to start of double -blind treatment but increased in severit y based on preferre d term) will be summarized in the following way s: by treatment, primary system organ class and preferred term. by treatment, primary system organ class, preferred term and maximum severity . by treatment, Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) and preferred term"

In addition, the proportion of patients with 0 total systemic corticosteroid dose in mg prednisone/prednisolone (or equivalent) is quite high (>30%) therefore a transformation that could normalize the distribution is not feasible. As a consequence, a non-param etric method based on rank analy sis will be used to analy ze the primary end-point. The formula developed for the Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney test adjusting for ties (Zhao et al 2008) has been used to estimate the sample size. A 1:1:1 randomization was used. There are four h ypotheses to be tested for primary endpoint as stated in Section 9.4.2.

Spirometers must have the capacit y to print forced vital capacity (FVC) tracings. All spirometry values should be reported at body temperature and pressure saturated (BTPS) by the method established by the manufacturer. Calibration The spirometer should be calibrated every morning before any spirometric measurements for the study are performed. Calibration reports should be printed and stored as source data at the site. Preparing the test subject On study days when spirometry will be performed, patients should refrain from the following: Coffee, tea, chocolate, cola and other caffeine -containing beverages and foods and ice- cold beverages for 4 hours prior to spirometry Alcohol for 4 hours prior to spirometry Strenuous activity for 12 hours prior to spirometry Exposure to environmental smoke, dust or areas with strong odors Every effort should be made to assure consistent testing conditions throughout the study . A seated position with nose clips is recommended to reduce risks related to dizziness or sy ncope. When possible, spirometry should be conducted by the same technician using the same spirometer. To minimize the effects of diurnal variation on lung function, spirometry visits should start at approximately the same time of day at ea ch visit. Performing Spirometry The subject’s age, height and gender will be entered into the spirometer. I t is important that the height is measured accurately at the study site. Spirometry , an effort -dependent test, requires careful instruction and coope ration of the subject. The technician should ensure a good seal around the mouthpiece, and confirm that the subject’s posture is correct. The subject should be instructed to perform a maximal inspiration, followed by maximum forced expiration until no more air can be exhaled or for at least 6 seconds. Expiration must be rapid with exertion of maximal effort. The results of spirometry should meet the ATS/ERS criteria for acceptability and repeatability . Acceptability criteria should be applied before repeata bility is determined. Number of trials A minimum of 3 acceptable forced vital capacit y (FVC) maneuvers should be performed. If a subject is unable to perform a single acceptable maneuver after 8 attempts, testing may be discontinued. Acceptability An accep table maneuver has the following characteristics: No hesitation or false start;"
81,page_81,"Novartis Confidential Page 82 Amended Protocol Version 01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2323 A rapid start; No cough, especially during the first second of the maneuver; No glottic closure or obstruction by tongue or dentures; No earl y termination of exhalation (minimu m exhalation time of 6 seconds is recommended and no volume change for at least 1 second) or the subject cannot continue to exhale further. Overall acceptability will be determined b y expert over -read b y spirometry vendor. Repeatability The 2 largest force d expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) values from 3 acceptable maneuvers should not vary by more than 0.150 L. If patient does not meet the repeatability or acceptability criteria during the screening period, patient may be rescreened once or allow one sp irometry retest. Recording of data The greatest FEV1 and FVC from any of the acceptable curves are recorded. (The greatest FEV1 and FVC may not necessarily result from the same acceptable curve). Predicted normal For all patients, this study will utilize the global lung function 2012 equations (GLI2012) published by Quanjer et al 2012[2]or Japanese Respiratory Society[3]. Reversibility All reversibility evaluations should follow the recommendations of the ATS/ERS Task force: Standardization of Lung Funct ion Testing[1]. A pre-bronchodilator spirometry assessment should be performed after withholding of specified medications as specified in Table 5-3 “Medications to be withheld prior to spirometry ”. Administer 400µg of salbutam ol/albuterol (or equivalent) following the completion of the pre - bronchodilator assessment. Spacers will be allowed for the administration of salbutamol/albuterol (or equivalent) for reversibility testing. Post-bronchodilator spirometry assessment is then performed approximately 10 to 15 minutes after administration of the salbutamol/albuterol. Reversibility is calculated as: 100 x FEV1 (post - bronchodilator) – FEV1 (pre -bronchodilator) / FEV1 (pre -bronchodilator) Patients will be considered reversible if anincrease of at least 12% (and 200 mL) is demonstrated after administration of the salbutamol/albuterol. 17.1 References for appendix 1Miller MR et al (2005) Standardization of L ung Function Testing.
