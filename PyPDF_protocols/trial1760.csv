No. 5 May 11, 2020 Confidential Page 7 of 84 3 INTRODUCTION 3.1 Study B ackground Physiologic al skin aging is multi factorial and result s from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Genetics is one example of an i ntrinsic factor; others include hormone and metabolic processes that can cause the skin to age. Exposure to chronic light , radiation, pollution, chemicals and toxins , are examples of extrinsic factors. Since skin health and beauty is contemplated as one of the representation s of overall “well -being” and “health”, several anti -aging therapies have been developed during the recent years. The goal of these therapies is to achieve a healthy, smooth, blemish -free, translucent and resilient skin . [1] Skin resurfacing or peel procedures have become an established non- surgical method for reducing certain skin imperfections such as wrinkles, rhytides, dark spots, scars, or blemishes. Traditional fully ablative and fractional lasers are the most commonly used devices for skin resurfacing. The skin is composed of three layers: the epidermis, the dermis, and the hypodermis. The dermis contains well -organized and oriented collagen fibers that contribute to the firmness and smoothness of the skin. As people age, these collagen fibers reduce in number and become less organized, resulting in sagging and/or wrinkled skin. When esthetic procedures are scheduled for older adults , the rate of the epidermal turnover associated with a slower wound healing and less effective desquamation (shading of outer layers of the skin) , needs to be taken into consideration . [1] In most skin resurfacing procedures, an energy source (heat, radiofrequency energy, etc.) is used to selectively damage the skin and prompt a healing response that stimulates the growth of new collagen fibers in the dermis that are well- organized. The healing response and new collagen formation results in skin that is smoother and firmer. There are numerous traditional fully ablative and fractional lasers on the market today used for skin resurfacing. Traditional and fractional lasers differ in their method of treatment. Traditional lasers have a single beam that burns or damages all of the epidermis within the treatment area of the beam. Fractional lasers divide the beam into multiple smaller beams and treat only a “fraction” of the epidermis to affect changes in the deeper epidermis or dermis. Thi s results in multiple small cores of laser damage surrounded by areas of healthy tissue. When compared to traditional lasers, fractional lasers deliver a more superficial treatment resulting in less risk for complications and reduced time for h ealing. However, this also means more treatments may be required to achieve the desired results especially in areas of deep lines or wrinkles. Healing times vary by amount of treatment, but fractional laser recovery time is typically one week compared to three to fo ur weeks for traditional lasers. In the wake of the demonstrated safety and effectiveness of laser skin resurfacing, multiple additional treatment modalities have been developed for this application including the use of radiofrequency (RF) energy. The fractionated radiofrequency results in epidermal and subepidermal ablation under the conductive pins that reproduces similar effects as a fractional CO 2 laser with dermal heating, seen in the non -ablative lasers and devices.[2] The combination of epidermal abl ation and dermal heating with radiofrequency, called sublative resurfacing in some studies, is suitable for skin types I –IV, for the treatment of skin laxity, wrinkles, enlarged pores, pigmented lesions, acne, telangiectasias, and scar ring from trauma or a cne. Subject recovery and"
7,page_7,"Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. 5 May 11, 2020 Confidential Page 8 of 84 down time periods are significantly lower when compared with ablative laser healing times, with minimal adverse effects.[3] 3.2 Study Rationale An emerging method utilizing the state of matter known as plasma to create a thermal effect on the skin through the use of positively ionized gasses is plasma skin resurfacing (PSR).[4] As this plasma comes in contact with the resurfacing target, the positive ions capture back electrons while energy is released. With PSR, an inert gaseous source is used to form a plasma that releases thermal energy that eliminates oxygen from the targeted skin surface. [5,6] PSR is not dependent on a chromophore for its use and does not vaporize tissue as ablative lasers do. This resurfacing modalit y has been hypothesized to function by forming a layer of desiccated epidermis creating a natural barrier that facilitates accelerated healing with generation of new epidermis. PSR also penetrates to the upper dermis resulting in thermal denaturation of su rrounding collagen, thereby increasing fibroblast activity, which has been shown to continue up to a year after the plasma treatments. [7] Plasma resurfacing has been safely used in Fitzpatrick skin types I –IV. It has been approved for the treatment of many skin conditions including photoaging, acne scars, rhytides, dyschromias, skin laxity, as well as the treatment of actinic keratosis and seborrheic keratosis. In contrast to the ablative laser, plasma resurfacing treatments have a very low incidence of side effects such as permanent hypopigmentation, scarring, or prolonged erythema. [8] As an alternative treatment modality for skin resurfacing , Apyx Medical Corporation has developed the Renuvion® Dermal System that delivers RF energy in a controlled fashion with similar depth of thermal effect as predicate devices currently on the market for dermal resurfacing and wrinkle reduction procedures . [9,10,11] A po tential benefit of this single -treatment low-risk technology is reducing wrinkle appearance and enhancing well-being by improv ing satisfaction and perception of having a more youthful appearance. 3.3 Study Device Description The Renuvion® Dermal S ystem consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (ESU , Figure 1), a handpiece with detachable standoffs (Figure 2) , and a supply of helium gas. RF energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the subject in the form of a precise helium plasma beam."

Pre-clinical studies comparing Renuvion (formerly known as J-Plasma®) to other energy sources such as CO 2 laser and RF energy demonstrated less or comparable lateral and depth of thermal spread for Renuvion® in porcine peritoneum, bladder, and small intestine .[12] Additionally, a pre -clinical study comparing Renuvion to the NeoGen PSR System (K132754) when ablating/resurfacing the skin in a naive swine model was conducted. A single animal w as utilized in the study to evaluate both devices at an acute time point. At the treatment settings used in this study, the maximum depth of thermal effect mea sured for tissue treated using the Renuvion® System were statistically equivalent to or lower than the maximum depth of thermal effect for tissue treated using the NeoGen PSR System. These results support the safety of Renuvion® for this application and e quivalent tissue effects for the two technologies . These pre -clinical study results demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the Renuvion® Dermal System in the ablation of soft tissue within its current FDA cleared indications in an animal model , therefore making the Renuvion® Dermal S ystem a viable technology for dermal skin resurfacing."

The Investigator must provide the prospective subject with enough opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence. To participate in the study, a subject must sign and date an IRB -approved consent document. The original, signed documents will be kept w ith the subject s’ files and copies will be provided to the subject s. The informed consent process must be followed, and the subject’s participation in the study, must be documented in the subject’s medical record/chart. 6.2 Pre-Procedure The subject s will have verification of eligibility criteria, a brief general examin ation including medical history, and wrinkles/rhytides assessment completed within 30 days prior to undergoing the study procedure. In response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pande mic, preoperative testing can be completed at the Investigator’s discretion. Pre- operative testing should be performed as close to the scheduled study procedure as feasible, but in time to get results. Up to t wo urine pregnancy test s must be obtained prior to study procedure for females with child -bearing potential (one at pre -procedure screening and one on the day of the procedure prior to the procedure . Screening and procedure will not be performed on the same day) . Additionally, photogr aphs of the area to be treated with the study device will be taken using the Canfield Scientific Visia -CR system (see also Section 12.3 Data Management Responsibilities and Section 12.4 Data Capture Methods) for each subject to document the appearance of t heir facial wrinkles and rhytides. The same standardized photography views will be used throughout the study a s documented in the Canfield User Manual document developed for the study . Subjects will specifically be instructed to lightly rest their chin on the chinrest rather than resting heavily and distorting the chin appearance. All screening images will be reviewed by the Sponsor prior to study treatment to ensure enrollment criteria are met and study baseline images are high quality.

Documentation should include medications and supplements that study subjects take on an elective basis in addition to prescribed medications . Medication used for analgesia and/or anesthesia should be recorded as concomitant medication as well. To ensure the capture of the foregoing information on pre -existing conditions, sites should also be attentive to the need to document without limitation and whenever discovered: (1) all chronic, episodic or ‘as needed’ medications used before study enrollment; (2) prior episodic or ‘as needed’ therapeutic interventions, procedures or hospitalizations; and, (3) recent or planned surgical procedures. 6.3 Study P rocedure On the day of the procedure and prior to the study procedure, female subjects with child -bearing potential must complete a urine pregnancy test (result must be obtained prior to the procedure). Additionally, subjects must complete a VAS pa in assessment pre- procedure and immediately following the procedure (within 60 minutes after the procedure). Prior to study treatment, the following medications may be administered at investigator’s discretion: • Ativan 2mg or Valium 10 -20mg. • Norco 5-10mg or Ultram 200mg. A responsible driver (friend or family member) is required if these medications are prescribed. The skin in the treatment area will be prepped by wiping the area with 70% isopropyl alcohol, then cleaned with 0.012 % Hypochlorous Acid, then the entire area will be wiped clean with sterile saline. Facial Nerve Blocks will be done prior to infiltration of tumescent anesthesia to the ophthalmic nerve (v1), the maxillary nerve (V2), and the mandibular nerve (V3) using 1% -2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1:100,000). Regional blocks and local tumescent anesthesia (an anesthetic) will be used during the study procedure. The local anesthetic is commonly referred to as Klein’s Solution. Per standard of care, this Klein’s Solution is prepared at the time of use and contains USP injection grade saline solution, USP injection grade Lidocaine for pain, and injection grade Epinephrine for vasoconstriction. A 0.2% concentration ( double Klein solution) will be utilized in this study. The Tumescent solution is made by adding the following to 500 cc of normal saline: 1. 50cc of 2% Lidocaine = to 1000mg 2. 0.5cc of 1 mg/ml Epinephrine (1:1000) Tumescent local and regional anesthesia will be injected percutaneously infused with a 22 Gauge spinal needle. The total volume of tumescent used should be between 250 – 500cc for the entire treatment area at investigator’s discretion and will be documented in the CRFs. Polycarbonate plastic eye shields will be used as per product IFU during study treatment . Numbing eye drops may be used to place eye shields at investigator’s discretion."

Study subject s will complete Visual Analog Scale and Modified Global Aest hetic Improvement Scale (GAIS): Subject Form at follow -up visits. 6.6 Confidentiality of Data The Principal Investigator will oversee the conduct of the study and all data will be kept confidential. Confidentiality will be maintained by using subject identification numbers instead of names. Informed consent forms, data collection sheets and records, linking a subject ’s name with their ID number will be maintained in a locked cabinet or locked office. Information to be stored on the computer will be identified by subject ID and will be password protected. Data disclosed outside the study team will be de -identified or will only include general group demographic information. Protected Health Information and/or identifiable study data will not be shared with anyone outside the study team or Health System, with the exception of the study sponsor, and fe deral regulators/ institutional officials for the purposes of auditing. 7 EVALUATION TOOLS The following evaluation tools will be used in this study: 7.1 Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale (FST) Assessment of subject ’s skin color will be determined prior to study proce dure by the Investigator using the FST . The scale delineates skin color into the categories as shown in Table 2. Table 2: Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale (FST) Table 2: Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale Evaluation Skin Type Description Type I White skin that never tans and always burns easily Type II White skin that tans slightly and always burns easily Type III Light brown skin that tans gradually and can burn moderately Type IV Moderately brown skin that tans well and burns slightly Type V Dark brown skin that tans profusely and burns rarely Type VI Black skin with deep pigmentation that never burns 7.2 Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale (FWS) Assessment of each subject ’s wrinkles at baseline and 30, 90, and 180- day follow- up visits will be performed by the Investigator . As well, assessment of each subject ’s baseline and the 90-day follow -up visit images viewed simultaneously will be performed by three board -certified dermatologists or plastic surgeons sourced and managed by Canfield Scientific and the Sponsor , called Independent Photographic Reviewers (IPRs), using the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale ( FWS ) categories as shown in Table 3 (see also Section 12.3 Data Management Responsibilities and Section 12.4 Data Capture Methods) . The FWS is a clinically validated"

No. 5 May 11, 2020 Confidential Page 22 of 84 assessment tool used to assess skin wrinkle severity and elastosis on a scale from 1 through 9, where the lower score is considered better. Three Independent Photographic Reviewer s will be blinded to the study subject ’s visit (baseline and follow -up visit) and will perform photographic assessments of each subject ’s wrinkle depth in the treated zones (identified only as “Zones to Evaluate” to the IPRs) using FWS and ignoring nasolabial folds and marionette lines (effects of gravity) , and artifacts from the chin rest. The IPRs will assign a single FWS score per subject for both the right and left photo. Each photograph will have a unique identif ication number but sets of images will not be arranged in any specific order (i.e., randomized order). Independent Photographic Review Evaluation Process for FWS: 1. Each blinded assessor will be provided with identical photos to be assessed. The pre- treatment and follow -up photos will be consistent in lighting, subject positioning and focus. Each photo’s visit interval, i.e., pre -treatment and follow -up, will NOT be marked. The images placement (right or left) will be randomly ordered for pre -treatment and follow -up images. Images for each subject will be grouped together into one set with all pre-treatment and follow -up images in the same location (right/left) for the subject set. 2. Each blinded assessor will conduct their assessment independently with no input from another blinded assessor. 3. Each blinded assessor reviews the Left photo and assigns a FWS score. 4. Each blinded assessor reviews the Right photo and assigns a FWS score. 5. Enough time should be allowed to do this for each image , so the assessments are not rushed. 6. The change between FWS scores will be calculated during data analysis after assessments are complete. 7. Success will be determined by at least 1 -point improvement in FWS by at least two out of three blinded, independent reviewers. Table 3: Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale Table 3: Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale Class Description Score Description I Fine wrinkles 1-3 Mild: Fine texture changes with subtly accentuated skin lines. II Fine to moderate depth wrinkles , Moderate number of lines 4-6 Moderate: Distinct papular elastosis (individual papules with yellow translucency under direct lighting) and dyschromia . III Fine to deep wrinkles, numerous lines , with or without redundant skin folds 7-9 Severe: Multipapular and confluent elastosis (thickened, yellow and pallid) approaching or consistent with cutis rhomboidalis ."

A modification of the GAIS to include “much worse” and “very much worse” as rating options will be used i n this study . The Investigator will grade the overall improveme nt of treatment area as indicated in Table 4a by comparing the subject ’s appearance at follow -up visits against a photograph taken prior to procedure . Likewise, the subject will also rate their improvement compared to pre -treatment as shown in Table 4b. The modified GAIS results will be collected at the 30, 90, and 180- day follow -up visits .

Achievement of Re-epithelization - determine percentage epidermal recovery per treatment zone at the 1, 6, 10, 30, and 90-day follow-up visits. 2. Down Time - date when study subject felt comfortable, willing and able to go in public following study procedure (assessed at the 1, 6, 10 , and 30-day follow- up visit) . 7.5 Visual Analog Scale (VAS) The s tudy subject s will be asked to complete an 11-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for the following assessments: 1. Level of pain and discomfort associated with study procedure – to be completed by the subject s on the day of the procedure (prior to the procedure and immediately following the procedure) , daily between the date of the procedure (reported at home) and the 10 day follow -up visit, and at all follow -up visits. 2. Subject satisfaction with treatment – at the 3 visits . Additionally, the subject s will be asked if they would recommend the treatment to friends and acquaintances (yes, perhaps, or no) and improvements noted (if any). Scoring for the VAS will consist of making a mark on a 10 -cm line demarcated at 1 -cm intervals. Each end of the line will be awarded a score of 0 or 10 according to the extre me points of reference pertaining to an individual measure. 7.6 Subject Diary Study subjects will be asked to complete a daily diary (see Appendix E: Subject Diary) starting from the procedure date (after study procedure , at home ) until the 10 day follow- up visit to complete daily 11-point VAS pain assessments and document any complications they have experienced. 7.7 Blinded Identification of 90- Day Images Assessment of each subject’s baseline and 90- day follow -up images viewed simultaneously will be performed by the Independent Photographic Reviewers (IPR) who will be blinded to the study subject’s visit (baseline and 3 -month follow -up visit). Each IPR will view each subject’s randomized baseline and 90-day follow -up images and assess which set of images represent the subject’s post -treatment images. Each photograph will have a unique identification number, but the sets of images will not be arranged in any specific order (i.e., randomized order). Independent Photographic Review Evaluation Process for Masked Assessment : 1. Each blinded assessor will be provided with identical photos to be assessed. The pre - treatment and follow -up photos will be consistent in lighting, subject positioning and focus. Each photo’s visit interval, i.e., pre- treatment and follow -up, will NOT be marked. The images placement (right or left) will be randomly ordered for pre -treatment and follow -up images. Images for each subject will be grouped together into one set with all pre-treatment and follow -up images in the same location (right/left) for the subject set."
24,page_24,"Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. 5 May 11, 2020 Confidential Page 25 of 84 2. Each blinded assessor will conduct their assessment independently with no input from another blinded assessor. 3. Each blinded assessor compares the Left and Right photo for improvement. Assessors should look through each view and assess change. Enough time should be allowed to do this for each subject, so the assessments are not rushed. 4. The following definition will be used: • Change: An improvement that is: o Striking, substantial and immediately noticeable, or o Readily apparent but modest in nature, or o Slight and subtle in nature; may require close examination. 5. The assessor chooses which photo they believe to be the Post treatment photo (i.e., Left photo or Right photo) once all images in the subject set have been reviewed. 6. Post-Analysis Coding of Masked Assessment: • If the assessor incorrectly chooses the Post treatment photo, this will be coded as an “Incorrect post selection”. • If the assessor correctly chooses the Post treatment photo, this will be coded as a “Correct post selection”. 7. Success will be determined by correct identification of post treatment follow -up visit photographs by at least two out of three blinded, independent reviewers. 8 ADVERSE EVENTS ASSESSMENT REPORTING 8.1 Adverse Events Evaluation Safety evaluations for this study include an interview with the study subject at each follow -up visit by the Investigator or Research Coordinator to elicit information about any medical occurrence that meets the definition of Adverse Event. This information will be documented in CRF without regard for cause or relation to device and/or procedure. In addition, study subject s will be instructed to report all of complications experienced post study procedure to the site personnel as soon as they occur/ are observed. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to determine seriousness, severity, and relatedness of the Adverse Event to the device and procedure using the definitions below. 8.2 Adverse Event (AE) and Expected Treatment Effect (ETE) Definition An adverse event (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject , including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the subject ’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject ’s participation in the research. An expected treatment effect (ETE) is any typical treatment side -effect of the Renuvion Dermal System"
25,page_25,"Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. 5 May 11, 2020 Confidential Page 26 of 84 lasting up to a typical maximum duration. All ETEs and AEs will be collected during the conduct of this trial. A preexisting condition (one that is present at the start of the study) will be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. Neither the c ondition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an AE in the following circumstances: hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 8.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an adverse event that: • Led to a death or • Led to a serious deterioration in the health of a subject that: o Resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury, o Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, o Required in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, o Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent impairment to body structure or a body function o Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect, or o Other serious (important) medical events that may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent on of the other outcomes. All SAEs that occur during the study period, whether considered to be related to the investigational product or not , must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. IRB reporting requirements may also apply for SAEs. 8.4 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADEs) Definition An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADEs) is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in na ture, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. In addition, any UADEs will be reported to the Sponsor and the reviewing IRB as soon as possible, but no later than within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. All adverse events, anticipated or unanticipated, will be monitored until they are adequately resolved or explained. 8.5 Reporting Requirements All advers e events (AEs) obser ved by study subject s, investigators or other study staff from first exposure to the study product through last study follow -up visit will be recorded. If a device - related AE, SAE, or unanticipated serious device related effect is ongoing at the final study visit,"
26,page_26,"Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. 5 May 11, 2020 Confidential Page 27 of 84 the subject will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. The investigator should make every effort to ensure that follow -up incl udes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate, as completely as practical, the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. This may include unscheduled follow up visits for AE assessment. Study subject s will be instructed to report all AEs to the clinical study staff. AE information will be collected throughout the study and recorded on CRFs. 8.6 Severity of Adverse Events The severity of adverse events will be categorized using the following criteria: • Mild: easily tolerated by the subject , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. These events generally do not require treatment. • Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities. These vents are usually relieved by simple therapeutic measures. • Severe: prevents normal, everyday activities. These events may require systemic drug therapy or other medical treatment. 8.7 Relationship to the Study Device and/or Procedure The relationship to the study de vice and /or procedure will be determined by the investigator utilizing the following categories: • Not Related: An event for which an alternative explanation is conclusively identified – e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is highly unlikely. • Related : The adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence related to treatment by the device, follows a known or suspected response pattern and a plausible alternative etiology cannot be identified. • Undetermined : The relation of the adverse event has some temporal relationship to the device and/or device procedure , is not clearly due to another condition and the involvement of the study device is unknown. 8.8 Stopping Guidelines / Stopping Rules: Safety The Sponsor and/or investigator may recommend termination or modification of the study if there is an occurrence of any device- or treatment -related Serious Adverse Event, using the clinical protocol definitions of Serious Adverse Event in Section 8.3 of this protocol. In addition, termination or modification may be recommended for any other perceived safety concern based on clinical judgment, including but not limited to a severe burn (anticipated or unanticipat ed), a higher than anticipated rate for any component of the safety measures, device failures resulting in Adverse Events, or unexpected SAEs."

This risk may increase with duration of use and in patients who have underlying risk factors for disease of the heart and blood vessels. NSAIDs, particularly non -selective NSAIDs, cause an increased risk of serious, even fatal, stomach and intestinal adverse reactions such as bleeding, ulcers, and perforation of the stomach or intestines.

Prior approval by the Sponsor is expected in situations where the Investigator anticipa tes, contemplates, or makes a conscious decision to deviate. Prior approval is not required when a deviation is necessary to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in an emergency. Prior approval is not expected in situations where unforese en circumstances are beyond the Investigator’s control (e.g. inadvertent errors, product failure, or inability to perform required procedures due to subject ’s illness). All protocol deviations are to be reported to the S ponsor, along with the justificati on for the deviation, on the Protocol Deviation CRF. Protocol deviations should be reported as soon as possible upon center notification of the deviation. 10.2 Discontinuation of Study Subject s A subject may discontinue from the study at any time without any penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. An Investigator may also discontinue a subject from the study without the subject ’s consent, if the Investigator feels it is in the best medical interest of the subject . The date and the reason for study withdrawal will be indicated on the Study Exit CRF. Every effort should be made to contact subject s lost to follow -up, and all such efforts should be documented in the subject ’s file. 10.3 Supply of Study Materials Each clinical site will be provided with the investigational devices. A Device Accountability Log will be used to track the receipt, use and ret urn of study devices at each study site. All investigational devices will be returned to study Sponsor after enrollment of all subject s. Study Sponsor will provide appropriate packaging and shipping instructions to the study sites. 10.4 Device Malfunction/Observations All malfunctions of, or defects of the delivery system will be recorded on the Device Malfunction/Observation Case Report Form and reported to the S ponsor by the investigational sites. This will include situations where the delivery system did not perform as intended; user errors; study device/component being physically defective, including out of the box failure. 10.5 Monitoring It is the responsibility of the study Sponsor to ensure that proper monitoring of this clinical investigation is conducted. Appropriately trained personnel appointed by the S ponsor will conduct monitoring activities, as needed, and ensure that the investigation is conducted in accordance with the study protocol, the Clinical Trial Agreement, applicable laws and regulations, including ICH GCP, and overseeing IRBs."
43,page_43,"Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. 5 May 11, 2020 Confidential Page 44 of 84 Prior to study initiation at each investigational site, approval to enroll subject s will be given by the S ponsor and/ or designee. The Sponsor will determine frequency and timing of interim or periodic monitoring visits for each site based on enrollment rate, volume, study compliance, and findings from previous visits. Each enrolling site will be visited at least annua lly. Remote monitoring will be conducted to manage study data between site visits. During a monitoring visit, the M onitor will evaluate the site’s compliance with regulatory and protocol requirements, verify data recorded on CRFs to available source docu ments, etc. In addition, the Monitor will check whether all AEs and SAEs have been reported appropriately within the time periods required. Data Clarification Forms (DCFs) will be created for identified errors on CRFs that have been submitted to the Spons or to ensure errors/omissions are corrected. New and previous findings and recommended corrective and preventative actions, if they exist, will be communicated with the study staff during the visit, and will also be addressed in a final letter that will b e sent to the Investigator after the visit. 10.6 End of Study The end of study will be defined as completion of all study visits by all enrolled subject s. If a device -related AE, SAE, or unanticipated serious device -related effect is ongoing at the final study visit, the subject will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. Study closure visits may be conducted at all clinical sites in order to review record reten tion requirements, device disposition requirements, etc., with site personnel. The S ponsor may choose to conduct the closure visit via telephone contact if appropriate. 10.6.1 Premature Termination /Suspension of the Study or a Study Site The study or parts of the study may be prematurely terminated or suspended by the Sponsor. This discontinuation may be based on a significant number of AEs of a similar nature that warrant such action. Furthermore, the study may be prematurely ended if the regulatory authority or the IRB make a recommendation to terminate or suspend approval for the study, the study site, or the Investigator. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended for any reason, the investigator must inform the subject s and a ssure appropriate follow -up treatment. Within the timeframes noted in applicable regulations, the Sponsor will promptly inform the investigators, study sites, the IRB, and regulatory authorities of the termination or suspension of the study, as appropriate 10.7 Audits / Inspections The Sponsor, their designee, and the reviewing IRB may monitor or audit the study centers. Likewise, r egulatory authorities may inspect Sponsor or CRO files or any study center to eval uate the conduct of the study. The Investigator mu st allow access to the subject files and inspection of their clinical research protocol procedures when requested."

For more detail please refer to the Statistical analysis plan. Any deviations from planned analyses, the reasons for such deviation, and all alternative or additional statistical analyses that may be performed before database close will be summarized in the Clinical Study Report. Full details of planned statistical analyses will be outlined in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for the study. 11.1 Determination of S ample S ize The objective of this study is to demonstrate response to treatment with the Renuvion Dermal System. The IPR will assess each subject image and assess using the FWS. The proportion of subjects achieving at least a one- point improvement in 2 out of 3 IPR a ssessors will be calculated ; this is the proportion of treatment successes. The sample sizes were estimated using PASS 2019 1 with the following inputs: • A performance goal (PG) of 50% success; • A one- sample, one- sided t -test against the PG; • α = 0.05; • Power = 90%; • Renuvion success proportions (P) of 70%; • Test is Fisher’s Exact Test.

This primary effectiveness endpoint definition and performance goal have been used in prior clinical studies to support their 510(k) clearances ( i.e., eTwo Skin Treatment System, cleared under K141507 on December 8, 20142). Moreover, the expected Renuvion proportion used to determ ine th e study sample size is within the observed results range of the clinical studies conducted to support this indication for other FDA cleared devices (e.g., Picosure Workstation, cleared under K140719 on May 23, 20163 and the eTwo Skin Treatment Syste m mentioned above) . 11.3 Analysis S ets The full analysis dataset will be used in our main analyses. Full Analysis Dataset (Intent -to-Treat Sample, ITT) Participants enrolled in the study who had baseline photographs taken will be included. Those with missing data items at 90-day visit will be imputed using multiple imputation . The primary efficacy endpoints will use this data set. The primary safety endpoint will also use this data set, but without multiple imputation. The reason is that the analysis method takes into account missing data (see the Analysis section below). Modified Analysis Dataset s (modified Intent- to-Treat Samples, mITT ) Participants enrolled in the study who had baseline data and endpoint data will be included. No imputation will be done for missing endpoints unless there is evidence that the endpoint is missing for cause. The Secondary and Additional endpoints will use these datasets. The reason that there are more than one mITT data set is that the data set is dependent upon the endpoint in questions; only those subjects with baseline and endpoint data for that endpoint will be included in the analysis. Per Protocol Dataset (Per-Protocol Sample , PP) This will be a subse t of the full analysis dataset comprising participants without major protocol deviations. Participants with major protocol deviations will be identified at the data review meeting that takes place before database lock. If the primary effectiveness endpoint is not met, it will be repeated on the PP data set. 11.3 Other Data Issues 11.3.1 Discontinuations and Missing Data The primary endpoints will be tested or estimated using the full (ITT) sample, with missing endpoints will be multiply imputed. Secondary and Additional endpoints will use the mITT data sets. 11.4 Safety Endpoints An interim safety report of 30 -day safety data including analysis of treatment data, adverse events, and pain scores will be completed. 2 https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf14/K141507.pdf 3 https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf14/K140719.pdf"

No. 5 May 11, 2020 Confidential Page 47 of 84 11.4.1 Primary Safety Endpoint The primary safety endpoint is the enumeration of each subject’s adverse events (AE) up to the 90-day visit after treatment. Each AE will be c ategorized by cause, severity, seriousness, and relatedness to the procedure, the device, and the therapy. 11.4.2 Secondary Safety Endpoint The secondary safety endpoint is the evaluation of the change in pain and discomfort after treatment (baseline, within 60 minutes following the procedure) experienced in the period up to the 10- day follow -up visit. Pain or discomfort will be recorded daily by each participant in a diary using an 11- point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). 11.5 Effectiveness Endpoints 11.5.1 Primary Effectiveness E ndpoint Primary Effectiveness Endpoint On each subject, the appearance of facial wrinkles and rhytides at baseline and the 90-day images will be assessed by three blinded Independent Photographic Review ers using the FWS. Each subject will have three change scores; if 2 or more of the 3 change scores are one point or higher, the subject will be considered a success (Y or 1) and if 2 or more of the 3 change scores are less than one point, the subject will be considered a failure (N or 0). 11.6 Additional Endpoints Other endpoints to be evaluated include: 1. Whether or not (Yes/No) at least 2 out of 3 blinded Independent Photographic Reviewers (IPRs) correctly identify the 90-day image of a subject from the pair of baseline and 90-day images . 2. Magnitude of improvement measured by the mean change in FWS from baseline to 90-day visit as determined by the Investigators. 3. Subject modified GAIS at 90-day FUV. 4. Investigator modified GAIS at 90- day FUV. 5. Subject satisfaction with procedure recorded at the 90-day visit. 6. Achievement of re -epithelialization by facial zone and across all facial zones at the 10 day, 30- day and 90- day follow-up visits as reported by the investigator. 7. Mean duration until study subject feels comfortable going in public after treatment as reported by the study subject. 11.7 Statistical Analysis of Safety Endpoints All statistical analyses will be described in detail in an accompanying statistical analysis plan (SAP). Primary Safety Endpoint Adverse event rates will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier time -to-event analyses. The monthly event rates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported by their type, severity, and relationship to the study procedure, device, and therapy."
47,page_47,"Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. 5 May 11, 2020 Confidential Page 48 of 84 Secondary Safety Endpoint The mean VAS score will be reported at each measurement along with it 95% CI, its SD and its minimum and maximum. The change from baseline will be similarly reported. 11.8 Statistical Analysis of the Effectiveness Endpoint All statistical analyses will be described in detail in an accompanying statistical analysis plan (SAP). For the primary effectiveness endpoint, the proportion of successful patients (P) will be tested against the PG. If the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the proportion of subject achieving treatment successes is greater than the Performance Goal, the effectiveness endpoint would be met. The statistical test will be a one- sided Fisher’s Exact Test at α = 0.05. For the effectiveness endpoint to be met, Ho must be rejected. Ho: P < 50% vs. Ha: P > 50% 11.9 Statistical Analysis of Additional Endpoints These analyses will be described in the accompanying SAP. 11.10 Subgroup Analysis Subgroup analyses will include modeling (using linear regression analysis) the effect of on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and Fitzpatrick Skin Scale (FSS) on the ∆FWS . (Age et al are called “independent variables”.) The goal is to determine whether certain types of subjects are more likely to have a better response than other types. If any of the independent variables are significant , the effect size and better responders will be reported. This is examined in greater depth in the SAP."
