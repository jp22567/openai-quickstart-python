Criteria for Evaluation Study Endpoints Three analysis populations are defined for this study. The Intent to Treat (ITT) patient population will consist of all patients who are randomized. The full analysis set will consist of all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. The full analysi s set will be used for the efficacy and safety analyses. Efficacy analysis will be conducted according to the randomized treatment the patients receive, and safety analysis will be conducted according to the actual treatment the patients receive. The per-protocol set will consist of all patients in the full analysis set who do not have major protocol deviations as specified in the statistical analysis plan. Plan for Statistical Analysis Efficacy: The analysis for the change from baseline in weekly num ber of CSBMs will be performed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group and the Baseline value as covariates using the ITT analysis set. The primary analysis will be conducted using the observed values. For missing data, two sensitivi ty analyses will be conducted by using the multiple imputation and last observation carried forward (LOCF) methods. Details will be included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). For secondary and exploratory analyses, the Chi -squared test will be used to determine differences between treatment groups for categorical variables. For continuous -type variables, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) methods will be used with treatment group and the corresponding baseline value as covariates. For the responder endpoints, the analysis will be conducted by imputing the missing data as “non -responders”. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted by imputing the missing data as “responders”. All statis tical tests will be conducted at a 2 -sided significance level of 5% unless otherwise specified. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, study enrollment was temporarily stopped, at which time 53 patients had been randomized to study drug treatment groups. A futilit y interim analysis will be conducted on these 53 patients (49 have completed the study and 4 have withdrawn/early terminated). Safety: All AEs will be analyzed in terms of descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis. Adverse events will be listed for each patient and summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Safety laboratory data, ECGs, physical examination findings and vital signs measurements will be listed for eac h patient and presented descriptively by treatment group time points."

Introduction 3.1 Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of any organic cause. The symptoms of IBS not only adverse ly affect a patient's health -related quality of life (QoL), but also place a significant financial burden on society due to reduced work productivity and increased use of healthcare -related resources1,2. Patients with IBS frequently complain of abdo minal bloating and increased gas production in the form of flatulence or belching. The prevalence in North America and Europe is approximately 10 -15%3,4. Irritable bowel syndrome affects all ages and genders however there is a 2:1 female predominance in No rth America5. Irritable bowel syndrome is classified into 4 subtypes based on stool pattern: IBS with const ipation (IBS -C), IBS with diarr hea, mixed IBS, and un -subtyped IBS. Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation is defined as the presence of hard or lumpy stools with ≥ 25 percent of bowel movements an d loose or watery stools with < 25% of bowel movements6. SYN-010 is a modified release, oral formulation of lovastatin being developed for the treatment of IBS-C. The SYN -010 program is based predominant ly on research by Dr. Mark Pimentel (Director, Medically Associated Science and Technology Program, Cedars -Sinai Medical Center) and collaborators7,8,9 hypothesizing that reduction in intestinal methane (methane) production can reverse constipation and imp rove global symptoms in IBS -C. Methane production in humans is due to methanogenic archaea in the intestine, predominantly Methanobrevibacter smithii (M. smithii ). Methane, the key product of anaerobic respiration of methanogens, had been perceived to produce no ill effects in humans aside from gaseous distention. However, several research groups worldwide have shown that a significant percentage of patients with IBS-C excrete methane, and elevated methane production by methanogens correlates with constipation and related symptoms in both IBS - C and chronic idiopathic constipation7,8,9,10,11,12,13. A direct causative role for methane in IBS -C was demonstrated in a recent case report, wherein a woman undergoing fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for C. difficile infection unknowingly received stool containing a high concentration of methanogens. The FMT recipient rapidly developed severe symptoms of IBS -C that we re subsequently reversed by ablation of methane production14. Further details can be found in the Investigator's Brochure, which contains comprehensive information on the investigational product. 3.2 Summary of findings from pre -clinical studies with potential clinical significance A series of preclinical studies have sought to understand the mechanism by which methane exerts its effects on gastrointestinal motility. The precise mechanism remains under investigation; however, these studies indicate that methane may exert its actions in the intestine by modulation of the cholinergic pathway of the enteric nervous system15. In vivo studies in dogs and ex vivo studies using guinea pig ileal strips showed that methane stimulates non -propagating contractions, prevent ing propulsion of materials through the intestinal tract16,17. The active ingredient of SYN -010 is lovastatin lactone, which was first approved by the FDA in 1987 ; it is a cholesterol -lowering agent (Mevacor®, Merck & Co., Inc.)18 and has a history of safe use at oral doses up to 80 mg/day. In its cholesterol -lowering indication, lovastatin lactone is a prodrug and must be converted to the β -hydroxyacid form to inhibit the enzyme HMG -CoA reductase (HMGR). The preclinical safety of lovastatin lactone and β -hydroxyacid was established in detailed preclinical and toxicology studies conducted by Merck19."
15,page_15,"Date: June 30, 2020 Version : 8.0 Page: 16 of 52 Interest in lovastatin as a potential inhibitor of methanogenesis originated with recognition that the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of lipid membranes in the methanogen M. smithii is catalyzed by HMGR. As detailed below, it has since been determined that HMGR is not the target for lovastatin anti-methanogenic activity and the methane reducing effects of SYN -010 can be separated from potential s ystemic effects such as cholesterol lowering. The ability of lovastatin to inhibit methane production was established in ex vivo studies investigating the effects of nine statins (including lactone and β -hydroxyacid forms) on methane production by stool sa mples from IBS -C patients. In these studies, lovastatin lactone was identified as the only effective statin inhibitor of methane production, while the cholesterol -lowering metabolite lovastatin β-hydroxyacid was ineffective. In fact, the β -hydroxyacid form s of pravastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin were all ineffective inhibitors of methane production in his system. These experiments also demonstrated the dose -dependence of methane inhibition by lovastatin lactone and a head -to-head compari son of lovastatin lactone, lovastatin lactone -diol and lovastatin β - hydroxyacid affirmed that the lactone form of lovastatin is the anti -methanogenic species20. An additional important feature of lovastatin as a methane lowering agent is that neither lovas tatin lactone nor the β -hydroxyacid appear to be microbicidal. Neither species eradicated M. smithii or bacteria in the intestine of rats administered daily oral doses of each compound for 10 days21. 3.3 Rationale of the study SYN-010 has previously been evalu ated in consecutive Phase 2a clinical trials. Sixty -three (63) IBS -C patients with high breath methane (>10 ppm) at screening were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double -blinded clinical trial (RCT) in which they received SYN -010 21 mg, SYN-010 42 mg or Placebo once daily for 4 weeks. Fifty -four (54) subjects who completed the RCT continued into an open -label extension (EXT) in which all subjects received SYN -010 42 mg once daily for an additional 8 weeks. The SYN -010 Phase 2a studies wer e intentionally designed as mechanistic proof -of-concept studies, wherein reductions in breath methane were employed as a rapid and cost -effective means by which to determine if SYN -010 could be effective in treating an underlying cause of symptoms in IBS -C. Breath methane was reduced relative to baseline in SYN -010 treatment groups, and lower breath methane levels correlated with an increased number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) at week 12, consistent with the proposed methane -inhibiting action of lovastatin lactone22. Since lovastatin has not previously been used to treat IBS -C patients, the SYN -010 Phase 2a studies were also focused on the safety of the SYN -010 dosage form. Daily doses of SYN -010 were well - tolerated by IBS -C patients ove r the 12 -week treatment period (at least 8 weeks of SYN -010 42 mg). SYN-010 did not cause clinically meaningful or persistent changes in serum liver and muscle markers in IBS -C patients at daily doses of 21 mg and 42 mg. Modest decreases from baseline in l ipid parameters observed after 7 days of SYN -010 21 mg or 42 mg had largely faded by 28 days and were not evident after 12 weeks of dosing23. Very few adverse events were reported over 12 weeks of SYN - 010 treatment and all were of mild or moderate intensit y. No serious adverse events were reported and there were no incidences of drug -related diarrhea, which is an important potential benefit of SYN-010 as an IBS -C therapy. Although the Phase 2a studies were not prospectively powered for formal statistical ev aluation of clinical endpoints, compelling improvements in CSBMs, abdominal pain, and bloating were observed in SYN -010 treatment groups. These clinical findings have been presented in multiple public forums"
16,page_16,"Date: June 30, 2020 Version : 8.0 Page: 17 of 52 and a panel of clinical advisors affirmed that t he Phase 2a data validate the need to evaluate optimal dosing of SYN -010 in a larger patient population over a longer dosing period. Based on the potential clinical benefit observed in Phase 2a, this Phase 2b clinical study will evaluate in more detail the clinical effects of two dose strengths of SYN -010 administered over a longer treatment period (12 weeks per FDA guidelines) to a larger number of IBS -C patients. The study will seek more definitive evidence regarding potential symptom improvements and sa fety in IBS -C patients. The study also seeks to provide new information of relevance to both efficacy and safety by measuring changes to the microbiome in patient stool samples; serum level of cytokine markers of inflammation; and expanded breath gas measu rements. 3.4 SYN-010 (lovastatin lactone modified release capsules) 3.4.1 Description SYN-010 is a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) capsule filled with enteric -coated tablets from which lovastatin is released at different intestinal pH values. The tablets are designed to pass through the stomach unchanged then release a small amount of lovastatin into the duodenum and the majority of the lovastatin dose into the ileocecal junction and colon. The amount of lovastatin to be released into the small and large intestine is anticipated to be consistent with the relative levels of methane -prod ucing archaea in each location of the intestine24. Each tablet in the SYN -010 dosage form contains 7 mg of lovastatin combined with USP excipients and coated with two different EUDRAGIT® enteric polymers that dissolve at either pH 5.5 (duodenal release; DR ) or pH 7.0 (ileocecal release; ICR). • SYN-010, 21 mg (D1 -I2) comprises an opaque, green , size 1 HPMC capsule containing 1 x pH 5.5-coated tablet (DR) and 2 x pH 7.0 -coated tablets (ICR). • SYN-010, 42 mg (D1 -I5) comprises an opaque, green , size 1 HPMC capsul e containing 1 x pH 5.5-coated tablet (DR) and 5 x pH 7.0 -coated tablets (ICR). 3.4.2 Mechanism of action Methane production (methanogenesis) is a ubiquitous process in the human intestine, disposing of hydrogen and other by -products formed during bacterial ferm entatio n. Methane production in humans is almost entirely due to the archeon M. smithii . Elevated intestinal methane production reduces intestinal motility and is a cause of constipation, pain and bloating in IBS -C. Interest in lovastatin as a potential i nhibitor of methanogenesis originated with recognition that the rate -limiting step in the synthesis of archaeal lipid membranes is catalyzed by HMG -CoA reductase (HMGR) which is the target enzyme for cholesterol -lowering statins. Subsequent in vitro studie s (described above) and computational studies have since determined that HMGR is not the target for lovastatin anti -methanogenic activity; rather , lovastatin lactone appears to exert a direct effect on methanogenesis enzymes. The mechanism by which lovasta tin lactone inhibits methane production by M. smithii has not been conclusively determined; however, detailed computational studies showed that lovastatin lactone may competitively inhibit F420 -dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (mtd), an enzyme that is integral to the M. smithii methanogenesis pathway25."
17,page_17,"Date: June 30, 2020 Version : 8.0 Page: 18 of 52 Methanogenic archaea reside predominantly in the human colon, with lower methanogen levels measured in the small intestine of some patients. Methane production at both sites contributes to reduced gastrointestinal motility and rat studies suggest that the ileocecal region may be of particular significance21. SYN -010 utilizes a dual -pulse release profile to deliver a portion of the lovastatin dose to the small intestine and the majority of the dose to the ileocecal junction and colon where the most methane -producing organisms are found; the relative amounts of lovastatin released into the small and large intestine are consistent with th e anticipated relative levels of methanogens in each location. Lovastatin lactone exerts its methane -reducing effect in the intestinal lumen and systemic absorption of lovastatin is not required for its therapeutic effect in IBS -C. The pharmacokinetic prof ile of SYN -010 has been evaluated in a repeated -dose study in heathy volunteers. Two of the most therapeutically relevant findings from the PK study were: • Conversion of the anti -methanogenic lovastatin lactone to the cholesterol -lowering β - hydroxyacid meta bolite was significantly reduced in the SYN -010 formulation, and this was reflected in reduced systemic levels of the β -hydroxyacid and an absence of clinically meaningful or persistent SYN -010 effects on serum liver, lipid and muscle markers; • Conversion o f the anti -methanogenic lovastatin lactone to the cholesterol -lowering β - hydroxyacid metabolite was significantly reduced in the SYN -010 formulation, and this was reflected in reduced systemic levels of the β -hydroxyacid and an absence of clinically meanin gful or persistent SYN -010 effects on serum liver, lipid and muscle markers. In addition to the pharmacokinetic study, sparse PK sampling was conducted in IBS -C patients during Phase 2a clinical testing. After daily administration of SYN -010 21 mg or SYN -010 42 mg, plasma trough levels of both lovastatin lactone and β -hydroxyacid were low and variable, such that ≥ 50% of patients had undetectable plasma levels of each lovastatin species after both 7 and 28 days of treatment23. Reduced systemic levels of lov astatin species and high concentrations of lovastatin lactone in the stool are compelling findings regarding the use of SYN -010 as an intestine - acting anti -methanogenic therapy. 4.

Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must b e performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy. The i nvestigator should also be notified of any pregnancy occurring during the study and for 30 days after completion of the study. Within 24 hours of awareness of any pregnancy associated wit h study drug exposure during the study and for 30 days after th e last dose of study drug, the i nvestigator must record the event on the supplied pregnancy form and send it to the safety vendor. Any pregnancy will be followed to term or termination, and the status of mother and child will be reported on the pregnancy form after delivery. If delivery occurs after study closure, the outcome should be reported directly to the Sponsor. Patients may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: • The patie nt is non -compliant with study drug, trial procedures, or both , including the use of concomitant medications not prescribed by the study protocol. • If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation of the trial would be harmful to the patient's well-being. • The development of a secondary infection or other condition. • Development of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the judgment of the investigator, significantly affect assessments of clinical status and trial endpoints. • Use of illicit drug s or other substances that may, in the opinion of the investigator, have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity or otherwise skewing trial result. Any patient removed from the trial will remain under medical supervision until discharge or transfer is medically acceptable. In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the CRF and in the patient's medical records. 7.6 Screen failures Patients withdrawn during the Screening Period due to abnormal ECG, liver function tests, creatine kinase level, opiate use, or pregnancy will not be allowed to repeat the Screening Period . All other patients withdrawn during the Screening Period will be reviewed and evaluated on an individual basis and may be allowed to re -enter the Screening Period at the discretion of the investigator and the study team . 8. Treatments 8.1 Randomization Randomization will occur after a questionnaire collection period of at least 14 days, with compliance in fully respon ding to questions on at le ast 11 of the 14 days before the start of the Treatment Period. After the successful completion of the Screening and Pre -treatment Period, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to the following treatment gro ups: SYN -010 21 mg, SYN -010 42 mg, or placebo."

Randomization will be in blocks of 6. 8.2 Investigational product 8.2.1 SYN-010 SYN-010 will be supplied by Synthetic Biologics, Inc. as a 21 mg or 42 mg capsule of lovasta tin in a modified -release formulation. SYN-010 is a capsule containing enteric -coated tablets of lovastatin designed to release drug in both the duodenal (pH 5.5) and ileocecal (pH 7.0) regions of the GI tract. 8.3 Comparator treatment to be administered 8.3.1 Place bo The placebo is a capsule containing enteric -coated tablets without drug product that will be identical in appearance to SYN -010 and packaged in identical containers. The placebo will be supplied by Synthetic Biologics, Inc. 8.4 Full description and handling of treatments 8.4.1 SYN-010 SYN-010 will be supplied as a 21 mg or 42 mg capsule of lovastatin in a modified release formulation. SYN -010 is a green, size 1 HPMC capsule containing either 3 (21 mg) or 6 (42 mg) enteric -coated tablets of lovastatin (each 7 mg) d esigned to release drug in both the duodenal (pH 5.5) and ileocecal (pH 7.0) regions of the GI tract. The placebo is an HPMC capsule containing enteric coated tablets without drug product that will be identical in appearance to SYN -010 and packaged in iden tical containers. 8.4.1.1 General warning SYN-010 capsules should not be chewed or opened. The active ingredient of SYN -010 (lovastatin) is currently listed as a pregnancy category X drug and should not be taken during pregnancy. Female subjects who become pregnant must immediately discontinue taking study drug. Subjects will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy occurring during the study should be confirmed and reported to the investigator, who will then withdraw the female subjects from the study without delay. The investigator should also be notified of any pregnancy occurring durin g the study but confirmed after completion of the study. Clinical studies with the commercially -available cholesterol -lowering lovastatin formulation Mevacor® (Merck) showed that lovastatin, like other inhibitors of HMG -CoA reductase, occasionally causes m yopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal. Myopathy sometimes takes the form of"
28,page_28,"Date: June 30, 2020 Version : 8.0 Page: 29 of 52 rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of HMG -CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. SYN -010 is designed to limit systemic exposure of HMG -CoA reductase inhibiting lovastatin species and no myopathy or rhabdomyolysis w ere observed in Phase 1 or Phase 2a clinical trials with up to 12 weeks of SYN -010 42 mg dosing. Transient and reversible increase s in serum CK were observed in two subjects treated with SYN -010 42 mg for 8 weeks in the Phase 2a clinical trial; however, th ese were deemed unrelated to study drug by the investigator and returned to normal without discontinuation of SYN -010. Clinical studies with the commercially -available cholesterol -lowering lovastatin formulation Mevacor® (Merck) also found p ersistent incre ases (to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) in serum transaminases occurred in 1.9% of adult patients who received lovastatin for at least one year in early clinical trials. When the drug was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the tra nsaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases usually appeared 3 to 12 months after the start of therapy with lovastatin and were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. SYN-010 is designed to limit systemic exposure to lovastatin species and SYN-010 21 mg and 42 mg doses did not cause clinically meaningful o r persistent alterations to serum transaminase levels in Phase 1 or Phase 2a clinical trials. 8.4.1. 2 Dose handling All study drug has been manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products and the relevant regulatory requirements. The study drug will be distr ibuted by PCI Pharma Services. All packaging and labeling operations have been perfor med according to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products and the relevant regulatory requirements. Study drug at the clinical study sites should be stored at controlled room temperature in a locked area accessible only to appropriate study perso nnel. Study drug bottles, and any unused study drug, will be retained by the study site until final reconciliation is completed, then destroyed by the study site according to local procedures. The investigator must provide an explanation for any missi ng bo ttles or missing capsules. Any missing bottles or capsules must be documented in the applicable source documentation and Accountability Log. 8.4.1. 3 Dose calculation SYN-010 doses were selected based on previous clinical experience in Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical studies. These studies showed that SYN -010 provided continuous delivery of lovastatin lactone throughout the colon, and stool concentrations for the SYN -010 21 mg and 42 mg doses were equivalent to concentrations that inhibited methane producti on by ~60% and ~90% respectively in stool samples from an IBS -C patient in vitro . Moreover, these SYN-010 doses did not cause significant or persistent systemic effects on blood chemistry, hematology or urinalysis parameters over 12 weeks of dosing in Phas e 2a clinical trials. 8.4.1. 4 Dose administration"
29,page_29,"Date: June 30, 2020 Version : 8.0 Page: 30 of 52 The study drugs, SYN -010 21 mg or 42 mg (active) or placebo (control), will be administered orally once daily at bedtime for 12 weeks. 8.4.1. 5 Dose modification No dose adjustments will be allowed. 8.5 Blinding In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a SUSAR completed for patients on investigational drug SYN -010, the patient’s treatment code will be unblinded and report ed to the health authorities. SUSARs involving placebo wo uld not be required to be submitted to the health authorities , however local and institutional regulations should be followed . Any safety reports completed, do not need to be unblinded before submitting to other investigators. Submission of safety report s to the ethics committee should follow local reporting regulation s. 8.5.1 Emergency unblinding by the investigator Unblinding may occ ur for emergency purposes only. The i nvestigator should note that the occurrence of a serious adverse event or progressive disea se should not routinely precipitate the imm ediate unblinding of the label. If unblinding is necessary for the treatment of a patient for a serious adverse event, every attempt should be made to contact the investigator prior to unblinding. If this is not f easible, then the investigator must be contacted within 24 hours of unblinding . 8.6 Drug logistics and accountability All study drugs will be stored at the investigational site in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements and the instructions given by the clinical supplies department of the Institution and will be ina ccessible to unauthorized personnel . 8.6.1 Storage All investigational product will be kept in a locked area with access limited to study staff only. The locked area will be maintained under controlled temperature conditions at 20oC-25oC (68oF-77oF), and away from light and moisture . 8.6.2 Accountability The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator, must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of the agent(s) (investigational or free of charge) using the Drug Accountability Record or another comparable drug accountability form. 8.6.3 Destruction and return At the end of the study, unused supplies of SYN -010 and other investigational agents should be destroyed appropriately and according to institutional policies. Destruction will be documented in the Drug Accountability Record Form."
30,page_30,"Date: June 30, 2020 Version : 8.0 Page: 31 of 52 8.7 Treatment compliance Upon receipt of the study drug, the investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator, will conduct an inventory of the supplies and verify that study drug suppli es are received intact and in the correct amounts. A full drug accountability log will be maintained at the study site at all times. All discrepancies must be accounted for and documented. Subjects will be expected to return all unused study drug and empty containers to the site at each clinic visit, and the number of capsules dispensed and returned will be documented by study staff. The study personnel will account for all drugs dispensed and returned. All unused supplies of SYN - 010 and other investigatio nal agents will be destroyed appropriately and according to institutional policies. Destruction will be documented in the Drug Accountability Record form. Subjects who are not compliant with treatment protocol, including laboratory evaluations, will be subject to withdrawal from the study at the discretion of the i nvestigator. 8.8 Prior and concomitant therapy Any prior or c oncomitant therapy that the patient may be taking and may be necessary for the patient’s welfare taken within two weeks prior to the start of the study and during the study must be recorded in the patient ’s source documentation and in the CRF (i ncluding start/stop dates, dose frequency, route of administration, and indication). The patient may be on a stable, continu ous regimen of fiber, or probiotics one month before the Screening Visit; however, he/she must maintain a stable dose regimen through Week 12. Additionally, certain drugs used for the treatment of IBS (e.g. low dose tricyclic antidepressants) may be allowe d at the discretion of the Medical Monitor provided the patient remains on a stable dose for one month prior to the Screening Visit and throughout the study with the exception of tegaserod, lubiprostone, linaclotide, metoclopramide, prucalopride, domperido ne, plecanatide , CandiBa ctin, Atrantil, Allimax/Allimed within 2 weeks prior to the Screening Visit or antibiotics within 2 months prior to the Screening Visit . Rescue medication will be allowed for severe constipation (i .e. when symptoms become intolerabl e). For guidance purposes for this protocol, intolerable symptoms may be when a subject has not had a complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) in the preceding three days with an abdominal pain score of ≥ 6 on an 11 -point (0 -10) scale each day during tha t time period. However, intolerability is ultimately a subjective judgment, and principal investigators and their patients make the final decision regarding what is intolerable and requires use of the rescue medication. For the Randomization Visit only, re scue medication will not be allowed the day before, the day of, or the calendar day after the Randomization Visit. If rescue medication is taken during this time, it must be recorded as a protocol deviation and the subject should not be randomized. The use of protocol - specified rescue medication and non -protocol -specified laxatives will be recorded in the subject record. Permitted rescue medications include bisacodyl , magnesium citrate, magnesium hydroxide, and lactulose. Dosage and frequency should be foll owed according to package insert on rescue medication and should not exceed recommended doses as approved by package insert."

As with any agent, there is always the potential for unexpected AEs, including hypersensitivity reactions. The IB will be updated if any new relevant safety data are ob tained. Therapeutic monitoring should be performed following dose selection of SYN -010 in a manner consistent with the local clinical standard of care . In general, patient s should be closely monitored for side effects of all concomitant medications regardle ss of the path of drug elimination. All concomitant medications must be recorded in the patient ’s source documentation. Patient s must be carefully m onitored for AEs. This monitoring also includes clinical laboratory tests. Adverse events should be assess ed in terms of their seriousness, intensity, and relationship to the study drug treatment. The institutional sponsor and investigator are responsibl e to comply with the local regulation and legislation for adverse events reporting. 9.3.11.1 Definitions Adverse event (AE) In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e. any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a patient or clinical investigation patient after providing written informed consent for participatio n in the study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of an investigational product. A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by any physician treating the patient should not be recorded as AE . The clinical manifestation of any failure of expected pharmacological action (lack of eff icacy) is not recorded as an AE if it is already reflected as a data point captured in the CRF. If, however, the event fulfills any of the criteria of an SAE, it must be recorded as and AE and reported as an SAE. • Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms or treatments are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as medical history (e.g. seasonal allergy without acute complaints). • Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity, are recorded as medical history (e.g. allergic pollinosis) . • Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed con sent will be documented as adverse events ."
37,page_37,"Date: June 30, 2020 Version : 8.0 Page: 38 of 52 Serious adverse event (AE) An SAE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meet s any of the following criteria : • Results in death. • Is life -threatening . o The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. • Requires inpatient hospi talization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. o A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization will not be regarded as an SAE if at least one of the following exceptions is met: ▪ The admission results in a hospital stay of less than 12 hours. ▪ The admission is pre -planned . ▪ The admission is not associated with an AE. o Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity. o Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s functions. ▪ Is a congenital anomaly /birth defect. ▪ Is another medically important serious event as judged by the investigator . 9.3.11.2 Reporting of serious adverse events The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given above in section 7. 3.1.1. Each serious adverse event must be followed up until resolution or stabilization, by submission of updated reports to the designated person. The investigator must promptly report to the Institutional Review Board all events, incidents, information, and outcomes that represent a possible unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others. An isolated laboratory abnormality that is assigned as serious , according to the i nvestigator is not reportable as an SAE , unless the i nvestigator assesses that the eve nt meets standard ICH criteria for an SAE. Baseline laboratory abnormalities that are part of the disease profile should not be reported as an SAE, specifically when they are allowed or not excluded by the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria. When requ ired, and according to local law and regulations, serious adverse events that are determined by the Investigator to be related to the investigational drug must be reported by the investigator o r the i nstitution safety officer to the Ethics Committee and Regulatory Authorities. Per the emergency unblinding section above (section 6.4.1), if SAE is considered to be related to the treatment, t he Cedar s-Sinai safety g roup will unblind the subject and determine if the subject was administered inve stigational drug and if so, will proceed with expedited reporting to the FDA .

The report should be submitted within the same timelines as an SAE, although a pregnancy per se is not considered an SAE. For a study patient , the outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up carefully, and any abnormal outcome of the mother or the child should be reported.
