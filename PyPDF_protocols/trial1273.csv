The study will consist of 7 office visits , 6 Sample collection visits and 3 phone call assessment s. Subjects agreeing to participate in the study and meet ing the entry criteria assessed at the screening visit, will begin a 28 day baseline period to confirm their diagnos is, and establish a baseline frequency of migraine and headache days. During th e baseline period, subjects will continue treating their migraines in their usual manner . They will monitor headache activity, migraine related symptoms, and medication us age with an electronic daily headache diary. Subjects who, after completing the baseline, continue to meet entrance criteria will be eligible to enter into the 4 month treatment phase . They will be randomized according to the Clinvest generated randomization schedule. A total of 30 randomized subjects will enter the treatment phase receiving ISIS 546254 (SC) or placebo in a 1:1 design. Study drug or placebo will be administered weekly for 16 we eks. A short phone call to assess any treatment related advers e events will take place 1 and 2 days after randomization. Daily electronic diary assessments will collect headache frequency and severity, associated migraine symptoms, acute medication usage , and the emergence of unusual symptoms and adverse events . Subjects will return to the site at weeks 4, 8 , and 12 for investigational product ( IP) accountability/dispensing, medication and medication updates, biomarker/lab sample collection , and assessment of adverse events. An end of treatment visit will take place 16 weeks after randomization.

Migraine represents an enormous socio -economic burden to the individual as well as to the society and affects the quality of life. A migraine attack is characterized by recurrent, severe, debilitating headache associated with nausea, vomiting, photoph obia, phonophobia, and/or osmophobia, and fatigue, along with other disturbances in autonomic, mental, sensory and motor functions. Migraine attacks typically last 4 to 72 hours and may be precipitated by endogenous factors (i.e., hormonal changes, psycho social stress, sleep deficit or surplus, hunger), or by exogenous factors (i.e., certain kinds of food; stimulation of different sensory modalities). Migraine attacks can be preceded by abnormal visual, sensory, motor and/or speech functions (migraine wit h aura) or start with no warning signs (migraine without aura). Chronic migraine (CM), defined as migraine occurring on ≥ 15 days per month, is a disabling neurological condition with an estimated global prevalence of up to 4 - 5%, and represents approxima tely half of all cases of chronic primary headache (Stovner et al. 2006; Stovner et al. 2007; Diener et al. 2012; Paemeleire et al. 2014). Episodic migraine (EM) has a complex relationship with CM as approximately 2.5 –3 % of EM patients per year evolve in to a CM state (‘‘progression’’) and CM can remit back to EM, with a 2 -year remission rate of around 25%(Bigal 2008; Manack 2011). CM patients are most commonly females in their 40s and have longer attacks, experience greater pain severity, are more disabl ed, and more likely to have a lower quality of life than patients with EM (Paemeleire et al. 2014). Mood and anxiety disorders, respiratory disorders and cardiac risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and high cholesterol, were also repor ted significantly more by CM patients (Buse et al. 2010). Treatment of Chronic Migraine The goal of CM treatment is to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and return the patient to an episodic pattern and includes counseling on risk factors such a s caffeine and analgesic use and stress management. Drug therapy for prevention of migraine revolves around a variety of nonspecific drugs that primarily reduce neuronal hyperexcitability, the putative pathophysiological hallmark for migraine. Various pha rmacologic classes of medication are used for migraine prophylaxis. Four of the more effective classes include effective classes include beta blockers, anticonvulsants, calcium antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants. In the US, topiramate and valproate s odium are approved for migraine prophylaxis, and botulinum toxin type A (BoNT -A) is approved for prophylaxis of CM. Regardless of class, effect sizes are modest and data from randomized, placebo -controlled trials (RCT) is scant. Topiramate, one of the bes t-studied medications, established efficacy at a daily dose of 100 mg during 16 weeks via two multicenter, parallel -group RCT in Europe (59 patients) and the USA (328 patients) (Diener et al. 2007; Silberstein et al. 2007). The topiramate studies demonstr ated a mean reduction in monthly migraine days of 3.5 (versus a reduction of 0.2 for placebo) and a number needed -to-treat of 12.5. There is no standard definition for drug refractory CM, but generally at least three or four drugs should have been adequat ely tested"

Other therapies for CM include peripheral nerve stimulation (both invasive and non -invasive), central neurostimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, cranial osteopathic manipulative treatment, a nd cognitive -behavioral therapy. The various effective preventive agents used in migraine prophylaxis, such as topiramate, valproate, b -blockers, and tricyclic antidepressants, appear to have in common the effect of suppressing cortical excitability. Migraine Pathophysiology CM is a chronic pain disorder where migraine attacks coexist with almost daily head pain: its pathophysiology is complex, with features of migraine attacks overlapping with those of acute head pain and chronic pain disorders. Structural, physiologic, and biochemical alterations in the brains of patients with CM have been documented. Migraine has a genetic basis in that common genetic variants set a ‘‘migraine threshold’’ that is modulated by endogenous and exogenous factors and characterized by an abnorma l pattern of sensory processing. Neurophysiological studies have shown that for a number of different sensory modalities the migrainous brain is characterized by a lack of habituation to evoked responses (Coppola et al. 2007). Whether this is due to incr eased cortical hyperexcitability, possibly due to decreased inhibition, or to an abnormal responsivity of the cortex due a decreased preactivation level remains disputed. Sensitization of central trigeminovascular neurons in nucleus caudalis mediates cuta neous allodynia (Burnstein and Jakubowski 2005). Kallikrein -Kinin System Plasma prekallikrein (PKK) is a glycoprotein that is predominantly synthesized in the liver. Low levels of PKK mRNA are also found in the epithelial cells of the kidney, adrenal glan d and placenta. PKK is secreted into the circulation as a single chain zymogen that has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 85 -88 kDa. The major physiological activator of PKK, activated factor XII (FXIIa), cleaves a single peptide bond to gene rate the active form of plasma kallikrein. Kallikrein is anchored to cell surfaces by binding to its substrate HMWK (Björkqvist et al. 2013). PKK is a key component of the kallikrein -kinin system (KKS) signaling cascade. Kallikrein cleaves HMWK to releas e the potent inflammatory vasodilator peptide hormone bradykinin (BK). BK acts through stimulation of G -protein coupled B1 receptors (B1R) or B2 receptors (B2R). B2R are constitutively expressed in multiple tissues, whereas B1R are typically expressed in very low numbers but rapidly increase in response to tissue injury, inflammation, or other pathophysiological events. B2R mediate bronchoconstriction, local blood flow regulation, hypotension, acute inflammatory reactions, pain, and hyperalgesia. B1R me diate short -lived arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin (PG) synthesis and B1R activation leads to elevation of intracellular free calcium activity by increasing calcium entry into the cell (Sharma et al. 2012). B1R affect natriuresis and glomerular filtration, contribute in the pathogenesis of diabetes, support leucocyte recruitment and the initiation of inflammatory responses and pain, and are mitogenic in fibrotic tissue (Sharma et al. 2012). Bradykinin and Migraine"

BK might also influence migraine. As an inflammatory agent, it directly activates the trigeminal system when applied to the meninges. Furthermore, BK stimulates the in crease of intracellular Ca2+. Ca2+ has a key function in hemiplegic migraines and in cortical spreading depression. Via calcium, the signaling cascade leads to increased nitric oxide (NO) production and calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP ) release. Bo th NO and CGRP are intensely discussed elements of migraines. BK stimulates endothelial cell prostacyclin synthesis leading to inhibition of platelet function and the formation of nitric oxide (Palmer et al. 1987) BK is involved in numerous signaling path ways, including involvement with g -coupled receptors that modulate pain and inflammation. Stimulation of the BK receptor leads to activation of a phosphoinositide signaling pathway, the release of intracellular calcium, and the activation of a kinase syst em. Various signal transduction mechanisms have been described for kinins, e.g. the activation of phospholipases A2, C, and D with the subsequent release of prostaglandins, NO, inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol leading to the mobilization of intrace llular calcium and activation of protein kinase C (Engeli 2004). This leads to the opening of the nociceptors TRPV1 channels in the sensory nerve cell membrane, enhancing nociception. Generated during inflammation and tissue injury, BK is a prominent alg ogenic mediator and regulator of the noxious heat sensitivity of nociceptors. Two (2) receptor types have been described: B1 and B2. B2 is constitutive in numerous tissues, including neurons, whereas B1 is typically inducible and its activation can gener ate both pain and inflammation. BKs numerous physiological functions might also be implicated in migraine headache (Engeli 2004). The activation of B2 receptors, constitutively expressed in primary sensory neurons, promotes polymodal nociceptor activation and hyperalgesia through the production of diacylglycerol and activation of protein kinase C (Engeli 2004). BK can sensitize nociceptors following the release of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, cytokines and NO either from sensory neurons or endothelial and immune cells. BK is also known to facilitate the release of substance P and CGRP from rat sensory neurons in culture (Engeli 2004). However, the type of BK receptor responsible for pain and inflammation in humans has not been adequatel y defined. Studies have substantiated the binding of BK to cortical astrocytes and indicated that stimulation with BK causes calcium turnover, suggesting a role for BK in central nervous transmission (Stephens et al. 1993). BK increases Ca2+ -levels in sen sory neurons (Linhart et al. 2003). BK activation simulates the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and Ca2+ supply through Ca2+ entry pathways in the plasma membrane. BK regulates systemic and local hemodynamics by turning on NO production (Engeli 2004). HAE and Migraine Chung and Kim reported on an HAE patient manifesting migraine -like episodes of headache, effectively prophylaxed with Danazol. The patient, a 44 -yr-old Korean man, suffered from frequent attacks of migraine -like headache (3 -7 per month), pulsating in nature, associated with nausea, and aggravated by activity. His headache had shown recent progression with abdominal pain. No remarkable findings were observed on radiologic examination, including brain MRI"

Danazol 200 mg every other day prevented the migraine -like episodes for about 2 years. A single moderate migraine -like headache was resolved with administration of naratriptan 2.5 mg (Chung and Kim 2012). It suggests that pathogenic mechan ism of headache in hereditary angioedema may be mediated by the neurogenic inflammatory -like physiology of migraine. Hoxha et al. reported on 38 -old female HAE patient presenting facial paralysis and hemiparesis, persistent headache, nausea, and vomiting who also responded to Danazol with resolution of her symptoms (Hoxha et al. 2013). Current clinical studies are underway investigating inhibitors of calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) as prophylactic agents for chronic migraine. Due to the role that BK plays in the stimulating the release of CGRP via its increasing prostaglandin production through binding to BK BR2, it is thought that the systemic reduction of circulating PKK, and therefore the reduction of plasma’s potential to produce BK, could grea tly reduce the contribution of BK and its associated downstream effects in chronic migraine (Ceruti et al. 2011; Supowit et al. 2011; Petho and Reeh 2012; Gangadha et al. 2014). This, combined with the known long tissue half -life of ASOs, supports ISIS 54 6254 as a potentially attractive once -weekly, self -administered, subcutaneous treatment for the p revention, or amelioration, of symptoms associated with chronic migraine . ISIS 546254 Antisense oligonucleotides are short synthetic strings of nucleotides that selectively bind to mRNA and prevent the expression of a targeted protein encoded by that specific segment of mRNA. These compounds bind to RNA with high affinity and selectivity . Antisense technologies offer a number of potential advantages over more t raditional approaches for drug discovery and development including: (1) greatly improved specificity allowing discrimination between closely related gene products; (2) predictability due to some similarities in pharmacokinetics, toxicology and manufacturin g; and (3) versatility allowing inhibition of “non - druggable” targets, such as transcription factors, adapter proteins and other proteins with no intrinsic enzymatic activity or proteins with unknown function. Antisense oligonucleotides have been tested cl inically for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases including viral disease, cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic and inflammatory diseases. The investigational product, ISIS 546254, is a chimeric 2′ -O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2′ -MOE) antisense oligonucleotid e (ASO) targeted to human prekallikrein (PKK) mRNA. As such , it is a highly specific inhibitor of PKK synthesis which should result in reduced BK generation . The antisense concept is based upon Watson -Crick hybridization. Antisense oligonucleotides are designed to inhibit the translation of mRNA by binding with high affinity and selectivity to their RNA targets. Antisense oligonucleotides exert their inhibitory effects on mRNA translation by a number of mechanisms, the most studied of which includes brea kdown of steady -state mRNA levels through the utilization of endogenous RNase H 1 enzyme .(Monia et al. 1993) ISIS 546254 was designed to function through an RNase H 1-dependent terminating mechanism. (Baker and Monia 1999) RNase H1 efficiently induces antisen se-mediated cleavage of mRNA and is present in most mammalian cells. Antisense -mediated reduction of target mRNA levels is typically 85 - 90% of control levels. (Crooke and Bennett 1996) Furthermore, reduction in target mRNA levels"

ISIS 546254 is a very potent antisense inhibitor of human PKK expression and has demonstrated an ED 50 of 2.5 -5 mg/kg/week in transgenic animal models. After systemic administration, the pr imary mechanism of ISIS 546254 is to reduce circulating prekallikrein (PKK) levels, therefore reducing the plasma’s ability to produce kallikrein which in turn will reduce bradykinin formation and vascular permeability. Preclinical data indicate that reduc tion of PKK by administering a specific antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting PKK mRNA (ISIS 546254) leads to reduced ability of treated plasma to produce bradykinin and reduced vascular permeability in animal models. (Revenkop et al. 2011) This, comb ined with the known long tissue half -life of ASOs, supports ISIS 546254 as a potentially attractive self -administered, SC treatment for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine . 8 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE S 1.

Effective contraception includes a vasectomy with negative semen analysis at follow -up, or the use of condoms together with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . Male subjects engaged in sexual r elations with a female of child -bearing potential must also encourage their female partner to use effective contraception from the time of signing the informed consent until 96 days after the subject’s last dose of study treatment . Effective contracepti on for the female partner includes: surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation), hormonal contraception, intrauterine contraception/device, or barrier methods (female condom*, diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap) together with spermicidal foam/gel/ film/cream/suppository. Male subjects with partners that are pregnant must use condoms to ensure that the fetus is not exposed to the Study Drug. †Note: Abstinence is only acceptable as true abstinence, i.e., when this is in line with the preferred and us ual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a trial and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. *Note: A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction between the two can result in either or both products failing. 14 INFORMED CONSENT The investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential subject, or legally authorized representative, pr ior to any study related procedures being performed. Consent must be documented by the subject’s dated signature on an Informed Consent Form (ICF) along with the dated signature of the persons conducting the consenting process. A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participating in the study. 15 STUDY DRUG RANDOMIZATION AND TRAINING Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive ISIS 546254, 200 mg/mL, 1 mL or placebo at Visit 2 by unblinded staff . If at any time during the study the subject withdrawals from the study, they will be instructed to return all used packaging and unused medication to unblinded staff. All doses (200mg ISIS546254 or placebo will be given by subcutaneous ( SC) injection at a standa rdized volume of 1.00 mL ISIS 546254 or placebo weekly through week 16. All dosing after the first injection at the site may be self -administered per dosing schedule if desired by the subject. All subjects will have the option to return to the site for injections administered by the unblinded staff if they desire. Subjects wi ll receive training on proper administration of IP, storage requirements, and will be asked to return all used/partially used/unused medication containers at the next office visit to unblinded staff . Any subject self -administering IP will call site to conf irm most recent lab report values are within allowable rages dosing. Adjustments of dose and/or treatment schedule should occur only on rare occasions. Adjustments in the dose and/or treatment schedule may be allowed only with consent of the study medica l"

A brief description should be provided in the deviation, incl uding whether the subject was symptomatic (list symptoms) or asymptomatic, and the event accidental or intentional. 17 RESCUE MEDICATION Subjects will be instructed they may take their investigator approved rescue medications for headaches, if needed. Rescu e medication usage and dosage will be recorded on the headache diary. 18 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIO NS Therapy considered necessary for the subject’s welfare may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. Concomitant medication usage and dosage will be recorded on the concomitant medication form. Routine medications , including migraine preventative medications , should be maintained on a stable dose and regimen for the duration of the study period. Additionally, a ny concomitant chronic therapies should be maintained at a stable dose and dose regimen during the study. 18.1 Allowed Medications 1. All acute migraine medications currently taken by subject at Visit 1 will be allowed during the study as a rescue medication or if a subjec t does not treat with study drug for that specific headache. 2. All migraine preventative medications , currently taken by subject at Visit 1 , will be allowed if on a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to Visit 1 and subject agrees to continue at that d ose throughout the study. 18.2 Prohibited Medications 1. Any anticoagulant during the study is prohibited 19 HEADACHE DIARY The primary and much of the secondary endpoints will be derived from the electronic daily headache diary. Site personnel will be responsible for instructing subjects on the requirement for timely and daily completion of the electronic diary. Each day, the subject will be asked to record diary data for the previous day (24 hour period). If a subject does not experience a headache i n the previous 24 hour period, the diary must still be completed and recorded as no headache. Subject’s diaries may vary day to day based on their responses. Subjects will be asked to document all headaches experienced regardless of severity for the dura tion of the study . All subjects should have at least 80% compliance with diary completion throughout the length of the study. Subjects will record headache severity, symptoms, use of acute medications, as well as additional questions as required. Headac he severity will be subjectively rated by the subject as"

These ratings will be collected at pre - defined time points. 20 UNSCHEDULED VISITS If a subject has an unscheduled visit, the unschedul ed visit form must be completed. If the visit occurs for safety reasons, all relevant safety data should be captured and reported on the appropriate forms. If the unscheduled visit results in an early termination, all applicable final study visit procedu res will be performed and the early termination form will need to be completed as well . 21 BLINDING/UNBLINDING At randomization (Visit 2 ), neither the subject nor the investigator will be aware to which treatment group the subject has been assigned. Investigational product will be drawn and administered by an unblinded member of the staff. If needed, for safety and proper treatment of the subject, the investigator can unblind the subject’s treatment assignment to determine which treatment has been ass igned and institute appropriate follow -up care. When possible, Sponsor and Clinvest should be notified prior to unblinding study drug. Individual unblinding envelopes are shipped with study drug. Each study drug kit has a corresponding unblinding env elope. Unblinding will include matching the kit and unblinding envelope with the subject drug number. To unblind a subject without breaking the blind for remaining subjects’ treatment the following instructions described below will be followed: • Obtain the security envelope containing the unblinding envelopes. • Remove the unblinding envelope with the study drug number corresponding with the study drug kit dispensed to the subject. • Break the seal of the unblinding envelope and remove the subjects’ treatmen t label. • Return the subjects’ treatment label to the unblinding envelope. • Return the unblinding envelope to the security envelope . • Document on the unblinding form located in the eAdmin Binder. • Email copy of unblinding form to study@clinvest.com within 24 hours of unblinding. • Complete and email or fax the Sterling IRB, unanticipated problem report form, to Sterling IRB within 10 business days of unblinding. 22 DISCONTINUATION/WITH DRAWAL FROM STUDY All subjects who withdraw from the study, for any reason, must return all study drug and supplies to the investigator or his/her delegate at the first available opportunity. Subjects may withdraw at any time or be dropped from the study at the discretion of the investigator or Clinvest if he/she violates the study plan or for administrative and/or safety reasons. When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to study completion, all applicable activities scheduled for the final study visit should be perform ed at the time of discontinuation, as well as the completion of the early termination form and unscheduled visit form (if appropriate). Any adverse experiences which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in"

An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study product. An adverse event can theref ore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study product, whether or not related to the study product. An adverse event observed after the initial dos e of the study product will be considered a “treatment -emergent adverse event”. Treatment -emergent adverse events will be analyzed and discussed in the clinical study report for this study. Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference to the listing of individual signs and symptoms. If a diagnosis is not possible, each sign and symptom should be recorded as an individual adverse event. All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug, must be completely docum ented on the appropriate adverse event eCRF (electronic case report form) page. If a subject is withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event, this must also be recorded on the appropriate eCRF pages. The site staff must record all directly observed AEs and all spontaneously reported AEs. At each visit, the site staff will ask the subject a non -specific question (e.g., “Have you noticed any change in your health since your last visit?”) to assess AE oc currence since the last report or visit. 23.1 Non-Serious Adverse Event (NSAE) Non-serious adverse events ( NSAE ) will be collected beginning after the first dose of study medication of treatment and will include any change from the subject’s condition at Visit 2 though the last follow up phone call 3 months post treatment . These include physical findings, clinical signs and symptoms, or sequelae. Any worsening (i.e. any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency and/or intensity) of a preexistin g condition which is temporally associated with the use of the provided product, is also considered to be an adverse event. Events such as elective medical/surgical procedures or anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing conditions present at sc reening that do not worsen are not considered NSAE’s. All NSAE’s noted will be captured on the non -serious adverse events eCRF. Information captured will include start date/time, end date/time, severity, relationship of causality to study drug, course of action taken, and outcome."

It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.). 3. require s subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 4. results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 5. Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life - threatening, or do not require hospitalization may also be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples o f such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should also be considered serious. SAE’s will be reported in compliance with all applicable safety reporting requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations. SAE’s assessed as life threatening or death “possibly related to the study medication” will be reported to Clinvest, Sponsor, and Sterling IRB within 24 hours of knowledge of the event by study staff. All other SA E’s (such as hospitalization, disability, congenital anomaly, and an important medical event) will be reported to Clinvest, Sponsor, and Sterling IRB within 48 hours of knowledge of the event by study staff. A MedWatch Form FDA 3500A will also be complete d and forwarded to Sponsor and Clinvest. Included in the SAE Report Form will be an assessment of the causal relationship between the Study IP and the SAE. SAE’s will be followed by study staff until the event(s) have returned to normal, stabilized, or have been otherwise explained, for at least 2 weeks following the last dose of study drug."

Confirmation Guidance : At any time during the Study (Treatment or Post -Treatment Periods), the initial clinical laboratory results meeting the safety monitoring criteria presented below must be confirmed by performing measurements (i deally in the same laboratory that performed the initial measurement) on new specimens. All new specimen collections should take place as soon as possible (ideally within 3 days of the initial collection). For stopping rules, if the initial laboratory re sult is observed during the Treatment Period, the results from the retest must be available prior to administering the next dose of Study Drug (ISIS 546254 or placebo). Re-dosing Guidance : Subjects with initial laboratory test values that reach a stopping rule must not be re -dosed until the re -test results are available. In general, subjects who do not meet the stopping rules based upon retest may continue dosing. However, the Investigator and study drug manufacturer (Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc.) should confer as to whether additional close monitoring of the subject is appropriate. If any of the stopping criteria described below (Section 25) are met, the subject will be permanently discontinued from further treatment with Study Drug, evaluated ful ly as outlined below and in consultation Ionis Pharmaceuticals or appropriately qualified designee, and will be followed up in accordance with Section 23 of the protocol. 24.1 Safety Monitoring Rules for Liver Chemistry Tests The following rules are adapted fr om the draft guidance for industry, “Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation,” issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, July 2009. For a definition of Baseline, please refer to guidance in Section 8.5 above. In the event of an ALT or AST measurement that is > 3 x ULN (or the greater of 2 x baseline value or 3 x ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) at any time during the Study (Treatment or Post-Treatment Period), the initial measurement(s ) should be confirmed as described above. Additional, confirmatory measurements should also be performed if ALT or AST levels increase to 5 x ULN. Frequency of Repeat Measurements : Subjects with confirmed ALT or AST levels > 3 x ULN (or the greater of 2 x baseline value or 3 x ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) should have their liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, ALP, INR and total bilirubin) retested at least once -weekly until ALT and AST levels become ≤ 1.2 x ULN ( or 1.2 x baseline value if the baselin e value was > ULN)."

Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior and concurrent diseases 2. Obtain further history for concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications, herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets 3. Obtain a history for exposure to environmental chemical agents and travel 4. Serology for viral hepatitis (HAV IgM, HBsAg, HCV antibody, CMV IgM, and EBV antibody panel) 5. Serology for autoimmune hepatitis (e.g., antinuclear antibody (ANA)) Additio nal liver evaluations, including gastroenterology/hepatology consultations, hepatic CT or MRI scans, may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator, in consultation with Ionis Pharmaceutic als. Repetition of the above evaluations should be consider ed if a subject’s ALT and/or AST levels reach 5 x ULN. 24.2 Safety Monitoring Rules for Platelet Count Results All patients will have platelet measures taken every two weeks for the duration of the study. 24.3 Safety Monitoring for Bleeding Events Minor bleeding events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for major bleeding or clinically relevant, non -major bleeding events (which are defined below), for example excess bruising, petechiae, gingival bleeding on brushing teeth. If a minor bleeding event occurs , the Investigator should notify Ionis Pharmaceuticles and additional testing of coagulation parameters (aPTT, PT, INR) and platelet count should be performed. 24.3.1 Definition of Major Bleeding Events 1. Fatal bleeding, and/or 2. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra -articular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or 3. Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2.0 mg/dL ( 1.24 mmol/L) or more within 24 hours, or leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole or red cells 24.3.2 Definition of Clinically Relevant , Non -Major Bleeding Events 1. Multiple -source bleeding 2. Spontaneous hematoma > 25 cm2 3. Excessive wound hematoma (not injection site related)"

If possible, the samples to be used in the substudy will be obtained at the same time that the patient is scheduled to have blood drawn for clinical laboratory assessments as required at the Screening visit for the main study. All samples collected for the s ubstudy will be sent to the designated central laboratory and later shipped to a biorepository for storage. Samples collected for the substudy may be stored at the biorepository for potential analysis under separate protocols for up to 15 years. Substudy s amples may be stored for a longer time if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being answered. In this special circumstance, such substudy samples will be stored until these questions have been adequately addressed. All pat ients enrolled in the clinical trial will be considered for enrollment in the Future Biomedical Research substudy; however, participation is optional and will require a separate informed consent form. A patient who initially consents can withdraw that cons ent at any time and have his or her substudy sample destroyed, including any by -products of the sample. 38 SUMMARY OF METHODS O F DATA COLLECTION Data required for the evaluation of the primary and some secondary measures will be recorded by subjects using a daily e -diary. The following data will be collected daily with the e -diary: • Onset and duration of headache • Severity of headache (mild, moderate, or severe) • Acute headache medication(s) us age • Study drug usage • Associated symptoms • Unusual symptoms Questionnaire data required to be directly collected from subject will be obtained at each appropriate visit using an electronic device as defined in the protocol. Questionnaires are to be completed by the subject and the answers to the questions on the q uestionnaires should come directly form the subject directly, not from family, friend or the study personnel."

Randomization will not include any type of stratification. An alpha of .05 will be used for statistical significance. All statistical te sts will be two -tailed . Descriptive statistics will establish baseline characteristics and adverse event frequency. Data for the safety primary endpoint will be statistically analyzed via Chi -squared analyses and a 2 - tailed Repeated Measures ANOVA for the efficacy primary endpoi nt. Data for each of the secondary outcome measures will be statistically analyzed via a 2 -tailed Repeated Measures ANOVA , chi-squared, and/or independent or dependent t -tests as appropriate. All ANOVAs will be followed by univariate post -hoc tests as ap propriate. Multiple comparison adjustments will be made if needed. 39.1 Modified Intent -to-Treat Population (mITT) The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and obtained at least one primary endpoint measurement after treating. The mITT population will be used for efficacy analyses. 39.2 Safety Population The safety population will include all randomized subjects who received at least one do se of study drug. A last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will be utilized to impute missing values within a single headache diary . This type of imputation replaces the missing value with the last observation value obtained. If an e-diary day is not recorded, the day will be considered a non -headache day. 40 PRIMARY ENDPOINT S 1.
