9,page_9,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 9 LY30091041.Synopsis Title of Study: A Mu lticenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Baricitinib in Combination with Topical Corticosteroids in Adult Patients with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis -BREEZE -AD7 Rationale: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a pruritic, chronic or chronically relapsing, highly symptomatic inflammatory skin disease characterized by excessive T cell activation leading to significant skin infiltration by T cells and dendritic cells (Bieber 2010) . Presentation is varied, but includes skin manifestations and pruritus, with associated sleep disturbances and subsequent skin infections. The course of disease includes relapses of varying duration and severity . Baricitinib is an orally available, selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor with potency and selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2 and less potency for JAK3 or tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) ( Fridman et al. 2010 ). The pathogenesis of AD is thought to be modulated through t hymic stromal ly mphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin (IL) -13, IL -4, IL-5, IL-22, and IL-31, many of which activate receptors with downstream signaling through intracellular JAK1/JAK 2/TYK2 (Nomura and Kabashima 2015 ). This activity profile suggests that baricitinib would inhibit cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis . Clinical studies have established that baricitinib is effective in autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases involving the joints, kidneys, and skin. Baricitinib was effective at reducing swollen and tender joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Genovese et al. 2016; Dougados et al. 2017; Fleischmann et al. 2017; Taylor et al. 2017); was effective at reducing disease severity in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Papp et al. 2016 ); was effective at reducing the urinary albumin -to-creatinine ratio in patients with diabetic kidney disease (Tuttle et al. 2015 ); and in a recently completed Phase 2 study (I4V -MC -JAHG) was effective at reducing disease severity in patients with moderate to severe AD(Guttman -Yassky et al . 2018) . The mechanism of action, combined with demonstration of clinical benefit sin inflammatory diseases involving joints, kidneys, and skin, provides the rationale for evaluating baricitinib in moderate –to-severe AD. Objectives/Endpoints: Objectives Endpoints Primary To test the hypothesis that baricitinib 4 -mg QD + TCS or baricitinib 2 -mg QD + TCS is superior to placebo + TCS in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AD.Proportio n of patients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement at Week 16. Key Secondary These are prespecified objectives that will be adjusted for multiplicity To compare the efficacy of baricitinib 2 -mg QD + TCS or baricitinib 4-mg QD + TCS to placebo + TCS in AD during the 16 - week double -blind placebo -controlled treatment period as measured by improvement in signs and symptoms of AD.Proportio n of patients achi eving EASI75 at 16 weeks Proportio n of patients achieving EASI90 at 16 weeks Percent change from baseline in EASI score at 16weeks Proportio n of patients achieving SCORAD75 at 16weeks."

Summary of Study Design: Study I4V-MC -JAIY (JAIY) is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, outpatient study evaluating the efficacy and safety of barici tinib 4 -mg once daily (QD) plus topical corticosteroids (TCS) and 2-mg QD plus TCS , as compared to placebo plus TCS in adult patients with moderate to severe AD. The study population will include patients aged 18 years or older w ho have moderate to severe AD and a history of inadequate response to existing topical therapies."
11,page_11,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 11 LY3009104The study duration will be up to 25 weeks over 3 study periods: Period 1: Screening Period lasting from 8 to 35 days prio r to Week 0 (baseline, Visit 2). Period 2: Double -Blinded Tre atment Period, lasting from Week 0 (baseline, Visit 2) through Week 16 (Visit 8) inclusive: oAt completion of the double -blind treatment period, eligible patients will be provided the option to participate in the long -term extension study I4V-MC -JAHN (JAHN). Those not eligible or who chose not to participate will proceed to the post -treatment follow -up period. Period 3: Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period, spanning the period from the last treatment visit at Week 16 (Visit 8) or Early Termination Visit ( ETV) to approximately 4 weeks following the last dose of investigational product. Treatment Arms and Duration Patients will be randomized at Week 0 to 1 of 3treatment groups: placebo once daily (QD), baricitinib 2- mg QD, o r baricitinib 4 -mg QD . Use of TCS as abackground therapy is allowed during the study . The study duration will be up to 25 weeks (Screening Period: up to 5 weeks prior to randomization; Double -Blinded Treatment Period: 16weeks; Follow -up Period: approximately 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product). Number of Patients This study will include approximately 300patients with AD who will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo QD , baricitinib 2 - mg QD or baricitinib 4 -mg QD ( 100 patients in each treatment g roup). Statistical Analysis Unless otherwise specified, the efficacy and health outcome analyses will be conducted on the intent -to-treat populatio n and safety analy ses will be conducted on those patients who receive at least 1 dose of investigational product. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables will be made using a logistic regression analysis with treatment, baseline disease severity, and region in the model. The proportions and 95% confidence interval (CI) will be reported. If a patien t needs to use rescue medication, the data after rescue onward will be considered missing and missing data will be imputed using the nonresponder imputation (NRI) method. All patients who discontinue the study or study treatment at any time for any reason will be defined as nonresponders for the NRI analysis for categorical variables after discontinuation onward. Additional analyses will be done using all observed data whether rescue medication was used or not. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and health outcome variables will be made using mixed -effects model of repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, region, baseline severity , visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score -by-visit interaction as fixed continuous effects. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within -patient variance –covariance errors. TypeIII sums of squares for the least squares means (LSMs) will be used for the statistical comparison and c ontrasts will be set up within the model to compare treatment groups at specific time points of interest . Fisher exact test will be used for all adverse events (AEs), baseline, discontinuation, and other categorical safety data. Continuous vital sign s and laboratory values will be analyzed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and baseline values in the model."

Background Atopicderm atitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a co mmo n, chronic, relapsing, highly symptom atic inflammatory skin disease (Bieber 2010 ). Pati ents wi th AD m ay present with skin lesions that can be acute with oozing, crusted, eroded vesicles or papules on ery thematous plaques. Pati ents m ay also present with lesio ns that have a subacute appearance, with thick and excori ated pl aques, o r chronic appearance, with lichenified, slight ly pigmented, excoriated plaques (Bi eber 2010 ). Atopi c derm atitis causes pruritus attacks throughout the day, which is the primary source of m orbidity in this disorder (Simpson 201 2). Pruritus often leads to an “itch – scratch” cycle, further compromising the epi dermal barri er and result ing in dry skin, microbial colonizat ion, and secondary infect ions (Krakowski et al. 2008 ) ;36% of patients have report ed that they often or always scratch unt il their skin bleeds (Langenbruch et al. 2014 ). Pruritus fro m ADcan worsen during night time, resul ting in sleep disturbances ;approximately 27% of adul t patients wi th AD experiencing sleep distur bance as a result of itching (Langenbruch et al. 2014 ). In adult patients with moderate to severe AD, sleep qualit y and latency were si gnificant ly associ ated wi th poor quali ty of life (QoL) (Yano et al . 2013 ). In clinical pract ice, AD is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on a variet y of clinical features, including severit y of skin lesi ons and pruri tus, and extent of disease (body surface area [BSA] invo lved) . Until recent ly, there were no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved systemic treatm ents for pati ents wi th moderate to severe AD, with the exception of systemic corticosteroi ds, and i n the Europ ean Unio n, only cyclosporine had been approved for the treatm ent of patients with severe AD (Bieber and Straeter 2015 ). In 2017, Dupixent (dupilumab) inject ion, an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin (IL) -4 and IL -13, was approved by th e FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for this pat ient populat ion. A recent ly completed Phase 2 study (I4V -MC-JAHG [JAHG]) evaluated the safet y and effi cacy of baricit inib (a Janus kinase [JAK] inhibitor) in AD and results showed si gnificant improvement in disease severi ty com pared to pl acebo and no new safet y concerns were ident ified (Guttm an-Yassky et al . 2018). In addit ion to AD, baricit inib has also been studied in Phase 3 in pat ients with rheumatoi d arthri tis (RA) and in Phase 2 in pati ents wi th diabeti c nephropathy , moderate to severe psoriasis, and systemic lupus ery thematosus. Through 13 February 2018 ,baricit inib has been studied in approximately 548 healt hy vo lunteers and 4 673patients have received baricit inib in clinical studies. Of these, more than 2 700patients have been treated with baricit inib for more than a year and more than 2100 patients have been treated with baricit inib for more than 2 years at doses of 2 -mg once daily (QD) and/or 4-mg QD across the RA clinical program . Baricit inib has been administered as single doses ranging from 1-to 40 -mg and as repeat oral doses ranging fro m 2-to 20 -mg to healthy subjects . Bari citinib has also been administered to patients with RA at doses up to 15 -mg daily for 4 weeks, 10 -mg"
18,page_18,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 18 LY3009104daily for 24 weeks, 8- mg daily for 76 weeks, and lower doses up to 4- mg daily for up to approximately 5years . 3.2. Study Rationale The underlying cause of AD is not completely understood. Loss of function mutations in the gene for filaggrin (filament aggregating protein), a key protein in terminal different iation of the epidermis contribut ing to barrier funct ion, has been identified as the strongest genetic risk factor for AD in European populat ions (Palmer et al. 2006 ). At a ce llular level, AD is characterized by excessive T cell act ivation caused by genetic and environmental factors, leading to significant skin infiltrat ion by T cells and dendrit ic cells. The cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoiet in (TSLP) is thought to act as a master switch that triggers the init iation and m aintenance of AD (Moni aga et al . 2013 ; Ziegler et al. 2013 ). Overexpressio n of TSLP in kerat inocytes, the most prevalent cell t ype inthe skin, tri ggers robust i tch-evoked scratching and the development of an AD-like skin phenoty pe in mice (Li et al. 2005 ). In addit ion to di rectly inducing itch by activat ing sensory neurons in the skin, TSLP also enhances maturation and dif ferent iation of dendrit ic cells and naive CD4+ T cells and induces production of Th2 -related cy tokines invo lved in AD pathogenesis (Wilso n et al . 2013 ; Divekar and Kita 2015 ). Thymic stromal lymphopoiet in and other key cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis, such as IL -13, IL -5, IL -22, and IL -31, signal through receptors associated with intracellular JAK1/JAK2/ty rosine kinase 2 (TYK2) signaling (Ziegler et al. 2013 ; Nom ura and Kaba shima 2015). Janus kinases are a family o f tyrosine kinases that mediate cy tokine receptor signaling through phosphorylat ion and activat ion of signal transducers and activators of transcript ion (STAT) proteins. There are 4 known JAK family member s: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 (Clark et al. 2014). The relat ive affinit y of JAK inhibitors for different members of the JAK kinase family allows for different iation of JAK inhibitors in relatio n to thei r enzymat ic inhibitory profile. In vitro assays indicate that baricit inib is a select ive inhibitor of JAKs with potency and select ivity for JAK1/2 and less potency for JAK3 or TYK2 (Fri dman et al . 2010 ). The balanced JAK1/JAK2 inhibitory profile o f baricit inib suggests that baricit inib will have the greatest modulatory effect in cy tokines signaling through a JAK1/JAK2 heterodimer intracellularly (or a JAK1/JAK2/TYK2), such as IL -6, TSLP , IL-13, or IL -31(Vaddi and Luchi 2012 ). The recent ly co mpleted Phase 2 study of baricit inib in AD, JAHG, met its primary object ive of proporti on of patients achieving a 50% improvement fro m baseline in Eczema Area and Severit y Index (EASI )scores compared to placebo (Guttman -Yassky et al . 2018) . Baricit inib also showed statist ically significant improvements for other disease severit y analyses as well as multiple different patient -reported outcome (PRO) scales compared to placebo, further validat ing the hypothesis that JAK1/JAK2 signaling plays a key role in AD pathogenesis . To comprehensively evaluate the effica cy of baricitinib in pat ients with AD, both as a monotherapy and in combinat ion with background TCS, several Phase 3 studi es have been initiated. Two mult iregional Phase 3 studi es (I4V -MC-JAHL [BREEZE -AD1] and I4V-MC-JAHM [BREEZE -AD2]) will evaluate the safet y and efficacy of baricit inib monotherapy as com pared to pl acebo, in adul t patients wi th moderate tosevere AD.

The study is divided into 3 periods, a 5 -week Screening period, a 16 -week Double -Blinded Treatm ent period, and a 4 -week Post -Treatment Follow -Up period. For those patients who complete the 16 -week treatm ent peri od, there is an option to participate in the long -term extensio n Study JAHN. Approximately 300 pat ients ≥18years of age who have responded inadequately to topical therapy will be rando mized ina 1:1:1 rati o to receive placebo QD, baricit inib 2 -mg QD, or baricit inib 4 -mg QD in co mbinat ion with TCS (100 pati ents in each treatment group). Patients will be stratified at randomization according to disease severit y (Invest igator’s Global Assessment [IGA] 3 vs. 4) and geographic region. All procedures to be conducted during the study, including timing of all procedures, are indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Secti on9.4.4 describes co llection of laboratory samples; Appendix 2 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5 list the specific laboratory tests that will be perform ed for this study .Laboratory samples listed in Appendix 4 ,Appendix 5 ,andAppendix 6 are collected when possible in the event of specific AEs. Study governance considerations are described in detail in Appendix 3 . Secti on10.3.7.1 outlines information regarding the data monitoring co mmittee (DMC) and interim analyses. 5.1.1. Period 1: Screening The durati on of the Screening Period is between 8 and 35 days pri or to Visit 2 (Week 0). At Visit 1, the pati ent will sign the informed consent form (ICF) prior to any study assessments, examinat ions, or procedures being performed (Appendix 3 ). All screening procedures will be perform ed according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on2). Pati ents who receive a purified protein derivat ive (PPD) skin test at Visit 1 will need to return within 48 to 72hours later to read the skin test. Pri or to randomizat ion, treatm ents for AD will be washed out: 4 weeks for systemic treatments and 2 weeks for topical treatments (not including emo llients). Patients will be required to use emo llients daily during the 14 days preceding randomizat ion and throughout the study . If patients have been using emo llients daily at the tim e of screening, then those cumulative days can be utilized to meet inclusio n criterion [8]. Addit ionally, collect ion of data through daily diaries will be requi red throu ghout the screening period. The baseline for the daily PRO assessments will be the average score of the 7 days prior to randomization; thus, the minimum screening window was set at 8 days. All patients who have not previously received the herpes zoster va ccine by screening will be encouraged (per local guidelines) to do so prior to rando mizat ion. Refer to the exclusio n criterion [28] in Secti on6for addi tional information regarding herpes zoster vaccinat ions. In addition, invest igators should review the vaccinat ion status of their patients and fo llow the l ocal"

Patients who m eet all of the inclusio n and none of the exclusio n criteria (Secti on6) will cont inue to Visit 2. 5.1.2. Period 2: Double –Blind ,Placebo -Controlled Treatment At Visit 2 (Week 0, baseline), study eligibilit y for each patient will be reviewed, based on all inclusio n and exclusio n criteria (Secti on6), and l aboratory test resul ts. Pati ents who m eet all criteria will proceed to randomizat ion and begin the 16 -week double -blind, pl acebo -controlled treatm ent peri od. At Visit 2, after laboratory samples are collected and all assessments are completed, patients will take the first dose of invest igational product at the clinic . Patient will be rando mized at a 1:1:1 ratio into 1 of the 3treatm ent groups (pl acebo QD, baricit inib 2 -mg QD, or baricit inib 4 -mg QD) . Investigational product will be administered daily for 16weeks (treatment period Visit s2 through 8; Section 7). All patients will be required to use emollients daily . Daily diaries will cont inue to be utilized throughout the treatment period. Downl oad of this data will be required at study visits. TCS will be dispensed at V2 and used on affected areas as described in section 7.7.2 . Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCNIs) is also allowed, but TCNI use should be limited to problem areas (e.g. face andskin fo lds). The use of higher potency TCS and systemic therapies for the treatment of AD are not allowed, e xcept as part of rescue therapy for pati ents not responding to treatment. Details of background topical therapy , as well as rescue therapy and rescue criteria are included in Sect ion7.7. Assessments of disease severi ty will be perform ed by the invest igator at all study visits including unscheduled and early terminat ion visit s (ETVs). The primary efficacy endpoint and final visit in the treatment period will be at Week 16 (Vi sit8). Patients who com plete through the Week 16 study visit may be eligible for inclusio n in the long-term extensio n study JAHN (up to 2 addit ional years of trea tment). If a patient discontinues invest igational product for any reason, the pati ent shoul d rem ain in the study through Week 16 (Vi sit8). If the patient refuses and wishes to withdraw consent, an ETV shoul d be perform ed as soon as logistically possible. 5.1.3. Period 3: Post -Treatment Follow -up Patients who com plete the study through Vi sit8 (Week 16) and do not enter the long -term extensio n study will have a post -treatm ent follow-up visit (Visit 801) approximately 28 days after the l ast dose of invest igational product. Patients who have received at least 1 dose of investigat ional product and discontinue early fro m the study must have an ETV, and return for the post -treatment safet y follow-up visi t (Vi sit801) approximately 28days after the last dose of invest igational product."

Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will enroll m oderate to severe AD patients with a history of inadequate respons e to exist ing topical therapies for whom a systemic treatment such as baricit inib may therefore be appropriate. Topi cal corti costeroi ds are the first -line ant i-inflammatory treatment, even for patients treated with systemic treatm ents. F or this reason, th is study will assess the efficacy of baricitinib in combinat ion with background mild -to-moderate potency TCS, used as determined appropriate by the invest igator. During the screening period (Period 1), a washout of systemic and topical treatments for AD was incorporated prior to randomizat ion to minimize confounding effects of patients receiving a wide range of different background treatments prior to study entry as well as potential safet y issues related to the use of other therapies, including rebound e ffects after discont inuat ion of systemic therapi es. The double -blind, pl acebo -controlled treatment period (Period 2) is designed to minimize bias in the evaluat ion of the efficacy and safet y of 2baricit inib doses, relat ive to placebo, through 16 weeks of treatm ent. In consideration o f the disease severit y, all patients in Study JAIY are eligible for rescue to higher potency TCS. Invest igators are allowed to rescue patients who are experiencing unacceptable or worsening symptoms of AD. Once rescue medica tion is used, the pati ent will be determined to be a nonresponder (Section 7.7.4 ). Invest igator’s Global Assessments are commonly used in clinical t rials, both for qualifying patients f or enrollment and for evaluat ing treatment efficacy (Langley et al. 2015 ; Futam ura et al . 2016). There is no single “gold standard” disease severit y scale for AD; however, IGA scales provi de clinically meaningful measures to patients and invest igators that are easily described and that correspond to disease severit y categori es (e.g., m oderate to severe). The scale that will be used in this study , the validated Invest igator’s Global Assessment of Atopic Dermat itis (vIGA -AD, referred to throughout the protocol as IGA), has been developed internally and assesses AD severit y using a 5 -point scale. The 16 -week efficacy endpoint was chosen because it is likely that a robust clinical effect will be observed wit h bari citinib wit hin this timeframe based on the Phase 2 study resul ts in AD and from previ ous studi es in another inflammatory skin condit ion. The Post -Treatment Follow -Up Peri od (Peri od3) is for safet y monitoring after the pati ent has been o ff invest igational product for approximately 28 days. 5.5. Justification for Dose The doses proposed for AD Phase 3 studi es are baricit inib 2 -mg, and 4 -mg QD. These doses were chosen primarily based on the recent ly completed Phase 2 AD study , JAHG, and are additionally supported by pharm acokinetic s (PK), safet y, and efficacy data f or bari citinib in Phase 2 and Phase 3 RA studi es and a Phase 2 psoriasis study ."
28,page_28,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 28 LY3009104In the Phase 2 Study JAHG, both the 2 -mg and 4 -mg doses showed benefit on the primary and major secondary endpoints ( Eczem a Area and Severi ty Index [EASI ], IGA, SCORing Atopic Derm atitis[SCORAD ], Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure [POEM ],and Dermatology Life Qualit y Index[DLQI ]) as com pared to pl acebo, and both doses had an acceptable safet y profile at Week 16(Guttman -Yassky et al . 2018) . However, the 4- mg dose appeared to demonstrate a more rapi d benefit (at 4 weeks) on the more stringent endpo ints (improvement of at least75% in EASI score [ EASI75] , improvement of at least 90% in EASI score [EASI90] , and IGA 0 or 1) compared to 2 -mg dose particularly in the subgroup of pat ients with baseline EASI scores ≥16. The 4 -mg dose resulted in statist ically significant improvement in these endpo ints at Week 4 and this level of response was m aintained through Week 16. A similar trend between the baricit inib 4-mg and 2 -mg doses was observed in pat ients with RA. Al though in Study JAHG ,the 4-mg dose seem ed to perform better than the 2 -mg dose on more stringent endpoints, on other endpo ints, including an improvement of at least 50 %inEASI score [ EASI50] , and EASI change from baseline, 2- mg and 4 -mg doses showed similar efficacy co mpared to placebo . Therefore, both doses will be tested in Study JAIY . 5.5.1. Dose Adjustment for Renal Impairment Baricitinib exposure increases wit h decreased renal funct ion. Based on PK simulat ions of baricit inib exp osures for the mild and moderate categories o f renal funct ion (stratified as estimated glo merular filtrat ion rate [eGFR] 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2and eGFR 30 to <60mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively), dose adjust ment is not required for patients with eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2. Pati ents wi th eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2who are randomized to the 4-mg dose will receive a dose of 2 -mg QD, which will ensure that exposures do not exceed those of the 4 -mg QD dose in pat ients with eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m 2. For pati ents rando mized to the 2-mg dose, there will be no dose adjust ment based on renal funct ion. The dose adjust ment for renal impairment will be m anaged by interactive web -response system (IWRS) to ensure maintenance of the treatment blind. This study will not enroll patients with screening eGFR <40mL/min/1.73 m2. See Secti on8.1.1 for eGFR thresholds that trigger interruption of investigat ional product. The p rocedure of dose adjust ment based on renal funct ion (eGFR) during the study is detailed in Secti on7.2.2 ."

Method of Treatment Assignment Patients who m eet all cri teria for enrollment will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio (placebo : baricit inib 2 -mg: baricitinib4-mg) to double -blind treatment at Visit 2 (Week 0). Randomization will be stratified by geographic regio n (Europe, Japan, rest -of-world) and disease severit y at baseline (IGA 3 vs. 4). Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a computer -generated random sequence using an IWRS. The IWRS will be used to assign"
40,page_40,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 40 LY3009104packages containing double -blind invest igational product tablets to each patient according to the study schedule of a ctivities. Site personnel will confirm that they have l ocated the c orrect packages by entering a confirmation number found on the packages into the IWRS. 7.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses The invest igational product shoul dbe taken once daily without regard to food and if possible, at approximately the same t ime every day, us ually at the start of the patient’s day , to ai d pat ient compliance. 7.2.2. Dose Adjustment for Renal Impairment The rati onale of dose adjust ment for pati ents wi th docum ented renal impairment (defined as screening eGFR ≥40 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) is detailed in S ection5.5.1 . The dose adjust ment for renal impairment will be managed by IWRS to ensure maintenance of the treatment blind. The eGFR value from the screening visit (Visit 1) will be entered into IWRS at Vi sit2, and IWRS will assign the treatment doses accordingly. Patients wi th docum ented renal impairment (defined as screening eGFR ≥40 to <60mL/min/1.73 m2), who are randomized to the 4- mg active treatment arm will receive a dose of 2-mg QD by the IWRS. For patients randomized to the 2 -mg dose, there will be no dose adjustm ent based on renal funct ion. No dose adjust ment will be made for patients with screening eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2. These patients who are r andomized to active treatment will receive their assigned dose, either baricit inib 4 -mgor2-mg, respectively. During the study , for pati ents wi th docum ented renal impai rment when the subsequent eGFR falls <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, invest igational product will b e withheld unt il their eGFR beco mes ≥40mL/min/1.73 m2, whereupon the invest igational product dosing may resume. For pati ents with screening eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2, when the subsequent eGFR falls to <40mL/min/1.73 m2, invest igational product will be wit hheld unt il their eGFR beco mes ≥50mL/min/1.73 m2, whereupon the invest igationalproduct dosing may resume ( Section8.1.1 ). 7.3. Blinding This is a doub le-blind study . To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly personnel will see the rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before the study is complete. All study assessments will be performed by study personnel who are blinded to the patient’s treatment group. Except in clinical circumstances where unblinding is required, the patients, invest igators, Lilly study team, and any personnel interact ing direct ly wit h pat ients or investigat ive sites will remain blinded to baricit iniband pl acebo assi gnment until after completion of the Double -Blinded Treatm ent Peri od. It i s expected that the need for unblinding a pati ent’s treatm ent pri or to com pletion of the Double -Blinded Treatm ent Peri od will be extrem ely rare. Every effort shoul d be made to preserve the blind unless there is a compelling reason that knowledge of the specific treatment would alter the medical care of the patient. In case of an emergency , the investi gator has the sol e responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of"
41,page_41,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 41 LY3009104a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment i s warranted for medical management of the event. Patient safet y must al ways be the first considerat ion in making such a determinat ion. Where feasible and when timing of the emergent situation permits, the investigator should attempt to contact the Lilly medical mo nitor before unblinding a subject’s treatment assignment. If a patient’s treatm ent assi gnment i s unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately . If the invest igator decides that unblinding is warranted, it is the responsibilit y of the investi gator to prom ptly docum ent the decisio n and rat ionale and notify Lilly as soon as possible. Emergency unblinding for AEs m ay be perform ed through the IWRS . This option may be used ONLY if the patient’s well -being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment. All unblinding events are recorded and reported by the IWRS . If an invest igator, si te personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, the patient must be discont inued fro m the study . In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient remain in the study , the investigator must obtain specific approval fro m aLilly clinical research physician for the patient to con tinue in the study . Processes to maintain blinding during the interim analysis conducted by the DMC are described in Section 10.3.7.1 . 7.4. Dosage Modification Not applicable. 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability All invest igational product (used and partially used) will be returned to the sponsor or destroyed at site level with the sponsor’s written approval . In so me cases, sites may destroy the material if, during the invest igative site select ion, the evaluator has verified and documented that the site has appropriate facilit ies and written procedures to dispose of clinical trial materials. Follow storage and handling instructions on the investigational product packaging. 7.6. Treatment Compliance Patient com pliance wi th study medicat ion will be assessed at each visit during the treatment period (Vi sit 3 through Visi t 8) by counting returned table ts. A pat ient will be considered significant ly nonco mpliant if he or she misses more than 20% of the prescribed doses of invest igational product during the study , unless the pati ent’s invest igational product is withheld by the invest igator for safet y reasons. Similarly , a pati ent will be considered significant ly noncom pliant if he or she i s judged by the investi gator to have intent ionally or repeatedly taken 20% more than the prescribed amount of medicat ion during the study . Patients will be counseled by study staff on the importance of taking the invest igational product as prescribed, as appropriate. Patients’ com pliance will be further defined in the statist ical analysis plan (SAP)."

For AD therapies permitted as part of rescue therapy , see Secti on 7.7.4 . 7.7.1. Permitted Medications and Procedures Treatment with conco mitant AD therapies during the study is permitted only as described below. Daily use of emo llients i s requi red as background treatment. Moisturizers with additives containing pharmacological agent s with antiprurit ic or antisept ic properties are not permitted. If daily applicat ions are missed, it will not be considered a protocol vio lation o Patients shoul d not apply emo llients on the day of their study visit prior to the procedures to allow adequate assessment of skin dryness Background TCS therapy with moderate -potency and/or low -potency TCS (e.g., triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocorti sone 2.5% ointment) are to be used on active lesions, as described in Section 7.7.2 Topical calcineurin inhibitor s(e.g., tacrolimus and pimecrolimus), or topical PDE -4 inhibitor (i .e., crisaborol e, where approved) are permit ted in place of TCS on areas where application o f TCS is considered inappropriate by the investi gator; use should be limited to problem areas (e.g., face, neck, skin fo lds, genital areas, etc.) as described in Section 7.7.2 In addit ion, the fo llowing therapies are permi tted during the study : For those patients on stable dosing of prescription sleep medications at entry , downward dose adjust ments or discontinuation o f treatment may occur during the study Nonsedat ing ant ihistamines including, but not limited to, acrivast ine, bilast ine, cetirizine, desl oratadin, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, mizolastine, and rupatadine are allowed for treatm ent of allergic condit ions other than AD .

Treatmen t with concomi tant therapi es for other m edical condi tions such as diabetes and hypertensio n is permitted during the study . 7.7.2. Use of Topical Corticosteroids A washout period of 14 days is required for all TCS prior to randomization at Visit 2. At baseline (We ek0, Visit 2), patients will receive triamcinolone 0.1% cream (or equivalent -potency TCS) and hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment (or equivalent -potency TCS). See “Choice of Background Topical Corticosteroid” below. Triamcinolone 0.1% cream (moderate -potency T CS) should be applied at least once daily to affected areas until lesions are under control (clear or almost clear). Patients should then switch to hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment (low-potency TCS) and treat previously affected areas once -daily for 7days an d then stop. Hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment (low -potency TCS) may also be used to replace triamcinolone 0.1% cream (moderate -potency TCS) on areas of thin skin (face, neck, folds, and genital areas) and areas with skin atrophy . If lesions reappear during th e course of the study, the patients should resume the once -daily applications of triamcinolone 0.1% cream (moderate -potency TCS) or hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment (low -potency TCS) as described above. Patients whose lesions persist or worsen despite the use of emollients and low -and/or moderate -potency TCS and/or patients who require daily applications on large surfaces may be considered for topical rescue with high -or ultra -high-potency TCS (Secti on7.7.4 for details). On the days of study visits, topical therapy including TCS should not be applied before the patient has undergone all study procedures and clinical evaluations in order to allow adequate assessment of skin dryness. Inabilit y to follow this guidance for use of TCS will not be considered a protocol violation. Choice of Background Topical Corticosteroid Where possible, triamcino lone cream 0.1% and/or hydrocortisone 2.5% oint ment will be supplied by the sponsor for use as background TCS. In the event of these specific TCS being unavailable, an alternate, equivalent -potency TCS may be provi ded by the sponsor (see below). Topi cal corti costeroi d use, when supplied by the sponsor, should be recorded via weight of returned tubes as indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). In the event that the sponsor i s unable to suppl y TCS, commercially available triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hydrocortisone 2.5% oint ment may be supplied by the sites. Where providing triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocorti sone 2.5% oi ntment is not possible, an equivalent -potency TCS cream and/or ointment that i s in line with local practi ces can be supplied by the si tes.

The weights of returned tubes of the high-and ultra -high-potency TCS are not requi red. Other Topical Treatments Invest igators may also select to use TC NIs and/or crisaborole in countries where approved, in place o f TCS. If TC NIsor cri saborol e are prescribed, use should be limited to problem areas (e.g., face, neck, skin fo lds, genital areas, etc.). Use of all topical treatments for AD must be recorded in the CRF. 7.7.3. Prohibited Medications and Procedures Prohibited Medications and Procedures Not Requiring Interruption of Investigational Product The fo llowing therapi es will not be allowed during the course of the study and, if taken by or administered to the patient, the prohibited therapy must be discont inued. High potency TCS (defined as any TCS wi th higher than m oderate strength as defined in Appendix 8 )except when given as rescue therapy as described in Secti on 7.7.4 . topical ant ihistamines or sedating, systemic ant ihistamines including, but not limited to, alimemazine, chlorphenamine, clemast ine, cyproh eptadine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, ketotifen, and promethazine Prescri ption allergen immunotherapy phototherapy including psoralen and ultravio let A (PUVA ), ultraviolet B, tanning booth and excimer laser bleach baths Prohibited Medications Requiring Temporary Interruption of Investigational Product The fo llowing therapi es will not be allowed during the course of the study and, if taken by or administered to the patient, temporary interrupti on of investigational product is required. live vaccines (including Bacillus Calmette -Guérin [BCG] or herpes zoster), (seeExclusio n Cri terion [28])"

If a pati ent is not abl e to discont inue probenecid, then investigat ional product should be permanently discontinued Prohibited Medications Requiring Permanent Discontinuation of Investigational Product systemic corticosteroids any systemic therapy, investiga tional or commercial (approved or off label use), used for the treatment of AD or symptoms of AD (except for antihistamines, as specified above) other JAK inhibitors (e.g., tofacit inib and ruxo litinib) systemic immunosuppressive/immuno modulatory substances, including, but not limited to, cy closporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofet il, interferon γ, azathioprine, or bio logic agents Note: In the event that these prohibited medications were inadvertently used, agreement and docum entati on to conti nue invest igational product must be sought from sponsor . 7.7.4. Rescue Therapy For pati ents who are experiencing worsening and unacceptable symptoms of AD despite treatm ent wi th invest igational product and moderate -potency TCS, rescue therapy with additional topical and systemic therapies is available starting after 2 weeks of treatment (Visit 4). Use of rescue medicat ions should be limited to patients where control of symptoms cannot be achieved with increased emo llient use and background TCS (low potency and m oderate potency ). Pri or to rescue, control of AD symptoms should be attempted by avoi ding exacerbating factors, intensifying emo llient applications, and using only the permitted study treatm ents, including background TCS therapy (e.g., tri amcino lone 0.1% c ream and/or hydrocortisone 2.5% oint ment) (Section7.7.2 ). Rescue with High -and Ultra -High -Potency TCS Patients whose l esions persist or worsen despite the use of emo llients and background TCS therapy (e.g., tri amcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hydrocortisone 2.5% oint ment) and/or patients who require prolonged applicat ions of triamcino lone 0.1% cream (moderate -potency TCS) on large surfaces may be con sidered f or rescue to high -or ultra-high-potency TCS ( Appendix 8 for TCS potency ). High-or ultra-high-potency TCS m ay be used once daily for up to 14 consecut ive days or less , or based on the maximum duration reco mmended in the prescribing informat ion."
46,page_46,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 46 LY3009104It is recommended that if a pat ient reaches “clear” to “almost clear” skin after topical rescue, then moderate -, high-,or ultra-high-potency TCS shoul d be stopped, and low -potency TCS (e.g., hydrocortisone 2.5% oint ment) should be used once daily for an addi tional 7days, then stopped. Patients rescued wi th high -or ultra-high-potency TCS will continue to take invest igational product and use of topical rescu e therapy will be docum ented in the eCRF. Rescue with Systemic Therapies If topi cal rescue therapy as described above fails to sufficient ly control AD symptoms, then oral systemic medicat ions may be used as rescue (e.g., corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and methotrexate ); however, investigational product will be required to be permanent ly discont inued for the rem ainder of the 16 -week study durati on. If these medications are needed for other medical condit ions (e.g., asthma flare), they will still be treated as rescue medicat ions. These patients are still eligible to enter the long -term extensio n study (JAHN), if they com plete the schedule of study visits through Visi t8 (Week 16) and are also able to complete a minimum 4-week washout from oral systemic rescu e medicati ons (which can occur during the screening period for Study JAHN). Invest igators should make every attempt to conduct efficacy and safet y assessments immediately before administering any rescue treatm ent. An unscheduled visit can be used for th is purpose if necessary . 7.8. Treatment after the End of the Study 7.8.1.

Temporary Interruption from Investigational Product In some circumstances, it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of AEs or abnorm al laboratory values that m ay have an unclear relationship to invest igational product. For example, investigational product should be temporarily int errupted if the patient experiences a cardi ovascular AEconsidered to be related tothe study treatm ent,isgraded asmoderate (Grade 2according to Common Termino logyCriteriaforAdverse Events [CTCAE] Version 3.0), and that does not resolve promptly withsupporti vecare. Except in cases of emergency, it is recommended that the invest igator consult with Lilly (or its designee) before temporarily interrupting therapy for reasons other than those defined in Table JAIY. 4. For the abnormal laboratory findings and clinical events (regardless of relatedness) listed in Table JAIY. 4,specific guidance is provided for temporarily interrupting treatment and when treatm ent m ay be restarted. Retest frequency and timing of fo llow -up laboratory tests to m onitor the abnormal finding is at the discret ion of the investigator. Invest igational product that was temporarily interrupted because of an AE or abnormal laboratory value not specifically covered in Table JAIY. 4may be restarted at the discretion of the invest igator . If laboratory abnorm alities leading to temporary interrupti on of invest igational product are identified from Visit 2 laboratory tests, invest igational product must still be interrupted, even though the abnormal laboratory resul ts are unrel ated to invest igational product .

Appendix 2 and Appendix 4 list the laboratory tests that will be performed for this study . Unless otherwise stated in the subsect ions below, all samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroy edwithin 60 days o f recei pt of confi rmed test resul ts. Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory certificati on standards. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessments Validated Investigator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA -AD): The IGA used in this study, the vIGA -AD (referred to as the IGA throughout the protocol) measures the i nvest igator’s global assessment of the pati ent’s overall severit y of their AD, based on a static, numeric 5 -point scale fro m 0 (clear skin) to 4 (severe disease). The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of ery thema, papul ation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification. 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments 9.1.2.1. Eczema Area and Severity Index Scores The EASI assesses extent of disease at 4 body regions and measures 4 clinical signs: (1)erythema, (2) i ndurat ion/papulat ion, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenificat ion each on a scale of 0to 3. The EASI confers a max imum score of 72. The EASI evaluates 2 dimensio ns of AD: disease extent and clinical signs (Hanifin et al. 2001). Body surface area affected by AD will be derived from data collected as part of the EASI assessment. 9.1.2.2. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis The SCORAD in dex uses the rul e of nines to assess di sease extent and evaluates 6 clinical characterist ics to determine disease severit y: (1) ery thema, (2) edema/papulat ion, (3)oozing/crusts, (4) excoriat ion, (5) lichenificat ion, and (6) dryness. The SCORAD index als o assesses subject ive symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss. These 3 aspects: extent of disease, disease severi ty, and subjective symptoms combine to give a maximum possible score of 103 (Stalder et al . 1993; Kunz et al . 1997; Schram et al. 2012). 9.1.2.3. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale The Hospi tal Anxiet y Depressi on Scal e (HADS) i s a 14 -item self-assessment scale that determines the levels of anxiet y and depressio n that a patient is experiencing over the past week. The HADS utilizes a 4 -point Li kert scal e (e.g ., 0 to 3) for each quest ion and i s intended for ages 12 to 65 years ( Zigmond and Snait h 1983; White et al. 1999). Scores for each domain (anxiet y"
52,page_52,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 52 LY3009104and depression) can range from 0 to 21, with highe r scores indicat ing greater anxiet y or depressio n (Zigmond and Snait h 1983; Snait h 2003 ). 9.1.3. Health Outcomes and Quality -of-Life Measures The patient self -reported questionnaires will be administered via either an elect ronic pat ient diary or via an electroni c tablet and in countries where the quest ionnaires have been translated into the native language of the region and linguistically validated. 9.1.3.1. Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM i s a simple, 7- item, pati ent-admini stered scal e that assesses disease severit y in children and adults. Patients respond to questions about the frequency o f 7 symptoms (i tching, sleep disturbance, bleeding, weeping/oozing, cracking, flaking, and dryness/roughness) over the last week. Respo nse categories include “ No day s,” “1 -2 days,” “3 -4 days,” “5- 6 days,” and “Every day” wi th corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Scores range from 0 to 28 with higher total scores indicat inggreater di sease severit y (Charman et al . 2004 ). 9.1.3.2. Itch Numeric Rating Scale The Itch Numeric Rat ing Scale (NRS) is a pati ent-administered , 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing “no itch” and 10 represent ing “worst itch imaginable.” Overall severit y ofa pati ent’s i tching is indicated by select ing the number that best describes the worst l evel of itching in the past 24 hours ( Naegeli et al. 2015; Kimball et al. 2016 ). 9.1.3.3. Atopic Dermatitis Sleep Scale The Atopi c Dermat itis Sleep Scale (ADSS) is a 3 -item, patient -administered quest ionnaire developed to assess the impact of itch on sleep including difficult y falling asleep, frequency of waking, and difficult y getting back to sleep last night. Patient’s rate their difficult y falling asleep and difficult y getting back to sleep, items 1 and 3, respectively , using a 5 -point Likert -type scale with response opti ons ranging fro m 0 “not at all” to 4 “very difficult.” Patients report their frequency of waking l ast ni ght, item 2, by selecting the number of times they woke up each night, ranging fro m 0 to 29 times. The ADSS is designed to be completed each day with respondents thinking about sleep “last night.” Each i tem is scored individually. 9.1.3.4. Skin Pain Numeric Rating S cale Skin Pain NRS is a patient -administered, 11 -point hori zontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0represent ing “no pain” and 10 represent ing “worst pain imaginable.” Overall severit y of a patient’s skin pain is indicated by select ing the number that be st describes the worst level o f skin pain in the past 24 hours. 9.1.3.5. Patient Global Impression of Severity The Pati ent Gl obal Impressi on of Severi ty–Atopic Derm atitis (PGI -S-AD) is a single -item question asking the patient how they woul d rate thei r overall AD s ymptoms over the past 24hours. The 5 categories o f responses range from “no symptoms” to “severe.” 9.1.3.6. Dermatology Life Quality Index The Derm atology Life Qualit y Index (DLQI) is a simple, patient -administered, 10 -item, validated, qualit y-of-life quest ionnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings,"
53,page_53,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 53 LY3009104daily activi ties, leisure, work and school, personal relat ionships, and treatment. The recall period of this scale is over the “last week.” Response categories include “not at all,” “a l ot,” and “very much,” with corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3, respect ively, and unanswered (“not relevant”) responses scored as 0. Scores range fro m 0to30 with higher scores indicat ing greater impairment of qualit y of life. A DLQI total score o f 0 to 1 i s considered as having no effect on a patient’s healt h-related QoL (Hongbo et al. 2005 ), and a 4- point change fro m baseline is considered as the minimal clinically important difference thresho ld (Khilji et al. 2002 ; Basra etal. 2015 ). 9.1.3.7. European Quality of Life –5Dimensions –5Levels The European Qualit y of Life -5 Dimensi ons-5 Levels (EQ -5D- 5L) is a standardized measure of healt h status that provides a simple, generic measure of healt h for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ -5D- 5L consists of 2 components: a descript ive system o f the respondent’s healt h and a rating of his or her current health state using a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS ). The descript ive system co mprises the fo llowing 5 dimensio ns: mobility, self -care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensio n has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his or her healt h state by ticking (or pl acing a cross) in the box associated with the most appropri ate statem ent in each o f the 5dimensions. It should be noted that the numerals 1 to 5 have no arithmet ic properties and should not be used as an ordinal score. The VAS records the respondent’s self -rated heal th on a vertical VAS where the endpoints are labeled “best imaginable healt h state” and “worst imaginable health state.” This informat ion can be used as a quant itative measure of healt h outcome. The EQ-5D- 5L health st ates, defined by the EQ-5D- 5L descript ive system, may be converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essent ially attaches values (also called weights) to each of the levels in each dimensio n (Herdm an et al . 2011; EuroQol Group 2015 [WW W]). 9.1.3.8. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire –Atopic Dermatitis The Work Productivit y and Act ivity Impairment Questi onnai re–Atopic Dermat itis (WPAI -AD) records impairment due to AD during the past 7 days. The WPAI -AD consists of 6 items grouped into 4 domains: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on -the-job effect iveness), work productivit y loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activit y impairment. Scores are calculated as impairment percentages (Reilly et al. 1993 ), with higher scores indicat ing greater impairment and less productivit y. 9.1.3.9. PROMIS Itch Questionnaire General Short Form 8a v1.0 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a set of person -centered m easures that evaluates and monitorsphysical, mental, and social healt h in adults and children . It can be used with the general populat ion and with individuals living with chronic condit ions. The Itch General Short Form 8a (PIQ –General) within the PROMIS i tch item bank consists of 8 i tems assessing the impact of itch on various aspects of life . Response"

PROMIS Itch Questionnaire Mood and Sleep Short Form 8a v1.0 The Mood and Sleep Short Form 8a (PIQ –Mood and Sleep) within the PROMIS Itch item bank consists of 8 items assessing mood and sleep related qualit y of life impairment from itch and impact of itch “in the past 7 day s”. Response options range fro m 1=Never, 2=Rarely ; 3=Som etimes; 4=Often; to 5=Almost always; t otal raw scores are converted to T- Scores with higher scores represen ting greater impact on mood and sleep because of itch . 9.1.3.12. PROMIS Itch Questionnaire Scratching Behavior Short Form 5a v1.0 The Scratching Behavior Short Form 5a (PIQ –Scratching Behavior) within the PROMIS Itch item bank consists of 5 i tems assessing quality of life impairment from scratching behavior and the physical manifestations of itch in adults “in the past 7 days” . Response options f or the frequency of scratching behaviors range fro m 1=Never, 2=Rarely, 3=Sometimes; 4=Often, to 5=Almo st always . The response options for the worry related to scratching items range from 1=Not at all; 2=A litt le bit; 3=So mewhat; 4=Quite a bit; to 5=Very much . Total raw scores are converted to T -Scores with higher scores representing more scratching behavior . 9.1.3.13. PROMIS Sleep Related Impairment Short Form 8a v1.0 The Sl eep Related Im pairment Short F orm 8a (PROMIS –Sleep Impairment [PROMIS 2015] ) within the PROMIS bank consists of 8 items measuring self- reported perceptions of alertness, sleepiness, and tiredness during usual waking hours, and the perceived funct ional impairments during wakefulness associated with sleep problems or impaired alertness “in the past 7 days” . Response options range fro m 1=Not at all; 2=A little bit; 3=So mewhat; 4=Quite a bit; to5=Very much . Total r aw scores are converted to T -Scores with higher scores represent ing greater sleep impairment. 9.1.3.14. Neuro -QoL Cognit iveFunction Short Form v2.0 Neuro -QoL isa set of self -reported m easures that assess the health -related quali ty of life (HRQOL) of adults and children wi th neurol ogicaldisorders and is co mprised of item banks and scales that evaluate symptoms, concerns, and issues that are relevant across disorders along with instrum ents that assess areas most relevant for specific patient populat ions(NINDS 2015) . The Cogni tive Function Short Form v2.0 (Neuro -QoL –Cogni tive Funct ion) domain wi thin Neuro -QoL bank consists of 8 items measuring Executive Funct ion (perceived difficult ies in applicat ions of m ental health function related to planning, or ganizing, calculat ing, remembering and learning ) “in the past 7 days” and General Concerns ( perceived difficult ies in everyday cogni tive abilit ies such as memory , attenti on, and decisi on making) using the lead -in phrase"

The total raw s cores and are converted to T -Scores with higher scores indicat ing better (desirable) self-reported heal th. 9.1.3.15. Patient Benefit Index The Patient Benefi t Index ( PBI)measures pat ient-defined treatment object ives and benefit s, particularly in the course of a treatment (Augustin et al . 2009; Blo me et al. 2011 ). It consists of 2 questi onnaires. Before therapy , pati ents complete the standardized “Patient N eeds Quest ionnaire” indicat ingindividual importance of treatment object ives. This reflects their personal preferences wit h respect to therapeutic benefit. During the study , pati ents rate the extent to which the treatment object ives have been achieved in the “Pat ient Benefit Quest ionnaire”. Response options range fro m 0=not at all, 1 =somewhat; 2=m oderately; 3=quite; 4=very; to 5=does/did not apply to me. A global score i s calculated for each patient by weighing the achievement values o f the treatment object ives by their importance to the individual pat ient. Moreover, the PBI will be supplemented by 6 rating scales assessing the fo llowing areas : physical well-being, emotional well -being, performance capacit y on the j ob and in every day living, social contacts, leisure activit ies, and qualit y of life. Patients wi th PBI ≥1 are considered having at least minimum pat ient-relevant treatm ent benefit. 9.1.4. Appropriate ness of Assessments All assessments utilized in this study are standard, wi dely used, and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant except ADSS and Skin Pain NRS, which are current ly being developed and validated according to regulatory guidances. 9.2. Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to t he patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study . Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate healt h care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused the patient to discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patient shou ld be fo llowed unt il the event resolves or stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation ; for events that are not anticipated to resolve or stabilize, the patient shoul d be f ollowed unt il the treating physician (in consultat ion with the sponsor) determ ines that appropriate fo llowup has been completed . The frequency o f follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator."
56,page_56,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 56 LY3009104Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establ ish treatm ent effect. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via eCRF the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing condit ions. In addit ion, site personnel will record any change in the condi tion(s) and any new condi tions as AEs. Invest igators should record the fo llowing via eCRF for each AE : time of onset, time of termination, severit y, and thei r assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to investigat ional product . The invest igator will interpret and docum ent whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, study device, or a study procedure, taki ng into account the disease, concomitant treatment, or pathologies. A “reasonable possibilit y” means tha t there is a cause- and-effect relationship between the invest igational product, study device, and/or study procedure and the AE. The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be rep orted as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF, clarifying if possible the circumstances leading to any dosage m odificat ions, or discont inuat ions of treatment. 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in 1 of the fo llowing outcom es: death initial or prolonged inpatient hospit alizat ion a life- threatening experience (i.e., immediate risk of dying) persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y congenital ano maly/birth defect important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalizat ion but m ay jeopardize the patient or may require intervent ion to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above. Examples of such m edical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at hom e, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF and assessed for serious criteria. The SAE reporting to the sponsor begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the SAE should be reported to the sponsor as per SAE reporti ng requirements and t imelines if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure."
57,page_57,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 57 LY3009104Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method (e.g. invest igator space portal, telephone, or fax) . If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately followed wi th official notification on study -specific SAE forms. This 24 -hour notificat ion requirement refers to the initial SAE informat ion and a ll follow-up SAE inform ation. Patients wi th a seri ous hepat ic AE shoul d have addi tional data collected using the hepatic safet y eCRF. Invest igators can contact the sponsor via telephone at any time using the qualified medical personnel or Lilly affiliate medical contact details which are provided in the site study file. Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements, any pregnancy should be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in subjects once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the pati ent summary CRF has been co mpleted). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he or she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipati on, the i nvestigator must promptly notify Lilly. 9.2.1.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigation al product or procedure. United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the associ ated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory requirements in parti cipat ing countries requi re the reporting of SUSARs. Lilly has pr ocedures that will be fo llowed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and the associated detailed guidances. 9.2.2. Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest will include the following: infect ions (including TB, herpes zoster, or opportunist ic infections) malignancies (except for successfully treated basal or squam ous cell carcino ma) hepat ic events (Section 9.4.9 ) major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (Section 9.4.10 ) thrombotic events (such as deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmo nary embo lism) Sites will provide details on these AEs as instructed on the eCRF and may be asked for additional descripti on by Lilly . 9.2.3. Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug deliv ery system s used in clinical studies to ensure the safet y of study participants, monitor qualit y, and to facilitate process and product improvements."

Treatment of Overdose Refer to the IB. 9.4. Safety Any clinically significant findings from ECG testing, physical examinat ion, vital signs measurements, or laboratory measurements that resul t in a di agnosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of study treatm ent shoul d be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF. 9.4.1. Electrocardiograms A single 12- lead standard ECG will be obtained lo cally at Visit 1 and read by a qualified physician (the invest igator or qualified designee) at the site to determine whether the patient meets entry criteria. Electrocardiograms may be obtained at addit ional times, when deemed clinically necessary . 9.4.2. Vital Signs For each patient , vital signs shoul d be m easured according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on2). 9.4.3. Physical Exam ination For each patient, a complete physical ex aminat ion (excluding pelvic and rectal examinat ions) will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening). A symptom -directed physical examinat ion will be perform ed at other visits as specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). A com plete physical examinat ion may be repeated at the investigator’s discretion at any time a patient presents with physical co mplaints. 9.4.4. Laboratory Tests For each patient, laboratory tests detailed in Appendix 2 shoul d be conducted accordi ng to the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Wi th the excepti on of laboratory test resul ts that m ay unblind the study , Lilly or i ts desi gnee will provide the investi gator wi th the resul ts of laboratory tests analyzed by a central vendor, if a central vendor is used for the clinical trial. 9.4.5. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C -SSRS captures the occurrence, severit y, and f requency of suicidal ideat ion and/or behavior during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the ty pe of inform ation needed to determine if suicidal ideation and/or behavior occurred. The C -SSRS i s administered by an appropri ately trained health care professio nal with at least 1 year of pat ient care/c linical experience. The tool was developed by the Nati onal Inst itute of Mental Healt h trial group for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algori thm of Suicide"

For this study, the scale has been adapted (with permission fro m the scale authors) to include only the porti on of the scale that captures the occurrence of the 11 preferred ideat ion and behavior categories. The nonleading AE collect ion shoul d occur pri or to the collect ion of the C-SSRS. If a suicide-related event is discovered during the C -SSRS ,but was not captured during the nonleading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form. If an event is serious or leads to discontinuat ion, thi s is an except ion where the SAE and/or AE leading to discont inuat ion should be included on the AE form a nd the process for reporting SAEs should be fo llowed. 9.4.6. Self-Harm and Follow -up Supplement Forms Suicide-related events (behavior and/or ideat ions) will be assessed and evaluated at every visit with the administrati on of the C -SSRS and the Self -Harm Suppleme nt Form . The Self -Harm Suppl ement Form is a single quest ion to enter the number of suicidal behavior events, possible suicide behavi ors, or nonsui cidal self -injuri ous behavi ors. If the number of behavioral events is greater than 0, it will lead to the co mpletion of the self -harm fo llow -up form . The self -harm follow-up form is a seri es of quest ions that provides a more detailed descript ion of the behavior cases. 9.4.7. Chest x -ray and Tuberculosis Testing A posteri or–anterior view chest x -ray will be obtained l ocally at screening (Visit 1), unl ess resul ts from a chest x -ray obtained wi thin 6 months prior to the study are available. The chest x -ray will be reviewed by the invest igator or his or her designee to exclude pat ients with active TB infect ion. In addi tion, pati ents will be tested at screening (Visit 1) for evidence o f active or latent TB as described in the exclusio n criteria, Secti on6.2. Invest igators should fo llow local guidelines for m onitoring pat ients for TB if a pat ient is at hi gh risk for acqui ring TB or reactivat ion of latent TB. 9.4.8. Hepatitis B Virus DNA Monitoring Patients who are HBcAb posit ive and HBV DNA negat ive (undetectable) at Visit 1 will require measurement of HBV DNA at Week 16 (Visit 8) or early terminat ion visit, regardless of their hepat itisB surface antibody (HBsAb) status. The fo llowing acti ons shoul d be taken in response to HBV DNA test results: If a single result is o btained with a value “below limit of quant itation,” the test shoul d be repeated wi thin approximately 2 weeks. If the repeat test result is “target not detected,” monitoring will resume for those patients enro lling in the long-term extensio n study , JAHN. If the patient has 2 or more test results with a value “below limit of quantitation” or a test result above the limit of quant itation, the pati ent will be permanently discontinued fro m invest igational product (Section 8.1.2) and should be referred to a hepatology specialist."

Hepatic Safety Monitoring and Data Collection If a study patient experiences elevated ALT ≥3x ULN, ALP ≥2x ULN, or elevated TBL ≥2xULN, liver testing ( Appendix 4 ) shoul d be repeated wi thin 3 to 5 days including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transfera se, and creat ine kinase to confirm the abnorm ality and to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. If the abnormalit y persists or worsens, clinical and laboratory monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by the invest igator and in consultation wit h the study medical monitor. Moni toring of ALT, AST, TBL, and ALP should continue until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline levels. Discontinuati on cri teria of investigational products, either temporary interruption or permanent discontinuat ion, due to a bnormal ALT, AST, TBL, or ALP, are detailed in Sect ion8.1. Addit ional safet y data should be co llected via the hepat ic eCRF if 1 or more of the fo llowing condi tions occur: elevation of serum ALT to ≥5x ULN on 2 or more consecut ive blood tests elevated serum TBL to ≥ 2x ULN (except for cases of known Gilbert’s syndro me) elevation of serum ALP to ≥2x ULN on 2 or more consecut ive blood tests patient disc ontinued fro m treatm ent due to a hepatic event or abnormalit y of liver tests hepat ic event consi dered to be an SAE See Appendix 4 andAppendix 5 for a descri ption of hepati c laboratory values that warrant exclusio n from the study , tem porary or perm anent di scontinuat ion of invest igational product, or additional safety collecti on via the hepat ic eCRF. 9.4.10. Safety Monitoring Lilly will periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate methods. In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at the group l evel, only members of the DMC (an advisory group for this study formed to protect the integrit y of data [refer to Interim Analyses sectio n, Secti on10.3.7 ]) can conduct addit ional analyses o f the safet y data. The Lilly clinical research physician will mo nitor safety data throughout the course of the study . Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by co mpany procedures. The Lilly clinical research physician will, as is appropriate, consult with the funct ionally independent Gl obal Patient Safet y therapeutic area physician or clinical scient ist and peri odically review trends in safet y data and l aboratory analyt es. Any concerning trends in frequency or severit y noted by an investigator and/or Lilly (or designee) may require further evaluat ion. All deaths and SAE reports will be reviewed in a blinded manner by Lilly during the clinical trial. These reports will be reviewed to ensure completeness and accuracy, but will not be unblinded to Lilly during the clinical trial. If a death or a clinical AE is deemed serious, unexpected, and possibly related to invest igational product, only Lilly Gl obal Patient Safet y will be unblinded for regulatory reporting and safet y monitoring purposes. These measures will"

Invest igators will monitor vi tal signs and carefully review findings that may be associated with cardi ovascular events and VTE (Appendix 6 ). Adverse event reports and vital signs will be collected at each study visit. The cardi ovascular moni toring plan includes the following: regul ar monitoring of lipid l evels potenti al MA CE (cardi ovascular death, MI, andstroke), other cardiovascular events (such as hospit alizati on for unstable angina, hospi talizat ion for heart failure, serious arrhy thmia, resuscitated sudden death, cardiogenic shock, coronary revascularizat ion such as coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervent ion), venous thrombotic ev ents and noncardiovascular deaths will be ident ified by the investigative site or through medical review and will be sent to a blinded Clinical Event Committee for adjudicat ion at regul ar intervals. 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Not applicable. 9.6. Pharmacodynamics Not app licable. 9.7. Pharmacogenetics 9.7.1. Blood Samples for Pharmacogenetic Research A blood sam ple will be collected for pharmacogenetic analysis as specified in the Schedule o f Activities (Section 2)where local regulat ions allo w. There i s growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy . Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretion, the mechanism of act ion of the drug, the disease etiology, and/or the m olecular subt ype of the di sease being treated. In the event of an unexpected AE, the samples may be genoty ped and analysis may be performed to evaluate a genet ic associat ion with response to baricit inib. These invest igations may be limited to targeted exome sequencing approach of known targets involved in drug metabo lism or, if appropriate, geno me-wide associ ation studies may be performed to ide ntify regio ns of the geno me associated with the variabilit y observed in drug response. Samples will only be used for investigations related to di sease and drug or class of drugs under study in the context of this clinical program. Samples will not be used to conduct unspecified disease or populat ion genet ic research either now or in the future. Samples will be used to investigate variable response to baricit inib and to investigate genet ic variants though t to pl ay a rol e in AD or other inflammatory skin di seases. Assessment of variable response may include evaluati on of AEs or differences in efficacy. All samples will be coded with the patient number. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patient only by the invest igator site pers onnel ."
62,page_62,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 62 LY3009104Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15years after the last patient visit for the study, or for a shorter peri od if local regulations and/or (ethical review boards (ERBs)/invest igational review boards) impose shorter time limits, at a facilit yselected by Lilly. This retenti on peri od enables use of new techno logies, response to regulatory quest ions, and invest igation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later in the development of baricit inib or after baricit inib beco mes commerc ially available. Molecular techno logies are expected to improve during the 15 -year storage period and therefore cannot be specifically named. However, exist ing approaches include who le geno me or exome sequencing, geno me-wide associ ation studies, and candi date gene studi es. Regardl ess of techno logy utilized, genoty ping data generated will be used only for the specific research scope described in this sect ion. 9.8. Biomarkers Biomarker research is performed to address questions of relevance to drug di sposi tion, target engagement, pharmacodynamics (PD), mechanism of act ion, variabilit y of pat ient response (including safet y), and clinical outcome. Sample collect ion is incorporated into clinical studies to enable examinat ion of these quest ions through measurement o f biomolecules including DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular elements. Bloodsamples for nonpharmacogenetic bio marker research will be co llected at the times specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2)where local regulat ions allow. Samples will be used for research on the drug target, disease process, variable response to baricit inib, pathways associated with AD, mechanism of act ion of ba ricitinib, and/or research method or i n validat ing diagnost ic tools or assay(s) related to AD. All samples will be coded with the patient number. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patient only by the invest igator site personne l. Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15years after the last patient visit for the study , or for a shorter peri od if local regulations and ERBs impose shorter time limit s, at a facilit y selected by Lilly .

The proposed sample size will ensure a n 89% power to detect an abso lute difference of 20% between the baricit inib 4 -mg and placebo treatment groups and the baricit inib 2 -mg and placebo treatment groups, each using a 2- sided alpha of 0.025 and a Fisher exact test, assuming a 10% placebo response rate for the primary endpoint. The assumpti ons are based on what was observed in the Phase 2 study (JAHG). The proposed end point of IGA 0 or 1 represents patients whose AD is clear or alm ost cl ear from a baseline of moderate or severe disease. The anticipated effect size represents 3 times more pa tients achieving this benefit compared to placebo, which, in discussion with therapeuti c experts, is of a m agnitude that i s consi dered clinically relevant. Sample size and power estimates were obtained from nQuery ®Advisor 7.0. 10.2. Populations for Analyses Unless otherwise specified, the efficacy and healt h outcom e analyses will be conducted on the intent-to-treat populat ion, defined as all randomized patients, even if the patient does not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise did not fo llow the protoc ol. Pati ents will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned. Significant protocol vio lations will be described in the SAP. Safety analyses will be done on all rando mized patients who receive at least 1 dose of investigat ional pro duct and who did not discontinue fro m the study for the reason “Lost to Follow-up” at the first postbaseline visit. Further details of other populat ions will be described in the SAP. Patients will be analyzed according to the dosing regimen to which they were assigned in the Treatment Period. 10.3. Statistical Analyses 10.3.1. General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis o f this study will be the responsibilit y of Lilly o r its desi gnee. A detailed SAP describing the statist ical methodol ogies will be develope d by Lilly or i ts desi gnee. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and th e justification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report (CSR) . Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided al pha level of 0.05, unl ess otherwise stated. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables between baricit inib and placebo will be made using a logist ic regressio n analysis wit h regi on, di sease severi ty, and treatm ent group in the model. The percentages, differ ence in percentages, and 95% confidence interval"
64,page_64,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 64 LY3009104(CI) of the difference in percentages will be reported. Treatment -by-region interacti on will be added to the logist ic regressio n model of the primary and key secondary variables as a sensit ivity analysis. If this interaction is significant at a 2- sided 0.1 l evel, further inspect ion will be used to assess whether the interaction is quant itative (i.e., the treatment effect is consistent in direct ion but not size o f effect) or qualitat ive (the treatment is ben eficial for som e but not all regions). The p-value fro m the Fisher exact test will also be produced. When evaluat ing cont inuous measures over time, a restricted maximum likelihood -based mixed -effects m odel of repeated m easures (MMRM) will be used. The mo del will include treatm ent, regi on, baseline severi ty, visi t, and treatment - by-visit interact ion as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score-by- visit interacti on as fixed continuous effects. An unstructured (co)variance structure wi ll be used to model the between -and within -patient errors. If this analysis fails to converge, other structures will be tested. The Kenward –Roger m ethod will be used to estimate the degrees of freedo m. Type III sums of squares for the least squares means (LSMs) will be used for the statist ical com parison; 95% CI will also be reported. Contrasts will be set up within the model to test treatment groups at specific time po ints of interest. Further details on the use of MMRM will be described in the SAP. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and healt h outcome variables may also be made using analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA) with region, disease severit y, treatm ent group, and baseline value in the model. Ty peIII tests for LSM will be used for sta tistical co mpar ison between treatment groups. The LSM difference, standard error, p -value, and 95% CI may also be reported. The method used to handle missing data will be specified in the SAP. Fisher exact test will be used for the AEs, discont inuat ion, and other categorical safet y data for between -treatm ent group com parisons. Continuous vital signs, body weight, and other continuous safet y variables including laboratory variables will be analyzed by an ANCOVA with treatm ent and baseline value in the mod el. Shift tables for categorical safet y analyses (e.g., “high” or “low” laboratory resul ts) will also be produced. Missing data imputation: 1.Nonresponder imputation (NRI): All patients who discont inue the study or the study treatm ent at any time for any reason will be defined as nonresponders for the NRI analysis for categorical variables such as IGA 0/1 or EASI 50/75/90 after discontinuat ion and onward. Patients who receive rescue therapy will be analyzed as nonresponders after rescue and onward. An add itional analysis will be performed that includes all available data whether rescue medicat ion was given or not. 2.MMRM: Continuous variables such as EASI and SCORAD scores will be assumed to be missing after rescue or discontinuation and then an MMRM analys is will be perform ed. An addi tional analysis will be performed that includes all available data whether rescue medicat ion was given or not. 3.Last observed carried forward (LOCF): An addit ional analysis will be performed that uses the last observed value o n or prior to discont inuat ion or rescue therapy . Thi s will"
65,page_65,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 65 LY3009104then be analyzed using a logist ic model for categorical variables or ANCOVA for continuous variables as described above. Addit ional sensit ivity analyses for the primary and key secondary endpoints such as tipping po int analyses as well as a reference based mult iple imputation method may be done and will be specified in the SAP. Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons: Multiplicity controlled analyses will be performed on the primary and maj or secondary endpo ints to con trol the overall family -wise Ty peI error rate at a 2 -sided α level o f 0.05. The graphical multiple testi ng procedure described in Bretz et al. (2011) will be used. The graphical approach is a closed testing procedure; hence it strongly control s the family -wise error rate across all endpo ints (Alosh et al. 2014). Details of the specific graphical testing scheme (including testing order, interrelat ionships, Ty peI error allocat ion, and the associated propagation) will be prespecified in t he SAP. The fo llowing i s a list of primary and key secondary endpoints to be tested: Primary: proporti on of baricitinib 4 -mg pat ients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 and ≥2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16. proporti on of baricitinib 2 -mg pat ients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 and ≥2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16. Key Secondaries: Evaluated for 2 -mg and 4- mg: proporti on of patients achieving EASI75 at 16 weeks proporti on of patients achieving EASI90 at 16 weeks percent change fro m baseline in EASI score at 16 weeks proporti on of patients achieving SCORAD75 at 16 weeks proporti ons of patients achieving a 4 -point improvement in Itch NRS at 2 days, 1week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 16 weeks mean change fro m baseline in the score of Item 2 from the ADSS at 1 week and 16weeks mean change fro m baseline in skin pain NRS at 16 weeks 10.3.2.

Concomitant Therapy Concomitant medicat ions will be descript ively summarized by treatment group in terms of frequencies and percentages using the safet y populati on. The m edicat ions will be coded accordingly. 10.3.2.4. Treatment Compliance Treatment compliance wit h the randomly assigned study medicati on will be evaluated at every clinic visit through the counts of returned invest igational product tablets. A patient will be considered significant ly nonco mpliant if he or she misses more than 20% of the prescribed doses during the study , unless the patient’s invest igational product i s withheld by the investigator for safet y reason s; that i s, com pliance <80%. Similarly , a pati ent will be considered significant ly nonco mpliant if he or she is jud ged by the invest igator to have intent ionally or repeatedly taken more than the prescribed amount of medicat ion, that i s, com pliance ≥120%. 10.3.3. Efficacy Analyses 10.3.3.1. Primary Analyses The primary efficacy measure is the binary outcome of response defined as IGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or almo st clear skin) and ≥2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16. Primary analysis will be conducted using a logist ic regression as described above with treatment and the stratificat ion variables (disease severit y and re gion) in the m odel. Nonresponder imputation for missing data as described above will be used. Addit ional analysis o f the primary efficacy outcome will include analyzing the outcome as observed, that is, whether or not rescue medicat ion was used. 10.3.3.2. Secondary Analyses The fo llowing secondary categori cal outcom es will be analyzed in a similar manner as the primary ;that is, using the same logist ic regressio n model, but wi th respect ive baseline scores as further covariate included . Nonresponder imputation will be used for these analyses unless otherwi se noted. EASI75 at Week 16. EASI75 is defined as having an improvement of at least 75% from baseline. Besides NRI, this outcome will also be analyzed using observed cases, that is, whether rescue medicat ion was g iven or not. EASI90 at Week 16. EASI90 is defined as having an improvement of at least 90% from baseline. SCORAD75 at Week 16. SCORAD75 is defined as having an improvement of at least 75% from baseline. SCORAD90 at Week 16. SCORAD90 is defined as having an improvement of at least 90% from baseline. 4-point improvement in Itch NRS at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 16 weeks."

Contrasts within the M MRM m odel will be used to assess treatment differences for time po ints of interest as specified above in the list of object ives. Mean change fro m baseline in the fo llowing outcome measures: oADSS Item 2 score oEASI score oSCORAD score oBSA oItch NRS oPOEM total score oPGI-S-AD oHADS oDLQI total score oWPAI(4domains ) oEQ-5D-5L (VAS, health state index ) oPIQ –General oPIQ –Activit y and Cl othing oPIQ –Mood and Sleep oPIQ –Scratching Behavior oPROMIS –Sleep-Related Im pairment oNeuro -QoL -CognitiveFuncti on oPatient Benefit Index . The EASI total score and SCORAD total score will also be analyzed as observed, that is, not assuming missing values after rescue medicat ion is given. 10.3.4. Safety Analyses All safet y data will be descript ively summarized by treatment groups and analyzed using the safet y popul ation. Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as AEs that first occurred or worsened in severit y after the first dose of study treatm ent. The number of TEAEs as well as the number and percentage of patients who experi enced at l east 1 TEAE will be summarized using MedDRA (Medi cal Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities) for each system organ class (or a body system ) and each preferred term by treatment group. Serious adverse events and AEs that lead to discontinuat ion of invest igational product will also be summarized by treatment group. Fisher exact test will be used to perform co mpar isons between each baricit inib dose and the placebo group. All clinical laboratory resul ts will be descri ptively summarized by treatment gr oup. Individual resul ts that are outside of normal reference ranges will be flagged in data list ings. Quant itative clinical hematology , chemistry , and urinalysis variables obtained at the baseline to postbaseline visits will be summarized as changes fro mbaseline by treatm ent group and analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment and baseline value in the model. Categorical variables, including the incidence of abnormal values and incidence of adverse events of special interest, will be"
68,page_68,"I4V-MC-JAIY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 68 LY3009104summarized by frequency a nd percentage of patients in corresponding categories. Shift tables will be presented for selected measures. Observed values and changes fro m baseline (predose or screening if missing) for vital signs and physical characteristics will be descript ively summarized by treatm ent group and time point. Change from baseline to postbaseline in vital signs and body weight will be analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment and baseline value in the model. The incidence and average duration o f investigational product inte rrupti ons will be summarized and co mpared descriptively amo ng treatment groups. Various techniques may be used to estimate the effects of invest igational product interruptions on safet y measures. Further analyses may be performed and will be planned in t he SAP. Data collected after init iation of rescue therapy will be summarized as appropri ate. 10.3.5. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses Not applicable . 10.3.6. Other Analyses 10.3.6.1. Health Outcome Measures The health outcome measures will be analyzed using methods described for continuous or categori cal data as described for efficacy measures in Sect ion10.3.3 . 10.3.6.2. Subgroup Analyses To assess whether the treatmen t effect is similar across subgroups for the primary efficacy outcom e, a l ogistic model will be used and will include treatment, stratificat ion vari ables, the subgroup variable (e.g., sex) and the subgroup by treatm ent interacti on. If the interaction is statistically significant at =0.10, the nature of the interact ion will be explored, that is, within each subgroup the treatment effect will be est imated. Similarly, for the continuous variables of EASI, the MMRM model will include addit ional vari ables for subgroup and the subgroup by treatm ent interacti on. Subgroups to be evaluated will include regi on, baseline severi ty, sex, age, race, pri or therapy , etc. Further definit ions for the levels of the subgroup variables, the analysis methodology , and any additional subgroup analyses will be defined in the SAP. Asthis study is not powered for subgroup analyses, all subgroup analyses will be treated as exploratory . 10.3.7. Interim Analyses 10.3.7.1. Data Monitoring Committee A DMC will oversee the conduct of this trial. The DMC will consist of members external to Lilly. This DMC will fo llow the rul es defined in the DMC charter, focusing on potential and ident ified risks for this mo lecule and for this class of compounds. Data Monitoring Committee membership will include, at a minimum, specialist s with expertise in dermatology , stati stics, and other appropriate specialt ies."

The new protocol is indicated by amendment ( a) and will be used to conduct the study in place of any preceding version o f the protocol. Amendment Summary for Protocol I4V -MC-JAIY Amendment (a) Section # Description of Change Brief Rationale Section 5.1.2 crisaborole was listed in the description of rescue therapies in Period 2. This was an error, crisaborole is not considered a rescue therapy and is allowed during the trial (Permitted Medicat ions S ection 7.7.1). Minor error was corrected Section 5.4 in the scientific rationale for study design section, intolerance to existing topical therapies was listed . This was an error and was corrected to only include inadequate response to topic t herapiesMinor error was corrected Section 6.1 leukotriene inhibitors were removed from washoutLeukotriene inhibitors are not a prohibited medication because evidence suggests little impact to AD , so no need for washout Section 7.7.4 wording on rescue with high and ultra -high potency TCS use was updatedModified for clarity Section 8.1.2 and Appendix 5Eosinophilia (>5%) was removed from permanent discontinuation of IP criteriaElevated eosinophils are very common in patients with moderate to severe A D and do not reflect an increased risk for liver events."

Addit ions have been identified by the use of underscore . 5.1.2. Period 2: Double –Blind, Placebo -Controlled Treatment Patient will be rando mized at a 1:1:1 ratio into 1 of the 3 treatment groups (placebo QD, baricit inib 2 -mg QD, or baricit inib 4 -mg QD) . Investiga tional product will be administered daily for 16weeks (treatment period Visit s 2 through 8; Section 7). All patients will be required to use emollients daily . Daily diaries will cont inue to be utilized throughout the treatment period. Downl oad of this data will be required at study visits. TCS will be dispensed at V2 and used on affected areas as described in section 7.7.2. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCNIs) is also allowed, but TCNI use should be limited to problem areas (e.g. face and skin fo lds). The use of higher potency TCS , crisaborol e,and systemic therapies for the trea tment of AD are not allowed, except as part of rescue therapy for pati ents not responding to treatment. Details o f background topical therapy , as well as rescue therapy and rescue cri teria are included in Sect ion7.7. Assessments of disease severit y willbe perform ed by the investi gator at all study visits incl uding unscheduled and early terminat ion visits (ETVs). 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will enroll m oderate to severe AD patients with a history of inadequate response or intolerance to exi sting topical therapies for whom a systemic treatment such as baricit inib may therefore be appropriate. 6.1. Inclusion Criteria Type of Patient and Disease Characteristics [6] agree to discontinue use of the following excluded medicat ions/treatments for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization (Visit 2) and throughout the study : a.oral systemic corticosteroids and l eukotri ene inhibitors b.systemic immuno modulators, including, but not limited to, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycopheno late m ofetil, and azathio prine c.any other systemic therapy used to treat AD or symptoms of AD (approved or off- label use) 7.7.4 . Rescue Therapy Rescue with High -and Ultra -High -Potency TCS High-or ultra-high-potency TCS m ay be used once daily for up to 14 consecut ive days or less , or based on the maximum duration reco mmended in the prescribing informat ion."
