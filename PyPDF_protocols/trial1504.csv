Overall Rationale for the Amendment: The main purpose of this amendment is to remove the description of the interim anal ysis.Due to unexpectedly rapid recruitment ,the amount of 12-week efficacy and safety data at the planned interim anal ysis would not have been sufficient for a preliminary dose decision. Therefore, no interim analy sis will be performed. Section # and NameDesc ription of Change Brief Rationale 9.5 Interim Analyses Description of interim analyses was deleted and the statement “not applicable to this study“ was included.Due to unexpectedly rapid progression of the study, no interim analysi s will be performed. Primary analysis will be conducted once all participants have completed 12 week s of intervention, as described in Section 9.4.2 . 9.4.1 General considerationsThe term “database lock“ was changed to “unblinding of the database”.To reflect the current convention in terminology of the company 4.3Justification for Dose The values of awake cough counts obtained from the proof of concept study for RUCC (study 18184) were corrected (26.1% instead of 21.1% for the maximum technically feasible dose of 750 mgBID or the next lower dose of 200 mg BID of BAY 1817080 and 24.4% instead of 22.5% for the placebo).Correction of error Title page Sponsor signator y was removed and a statement added that t his is an electronically generated document that does not bear any sponsor signatures .To reflect the current conventio n of the company Title page The name of the sponsor’s medically responsible person was updated .The previous medically responsible person is no longer involved in this study"

Introduction Cough is one of the s ymptoms for which patients most frequently seek medical attention. In most patients, cough manifests itself as an acute cough, e.g., due to an upper respiratory infection, lasts a few days to weeks, and is usuall y self -limiting , thus resolve swithout any medical treatment. In general, cough is classified, on the basis of its duration, into acute (< 3 weeks), sub -acute (3-8 weeks) and chronic (> 8 weeks ). The prevalence of chronic cough, i.e., a cough that is not self -limiting, is estimated to be around 10% in the adult population. Chronic cough is a feature of man y common respiratory diseases (e.g. ,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma) and som e non -respiratory conditions (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux and rhinosinusitis) (1, 2), and it may be the presenting s ymptom of patients with some rarer conditions (e.g. ,idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and eosinophilic bronchitis). I n up to 50% of the chronic cough cases, the cough is refractory despite extensive investigation and treatment trials. In other patients with chronic cough, no potential underlying etiology is found –those are patients with a so -called idiopathic (or unexplained) chronic cough. Despite the distinction above, publications often summarize both refractory and idiopathic chronic cough simpl y as refractory chronic cough. I n this study protocol, both will be jointly referred to as refractory and/or un explained chronic cough (RUCC). In the majority of patients with RUCC, it has been postulated that sensitized nerve fibers play a prominent role after they fail to return to a normal quiescent state. This situation has be en described in the literature as “cough h ypersensitivity syndrome.” Patients with RUCC typicall y present with a mean age of about 65 years, and about two thirds of these patients are female (3, 4). In a normal ph ysiological state, noxious stimuli lead to a protective cough, while innocuous stimuli are not recognized by the cough receptors. I n pat ients with cough hy persensitivity syndrome, however, even small, innocuous stimuli lead to the urge to cough. I n fact, it was shown, in the experimental set- up of cough challenges, that the concentration of the tussive agent capsaicin, required to elicit 5 coughs within 15 seconds, is about 100 times lower in patients with RUCC than in healthy individuals ( 5). The underl ying nerve damage usuall y occurs after an initial injury (often a viral infection) and is thought to be associ ated with a local neuropath y leading to throat -clearing among other responses. While cough is a key protective reflex preventing aspiration and promoting airway clearance , cough in patients with RUCC is mainly pathologic, does not serve as an airway -protec tive mechanism and has a major impact on phy sical and psy chological aspects of quality of life. Among the ph ysical complications reported by a large proportion of patients with RUCC are exhaustion/fatigue, insomnia, breathlessness, vomiting and urinary incontinence (the latter predominatel y reported by women). Psychological complications with a high prevalence in patients with RUCC are depression, anxiety and embarrassment as well as interference with social life. Most patients with RUCC are able to identify the triggers of their cough, such as talking, singing, laughing, strong odors, strong foods or change in air temperature or quality . A well -established expert panel have proposed a chronic cough algorithm for the management of patients > 15 years of age with cough lasting > 8 weeks, as clearl y outlined by Irwin et al. 2006 (Figure 3 ) (6). The evaluation of chronic cough is largel y based on anatomic diagnostic protocols focused on the most common causes. The evidence supporting such protocols is limited and etiologic"

Sequential empiric therapy for the most common causes of chronic cough has thus been recommend ed instead. Identify ing the specific patient concern allows individualization of the extent of the diagnostic evalu ation and treatment as described by Achilleos et al. 2016 (Table 1) (7). 2.1 Study Rationale The objective of this study is to identify the optimal dose of theP2X3 receptor antagonist BAY 1817080 in patients with RUCC and to further assess efficacy and characterize the safet y and tolerability profile of BAY 1817080 following a 12 -week twice daily oral treatment 2.2 Background There are currently no specificall y approved drugs for the treatment of RUCC. Current guideline - approved treatment options for the management of patients with RUCC include only empiric treatments than cause- directed therapies. Th e ERS 2019 guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough in adults and children incorporate all recent advances in chronic cough pathophy siology , diagnosis and treatment ( 8). P2X3 ion channel receptors are expressed b y airway vagal afferent nerves and contribute to the ATP -driven h ypersensitization of sensory neurons, thus contributing to the induction of pathologic cough. Recently developed P2X3 receptor antagonists that blo ck these receptors have been investigated in improved animal models of cough using validated cough frequency measurement tools and demonstrated a therapeutic promise. Extrapolating from the guinea pig cough model, and with a better understanding of neuronal activation and sensitization together with their signal processing in the brain, P2X3 antagonism mode of action has been further validated in Phase 2clinical trials for the treatment of RUCC (9). Bayer has proposed a clinical development plan intend edto provide an efficacious and safe treatment option indicated for patients diagnosed with RUCC . The implementation of this clinical development plan ,within an efficient time and resources frame, aimstogenerate strong scientific and clinical evidence and recommendations supporting the use of this medication . The present Phase 2b clinical study intends to evaluate three different twice daily oral doses of a selective P2X3 receptor antagonist ( BAY 1817080) and compare them to placebo during a period of 12 weeks aiming to identify the most efficacious ,tolerable and safe dose to advance the drug into a Phase 3 of development . 2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment 2.3.1 Summary Chronic cough is a common and disabling disorder affecting approximately 5-10% of the adult population (10). Currentl y, there is no approved treatment for refractory chronic cough. Medicines, such as gabapentin and morphine, are used off- label in patients with refractory chronic cough, however they have limited efficacy and lead to a high rate of side effects. The burden of the disease and the limitations of currently available off -label use treatment modalities cause a serious unmet medical need. The P2X3 antagonist gefapixant and other compounds are currentl y in clinical developme nt for refractory chronic cough. Blocking of P2X3 counteracts purine ATP- evoked hy per- sensitization of afferent nerves, leading to a cessation/reduction of pathological coughing. Of note, an effect of P2X3 antagonism (gefapixant) on capsaicin -or citric -ac id-evoked cough for"

BAY 1817080 is a potent and selective P2X3 antagonist, which preferentially blocks the homomeric P2X3 channel. BAY 1817080 showed a strong effect on airway sensory afferent activation by inhibition of depolarization of the human and guinea pig vagus nerve prepared from lung tissues. Beneficial effects of BAY 1817080 on cough frequency and severit y were demonstrated in a Proof - of-Mechanism/Proof -of-Concept Phase 2a clinical trial with refractory chronic cough patients (9). Benefit/risk ratio for BAY 1817080 is considered favorable for the planned study . 2.3.2 Potential B enefits Administration of BAY 1817080 may be associated with the following benefits for patients with refractory chronic cough : Reduction in cough frequency , severity and urgency , which is expected to be associated with increased quality - of-life (Qo L) and social functioning Relief from physical and psychological complications of cough, such as exhaustion/fatigue, insomnia, breathlessness, urinary incontinence, difficulties in speaking, depression and anxiety . Recently generated evidence from aProof -of -Mechanism/Proof -of-Concept Phase 2a clinical trialcorroborates the potential benefit of this mode -of -action and is supportive of further developing BAY 1817080 as a therapeutic option for patients with refractory chronic cough (9).During the aforementioned Phase 2a study , BAY 1817080 was tested in four different doses of formulation A in patients with RUCC . Twice dail y administration of 50mg, 200mg and750mg ( formulation A) resulted in a 24-hour c ough count reduction with -18.4%, -22% and-25% , respectivel y (placebo -corrected values). Of note, f ormulation B will be administered in the current Phase 2b dose -finding study as outlined in this protocol . 2.3.3 Risks and Un desirable E ffects 2.3.3.1 Taste-Related AEs Taste -related AEs have been observed dose -dependently in up to about 20% of study participants at a dose of 750 mg twice daily (BID; formulation A ).This highest dose of 750mg BID ( formulation A) is expected to correspond to approximately 150 mg BID of formulation B as described thoroughly in the latest available version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and throughout this protocol . Taste -related AEs have also been reported for the P2X3 antagoni st gefapixant (12 ). To date , the influence of BAY 1817080 on taste perception has been investigated in a limited number of study participants only . In these studies, the change in taste perception was reported as being non -serious and mild. Changes were fully reversible after the end of treatment with BAY 1817080. No participants discontinued the treatment because of taste disturbances. Study 18184 ( 9)was a two -part stud y,investigating safet y and pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAY 1817080 in healthy volunteers (Part 1) and safet y, efficacy and PKin patients with refractory chronic cough (Part 2). In Part 1,the frequency of the taste-related AEs was evenly"
17,page_17,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 17of 84 distributed between participants receiving active treatment with BAY 1817080 (3 participan ts; 8.6%) and participant s receiving placebo (1 participan t; 8.3%). I n Part 2 of study 18184, overall 10 out of 40 participan ts treated reported a taste- related AE. Some of th eAEs lasted for two or more consecutive treatment intervals with different doses. If evaluated b y dose, 5.1% of participants had a taste -related AE starting or ongoing at the 10 mg dose, 10.3% at the 50 mg dose, 15.4 % at the 200 mg dose ,and 20.5% at the 750 mg dose . When extrapolated to doses of formulation B ,50 mg, 200 mg and 750 mg BID of formulation A are expected to correspond to approximately 25mg, 75 mgand 150 mg BID of formulation B, which areto be assessed in the current Phase 2b study . Under placebo, 2.5% of participants reported a taste -related AE. The changes in taste perception were reported as being mild in all participants, and all participants had recovered from the taste -related AEs at the end of the study . At the highest dose of 150 mg BID (formulation B; corresponding to a target dose of approximately 750 mg BID of formulation A) ,taste-related AEs are expected at rates of equal or less than 20%. In this stud y, the frequency of taste - related AEs will be evaluated, including the assessment of how bothersome the AEs were perceived to be. At this stage of clinical deve lopment, taste disturbance is regarded an identified risk. 2.3.3.2 Antithrombin III Activity I ncrease In stud y 18184 ( 9) (Part 1) , antithrombin III (ATIII) activity increases were observed in healthy participants treated with 200 mg and 750 mg BID of BAY 1817080 (f ormulation A). Effect was first observed 3 day s after the first dose. I ncrease was up to ~20% above baseline in the 200 mg BI D group, and up to ~30% above baseline in the 750 mg BID group (200 mg and 750 mg BID of formulation A are expected to correspond to approximately 75 and 150mg BID of formulation B ). In stud y 18184 (Part 2), in patients with refractory chroni c cough, there were similar time and dose-dependent increases of AT IIIactivity observed as in the healthy volunteers in Part 1 of the study . No changes in coagulation parameters were observed andno signs of bleeding/bruising related to BAY 1817080 were o bserved in study 18184 or other studies, to date, with BAY 1817080. Furthermore, t here is no established clinical relevance linked to increased ATIII activity in medical literature. Therefore, it is concluded that at this stage of development, the increas e in ATIII activity can be considered as not clinicall y relevant . ATIII activity will be measured in this study . Coagulation parameters ( p rothrombin time (Quick), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, i nternational normalized ratio (INR)) will be monitored regularly during the study as part of safet y laboratory assessments. Increased ATIII activity at this stage of development is regarded a potential risk. 2.3.3.3 Potential Decrease in Heart Rate and Diastolic Blood Pressure In stud y 18184, a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (4- 7 mmHg) and heart rate (HR) (5-11 bpm) was observed in the highest dose group (750 mg BID formulation A corresponding to approximately 150 mg BID of formulation B ) in health y participants (Part 1;"
18,page_18,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 18of 84 mainly in 2-3 participants with high baseline values). The decrease in DBP and HR was not observed in patients with refractory chronic cough (Part 2). In the absence of AEs related to the changes in DBP and HR, such as dizziness or sy ncope, this observation was con sidered as not clinicall y significant. Decrease in H R and DBP at this stage of development is regarded as potential risk. HR and blood pressure will be monitored in this study . 2.3.3.4 Potential Changes in Liver Function Laboratory Parameters In one of two in vitr o assay s, BAY 1817080 was found to be an inhibitor of bile salt export pump (BSEP). No other risk factors have been identified pre- clinically at relevant exposures, including absence of signals for mitochondrial toxicity . In GL P animal toxicology studies, no changes in liver function laboratory parameters have been observed. To date, clinicall y no changes in total bile acids or liver function laboratory parameters related to BAY 1817080 have been observed. Changes in liver function values at this stage of development are regarded as a potential risk. Liver -specific exclusion criteria and discontinuation rules have been defined. L iver function laboratory parameters will be assessed at 4- weekly intervals, i.e. ,at every visit. Investigators and participants should be alerted regarding non- specific s ymptoms which may be associated with liver dy sfunction, including anorexia, nausea, fatigue, right upper abdominal discomfort, vomiting, malaise, jaundice, fever, and rash. Informatio n on these sy mptoms should be asked forin case of abnormal liver laboratory values (see Section 8.3.6) or an y other suspicion of liver dy sfunction. Thestudy participants should be reminded to contact the study site immediately , if they are concerned about such s ymptoms and unscheduled liver laboratory assessments should be considered. 2.3.3.5 Reproductive Toxicity Studies on reproductive and developmental to xicity of BAY 1817080 were conducted in rats and rabbits. No effects of BAY 1817080 on male/female reproduction, fertility or developmental toxicity have been detected with multiples of exposures relative to the anticipated human therapeutic exposures of a bout 6-fold (rats) and 0.8- fold (rabbits). Women of childbearing potential must use an acceptable effective contraceptive method when receiving BAY 1817080. Theuse of highl y effective methods of contraception will be allowed for women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) during the conduct of this Phase 2 study . 2.3.3.6 Potential Phototoxicity BAY 1817080 was weakly phototoxic ( Photoirritation factor, PIF = 17.7) in an in vitro phototoxicity assay at concentrations clearl y exceeding t he expected human maximum plasma concentration. In addition, reversible affinit y to pigmented tissues (eye, skin) was seen in rats. In stud y 18184 (9), no AEs potentially linked to phototoxicity were observed. B ased on literature data ( 13), a PIF <25 derived from the in vitro assay is very unlikely to translate into in vivo phototoxicity .Nonetheless, as a pre cautionary measure, excessive exposure to sunlight should be avoided during the intervention period. Participants will be advised to use conventional ultraviolet (UV) sunscreens, to avoid prolonged sunbathing especiall y when traveling to a different geographical area with greater sunshine, and also to"
19,page_19,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 19of 84 avoid the use of solarium. They are also advised to use sunglasses if exposed to direct or excessive sunlight. 2.3.3.7 Risk of contracting SARS -CoV-2 infection during study participation As long as the COVID -19 pandemic situation is ongoing, there is a risk of contracting a SARS -CoV -2 infection during the time period of study participation. Only SARS -CoV -2 virus RNA and IgG testsnegative participants without any symptoms suggestive of COVID - 19 infection will be included into this study . Given the global setting of the PAGANINI clinical trial, testing, as well as obtaining further information regarding symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection1, will be part of the screening visit and subsequent visits (as applicable in accordance with guidance from the relevant regional and local public health authorities). Both quantitative detection and viral load analysis of SARS -CoV -2 through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT -PCR) will be performed throughout the study . If a participant becomes SARS -CoV -2 virus RNA test positive during study participation, the investigator will have to decide whether remaining in the study is compatible with participant’s and site personnel’s safet y and well -being. 1Common COVID -19 related symptoms could include (but are not limited to): fever over 38°C in the past 4 weeks; persistent chronic cough that exacerbated further in the past 4 weeks; chills; body aches; loss of smell and/or taste; headache; sore throat; fat igue."

Study Design 4.1 Overall Design Study design summary: Randomi zed, double -blind, parallel group, Phase 2 bdose-finding, efficacy and safet y stud y of 12 -week twice daily oral administration of BAY 1817080 compared to placebo in patients with RUCC . Intervention group: Parallel Study duration: Approximately 18weeks Intervention duration: 12 weeks Study Periods: Pre-intervention period ( screening & r andomization) , Intervention period, and Safety follow -upperiod Diagnosis group: Patient swith RUCC The study population consists of participants with a cough that has lasted for at least 12 months (unresponsive to treatment options) with a diagnosis of refractory chronic cough and/or idiopathic (unexplained) chronic cough and with persistent cough for at least the last 8 weeks before screening. 4.1.1 Pre-Intervention Period Written informed consent form must be obtained before an y stud y related activities are performed. After providing the written informed consent, participants will undergo a screening evaluation to determine their eligibility. The scr eening evaluation will take place on Day -14 before Visit 2 . The screening of each participant has to be recorded in the I WR Ssystem. To assure timel y drug suppl y to each study site, the recording of randomization must be completed at least 1 day but not later than 4 day s after Visit 1 (before Visit 2) . The recording of randomization in IWRS of a participant who is eligible for intervention must be repeated on the day of the planned start of intervention . This will be considered confirmation of randomizati on and will trigger the notification tothe site about the study intervention assignment . Following screening, eligible participants will be randomized to one of four parallel intervention groups of BAY 1817080. 4.1.2 Intervention Period After randomization, each participant will receive one of three doses of BAY 1817080 or placebo administered orally with or without food , twice dail y over the course of 12 weeks with an interval of 12 hours. 4.1.3 Post- Intervention Period After last intake of study intervention, participants will enter an obse rvational safet y follow- up period of 30±5 day s. During this period, AEs will continue to be collected. At the end of this observational period, a safet y follow -up ( SFU)visit will be performed at site .

24,page_24,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 24of 84 4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design This Phase 2b dose -finding study with BAY 1817080 administered twice daily for 12 weeks will provide further data to support the determ ination of adose with the highest potential for efficacy and with optimal risk -benefit profile for patients with RUCC. Twelve weeks on intervention isconsidered sufficiently long to identify optimal dose and explore whether BAY 1817080 hassuperior efficacy over placebo. The inclusion of a placebo -controlled arm is regarded asfundamental to minimize bias on the part of participants and investigators. Randomization is designed to prevent assignment or selection bias. RUCC is a condition wit h a k nown behavioral component, potentially susceptible to a placebo effect. Rationale for the primary efficacy endpoints Cough is associated with significant ph ysical and psy chological morbidity (14 ). In the research environment, the ability to measure relevant cough parameters is necessary for understanding its mechanism and developing new treatments (15). Coughing can be assessed either from the perspective of the patient or from that of the clinician or researcher. Both approaches are very useful and complementary , therefore combined subjective and objective assessment is necessary for more comprehensive evaluation . An objective measure of cough is of use in clinical practice, clinical research and theassessment of novel therapies. It permits validation of the presence of cough , grading of severit y and monitoring of response to treatment (16). The assessment of cough severit y is considered the most impor tant parameter for evaluating the efficacy of therap y and it can be measured b y symptom severit y,frequency , intensit y and impact on quality of life, with the validated tools available . There is a general consensus that cough frequency monitoring is the gold standard for the objective assessment of cough and it has been increasing lyused as primary endpoint in clinical trials , although there is currentl y no standardized method for measuring cough frequency (3). An objective measure of cough would permit validation of the presence of cough, grading of severit y and monitoring of responses to therapeutic intervention .Therefore ,our primary efficacy endpoint is the assessment of change from baseline in 24-hour cough count (measured b y cough recording digital wearable monitoring device) after 1 2 weeks of intervention ."
25,page_25,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 25of 84 4.3 Justification for Dose In this stud y, the dose s wereselected based on the following: The selected dose should result in sufficiently high exposures that block the target to an extent which allows to conclusively determine the optimal dose to be tested in subsequent confirmatory Phase 3trials in RUCC. The safet y/ tolerability profile based on clinical evidence gathered to date will ensure participants’ safet y during trial participation and reduce the risk of earl y disconti nuations due to adverse events (AEs) or perceived lack of efficacy . For BAY 1817080 ,the above -mentioned criteria are fulfilled for the selected dose sof 75 and 150mg BID2: Based on current dose predictions from preclinical studies and data from the proof of concept stud y in patients with refractory and/or unexplained chronic cough (study 18184), the lowest fully effective dose was observed at a dose of 200 mg BID with formulation A3. Exposures after dosing of 200 mg BID with formulation A correspond to ex posures expected with ~75 mg BID with formulation B. In this study ,formulation B is used. The dose sof 25, 75 and 150 mg BID w erechosen in order to allow investigating the full dose response in RUCC , i.e. ,testing one lower ,partiall y effective dose of 25 mg and one higher, also fully effective dose of 150 mg BID ( formulation B ). The dose sof 25, 75 and 150 mg BID of formulation B are expected to be similar to the doses of 50 mg, 200 mg and 750 mg of formulation A previously tested in P hase 2a (see Figure 4– 1 ). Participants are recommended to take the tablets at approximately the same time each daywith or without food. Tablets are not to be broken, halved or crushed; they should be swallowed as a complete unit with water (see Figure 4–1and the latest available version of the IBfor further details) . In summary , expected exposures after administration of 25, 75 and 150 mg BID of BAY 1817080 are believed to be sufficient to conclusively investigate the dose response in patients with RUCC . In stud y 18184, the highest exposure (after multiple doses of 750 mg of formulation A) was found to be well tolerated and safe (see the latest available version of the IB for further details)4. 750 mg BID of formulation A translates into approximately 150 mg BID of formulation B. Accordingl y, exposures following administration of 25, 75 2Formulation B [see the latest available version of the IB for further details]) 3Clinical proof of target engagement is derived from the proof of concept study with BAY 1817080 in patients with refractory and/or unexplained chronic cough (study 18184; see the latest available version of the IB ). For patients who had received the maximum technically feasible dose of 750 mg BID or the next lower dose of 200 mg BID , awake cough counts were reduced on top of placebo by 2 6.1% and 2 4.4%, respectively. 4Patients who had received the maximum technically feasible dose of 750 mg BID or the next lower dose of 200 mg BID experienced t aste-related adverse events at a rate of 15.4% and 20.5%, respectively. Such AEs were also observed after administration of a different P2X3 antagonist (gefapixant ) (12). CCI"
26,page_26,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 26of 84 and 150 mg BID of formulation B are expected to be similar to the concentrations covered in the multiple dose study 18184 (see the latest available version of the IBand Figure 4–1below; applies to both fasted and fed state). Additionally , in study 19519 ,a 400 mg single dose of formulation B was found to be safe. Therefore , there are no anticipated safet y concerns with the selected dose sof 25 , 75 and 150mg BID (formulation B) of BAY 1817080 in study 20393. Tolerability is expected to facilitate completion of the study by the required number of participants and accordingl y interpretation of stud y results (i.e., rate of earl y discontinuations within expectatio ns)."

Re-starti ng the defined set of screening procedures to enable the “screening failure” patient’s participation at a later time point is not allowed. Dropout A participant who discontinues study participation prematurel y for an y reason is defined as a “dropout” if t he participant has alread y been randomized to study intervention. Dropouts will not be replaced. 6. Study Intervention Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be admi nistered to a study participant according to the study protocol. 6.1 Study Interventions Administered Each participant will be randomized to receive one of three oral doses of BAY 1817080 or placebo, administered twice dail y Participants should be instructed to take the morning dose of study intervention at approximately the same time of day ,every day over the course of 12 weeks . The interval between the application of the morning and the evening dose should be with an interval of approximately 12 hours . The morning dose should be taken at the site onthe second day of Visit 6 (see also Section 8.5) Tablets are not to be broken, halved o r crushed; they should be swallowed as a complete unit with water . Tablets can be taken with or without food. See Section 8.5for detailed instructions regarding recording of the drug intake and the food intake before or after the drug intake in relation to blood sampling for PK . Participants will have to confirm the tablet intake twice per day by reporting this on the handheld device. In addition, the time of the tablet intake will be collected. If a dose of study intervention has been missed: oIf ≤ 6 hours has passed since the dose was due, it should be taken immediately oIf >6 hours have passed since the dose was due, the dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken according to the regular schedule ."

For further information, see the handling instruction and the instruction manual as provided with the device b y the legal manufacturer. 6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions , if applicable, have been maintained during transit for all study intervention sreceived and an y discrepancies are r eported and resolved before use of the study intervention. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive the study intervention and only authorized site staff may supply or administer the study intervention. All study intervention s must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical i nstitution (where applicable) is responsible for stud y intervention accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (i .e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are provided in the Investigator Site File. Study interventions will be dispensed at the visits summarized in S oA. Returned study intervention smust not be re -dispensed to the participants. 6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding Participants will be identified by a unique participant number with 9 digits once the ICFs are signed. The first 5 digits will identify the country and study site, the last 4 digits are assigned to the participant of the specific site in increasi ng order."
33,page_33,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 33of 84 Following the screening visit ( Visit 1 ), all participants who meet all eligibility criteria will be centrall y randomized in a 1:1:1:1allocation ratio and stratified by region (Japan, Europe [Belgium, Czech Republic, France, German y, Hungary , Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, United Kingdom ], ROW [ Argentina, Australia, Canada, Russian Federation, Taiwan, Turkey , United States]) to receive either BAY 181708 0or placebo b y using IW RS. Once a randomization number has been assigned ,it mu st not be re -assigned. To accomplish random ization assignments, a computer -generated randomization list will be prepared b y Randomization Management at the study sponsor. The randomizat ion list is provided to the I WRS vendor. Before the study is initiated, the log in inf ormation & directions for the I WRS will be provided to each site. After randomization, participant , investigator and sponsor will be blinded for the intervention participant receives. To maintain blind ing, tablets containing BAY 1817080 and corresponding placebo are identical in appearance (size, color, shape). BAY 1817080 25 mg, 75mg, and 150mg,and matching placebos will be packaged in blisters labeled with a unique number. Forregulatory reporting purposes ,drug safet y personnel of the sponsor are permitted to unblind individual cases. In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR), the randomization code of the participant will usually be unblinded before reporting to the health authorities. Bioanal ytical staff will be unblinded according to the corresponding Bay er standard operating procedure (SOP). Pharmacometrics staff may also be unblinded according to Bay er SOPs. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and exposure -response analy sis might be performed using population approaches (popPK and popPK/PD, e.g., b y non -linear mixed effect modeling). Anal ysis and report will be done under a separate cover. This evaluation might be started prior to database lock. I f this is applicable, appropriate measures will be taken to maintain blinding of the stud y team, e.g., data will be stored separatel y, and members of the stud y team will neither have access to the randomization list nor to individual data. Emergency unblin ding can only be performed in the I WRS sy stem. The IW RS will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an emergency , the investigator has the responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s intervention assignment is warran tedwhen knowledge of the actual intervention is absolutely essential for further medical management of the participant . If the investigator is unavailable, and a treating physician not associated with the study requests emergency unblinding, the emergency unblinding requests are forwarded to the study specific emergency medical advice 24 hours/7 - day service (country -specific emergency contact information provided in the participant card). Participant safet y must alway s be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a participant’s intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the participant. If a par ticipant’s intervention assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and case report form (CRF) , as applicable. The actual allocation must NOT be disclosed to the participant and/or other study personnel, including monitors, or sponsors staff; nor should there be an y written or verbal disclosure of the code in an y of the corresponding participant documents."

Compliance will be assessed b y direct questioning and counting returned tablets .Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). To monitor compliance, the investigator will be required to document intervention dispensing and return for each participant. The date of dispensing the stud y intervention to the participant will be documented. Study intervention will be dispensed according to the schedule provided in SoA. Participants should be instructed to bring all unused stud y intervention and empty packages at every scheduled/ unscheduled visit for accountability purposes. Any discrepancies between actual and expected amount of returned stud y intervention must be discussed with the participant at the time of the visit, and any explanation must be documented in the source records. When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive stud y intervention directly from the investigator or design ee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the eCRF. The dose of stud y intervention and study par ticipant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing b y a member of the stud y site staff other than the person administering the study intervention. When participants self -administer study intervention at home, compliance with study interventio n will be assessed at each visit. 6.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy Any medication or vaccine ( including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment upto 12 week s prior to screening or receives during the study must be recorded along with: Reason for use Dates of administration including start and end dates Dosage information including dose and frequency The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are an y que stions regarding concomitant or prior therap y.

Based on preclinical data, an increase in exp osure of drugs that are sensitive substrates of OATP1B1/1B3, P -gp or BCRP during co -administration of BAY 1817080 due to inhibition of those transporters b y BAY 1817080 cannot be excluded. • Typical OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP or P -gp substrates include but are n ot limited to the following: fexofenadine, sulfasalazine, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin, glyburide, pravastatin, repaglinide, simvastatin. • Participants receiving a combination of BAY 1817080 and OATP1B1/1B3, BCRP and P-gp substrates should be cl osely monitored for signs and s ymptoms of adverse events due to increased exposure of co -administered OATP1B1/1B3, BCRP or P- gp substrates. Dose modification of sensitive OATP1B1/1B3, BCRP or P -gp substrates should be considered based on the prescriber inf ormation or such compounds should be avoided. A clinical DDI stud y investigating the effect of BAY 1817080 on the sensitive OATP1B1/1B3 and BCRP substrate rosuvastatin is ongoing. According to the risk assessment based on the FDA Drug Development and Dru g Interactions (DDI) guidance (18), the potential increase in exposure (AUC) due to inhibition of OATP1B1, the transporter with the lowest measured IC 50is estimated to be up to 2.85 -fold with the highest dose of 150 mg BID of BAY 1817080 (simulated stead y state exposure of formulation B w as used for DDI predictions) . The parameters used for this calculation are"

The clinical relevant interaction will be assessed in the ongoing clinical DDI study investigating the effect of BAY 1817080 on the sensitive OATP1B1/1B3 and BCRP substrate rosuvastatin . Please refer to the current version of the IB for further information. Additional information regarding other OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP and P- p substr ates can be found in Table 5 -1 of the FDA DDI guidance (19). Ketoconazole and other triazole antifungal drugs are allowed for topical/ local use (including vaginal application) at any time during the study . Occasional intake of proton- pump inhibitors as treatment for concomitant AE, at the discretion of the investigator is allowed, but not recommended. Alternative treatment options are st rongl y suggested to be considered. 6.6 Dose Modification Dose modification is not allowed within the study . 6.7 Intervention after the End of the Study Participant s completing the intervention period will not be given further access to study intervention . The investigator will decide in consultation with the individual participant if additional treatment is required and choose from existing treatment options. It will be up to the investigators discretion to provide follow- up medical care for all participa nts who complete the study or who are prematurel y withdrawn from the study or refer them for appropriate ongoing care as required. 7. Discontinuation of Study Intervention and Participant Discontinuation/W ithdrawal Unnecessary withdrawal of participant s from the study should be avoided and all efforts should be taken to motivate participant s to adhere to all study procedures until the end of the trial. In case a participant premature discontinues the study intervention, the participant will remain in the stud y to be evaluated for the procedures planned at EoIand SFU visitsbefore the participant leaves the study. See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention. 7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention It may be necessar y for a participant to permanently discontinue study intervention. Such events are expected to be rare. If study intervention is discontinued, a participant who is still in the intervention period should have the EoIvisit (Visit 6) assessments performed a s soon as possible. Following Visit 6, the participant continues to the follow- up period and the end of stud y visit (i.e., the SFU visit) assessments thereafter according to the SoA.

Study Assessments and Procedures Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for stud y conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record detai ls of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. No screening procedures may be performed unless written informed consent has been obtained. If the (first) screening procedures already star t on the same day (same date) as the participant signs the ICF, confirmation that ICF was signed prior to an y screening procedures being initiated ,must be recorded in the source documents. Information on smoking history and a detailed history of symptoms and complications as a result of cough (t ype, onset, duration and time of resolution) will be recorded at screening visit via a series of questions reflected on individual eCRF page as part of the participant’s medical history . Worsening of any of the conditions listed on the aforementioned eCRF page or their first occurrence after signing the informed consent will be recorded as AEs. 8.1 Efficacy Assessments Planned time points for all efficacy assessments are provided in the SoA ( see Section 1.3). 8.1.1 Cough Count Measurement Objective 24-hour cough monitoring will be performed with the VitaloJAK cough recorder (VitaloJAK, Vitalograph) ,a non -invasive, battery operated and custom -built validated recording device and microphone intended to acquire, record and store ambulatory cough sounds from participants for 24 hours at six time points (see the SoA) . Briefly , this consists of a digital data logg er recording sounds at a sample rate of 8 kHz, with 16- bit resolution and in WAV format, which is a commonly used uncompressed sound file format. Recordings will be transferred to a personal computer; silences and background noise will be removed by using validated, custom -written software, and cough sounds will be counted by using an audio editing package (Vitalograph). The number of coughs will be expressed as coughs per hour and added up to give a cough count for a 24 -hour period. Cough monitoring with t he VitaloJAK recorder will be started at approximately the same time of day on each of the assessment day s. 8.1.2 Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePROs) Patient reported outcomes ( PROs) are self -administered questionnaires to be completed b y the study participants themselves. All questionnaires will be available in the participant’s local language.

The study site staff will provide a standardized technical training on the handling of the handheld -device and the tablet device to the study participants during the screening visit and will assist the study participants in case of any technical queries during the entire stud y duration. In addition to the technical support by the study site staff, a 24- hour help desk by the ePRO provider will be available during the entire stud y duration to respond urgent technical questions of the site staff . Measures to prevent missing data entry In case a warning due to missing data entry isreceived at the study site,the study site staff will directly contact the study participant immediately and ask for reasons for failure in data entry and transfer. The study site staff will remind the study participant again regarding the importance of the daily records . The handheld device will be returned to the site upon study participant discontinuing o r completing the stud y. 8.1.2.1 Severity of Chronic Cough Diary (SCCD) Study participant s’assessment of frequency , severity of cough, disruption due to cough and disruptions of sleep will be recorded electronically every day from screening until the end of the intervention period using the SCCD. The SCCD is a novel 14- item PRO questionnaire, asking the participant to assess experiences with their cough during the past 24 hours. Study participants will rate the frequency (items 1- 4), severit y (items 5 -8), disruptions due to cough (items 9- 11 and 14) and disruptions of sleep (items 12-13) using verbal rating scales (VRS) and ar e asked to enter their daily assessments directly into the handheld device at home . The completion of the SCCD takes approximately 5 minutes. The daily recording of the SCCD will start at Visit 1 and will be continued daily until the SFU visit or at earl y termination for those study participants discontinuing the study before completion. SCCD scores will be calculated based on stud y participants’ responses to single items. The SCCD is a PRO ,which has been newl y developed by Bayer. The SCCD underwent cogni tive interviews (CIs) confirming the content validity , the ease of comprehension, interpretation and completion prior to initiation of thisstudy . Psy chometric and other measurement properties of the SCCD are planned to be assessed using data from this tri al. Results from the CI s and the psy chometric anal yses are aimed to confirm the appropriateness of the instrument for use in clinical Phase 3 in potential support of label claims. Training and instructions will be provided to participants in terms of how t o complete the questionnaire . 8.1.2.2 Cough Severity Visual Analog Scale Study participant assessment of cough severity will be recorded electronically daily using the Cough Severit y Visual Analogue S cale (VAS). The Cough Severity VAS is a single item instrument ,asking the stud y participant to assess the severit y of his/her cough using a 0 -100 VAS. This is a verticall y oriented line ordered from 0–100, on which the study participants indicate the severity of their cough by crossing the line at the point that that best reflected the perception of the severity of their cough on"

The completion of the Cough Severity VAS will take less than 1 minute. The daily recording of the Cough Severity VAS will start at Visit 1 and will be continued daily until the SFU visit or at early termination for those study participants discontinuing the study before completion. The Cough Severity VAS response option is known for its simplicity and practicalit y and is commonly used in clinical research for the measure ment of a variet y of clinical phenomena (20), including for the assessment of cough (16). The scale response range is from (""No Cough"") to 100 (""Extremely Severe Cough""). A change of 17 scale units on a VAS has been reported to be perceived as important to subjects with acute cough (21). Clinical trial endpoints evaluating treatments for chronic cough include an endpoint of ‘ ≥ 30 scale units Reduction From Baseline in Cough Severit y Visual Ana log Scale (VAS) Score ’(22) . In this trial ,the Cough Severit y VAS will assess key secondary and othe r efficacy endpoints. Scores from the Cough Severit y VAS will also be used to investigate ps ychometric properties of the SCCD. 8.1.2.3 Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C) PGI-S and PGI -C will be assessed on the tablet device at predefined visits according to the SoA or at earlier termination for those study participants discontinuing the study before completion . PGI-S Study participants rate the severit y of cough using the PGI -S scale experienced at the time point of the assessment (no recall period). The PGI -S is a single item instrument. Study participants respond to the PGI -S using a 5- point verbal rating scale: a score of 0 = “No cough”, 1 = “Very mild”,2 = “Mild” ,3 = “Moderate” , 4 = “Severe” ,5 = “Very severe” and will enter their assessment on a tablet device during study visits .The PGI -S is being included in the trial as a reference measure for assessment of psychometric and other measurement properties of the newl y developed SCCD. PGI-C Study participants rate the change in the severity of their cough using the PGI -C scale since starting stud y intervention at the different assessment time points respectively . Study participants respond using a 7 -point verbal rating scale: a score of 0 = “Very much better ”, 1= “Much better” ,2 = “A little better” ,3 = “No change” ,4 = “A little worse” ,5 = “Much worse” and 6 = “ Very much worse”. The PGI - C is being included in the trial as a reference measure for assessment of psy chometric and other measurement properties of the newl y developed SCCD. 8.1.2.4 Leicester Cough Questionnaire Study participants assessment of health related quality of life will be recor ded electronicall y using the Leicester Cough Questionnaire LCQ (23). The L CQ is a 19 -item instrument that asks about the impact of chronic cough on various aspects of participants’ lives using a recall period of two weeks. The 8 items: 1, 2, 3, 9, 10,"

Further 4 items: 7, 8, 18 and 19 build the social domain. Study participants respond to the items using a 7 -point L ikert scale from 1 (all of the time) to 7 (none of the time) and will enter their assessments on a ta blet device during study visits according to the SoA or at earlier termination for those study participants discontinuing the study before completion. Completion of the L CQ takes approximately five minutes. The L CQ total score is calculated as a mean score for each of the three domains ranging from 1 to 7, with the L CQ total score ranging from 3 to 21. A clinically significant improvement in cough -specific quality of life (QoL), is indicated by a ≥1.3 -point increase in the L CQ total score from baseline (24). In this trial, the LCQ will assess key secondary and other efficacy endpoints. Scores from the LCQ will also be used to investigate ps ychometric properties of the SCCD. The L CQ version used in this trial is  2001. S. Birring, UK. 8.1.2.5 EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D- 5L will be filled in on the t ablet devi ceduring stud y visits according to the SoA or at earlier termination for those study participants discontinuing the study before completion. Completion of the EQ-5D- 5Ltakes approximately 3minutes. The EQ - 5D-5L is a self -administered generic and widely used measure of health status with well-documented reliability , validity and responsiveness in the general population as well as in various diseases. Use of this instrument will enable a comparison o f effects of RUCC on health- related quality of life with an age -matched normative sample. The instrument comprises 5 d imensions and an overall assessment of health status on a VAS. The 5 dimensions include: mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain and d iscomfort, and anxiety and depression where the scores 1 to 5 indicate: having no problems, having slight problems, having moderate problems, having severe problems and being unable to do/having extreme problems . In addition, patients are asked to self -rate their own health today on a vertical 0 -100 unit VA S, with 0 corresponding to ""the worst health y ou can imagine"", and 100 corresponding to ""the best health you can imagine"". Descriptive assessment will be done on the basis of the VAS and on dimension level assessment basis.

An y abnormal findings are to be recorded and reported as an AE/SAE (see Section 8.3.1). 8.2.2 Vital Signs Vital signs will be assessed at the site visits as specified in SoA table. This will include blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) measurements. BP will be measured b y using a standard sphy gmomanometer with an appropriate size cuff in the sitting positio n after 5 minutes of rest, in a quiet setting. Blood pressure measurements can be repeated once during the screening visit if medically justified (e.g. in order to avoid suspected “white -coat hypertension”.) 8.2.3 Electrocardiograms ECGs in supine position will be assessed locall y as safet y measures: standard electrocardiograms (12 -lead ECG) according to Gol dberger / Einthoven and Wilson will be recorded after resting for at least 5 minutes at Visit 1 (s creening) , Visit 6 (Day 84 ±2) and SFU visit, as outlined in the SoA . The following parameters will be recorded in the eCRF: VR, PR interval, QRS duration , QT interval ( corrected QT calculated according to the formulas of both Bazett and Fride ricia will be automatically calculated in Rave ). (1)Fridericia´s correction: QTc = QT/RR0.33 (2)Bazett´s correction: QTc = QT/RR0.5 All ECG printouts will be identified with the SID as well as the date and time of recording and will be attached to participant ´s file . ECG printouts must be reviewed and evaluated locally by the investi gator or clinicians with experience in ECG interpretation on the day of recording for safet y and quality . An overall investigator assessment of ECG will be provided (categories: “normal”, “abnormal, not clinicall y significant” and “abnormal, clinically significant”). All ECG findings will be reported in the e CRF and an y clinically relevant abnormality will be documented as an AE. 8.2.4 Spirometry (Lung Function T est) Lung function testing (spirometry ) will be conducted at Visit 1 (screening) in accordance with Guidelines from ATS/ERS Task Force ( 25), which is a standard method of the practice in pneumology .Available lung function testing results will be considered as baseline if they are not older than 3 months prior to screening."

The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study and after start of intervention in the AE section of the eCRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underly ing disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the p articipant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study or after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator. Participants in close liver observation should be followed up as described in Section 8.3.6. 6The follow ing FEF readouts during some fixed intervals will be recorded as part of the eCRF: Forced Expiratory Flow 25 -75% Forced Expiratory Flow 50%"

The name and address for the central laboratory service provider can be found in the documentation supplied by the vendor. Hematology and c hemistry tests are to be conducted every 4 weeks. Coagulation test s will be done every 4 weeks. Prothrombin time ( PT) (Quick and INR) will be determined using standard methods. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) will be measured via clotting assay . Quantitative reverse transcription poly merase chain reaction (qRT -PCR) for SARS -CoV -2 nucleic acid detection (or ophary ngeal swabs) and immunoassay for qualitative detection of IgG antibodies against SARS -CoV -2 antigen (serum) are to be performed at specified visits at the site (see Section 1.3for details). Since t here is no established clinical relevance linked to increased ATIII activity in medical literature , it is concluded that at this stage of development, the increase in ATIII activity can be considered as not clinically relevant. In addition, give nthe potential for un blinding participants receiving active treatment with BAY 1817080, the results of ATIII m easures at the other visits will not be communicated to study teams nor investigators until after unblinding of the stud y. In the event of implausible results, the laboratory may measure additional parameters to assess the quality of the sample (e.g., clo tted or hemoly zed) and to verify the results. The results from such additional anal yses may neither be included in the clinical database of this study nor evaluated further. If the results are relevant, the investigator will be informed to determine follow -up activities outside of this protocol. 8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Section 10.3. AE will be reported b y the participant (or, when appropriate, healthcare professional not involved in the study ) . The investigator and an y qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE . They remain responsible for following up S AEs, or AEs considered related to the study intervention or study procedures, orthose that caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention . 8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the follow-up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). A detailed history of symptoms and complications as a result of cough (t ype, onset, duration and time of resolution) will be recorded at screening via a series of questions reflected on an"
48,page_48,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 48of 84 individual eCRF page as part of the participant’s medical history . Worsening of any of the conditions listed on the aforementioned eCRF page or their first occurrence after signing the informed consent will be recorded as AEs. Additional details on smell and taste related AEs will be collected. All SAEs will be recorde d and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstances should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Section 10.3. The inve stigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AE or SAE after conclusion of the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, includin g a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. 8.3.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3 . Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open- ended and non leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. 8.3.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to f ollow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Section 10.3. 8.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a n SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards t he safet y of participants and the safet y of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y intervent ion under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority , Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safe ty report describing a nSAE or other specific safet y information (e . g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the IBand will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements."

If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor no later than 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Section 10.4. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e . g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs . 8.3.6 Liver- Related AEs Investigators and participants should be alerted regarding non-specific s ymptoms which may be associated with liver dysfunction, including anorexia, nausea, fatigue, right upper abdominal discomfort, vomiting, malaise, jaundice, fever, and rash. Information on these symptoms should be askedforin case of abnormal liver laboratory values (see Table 7–1 ) or any other suspicion of liver dy sfunction. The stud y participants should be reminded to contact the study site immediately , if they are concerned about such sy mptoms and unscheduled liver laboratory assessments should be considered. A ‘close observation’ has to be initiated in case of ALT or AST >3ULN after start of study intervention (seeTable 8–1) ( 26). Abnormal laboratory results and clinical signs and sy mptoms resulting in close liver observation (CLO) should be promptly reported as adverse event if an overarching diagnosis is not y et available . All events of ALT >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin >2 × ULN or ALT >3 × ULN and international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5, if INR measured which may indicate severe liver injury (possible Hy ’s Law), must be reported as an SAE . Close observation includes: Repeat serum chemistry panel (including serum transaminases [AST and ALT] and serum bilirubin) 2 to 3 times per week . Frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if laboratory abnormalities decrease and participant is as ymptomatic. Obtaining a more detailed history of the s ymptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. Obtaining a history of concomitant drug u se (including nonprescription medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets. Ruling out acute viral hepatitis; aut oimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); hy poxic/ischemic hepatology and biliary tract disease. This may require performing additional procedures, e.g., ultrasound examinations. If requested , test swill be done retrospectivel y using residual blood/serum samples collected at visits before laboratory abnormalities occurred. Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents. Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function as required, (e.g, international normalized ratio [I NR], direct bilirubin measurements)."

Mixed effects models, e.g. ,popPK models, describe the relationship between dose and time and variables such as drug plasma concentrations. Both structural and random effects are involved in this relationship. A preliminary popPK compartmental model will be further developed using the con centration of the drug as the dependent variable. The potential influence of relevant participant covariates (e.g., body weight) and optionally efficacy , PD biomarkers or safety laboratory parameter can be included in the PK/PD modeling using population ap proaches. A separate evaluation plan, providing details of the model building process and evaluation will be provided prior to the beginning of the popPK/PD analy sis. Results obtained by popPK/PD modeling will be presented in a separate report that may also include PKdata from other studies with BAY 1817080. The modeling anal yses might be started prior to database lock. If this is applicable, appropriate measures will be taken to maintain blinding of the stud y team, e.g., data will be stored separatel y, an d members of the study team will neither have access to the randomization list nor to individual data. Plasma concentration data for all participants will be listed in the clinical study report. 8.6 Pharmacodynamics See Section 8.5for details ."

Statistical Considerations 9.1 Statistical Hypotheses The primary endpoint for this study will be the change from baseline in 24 -hour cough count after 12 weeks of intervention .The primary efficacy aim is the detection of a trend in the dose relationship for the primary efficacy endpoint. For detecting an overall trend, or a dose - response sign al, each of the dose -response shapes in the candidate set will be tested, i.e. ,the null hy potheses: “The response at all doses is equal” will be tested against the alternative “There is a dose- response -relationship”. This will be done using a single contrast test based on contrast coefficients, taking the actual estimated effect per intervention group into account. For each of the   = 4 intervention groups (i.e. ,the placebo group and the 3 active intervention groups of BAY 1817080) the response is   ,  = 1,…,  . For each model  ,   = 1,…,4 , in the candidate set the null hy pothesis    :     = 0 will be tested against the respective 1 -sided alternative h ypothesis    :      > 0, where  = (   ,…,    )′is an optimized contrast vector for the doses ,   =(   ,…,     )′= (   (  ,   ),…,    (  ,   ))′and  is the dose -response model   =  ( , )+  . A more detailed description of the multiple comparison procedure modelling ( MCP -Mod ) approach and the models used will be given in Section 9.4. 9.2 Sample Size Determination Sample size calculations were performed for establishing evidence of a drug effect across the doses, that is, detecting a statistically significant dose response si gnal for the primary efficacy outcome in this study using the MCP -Mod approach. Treatment effects are here presented on the log scale of average hourl y counts, measured over 24 hours (see Section 9.4.2 for calculation details and interpretation). Assuming a true change in cough count under placebo after 12 weeks of -0.19 (17% reduction) , a maximum cough count change of -0.35 for BAY 1817080 over placebo (30%"
56,page_56,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 56of 84 reduction relative to placebo ), a common standard deviation of 0.8, a set of plausible dose - response shapes including Emax and sigmoidal Emax models (chosen based on BAY 1817080 effects in Study 18184 combined with literature review ), random allocati on of participants to dose groups according to a 1:1:1:1 ratio , a sample size of 50 participants per dose groups will have at least 85% power to demonstrate a dose -response relationship, using a one -sided test at a ty pe I error rate of α=0.10. Approximate ly 236 participants will be randomized to achieve 200 evaluable participants for an estimated total of 50 evaluable participants per intervention group. The number of participants to be randomized might be increased if more participants than expected becom e unevaluable due to COVID -19 related circumstances, to maintain the goal of 50 evaluable participants per intervention group. With this sample size, the dose -response curve is expected to be estimated with 80% confidence bands of half -widths of 0.14 to 0. 16, depending on the underl ying dose -response relationship. 9.3 Populations for Analyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: Population Description Enrolled All participants who sign the ICF Full analy sis set (FAS) All participants randomly assigned to study intervention . Safety analy sis set (SAF) All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and who take at least 1 dose of study intervention. Participants will be analyzed according to the intervention th ey actually received. Per protocol set (PPS) All participants randomly assigned to study intervention , who have no validity findings affecting efficacy . Further details will be specified in the SAP, ACIR and the BRR . Abbreviations: ACIR = Assessment Criteria and Identification Requirement ; BRR = Blind Review Report ; ICF = informed consent form; SAP = statistical analysis plan The efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the PPS, with analy ses on the FAS serving as sensitivity anal yses. The safet y end points will be analy zed using the SAF. 9.4 Statistical Analyses 9.4.1 General considerations The statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized before unblinding of the database and will describe the participant populations to be included in the an alyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. It will provide further details on the planned analy sis for all efficacy , safety and other endpoints. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analy ses with focus on the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. The statistical anal yses will be performed using SAS; the version used will be specified in the SAP. There will be separate anal ysis plan for psy chometric properties, scoring and assessment of SCCD."
57,page_57,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 57of 84 Continuous variables will be anal yzed using at least the following descriptive statistics: number of non -missing observations, arithmetic mean and standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Discrete data will be analy zed using frequency tables. The primary efficacy analy sis is based on a while on treatment estimand strategy . The goal is to estimate the effect of the intervention in those participants who tolerate the intervention , adhere to the intervention schedule and follow all relevant protoc ol procedures. The anal ysis will be performed on the PPS population. The primary variable will be the change from baseline in 24 -hour cough count after 12 weeks of intervention. The intercurrent events “discontinuation of study intervention ” and “non -compl iance with study intervention” will be handled with the while on treatment strategy , and for participants experiencing such an event, the last observation of the endpoint prior to the event will be carried forward. Participants with intercurrent events tha t lead to exclusion from the PPS will be excluded from the analysis.Handling of intercurrent events related to COVID- 19 will be described in the SAP. Other intercurrent events will be disregarded. The population -level summary will be the estimated mean of change from baseline in the logarithm of average hourly cough count by intervention group . 9.4.2 Primary Endpoints The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in 24h cough count after 12 weeks of intervention . Baseline is defined as the measuremen t at Visit 2. The raw 24h cough count will be standardized to an average hourl y count, and then log-transformed for the analy sis due to the expected range and distribution of the data. After a pplying a log -transformation, the data are expected to be normal ly distributed. The primary anal ysis will be performed on participants in the PPS who have valid cough count measurements both at baseline and at least one post -baseline measurement. Supporting analyses will be performed on the FAS . Further sensitivity analyses will be specified in the SAP. The MCP -Mod method combining MCP (multiple comparison procedures) principles with modeling techniques will be used for the primary statistical analy sis. This method allows the flexibility of modeling for dose estimat ion, while preserving the robustness to model misspecification associated with MCP procedures. 3 active doses of BAY 1817080 will be used in this study : 25mg, 75mg, and 150 mgBID, with an additional placebo arm, corresponding to a 0 mg dose. The measure ment of the primary efficacy endpoint at dose  will be a normally distributed variable   , i.e.,the change from baseline in log (average hourl y cough count). For the dose -response relationship we assume   =  ( , )+  . It is assumed that the change from baseline after 12 weeks of intervention is -0.19 under placebo and -0.54 at the maximum possible dose. The candidate set of models for  ( , ) consists of four models, two Emax models with parameter     = 30 and     = 50 and two sigmoidal model s with the parameters     =30 and     = 3, and     =60 and     = 5. All these candidate models assume a monotonically decreasing dose -response. The parameters of the models are based on Phase 2a data and literature review. The dose -response candidate models are shown in Table 9–1."

Figure 9–1: Candidate Set of Dose Response Curves Based on these models and the observed data optimal contrasts   and the corresponding critical value will be calculated. A more detailed description will be provided in the SAP. Based on the optimal contrast and the critical values a one- sided test with   = 0.1 based on the maximum value of the test statistics for the models in the candidate s et will be performed. The MCP -Mod method takes multiplicity into account , and t hus no further multiplicity adjustments have to be performed. If at least one contrast test is statistically significant, then a dose -response signal is considered to be established. The best model can be selected out of the statistically significant models in the candidate set for the next step: modeling and estimation. The selection of the dose - estimation model will be based on an assessment of the p value. If no candi date model is statistically significant, the procedure stops indicating that a dose -response relationship cannot be established from the observed data."

AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) a ssociated with the use of study intervention (for definition of study intervention, see Section 6). Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (e .g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/sel f-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. “Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil t he definition of an AE or SAE."
67,page_67,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 67of 84 Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure (e .g., endoscopy , appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 10.3.2 Definition of SAE An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: Results in death a.Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. b.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitaliz ation are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for electi ve treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. c.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e .g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. d.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect"
68,page_68,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 68of 84 e.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important m edical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These e vents should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 10.3.3 Recording and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE AE and SAE Recording When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e .g., hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF. It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE eCRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y sponsor . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant num ber, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to sponsor. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a nSAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe."
69,page_69,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 69of 84 Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the rel ationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will als o consult the IB and/or Product I nformation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be si tuations in which an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to sponsor. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial t ransmission of the SAE data to sponsor. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by sponsor to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the investigator will provide sponsor with a copy of any post mortem findings (autopsy report). New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. The investiga tor will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 10.3.4 R eporting of SAEs SAE Reporting to sponsor via an Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to sponsor will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours."
70,page_70,"CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Study Protocol Global Amendment 2 BAY 1817080 / 20393 28 APR 2021 Page: 70of 84 The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section). Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Site File. SAE Reporting to the Sponsor via Paper CRF Electronic data transmission of the SAE is the preferred method to transmit this information to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department In rare circumstances and in the absence of email, notification by telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the SAE CRFs within the designated reporting time frames Paper SAE forms (CRFs), details and contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Site File"

If fertility is unclear (e .g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cy cle cannot be confirmed be fore first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP 1.Premenarchal 2.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: Documented h ysterectomy Documented bilateral salpingect omy Documented bilateral oophorectom y For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (e .g., Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity ), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry. Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 3. P ostmenopausal female A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an altern ative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therap y (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH measurement is required. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use acceptable effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study .Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before stud y enrollment. Contraception Guidance: (See also the Inclusion Criteria in Section 5.1.) Acceptable effective birth control methods which may not be considered as highly effective (as per CTFG guidelines): Acceptable effective birth control methods that result in a failure rate of more than 1% per yearinclude: progestogen e-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not theprimary mode of action"

This applies onl y to male participants who have receive d at least one dose of study intervention. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directl y, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the sponsor as being aware of the partner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. 7A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods . 8Vasectomiz ed partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial par ticipant and that the vasectomiz ed partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success. 9Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the stud y interventions .The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant."

The complaint may or may not represent a potential risk to the partic ipant . Any malfunction or failure of the cough recording device (VitaloJAKTM) including use errors or inadequacy in the labeling will be recorded b y the clinical/investigational site, including all relevant device information, and reported directl y to the manufacturer. There are three different situations, in which a PTC might need to be reported by the investigator. a.When an AE is recorded, the investigator needs to check if a device assigned and worn by the corresponding pa rticipant operates as intended . b.When a device malfunction or device failure occurs, the investigator needs to assess whether an AE might have occurred in relation to the device complaint. c.When a device malfunction, device failure, or use error occurs, without any associated AE, this al so needs to be captured in the form, especiall y if it classifies as a reportable incident, and immediately forwarded to the sponsor for PTC investigation. There are three different categories of medical device related events Incident Any malfunction or de terioration in the characteristics and / or performance of a device, as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectl y, led, might lead to or might have led to the death of a participant , or user or of othe r persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. Other reportable incident Any incident that did not lead to death or serious deterioration in health, but it might do if it occurred again under less fortunate circumstances or without inter vention of healthcare personnel. This may include cases without any medical event reported. Non-incident Any device related case that does not fulfill all the three basic incident criteria a -c listed in the definition of an “i ncident” above. This includes reports of: Deficiencies of a device which are alway s detected prior to its use Event is caused b y the participant ’s condition Service life or shelf life of the device is expired Events which did not lead to serious deterioration in state of health or deat h, because a design feature protected against a fault becoming a hazard. Events where the risk of a death or serious deterioration in state of health has been quantified and found to be negligibl y small.

Overall Rationale for the Amendment: The main purpose of this global amendment is to address COVID -19 pandemic related issues. Changes include additional benefit risk assessments, exclusion criteria as well as COVID -19 testing for participants. The discontinuation criteria was also modified to explain how to manage participants who get infected with COVID- 19 while on study . Other changes have also been made in this global amendment. Following are the description of change and a brief rationale. These changes do not affect t he design or the overall concept of the stud y. Section # and NameDescription of Change Brief Rationale 1.3 Schedule of Activities (SoA), 8.2.5 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments and 10.2 Appendix 2: Clinical Laboratory TestsCOVID -19 testing was added. Survival status check was added for participants who do not show up at the safety follow -up visit.To address issues related to the COVID -19 pandemic. 2.3 Benefit/Risk AssessmentA new Section 2.3.3.7 Risk of contracting SARS -CoV-2 infection during study participation was added. 5.2 Exclusion Criteria COVID -19 related exclusion criteria #18 was added. 7.1.1 Rechallenge Criteria for rechallenge was added. 7.2 Participant Discontinuation/W ithdrawal from the StudyWithdrawal from study criteria added to clarify what to do if a participant becomes SARS -CoV-2 virus RNA positive while on study. 9.2 Sample Size Determination and 9.4.1 General considerationsStatistical considerations adjusted for COVID -19 related issues. 1.3 SoA, 5.2 Exclusion Criteria, and 8.2.2 Vital SignsExclusion criteria #11 was modified to exclude participants with systolic/diastolic blood pressure levels ≥160/100 mmHg at the screening visit.To align with the local amendment for Czechia (to satisfy the request from Czech ia Health Authority, State Institute for Drug Control [SUKL])."
