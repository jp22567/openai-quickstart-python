The neutralizing activit y of mirikizumab binds to the p19 subunit of the IL -23 m olecule and does not bind IL -12. Study I6T-MC-AMAJ (AMAJ) is a confirmatory study testing mirikizumab as a treatment for plaque psoriasis and is intended to support registration of this indication. This Phase 3 trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of mirikizumab versus secukinum ab and pl acebo, as measured by improvement in disease severit y and key patient -reported outcomes, and will contribute to the evaluat ion of the safet y of mirikizumab .

The study design includes 2 treatm entperiods (Induction andMaintenance), which together last for up to 52 weeks, fo llowed by a 12-week Post-Treatment Follow -Upperiod. The study popul ation consists of male or female patients aged 18 years or older at the time of screening who have chronic plaque psori asis based on a confirmed diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis fo r at least 6 months, are candidates for phototherapy and/or sy stemic therapy , and have 10% body surface area (BSA) involvement, a static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 3, and a Psori asis Area and Severit y Index (PASI) score 12 at screening and at baseline. Treatment Arms and Duration: At Visit 2 (Week 0 , baseline), patients who meet the study eligibilit y criteria will be rando mly assigned to their induct ion and m aintenance treatments with stratificat ion based on previous exposure to bio logic therapy (yes/no), body weight (<100 kg or 100 kg), and geographic region (North America, Europe, or Oth er). The treatment groups in the Blinded Induction Period are 250 m g mirikizumab or matching placebo (SC) administered at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 ,and 300mg secukinumab administered at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 . Patients who were randomly assigned at baseline to receive mirikizumab in the Blinded Induct ion Peri od were al so randomly assigned to receive either 250 mgmirikizumab every 8weeks ( Q8W )subcutaneous ( SC)or 125mg mirikizumab Q8W SCin the Blinded Mainte nance Period, with maintenance dosing starting at Week 16 and ending at Week 48 . Patients who were randomized to placebo in the Blinded Induct ion Peri od will receive 250 mg mirikizumab SC every 4 weeks (Q4W) for Weeks 16 through 32 and 250 mg mirikizumab Q8W thereafter . Patients who were randomized to 300 mg secukinumab SC in the Blinded Induct ion Period will cont inue this treatment with Q4W dosing in the Blinded Maintenance Period, starting at Week 16 and ending at Week 48 . Throughout the study , pati ents will receive placebo, as appropriate, to maintain the study blind across treatment groups . The durati on of treatm ent periods is 52 weeks . The total durati on of parti cipat ion in this study may be up to 68 weeks as detailed below . Screening Period: Up to 4 weeks . Treatment Period: Approximately 52 weeks. Post-Treatment Follow -up Period: Approximately 12 weeks after the l ast vi sit for pati ents who discont inue treatment prior to the Week 52 assessment or who are unable or not willing to participate in the long-term extensio n study (I6T -MC-AMAH).

13,page_13,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 13 LY3074828Randomized: 1443 Com pleted: 1152 Statistical Analysis: Approximately 1443 patients will be rando mized at a 4:4:4:1 ratio in the Blinded Induct ion Period to receive 250 mg mirikizumab SC at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12, then 250 mg mirikizumab SC Q8W, 250 mg mirikizumab SC at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and12, then 125 mg mirikizumab SC Q8W, 300 m g secukinumab at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, followed by 300 m g secukinumab Q4W, or placebo . Stratified blo ck rando mizat ionwill be perfo rmed wi th the f ollowing stratificat ion factors: previous exposure to bio logic therapy (yes/no), body weight (<100 kg or 100 kg), and geographi c regi on (North Ameri ca, Europe or Other) . With 888 patients in the mirikizumab group and 111 patients in the placebo group, the estimated power isat least 99% totest superi ority of mirikizum abto placebo on PASI 90 at Week 16, and on sPGA (0,1) at Week 16 ,respectively ,at alpha of 0.05 two -sided. With 888 patients in the mirikizumab group and 444 patients in the secukinum abgroup , the estimated power is at least 90% totest noninferiorit y of mirikizumab to secukinumab at alpha of 0.025 one -sided wi th a noninferiorit y margin o f 10% on PASI 90 at Week 16 and on sPGA (0,1) at Week 16. The assumed PASI 90 responses are 70% for the mirikizum ab arm, 70% for the secukinumab arm, and 3% for the placebo arm. The assumed sPGA 0 or 1 responses are 70% for the mirikizumab arm,70% for the secukinumab arm, and 5% for the placebo arm. Both PASI 90 and sPGA (0,1) rates at Week 52 are estimated to be 75% for both mirikizumab dose groups, and 65% for secukinumab group . In addit ion, wi th 444 patients in the 250 m g mirikizum abQ8W group, 444 patients in 125 m g mirikizumab Q8W group, and 444 patients in the secukinumab group, the study will have an estimated power of 90% to test superiorit y of 250 mg mirikizumab Q8W com pared to secukinumab at alpha of 0.05 two -sided on PASI 90 at Week 52 and sPGA (0,1) at Week 52 , respectively , as well as 90% power to test superiorit y of 125 m g mirikizumab Q8W com pared to secukinumab at alpha of 0.05 two -sided on PASI 90 at Week 52 and sPGA (0,1) at Week 52, respectively . For assessments of the primary and major secondary endpo ints and other categorical efficacy and healt h outcom e endpo ints, the Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) test along wit h Non - Responder Imputation (NRI) will be used to com pare the treatm ent groups. The CMH stratificat ion factors will be the same as those used in the stratified rando mization scheme. The CMH p -value will be provided. In addit ion, the treatment difference in proportions will be provi ded along wi th the 95% 2 -sided confidence interval est imate. The prespecified graphical mult iple testing approach (Bretz et al. 2011) will be implemented to control the overall Ty pe I error rate at 2 -sided alpha of 0.05, f or superi ority tests and at 1 -sided alpha of 0.025 for non -inferiorit y tests, for the hypotheses for the primary and maj or secondary endpo ints.

23,page_23,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 23 LY30748283.Introduction 3.1. Study Rationale Mirikizumab (LY3074828 )is a monoclonal, anti -interl eukin -23 (anti -IL-23) ant ibody being developed for the treatment of immune -mediated diseases where the IL -23 pathway is thought to have a sig nificant pathogenic role. The neutralizing activit y of mirikizumab binds to the p19 subunit of the IL -23 m olecule and does not bind IL -12. Study I6T-MC-AMAJ (AMAJ) is a confirmatory study testing mirikizumab as a treatment for plaque psoriasis and is intended to support registration of this indication. This Phase 3 trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of mirikizumab versus secukinumab and pl acebo, as measured by im provement in disease severit y and key patient -reported outcomes .The data will contribute to the evaluation of the safet y of mirikizumab . 3.2. Background The worl dwide prevalence of psoriasis is nearly 3% (IFPA 201 7), with rates varying across ethnic groups, ages, gender, and geographic regio ns (Parisi et al. 2013). Histologically, psoriasis is characterized by inflammatory infiltrate and hyperproliferat ive keratinocytes, which retain intact nuclei (parakeratosis), elongat ion of rete ri dges, and hyperconvo luted vasculature in the papillary dermis. The infiltrate consists of prominent T cells, dendrit ic cells, and neutrophils in the dermis. The dysregulation o f the immune system, especially the activat ion of pathogenic T cells, has been well dem onstrated to pl ay an important rol e in psori asis devel opment. A typical organ -specific, T -cell-driven inflammatory disease, psori asis had been considered a Thelper (Th) 1- type skin disease for decades ,until a new Th populat ion, Th17, was identifi ed (Lew et al . 2004; Steinman 2007; Weaver et al. 2007). Substantial clinical and basic research observat ions now suggest that the IL -23/Th17 axis is essential in the pathogenesis of psoriasis (Di Cesare et al. 2009). IL-23, a member of the IL -12 family of cytokines, i s a heterodimeric protein comprised of 2 subunits; the p40 subunit, which it shares with IL -12, and the p19 subunit, believed to be specific to IL -23. IL-23 is produced by antigen-present ing cells, such as dendrit ic cells and macrophages, a nd pl ays an important rol e in maintenance and amplificat ion of Th17 cells (Lee et al. 2004; Piskin et al. 2004). In addit ion, Th17 cells and their downstream effector m olecules, including IL- 17A, IL -17F, IL -21, IL -22, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - alpha, are found at increased levels in human psoriatic skin lesio ns and circulat ion (Boniface et al. 2007; Lowes et al. 2008; Caruso et al. 2009; Kagami et al. 2010 ). A number of IL- 23 targeting mo lecules are being investigated for the treatment of immune- mediated di seases. The first bio logic to dem onstrate clinical benefit through IL -23 inhibit ion in such di seases was ustekinumab, which is a monoclonal ant ibody approv ed by the Uni ted States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ( Stelara®package insert 2017 ) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA ) (Stelara Summary of Product Characteri stics 2017) for the treatment of psori asis, psori atic arthrit is, and Crohn’s disease and is being evaluated in a Phase 3 trial for the treatment of ulcerat ive co litis (NCT02407236). Ustekinumab binds the p40 subunit co mmo n to IL -12 and IL -23; therefore, it targets both cy tokines rather than IL -23 specifically. Blockade of the IL -12 pathway may prevent Th1 cell –induced interferon blockade of Th17 cell"
24,page_24,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 24 LY3074828development, thus potentially limit ing the clinical activit y of p40 targeting ant ibodies. Experimental studies suggest that blocking the IL-23/Th17/IL- 17 immune axis alo ne is sufficient to trea t autoimmune inflammat ion (Montel eone et al. 2009). One such therapy that specifically target sthe p19 subunit of IL -23, gusel kumab, has been approved for treatment of moderate -to- severe plaque psoriasis by the United States FDA (TremfyaTMpackage insert 2017) and the EMA (Tremfya Summary of Product Characteristics 2017). Other similar a gents , including mirikizumab in Studi esI6T-MC-AMAA (AMAA ) and I6T -MC-AMAF (AMAF) ,have demonstrated clinical act ivity in plaque psoriasis (Krueger et al. 2015; Papp et al. 2015, 2017; Reich et al. 2017 b). 3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment Psori asis remains an important public healt h challenge. Therefore, there is a cont inuing need to develop treatment options wit h mechanisms of act ion that differ fro m existing therapies. Clinical data wi th mirikizumab (Studi es AMAA and AMAF ), as well as clinical data with ustekinumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab, and guselkumab, support the hypothesis that IL -23 pl ays a significant rol e in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, a nd these co mpounds appear to have a favorable benefit/risk profile in pat ients with psori asis. To assess the nonclinical toxicit y of mirikizumab and establish a margin of safet y(MOS) for clinical studies, 4 -week and 6 -month general toxicity studi es in n ormal cyno molgus m onkeys were conducted with evaluat ion of immunotoxicit y, toxi cokinet ics, safet y pharmaco logy (as part of the 4 -week study ), and fertilit y (as part of the 6 -month study ). The weekly administration of mirikizumab to cynom olgus m onkeys resu lted in no adverse mirikizumab -related findings at doses of 0 mg/kg (vehicle), 1 and 30 mg/kg (SC), or 100 mg/kg ( intravenous [ IV]) for 4 weeks, or at doses of 0, 10, and 100 mg/kg (SC) for 6 months. Based on the lack of any toxicit y at exposures exceedin g the highest clinical exposure and lack of any tissue cross -reactivit y, the nonclinical safet y profile of mirikizumab supports clinical development of mirikizumab . Plasma exposure in monkeys at the no-observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL )in the 4 -week a nd 6- month studies provi ded a 52-and 22-fold margin of safet y, respectively, relat ive to the predicted human exposure at the highest proposed clinical dose and frequency o f 250 m g administered SC every 4 weeks. After 16 weeks of treatment in Study AMAF, Psoriasis Area and Severit y Index (PASI) 90 responses in all mirikizumab treatment arms were significant ly higher than placebo, with the highest responses in the 100 -mg and 300 -mg dosing groups. Overall frequencies of adverse events (AEs) were simil ar for mi rikizumab -and placebo -treated pati ents (Reich et al . 2017 b). The dose sand regimens planned for Study AMAJ were selected based on analyses of pharmacokinet ic (PK), safet y, and efficacy data f rom Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, literature inform ationfor other anti -IL-23 antibodi es, and nonclinical safet y data. In addit ion, blinded trial-level safet y reviews will be conducted at periodic intervals throughout the study . Interim safet y analyses will be conducted by an external Data Moni toring Committe e (DMC) to review unblinded safet y data. These monitoring and risk -mitigation actions, along with regular review"
25,page_25,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 25 LY3074828of AEs and l aboratory data, will assist in the evaluation and management of potential risks associ ated wi th mirikizumab administration. Given the published literature supporting posit ive clinical act ivity following blocking IL -23 in autoimmune/inflammatory diseases including psoriasis, the favorable safet y and PK profile of mirikizumab , and the ini tial clinical activi ty observed for mirikizumab in subjects with psoriasis, the potenti al benefi ts of participat ing in Study AMAJ are expected to outweigh the potential risks. More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) and reasonably ant icipated AEs of mirikizumab are to be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB)."

Number of Participants Approximately 1872 participants will be screened to achieve 1443 rando mized participants for an est imated total of 888 participants randomized to mirikizumab , 444 randomized to secukinumab ,and 111 rando mized to placebo. 5.3. End of Study Definition End of the study is the date o f the last visit or last scheduled procedure for the last patient. 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will examine the effect of mirikizumab versus placebo and versus an act ive comparator (secukinumab) in pat ients with moderate -to-severe plaque psori asis. Secukinumab was chosen as the active -comparator as i t: is a bio logic inhibi tor of IL-17,which has been shown to be a primary effector mo lecule in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis. Current ly,IL-17 inhibitors are the most effective biologic systemic therapies approved for the treatment of moderate -to-severe psori asis. has demonstrated effect iveness in the treatment of moderate -to-severe psori asis and is approved for the treatment of adults with moderate -to-severe plaque psori asis. has an established safet y profile Thus, secukinumab has been selected as an appropriate active comparator for a direct comparison of efficacy of mirikizumab against a well -established bio logic standard of care during a 52-week treatment period. The 300-mg secukinumab dose administered at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks is the approved dose regimen for adul t patients with moderate -to-severe psori asis (Cosent yx®Summary of Product Characterist ics2017 ; Cosent yx® [secukinumab ] package insert 2018). During the Induction Dosing Period (Period 2), 250 mg mirikizumab will be com pared to 300 mgsecukinumab and pl acebo. During the Maintenance Dosing Period (Period 3), 2 dose regimens ,250 m g and 125 m g,of mirikizumab will be compared to 300 mgsecukinumab . All treatm ent groups are detailed in Section 7.1, with the dose j ustificat ion outlined in Sect ion 5.5. The study will not use a placebo -to-match for secukinumab. The study blind will bemaintained as described in Sect ion 7.3using designated Unblind ed Si te Personnel to administer study inject ions,and by using physical means of shielding the investigational product from the patients’ view as detailed in Section 7.1. The Induct ion Dosing Peri od (Peri od 2) i s desi gned to com pare efficacy and safet y of mirikizumab versus secukinumab and versus placebo in pat ients with psori asis. The select ion of placebo as a com parator i s just ified on the basis that the most robust evaluat ion of effi cacy can be made versus placebo treatment, to provide clear evidence on assay sensit ivity, and to concl ude non -inferiorit y of the test treatm ent to the active control by showing that the test treatment preserves a certain predetermined percentage of effect over pl acebo relative to the effect over"
33,page_33,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 33 LY3074828placebo dem onstrated by the active control ( FDA 2016 ). The duration of the 16-week primary evaluat ion is sufficient ly short that patients will receive placebo without lasting adverse effects. The efficacy of mirikizumab in treating psori asis will be measured by the sPGA and PASI response scales, with the primary efficacy endpo int at Week 16. These measures and the 16- week endpo int are in alignment with efficacy endpoints for currently approved psori asis therapi es and wi th regulatory guidance (EMA 2004). Steady -state exposure i s expected to be reached withinthe 16-week time period(median half -life [t ½] of mirikizumab is 10.5 days), and it is ant icipated that a significant clinical effect will be observed within this t imeframe based on previous studies with mirikizumab in pat ients with psori asis. The Maintenance Dosing Period (Period 3) is designed to evaluate the maintenanc e ofresponse with 2 different dose regimens of mirikizumab (250 m g and 125 m g,Q8W )as co mpared to the comparator (300 mg secukinumab , Q4W), as well as assessment of safet y data fo llowing at l east 1 year of treatment with mirikizumab . The Post -Treatment F ollow -Up Peri od (Peri od 4) is included for safet y monitoring fo llowing the last study visitfor pati ents who do not enroll in Study AMAH or di scont inue early from Study AMA J. 5.5. Justification for Dose The dose levels and regimens selected for this study were based primarily on analyses of interim PK, safet y, and efficacy data f rom the Phase 2 Study AMAF , safet y data fro m other clinical studi esevaluat ing mirikizumab ,and nonclinical safet y data. Safety Considerations Single doses of up to 6 00 mg IV were evaluated in Study AMAA (healt hy subjects and psoriasis patients) and up to 1200 mg IV in Study AMAD (healt hy subjects); no dose -related safet y or tolerabilit y issues were observed in eit her study . Evaluat ion of the safet y data available to date in the ongo ing Phase 2 studi es in ulcerat ive colit is patients (Study I6T-MC-AMAC) and in Crohn’s disease patients (Study I6T-MC-AMAG) that are evaluating higher and more frequent dose regimens o f up to 1000 mg IV Q4W for up to 52 weeks has not reveale d any difference in the safet y profile resul ting fro m these hi gher exposures . The m argin o f safet y for the 250 mg Q4W SC induction dose regimen proposed for this study relative to the NOAEL level in the 6 -month nonclinical toxicology study in cyno molgus monkeys is 22, based on area under the plasma concentration versus time curve. No dose -related safet y or tol erabili ty issues have been observed in Study AMAF, including in patients who were non -responders and received a third dose of 300 mg SC at Week 16. Although the proposed 250 mg Q4W induct ion dose regimen for this study is expected to produce m odestly higher average concentrati ons than the highest dose regimen evaluated in Study AMAF, the safet y data collected in completed and ongoing clinical studies a nd fro m nonclinical toxicology studi es supports the proposed dose regimens."
34,page_34,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 34 LY3074828Efficacy Considerations In Study AMAF, doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg,administered Q8W SC,provided significant efficacy relative to pl acebo, wi th 100 and 300 mg achieving greater efficacy than 30 mgat Week 16. The 300 mg dose provided the highest efficacy for the primary endpoint at Week 16 (PASI 90)anddemonstrated a trend towards providing higher PASI 90 and PASI 100 rates at earlier time points ; the 300 mg dose also provided a more durabl e response fo llowing Week 16. Thus, results from Study AMAF indicate that the highest dose ( 300mg)provi ded the greatest efficacy . Results fro m Study AMAF also suggest that additional dosing, if given during the Induct ion Period, mi ght have further improved efficacy at Week 16. This suggest ion is based on incremental benefit s observed fo llowing a thi rd dose administered to Week 16 nonresponders when assessed wit hin 4 week to 8 weeks of that dose. Model -based analyses and simulat ions indicat e that 250 mg doses administered at Weeks 0, 4 , 8,and 12 (1000 mg total) will maximize efficacy at the end of the 16 -week Induction Period. A dosing regimen of 250 mg SC Q8W during the Maintenance Period is expected to maintain or further enhance the efficacy achieved at the end of the Induction Period. The 250 mg dose is expected to achieve exposures and efficacy that are not di stinguishable from that observed with 300 m g dosing. A second maintenance dosing regimen of 125 m gQ8W SC was chosen to deter mine whether efficacy could be maintained on a lower dosing regimen. This second dosing regimen is expected to result in mirikizumab concentrati ons that have, in individual subjects, minimal overlap with the concentrations produced with the 250 mg mirikizumab Q8W SC regimen. Formulation Considerations A 125 m g/mL concentrati on was selected to provide the maximum amount of mirikizumab that could be delivered a s asingle subcutaneous inject ion (that is, 2 mL). Therefore, a 2 mL dose of mirikizumab (delivered ei ther as two 1 -mL inject ions or a single 2- mL inject ion) woul d deliver 250 m g of mirikizumab , which i s comparable to the 300 -mg dose that was evaluated in the Phase 2 Study, AMAF. The 125 -mg dose will be del ivered as a single 1 -mL SC; this do se is comparable to the 100 -mg dose evaluated in Study AMAF. Therefore, based on all the available clinical and non -clinical data, the dose regimen splanned for this study areexpected to provide an acceptable safet y profile while provi ding maximum clinica l response in pat ients with plaque psori asis."

Lilly will not provi dea placebo to m atch secukinumab. Therefore, in order to maintain the blind of this study , designated Unblinded Site Personnel will be responsible for dispensing of all investigat ional products ( mirikizumab , secukinumab, and respective placebo). Unblinded Site Personnel will be responsible for administering th e doses and maintaining the blind o f the pati ent during the scheduled inject ions.This will be accomplished by physical means of shielding the investigat ional product from the patient’s view. Designated Unblinded Site Personnel will not be involved in an y clinical aspects of the study , including clinical evaluat ions and AE assessments .During study drug preparation or administration, blinded persons will not be admitted to areas where study drug is being prepared or administered. All study site personne l will be trained on the necessit y to maintain the blind throughout the study . 7.1.1. Packaging and Labeling Mirikizumab , placebo ,and secukinumab will be supplied to the invest igator by Lilly. Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the country ’s regul atory requi rements. All investigat ional products will be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and returned or destroyed according to applicable regulat ions. Clinical trial materials are manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices(GMP) . Invest igational product will be supplied as single -use, sol ution pre -filled syringes containing mirikizumab , secukinumab, or placebo. The 1 -mL sy ringe of mirikizumab is manufactured to contain 125 mg. The 1 -mL syringe o f secukinumab is manufactured to contain 150 mg. Mirikizumab cannot be di stinguished visually from placebo. Invest igational product will be provided wit h study -specific labels. Syringes will be supplied in cartons, with the appropriate quantit y specific to the pl anned dispensing schedule of the investigat ional product. 7.2. Method of Treatment Assignment Patients who m eet all cri teria for enrollment will be randomize d to double -blind treatment at Visit 2. Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a computer -generated random sequence using an interactive web -response system (IWRS). The IWRS will be used to assign prefilled syringes containing double -blind invest igational product to each patient. Invest igational product will be dispensed according to the Schedule of Activit ies (Secti on 2)for treatm ent of patients in the clinic. Site personnel will confirm that they have l ocated the correct carton(s) of pre -filled syringes by entering a confirmat ion number found on the carton(s) into the IWRS. 7.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses Study visit s at whi ch invest igational product is administered are preferred, if possible, to occur on the same day of the week. In any case, the study visits should occur wi thin the visit window"

The actual time o f all dos e administrations will be recorded in the subject’s electroni c case report form ( eCRF). 7.3. Blinding This is a double -blind study . The blinding applies to patients, site personnel, and Sponsor personnel. To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly and si te personnel will see the rando mizat ion table and treatment assignment s before the study is complete. Emergency unblinding for AEs m ay be perform ed through the IWRS . This option may beused ONLY if the patient’swell-being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment. All actions resul ting in an unblinding event are recorded and reported by the IWRS . If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is u nblinded, the patient must be discont inued fro m the study . In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient remain in the study , the investigator must obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly -designated medical mo nitorfor the patient to continue in the study . In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment is warranted for medical management of the event. The patientsafet y must always be the first considerat ion in making such a determinat ion. If a patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, it is the responsibilit y of the investi gator to prom ptly docum ent the deci sion and rati onale and notify Lilly as soon as possible. 7.4. Dosage Modification Dose adjust ments are not permitted in this study . 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for the fo llowing: Confirming that appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transi t for all study treatm ent received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study treatm ent. Ensuring that only participants enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authori zed si te staff may supply or administer study treatm ent. All study treatm ents m ust be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and m onitored (manual or autom ated) area i n accordance with the labeled storage condit ions with access limited to authorized site staff. The invest igator, institution, or the head of the medical inst itution (where applicable) is responsible for study treatm ent accountabilit y, reconciliat ion, and record m aintenance (such as re ceipt, reconciliat ion and final disposit ion records).

Treatment Compliance All doses o f study medicat ion will be administered at the study site by si te personnel. Deviat ions from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded in the eCRF. Every attem pt will be m ade to sel ect pati ents who have the abilit y to understand and co mply with study instructi ons. The invest igator is responsible for discussing methods to ensure high treatm ent com pliance wi th the pati ent before randomizat ion. If apatient i s nonco mpliant with study procedures and/or invest igational product administratio n, the invest igator should assess the patient to determine the reason for noncompliance and educate and/or manage the patient ,as appropriate ,to improve co mpliance. Overall compliance wit h therapy is defined to be missing no more than 20% of the expected doses within the protocol - defined visit window and not missing 2 consecut ive doses. If, in consultation wit h Lilly or its designee, the nonco mpliance is deemed to be significant or if further nonco mpliance occurs, the patient may be discont inued fro m thestudy . 7.7. Concomitant Therapy All conco mitant m edicat ions taken during the study must be recorded on the Concomitant Medicat ion eCRF. All patients should maintain their usual medication regimens for concomitant condi tions or di seases throughout the study unless those m edicat ions are specifically excluded in the protocol. Patients taking concomitant medicat ions should be on stable dosages a t the time of baseline and shoul d remain at stabl e dosages throughout the study unless changes need to be made because of AEs. Addit ional systemic drugs are to be avoided during the study , unless requi red to treat AEs. If the need for concomitant medicat ion arises for an AE or for appropriate medical management (including the limited use of therapeut ic agents which, if used under treatment regimens other than for treating an AE or for appropriate medical management, might be considered psoriasis therapi es), the invest igator should base decisio ns on the patient and clinical factors. Other medicat ions m ay be allowed if they are approved by the Sponsor or i ts desi gnee.

Certain samples m ay be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory certificati on standards. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessments The primary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of patients with an sPGA (0,1) with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16 and the proportion of pat ients achieving a 90% improvement in PASI from baseline (PASI 90) at Week 16. 9.1.1.1. Static Phy sician’s Global Assessment The sPGA is the physician’s glo bal assessment of the pat ient’s psoriasislesio ns at a given t ime point (EMA 2004). Plaques are assessed for induration, ery thema, and scaling, and an overall rating of psoriasis severit y is given using the anchors of clear (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or very severe (5). 9.1.1.2. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index The PASI is an accepted primary efficacy measurement for thi s phase of development of psori asis treatm ents (EMA 2004). The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body -surface involvement in 4 anatomical regio ns (head, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severit y of scaling, redness, and plaque indurat ion/infiltrat ion (thickness) in each region, yielding an overall score of 0for no psoriasis to 72 f or the m ost severe disease (Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978). The PASI has been the most frequent ly used endpoint and measure of psoriasis severit y in clinical trials (EMA 2004; Menter et al. 2008). A clinically meaningful respon se is a PASI 75, which represents at least a 75% decrease (improvement) from the baseline PASI score. Higher levels o f clearance (PASI 90), as well as complete resolut ion of psori asis (PASI 100), have beco me additional endpoints because of the increasing recogni tion of the associ ation of higher clearance with greater heal th-related quali ty of life (HRQoL) (Puig 2015). 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments Secondary efficacy assessments will include the following: 9.1.2.1. Static Physician’s Global Assessment Both sPGA (0) and sPGA (0,1) will be assessed at various time po ints up to Week 52. For assessment descript ion, see Secti on 9.1.1.1 ."
54,page_54,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 54 LY30748289.1.2.2. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 will be assessed at various time points up to Week 52. PASI 75, 90, and 100 are the percentage improvements in PASI (75%, 90%, and 100%, respectively). For assessment descript ion, see Section 9.1.1.2 . 9.1.2.3. Body Surfac e Area Percent BSA will be evaluated as the percent invo lvement of psoriasis on each subject’s BSA on a continuous scale fro m 0% (no invo lvement) to 100% (full invo lvement), where 1% corresponds to the size of the patient’s hand (including the palm, finger s, and thumb) (National Psori asis Foundat ion 2016). 9.1.2.4. Nail Psoriasis Severity Index The Nail Psoriasis Severit y Index (NAPSI) i s used to evaluate the severit y of fingernail bed psori asisand fingernail matrix psori asisby area of invo lvement in the fingernail unit. In this study , only fingernail invo lvement will be assessed. The fingernail is divided wit h imaginary horizontal and l ongitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for fingernail bed psori asis(0 to 4) and fingernail matrix psori asis(0 to 4) depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fingernail bed and fingernail matrix psori asis in each quadrant. The NAPSI score of a fingernail is the sum of scores in fingernail bed and fingernail matrix fro m each quadrant (m aximum of 8). Each fingernail is evaluated, and the sum of all the fingernails is the total NAPSI score (range, 0 to 80). 9.1.2.5. Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index The Psoriasis Scalp Severit y Index (PSSI) measures the affected scalp area and the severit y of clinical symptoms. The PSSI is a composite score derived fro m the sum of scores for ery thema, induration, and desquamat ion multiplied by a score for the extent of scalp area invo lved (range , 0 to 72). Higher scores indicate worse severit y (Thaçi et al. 2015). 9.1.2.6. Palmoplantar Psoriasis Severity Index The Palmoplantar Psoriasis Severit y Index (PPASI) i s a com posite score derived from the sum o f scores for ery thema, indurat ion, and desquamat ion multiplied by a score for the extent of palm and so le area invo lvement (range, 0 to 72). 9.1.2.7. Health Outcomes Assessments The fo llowing pati ent-reported questionnaires will be administered according to the Schedule of Activities(Secti on 2) in countri es where the questionnaires have been translated into the native language o f the region and linguist ically validated. These assessments shoul d be com pleted before administration of invest igational product; before the patient’s clinical examinat ion; before the pati ent receives any tests or resul ts; and before the patient’s health, healt h data, or emotions are discussed. 9.1.2.7.1. Dermatology Life Quality Index The Derm atology Life Qualit y Index (DLQI) is a validated, dermatology -specific, patient - reported measure that evaluates a patient’s HRQoL. This quest ionnaire has 10 items that are grouped in 6 domains, namely symptoms and feelings, daily act ivities, leisure, work and school, personal relat ionships, and treatment. The recall period of this scale is over the “last week.”"
55,page_55,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 55 LY3074828Response categories include “not at all,” “a litt le,” “a lot,” and “very much,” with corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively , and una nswered (“not relevant”) responses scored as “0.” Total s range fro m 0 to 30 (l ess to m ore impairment) (Finlay and Khan 1994; Basra et al. 2008). A DLQI total score of 0 to 1 is considered as having no effect on a patient’s HRQoL, and a 5 - point change fro m baseline is considered as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresho ld (Khilji et al. 2002; Hongbo et al. 2005). 9.1.2.7.2. European Quality of Life –5 Dimensions -5 Levels -Psoriasis The European Qualit y of Life –5 dimensi ons –5 levels (EQ –5D–5L) quest ionnaire is a widely used, generic quest ionnaire that assesses healt h status (EuroQol Group 1990; Herdman et al. 2011). The questionnaire consists of 2 parts. The first part assesses 5 dimensio ns (m obility, self-care, usual act ivities, pain/disco mfort and anxiety /depressi on) that have 5 possible levels o f response ( no probl ems, slight probl ems, m oderate probl ems, severe problems, extreme problems. This part of the EQ –5D–5L can be used to generate a healt h state index. The healt h state index score is cal culated based on the responses to the 5 dimensio ns, providing a single value on a scale fro m less than 0 (where zero is a healt h state equivalent to death; negat ive values are valued as worse than dead ) to 1 (perfect healt h), with higher scores indicat ing better heal th utilit y. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analog scale on which the patient rates their perceived health state from 0 ( the worst health you can imagine ) to 100 ( the best health y ou can imagine ). The study will use t he EQ–5D–5L–Psori asis ( EQ–5D– 5L–PSO), which is a versio n of the EQ–5D–5L with two additional items related to psoriasis: skin irritation and self -confidence (Swinburn et al. 2013). 9.1.2.7.3. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire : Psoriasis The Wo rk Productivit y and Act ivity Impairment-Psori asis (WPAI -PSO) Questi onnaire is a patient-reported instrument developed to measure the impact on work productivit y and regul ar activit ies attri butable to a specific healt h probl em (psori asis). It contains 6 it ems that m easure: 1) em ployment status, 2) hours missed from work due to the psoriasis, 3) hours missed from work for other reasons, 4) hours actually worked, 5) degree of healt h affected -productivit y while working, and 6) degree of health affected- produc tivity in regular unpaid activit ies. Four scores are cal culated fro m the responses to these 6 items: absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivit y loss, and act ivity impairment. Scores are calculated as impairment percentages (Reilly et al. 1993), wi th higher numbers indicat ing greater impairment and less productivit y, that is, worse outcom es. 9.1.2.7.4. Psoriasis Symptom sScale The Psoriasis Symptoms Scale (PSS) is a patient -administered assessment of 4 symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, and burning); 3 signs (redness, scaling, and cracking); and 1 item on the discomfort rel ated to symptoms/signs. Respondents are asked to answer th e questions based on their psori asis symptom s. The overall severit y for each individual symptom/sign from the patient’s psoriasis is indicated by select ing the number from a numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10 that best describes the worst level of eac h symptom /sign in the past 24 hours, where 0=no symptom/sign and 10=worst imaginable symptom/sign."
56,page_56,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 56 LY3074828The symptom severit y scores, ranging fro m 0 to 10, are the values of the selected numbers indicated by the pat ient on the instrument’s horizontal scale. Eac h of the 8 individual items will receive a score of 0 to 10 and will be reported as item scores for itch, pain, stinging, burning, redness, scaling, cracking, and disco mfort. In additi on, a symptom s score ranging fro m 0 (no symptoms) to 40 (worst imaginable symptom s) and a si gns score of 0 (no signs) to 30 (worst imaginable signs) will be reported. 9.1.2.7.5. Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short -Form Health Survey The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short -Form Health Survey (SF 36) is a patient -reported, generic, HRQoL instrument originally published in 1992, with so me item wordings and response options revised in 2000 (Ware and Sherbourne 1992; Ware 2000). It consists of 36 questions measuring 8 health do mains: physical funct ioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical probl ems, rol e limi tations due to em otional problems, general health percept ions, m ental health, social function, and vitalit y. The patient’s responses are solicited using Likert scales that vary in length, with 3 –6 response options per i tem. The SF -36 can be scored into the 8 health domains named above and two overall summary scores: physical co mponent summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores. The domain and summary scores range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate bett er levels of funct ion and/or better healt h. The SF -36 version 2 (acute versio n) will be used, which utilizes the recall period of “the past week” (Ware 2000). 9.1.2.7.6. 16 -Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report The QIDS -SR16 is a self-admini stered, 16-item instrum ent intended to assess the existence and severit y of symptom s of depressio n as listed in the American Psychiatric Associat ion’s Diagnostic and Stati stical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edit ion (DSM -V) (Amer ican Psychiatri c Associ ation 2013). A pati ent is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way they have f elt for the past 7 days. There is a 4 -point scale for each item ranging fro m 0 to 3. The 16 i tems corresponding to 9 depression domains are summed to give a sin gle score ranging from 0 to 27, wi th higher scores denoting greater symptom severit y. The dom ains assessed by the instrument include: (1) sad mood, (2) concentration, (3) self -criticism, (4) sui cidal ideati on, (5) interest, (6) energy/fat igue, (7) sleep disturbance (init ial, middle, and late inso mnia or hyperso mnia), (8) decrease/increase in appetite/weight, and (9) psy chomotor agitation/retardati on. This instrument will also be used for AE monitoring (see Section 9.2.2 ). 9.1.2.7.7. Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication The Treatm ent Sati sfact ion Quest ionnaire for Medicat ion (TSQM ) is a self -administered 9 i tem measure to evaluate patient treatmen t sati sfact ion with medicati on in the dom ains of effectiveness (3 items), convenience (3 items), and global s atisfact ion (3 items). The recall period is the l ast 2 -3 weeks or since the medicat ion was l ast taken. Item formats include both a 1-to- 7 -point or 1-to-5-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate greater satisfact ion(Bharmal et al. 2009) ."

Patient’s Global Assessment of Psoriasis The Pati ent’s Gl obal Assessment of Psori asis (PatGA) is a patient -reported, single -item scale on which patients are a sked to rank, by select ing a number on a 0 to5 NRS, the severit y of their psoriasis “today ,” from 0 (cl ear/ no psori asis) to 5 (severe). 9.1.3. Appropriateness of Assessments The clinical safet y parameters in this study are standard elements of clinical health a ssessment and Phase 3 drug development. The disease activit y and heal th outcom e measurements are used both in clinical pract ice and psori asis clinical trials. Psoriasis is associated with numerous skin - based symptom s and HRQoL impairment, which justifies the use of the psoriasis symptom severit y as well as dermatologic and generic HRQoL assessments used in this study (EMA 2004; Kimball et al. 2005 ). 9.2. Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this st udy and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study. Invest igators m ust docum ent thei r review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused themto discontinue the investigational product before completing the study. The patientshoul d be f ollowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. The frequency o f follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE i n clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the ICF i s signed, study site personnel will record via eCRF the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically sign ificant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study . In addit ion, site personnel will record any change in the condi tion(s) and any new condi tions as AEs . Investi gators shoul d record thei r assessment of the potenti al relatedness of eac h AE to protocol procedure or invest igational product via eCRF . The invest igator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, study device, or a study procedure, taki ng into account the disease, concomitant treatment or pathologies. A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause and effect relat ionship between the investigat ional product, study device ,and/or study procedure and the AE. The invest igator answers yes/no when maki ng this assessment."
58,page_58,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 58 LY3074828Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF clarifying if possible, the circumstances leading to any dosagemodificat ions, or discont inuat ions of treat ment. 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es: Death Initial or prol onged inpat ient hospi talizat ion A life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying) Persi stent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y Congenital anomaly/birth defect Important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitali zation,but may jeopardi ze the pati ent or may requi re intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcom es listed in the definit ion above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatm ent in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the develop ment of drug dependency or drug abuse. When a condi tion related to the prefilled sy ringes necessitates medical or surgical intervent ion to preclude either permanent impairment of a body function or perm anent dam age to a body structure, the seri ous outcom e of “requi red intervent ion” will be assigned. All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF and assessed for serious criteria. The SAE reporting to the Sponsor begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the SAE should be reported to the Sponsor as per SAE reporting re quirements and t imelines (see Sect ion9.2) if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a Sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official notificati on on study -specific SAE forms. This 24 - hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow -up SAE inform ation.Patients with a serious hepat ic AEshoul d have addi tional data collected using the eCRF . Pregnancy ( during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igationalproduct) does not m eet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus."
59,page_59,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 59 LY3074828Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in patients once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the patientdisposit ion CRF has been completed). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any tim e after a patient has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly . 9.2.1.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Susp ected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or procedure. United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associ ated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory requirements in parti cipat ing countries requi re the reporting of SUSARs. Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the ident ificat ion,recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regul ations and the associated detailed guidances. 9.2.2. Adverse Event Monitoring with a Systematic Questionnaire The C -SSRS captures the occurrence, severit y, and f requency of suicidal ideat ion and /or behavior during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the ty pe of inform ation needed to determine if suicidal ideation and/or behavior occurred. The C -SSRS is administered by an appropri ately trained health care professio nal with at least 1year of pat ient care/clinical experience . The tool was developed by the Nati onal Inst itute of Mental Healt h trial group for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algori thm of Suicide Assessment categorizat ion of suicidal eve nts. For this study, the scale has been adapted (with permission fro m the scale authors) to include only the porti on of the scale that captures the occurrence of the 11 preferred ideat ion and behavior categories. The nonleading AE collect ion shoul d occur prior to the collect ion of the C -SSRS. If a suicide-related event is discovered during the C -SSRS but was not captured during the nonleading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form. If an event is serious or leads to discontinuat ion, thi s is a n except ion where the SAE and/or AE leading to discont inuat ion should be included on the AE form and the process for reporting SAEs should be fo llowed. Suicide-related events (behavior and/or ideat ions) will be assessed and evaluated at every visit with the administration of the C -SSRS and the Self -Harm Supplement Form. The Self -Harm Suppl ement Form is a single quest ion to enter the number of suicidal behavior events, possible suicide behavi ors, or nonsui cidal self -injuri ous behavi ors. If the number of behavi oral events i s greater than zero, it will lead to the complet ion of the Self-Harm Follow-Up Form . The Self-Harm Fo llow-Up form is a series of quest ions that provides a more detailed description o f the behavior cases. The QIDS -SR16 instrument (for de script ion, see Section 9.1.2.7.6 )will be used to collect patient-reported data on signs and symptoms related to depres sion."

Treatment of Overdose Invest igators should remain vigilant for unknown effects related to mirikizumab overdose. In case of suspected overdose, hematology , chemistry, vi tal signs, and oxygen saturation should be monitored and supportive care provided as necessary . There is no known ant idote for mirikizumab . Refer to the Product Label of secukinumab for advice on overdose . 9.4. Safety 9.4.1. Electrocardiograms For each patient, ECGs should be co llected according to the Schedule of Activit ies (Secti on 2). Electrocardiograms should be recorded according to the study -specific reco mmendat ions and read locally for evaluat ion of study eligibili ty and safet y monitoring. Patients shoul d be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collect ion and rem ain supine but awake during ECG collect ion. Sitting BP, tem perature, and pulse (see Section 9.4.2 ) are to be ob tained at approximately the same t ime as ECG measurements or blood sampling. When mult iple assessments are scheduled for the same t ime point, the preferred order of completion shoul d be as follows: ECG, vital signs, and then blood sam pling.

At the visit s and t imes specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2),venous blood samples will be co llected to determine ant ibody producti on against mirikizumab . To interpret the results of immunogenicit y, a blood sample for PK analysis will be co llected at the same time points. All samples for immunogenicit y shoul d be taken predose when applicable. With reports of hypersensit ivityevents (immediate or non -immediate), addit ional samples will be co llected as close to the onset of the event as possible, at the resol ution of the event, and 30 day s following resol ution of the event . Samples will be evaluated for PK, anti -drug antibod ies (ADAs) , and additional exploratory markers of hypersensit ivity (see Section 7.8.2.1 ). Instructions for the collect ion and handling of blood samples will be provided by the Sponsor. The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sampling will be recorded. Immunogenici ty will be assessed by a validated assay designed to detect ADAs in the presence of mirikizumab at a l aboratory approved by the Sponsor. Samples will be retained at a facilit y selected by the Sponsor for a m aximum of 15 years after the last pati ent visi t, or for a shorter period if local regulat ions and /orEthical Review Boards (ERBs) requi re.

Tuberculosis Screening Screening : Screening for active or latent TB infect ion (LTBI) will include a history, physical examinat ion (Secti on9.4.5.1 ), chest x-ray (Secti on 9.4.5.3 ) and, except as noted below under “Prior Treatment for LTBI or TB,” testing by an interferon -release assay (IGRA ;Quant iFERON ®-TB Gold or T -SPOT ®) or a purified protein derivat ive (PPD) tuberculin skin test. In people aged 5 y ears and over, IGRA is the preferred screening test for LTBI. In countries where the PPD is available and is preferred (in the judgment of the investigator) as an alternat ive screening test for LTBI, that test may be used instead of an IGRA. Patients wi th docum entati on of a negat ive IGRA or PPD within 3 m onths before init ial screening may not need to repeat TB testing at screening, based on the judgment of the invest igator. Source document ation m ust include the original laboratory report (for IGRA) or a record of the size in millimeters of the indurat ion response (for PPD). A PPD recorded as negative wit hout docum enting the size of indurat ion in millimeters , will not be acceptable and will require a retest. Monitoring: After init ial screening, tuberculosis testing will only be requi red based on clinical assessment of TB ri sk (symptom s/signs/known or suspected TB exposure), and according to local regulat ions and/or local standard of care. Such clinical assessments should be conducted periodically, at least every 4 months. Interpretation of Screening Tests for LTBI The QuantiFERON -TB Gol d assay will be reported as negat ive, indeterminate ,or posit ive. The T-SPOT .TBassay will be reported as negative, borderline or posit ive. A posi tive PPD is indicated by a skin test response 5mm of induration documented between approximately 48 to 72 hours after test application (regardless of BCG vaccinat ion history ). Patients who do not return within 48 to 72 hours of test administration will be required to have the test repeated and then interpreted within this time frame. Patients wi th a diagnosis of LTBI, based on a positive IGRA test result or a posit ive PPD respons e 5 mm of induration and no evidence of active TB ,may be rescreened once afterthey meet the fo llowing requi rements: Have received at least 4 weeks of appropriate ongoing prophylact ic therapy for LTBI as per local standard of care , and Have no evidence of treatm ent hepatotoxicit y (ALT and AST l evels must remain ≤2xULN) upon retesti ng of serum ALT and AST levels before rando mizat ion. Such patients must continue and co mplete appropriate LTBI therapy during the course of the study to rem ain eligible and mu st con tinue to m eet all other inclusi on and exclusio n criteria for participat ion."

Confirmatory testing wi th an IGRA is allowed for selected patients who have a posit ive Quant iFERON -TB Gol d assay , posi tive T-SPOT.TB assay, or positive PPD, who meet all of the following criteria and are assessed and documented by the invest igator as likely to have a false - positive test result: no risk factors for LTBI, no risk factors for increased likelihood of progressing fro m LTBI to active TB, and have never res ided in a high -burden country (detailed in Appendix 5 ). If the confirmatory test i s posi tive, the patient will be excluded from the study unless they com plete at l east 4 weeks of appropriate therapy for LTBI, based o n nat ional or internat ional guidelines (as defined above), have no evidence of hepatotoxicit y (ALT and AST levels must remain ≤2x ULN) upon retesting of serum ALT and AST levels after at least 4 weeks of LTBI treatm ent. Such pati ents m ust continue and com plete appropri ate full course of LTBI therapy during the course of the study to rem ain eligible to participate. If the confirmatory test i s negat ive, these results will be discussed wit h the medical mo nitor in order to determine eligibilit y for the study . Diagnosis of LTBI During Study Patients di agnosed wi th LTBI during the study will temporarily discontinue the invest igational product and will be offered treatment by the referring physician. These patients can be considered for resumpt ion of invest igational product after complet ing the first 4 weeks of appropriate treatment, and no evidence of treatment hepatotoxicit y, as described above.

Hepatitis B Screening Patients who test HBsAg+, test HBcAb+ in conjunction with posit ive confirm atory HBV DNA test, or have posit ive HBV DNA test, regardless of HBsAb status, at screening will be excluded. Any enrolled subject who is HBcAb+ will undergo periodic mo nitoring of HBV DNA per the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). In addit ion to the above, any enrolled patient who is HBcAb+ and who experiences an elevated ALT or AST level >3 xULN m ust undergo HBV DNA t esting. If the HBV DNA test i s negat ive, the invest igator should consult with the Lilly -designated m edical m onitor regarding further management of the patient. If the result of the HBV DNA test is posi tivebut below quant ification, study drug should be withheld and a repeat test done immediately .

Sample Size Determination Approximately 1443 patients will be randomized at a 4:4:4:1 ratio in the Blinded Induct ion Period to receive 250 mg mirikizumab SC at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and12, then 250 m g mirikizumab SC Q8W, 250 mg mirikizumab SC at Wee ks 0, 4, 8 , and 12,then 125 m g mirikizumab SC Q8W, 300 m g secukinumab at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, followed by 300 m g secukinumab Q4W, or placebo . Stratified blo ck rando mizat ionwill be performed with the fo llowing stratificat ion factors: previous exposure to bio logic therapy (yes/no), body weight (<100 kg or 100 kg), and geographi c regi on (North Ameri ca, Europe ,or Other). There are mult iple primary endpoints in this study :the proporti on of patients achieving a 90% improvement in PASI from baseline (PASI 90) and the p roporti on of patients with an sPGA (0,1) with at least a 2 -point improvement fro m baseline , com parisons between mirikizumab and placebo (test of superi ority), and comparison between mirikizumab and secukinumab ( test of non-inferiorit y).The assumed PASI 90 responses are 70% for the mirikizumab arm 70% f or the secukinumab arm, and 3% for the placebo arm. The assumed sPGA 0 or 1 responses are 70% for the mirikizumab arm 70% f or the secukinumab arm, and 5% for the placebo arm. Both PASI 90 and sPGA (0,1) rates at Week 52 are estimated to be 75% for both mirikizumab dose groups, and 65% for secukinumab group . The assumptions for mirikizumab are based upon the resul ts of the mirikizumab Phase 2 Study AMAF (Reich et al . 2017b ) and review of historical clinical studies in psoriasis (Langley et al. 2014; Gordon et al. 2016; Blauvelt et al. 2017; Papp et al. 2017; Reich et al. 2017 a).The assumpt ions for secukinumab was based upon 2 Phase 3 studi es of secukinumab for psoriasis (Langley et al. 2014) . With 888 patients in the mirikizumab group and 111 patients in the placebo group , the estimated power is at least 99% totest superi ority of mirikizum abto placebo on PASI 90 at W eek 16, and on sPGA (0, 1) at Week 16 ,respectively ,at alpha of 0.05 two -sided . With 888 patients in the mirikizumab group and 444 patients in the secukinum abgroup ,the esti mated power isat least 90% totest noninferiorit y of mirikizumab to secukinumab at alpha of 0.025 one -sided wi th a noninferiorit y margin o f 10% on PASI 90 at Week 16 .

Pa tients will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned. Unless otherwise noted, efficacy and health outcomes analyses for the inductio n period will be conducted on this population. Induction Safety All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment . Safety analyses for the induction period will be conducted on this population. All Active Treatment Safety All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of mirikizumab or secukinumab . Abbreviation: ITT = intent -to-treat . Addit ional analysis populat ions will be described in the statist ical analysis plan (SAP) as deemed appropriate. 10.3. Statistical Analyses 10.3.1. General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis o f this study will be the responsibilit y ofLilly or its desi gnee. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment only if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report (CSR) . Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate. Efficacy analysis for induct ion and m aintenance outcom es will be conducted on the intent-to- treat (ITT) populat ion as defined in Sect ion 10.2. The induct ion and m aintenance safet y analysis will be perform ed on the Induction and All Active Treatment safety popul ations,respect ively. Continuous data will be summarized in terms of the mean, standard deviat ion, minimum, maximum, median, and number of observat ions. Categorical data will be summarized as frequency counts and percentages. Unless otherwise specified, all superiorit y tests will be 2 - sided wi th alpha of 0.05, and all non -inferiorit y tests will be 1 -sided wi th alpha of 0.025. Multiple testing will be controlled as described in Section 10.3.1.2 . Unless otherwise specified, baseline for efficacy and heal th outcom es endpo ints during both the Induct ion and Maintenance Periods will be defined as the l ast available value before the rando mizat ion, which in most cases will be the measure recorded at Week 0 (Visit 2). Detailed definit ions of baseline for safet y-related analyses will be described in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, the statist ical analysis models for the Induction Period and Maintenance Period will adjust for the covariates: previous exposure to biologic therapy (yes/no), body weight (<100 kg or 100 kg), and geographic regio n (North Ame rica, Europe ,or Other)."
72,page_72,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 72 LY3074828For assessments of the primary endpo ints and other categorical efficacy and healt h outcom es endpo ints, the Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) test will be used to compare the treatment groups wi th the stratificat ion factors ment ioned a bove. The CMH p- value will be provided. In addition, the treatm ent difference in proportions will be provided along wit h the 95% 2 -sided confidence interval estimate. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and healt h outcome variables with multiplepost- baseline measurements will be made using mixed -effects m odel for repeated m easures (MMRM) analysis. Secondary analysis on key cont inuous efficacy and health outcome variables will also be performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The log -rank test will be used to analyze the time to clinical response in the induction period. Fisher ’s exact test will be used for categorical safety data ,including AEs ,unless otherwise specified. Laboratory analy tes will be presented as m ean changes from baseline and as incidence of shift between normal and abnormal states. 10.3.1.1. Missing Data Imputation The fo llowing m ethods for imputati on of missing data will be used: Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) for Binary Clinical Response: Patient s will be considered non -responders for the NRI analysis if they do not meet the clinical response criteria or have missing clinical response data at the analysis t ime point. Randomized subjects wi thout at l east 1 postbaseline observat ion will also be def ined as non-responders for the NRI analysis. Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM): It will be the primary analysis method for longitudinal cont inuous measurements. It assumes missing at random and the bias caused by missing data can be attenuated by modeling rando m effects using the within- subject error correlat ion structure. Addit ional missing data imputation methodologies, for example, m odified baseline observat ion carried forward (m BOCF) ,may be considered as secondary analyses and will be fully detailed in the SAP. By using mBOCF, for patients discont inuing study treatm entdue to an AE, the baseline observat ion will be carried forward to the corresponding primary endpo int for evaluat ion. For pati ents di scont inuing invest igational product for any other reason, the last nonmissing postbaseline observat ion before discontinuat ion will be carried forward to the corresponding primary endpoint for evaluat ion. 10.3.1.2. Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity The prespecified graphical mult iple testing approach (Bretz et al. 2011) will be implemented to control the overall Ty pe I error rate at 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 for superiorit y tests and at 1 -sided alpha of 0.025 for non -inferiorit y tests, for the hypothese s for the primary and maj or secondary endpo ints. The graphical approach is a closed testing procedure ; hence it strongly controls the family -wise error rate across all endpo ints (Alosh et al . 2014). The Week 16 endpo intsof sPGA (0,1) and PASI 90 represent a primary endpo int family . The graphical test ing scheme will sequent ially test sPGA (0,1) first, followed by PASI 90 before"
73,page_73,"I6T-MC-AMAJ(b) Clinical Protocol Page 73 LY3074828proceeding to test the major secondary endpoints. Details o f the specific graphical test ing scheme (including testing order, interrelat ionships, Ty peI error allocat ion for the major secondary endpoints , and the associated propagation) will be pre -specified in the SAPs pri or to first unblinded analysis. 10.3.2. Treatment Group Comparability 10.3.2.1. Patient Dispos ition A detailed description o f patient di sposi tion will be provi ded at the end of the study . Patient disposit ion will be summarized for each treatment period. Reasons for discont inuat ion from the study will be summarized. 10.3.2.2. Patient Characteristics Patient characterist ics and baseline clinical measures will be summarized for each treatment period. Baseline characterist ics will include gender, age, age category , wei ght, race, geographic region, baseline disease severit y, durati on of disease, pri or ex posure to bi ologic therapy , previ ous nonbio logic systemic therapy , and previ ous bi ologic therapy . Baseline clinical measurements will include sPGA score, PASI total score, BSA, PSSI, PSS symptom and sign total score s, PatGA, DLQI total score, SF -36 (PCS), and SF -36 (MCS). 10.3.2.3. Concomitant Therapy Previous and concomitant medicat ions will be summarized for patients who enter each treatment period and will be presented using the latest version of the World Healt h Organizat ion (WHO) drug di ctionary. 10.3.2.4. Treatment Co mpliance Treatment compliance wit h investigational product will be summarized for patients who enter the Induction and Maintenance periods. A patient will be considered as having missed the visit if he or she fails to attend for administration of theinvestigational product within the required treatm ent window as defined in the Schedule of Activit ies (Section 2). Overall compliance wi th therapy is defined to be missing no more than 20% of the expected doses within the protocol - defined dosing interval and not missing 2 consecutive doses. The proporti on of patients who demonstrate overall co mpliance during the Induction P eriod will be co mpared between treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test. 10.3.3. Efficacy Analyses Primary and secondary analyses will be based on the ITT populat ion as defined in Sect ion 10.2. Non-inferiority Margin and Analyses : There i s no universally accepted val ue for what i s considered to be a clinically unimportant difference between 2 treatments in sPGA (0, 1) or PASI 90 response . Global regulatory guidance ( EMA 2005 and FDA 2016 guidelines) indicate that select ion of the non -inferiorit y margin is based upon a combination of statist ical and clinical grounds ."

Treatment -related TEAEs are defined as events that are indicated by the invest igator on the eCRF to be related to treatment. If a patient reports the occurrence of a particular event more than once, the most severe of those events will be included in the summary tables of TEAEs, and the most severe of the m ost rel ated of those events will be included in the summary tables of treatm ent-related events. For events that are gender specific, the deno minator and computation of the percentage will only include p atients from the given gender. Adverse events of special interest are defined in Section 9.2.3 )and the analysis plan will be described in the Program Safet y Analysis Plan and SAP. 10.3.5. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses The PK of mirikizumab will be characterized using visualizat ion/graphical evaluat ions and mixed -effect (population PK) modeling approaches. Various structural and error models will be evaluated. Intrinsic factors (such as age, body weight, gender, immunogenicit y) and extrinsic factors (such as co -medications) will be invest igated to assess their influence on model param eters. Model evaluat ion will i nclude a visual predict ive check. Estimates of PK model param eters and covariate effects and corresponding 90% confidence intervals will be reported. CCI"

Evaluation of Immunogenicity The frequency and percentage of patients with pre -existing (baseline) ADA, ADA at any t ime post baseline, and with treatment -emergent ADA (TE -ADA) to mirikizumab will be tabulated. The frequency of neutralizing antibodies will also be tabulated. The rel ationship between the presence of ant ibodies and the P K parameters and PD response , including safet y and efficacy to mirikizumab ,willbe assessed. 10.3.7. Other Analyses 10.3.7.1.

Interim Analyses One DMC consist ing of members external to Lilly will be established for interim safet y monitoring across all Phase 3 trials in pat ients with psori asis. This committee will consist of a minimum o f 3 members including a physician with expertise in dermatology , a stati stician, and an addit ional clinician(s). No member of the DMC may have contact with study sites. A Statistical Analysis Center (SAC) will prepare and provide unblinded safet y data to the DMC. The SA C members m ay be Lilly empl oyees or from thi rd-party organizat ions designated by Lilly. However, they will be external to the study team and will have no contact with sites and no privileges to influence change in the ongoing study. The study team will not have access to the unblinded data. The purpose of the DMC is to advise Lilly regarding cont inuing patient safet y; however, the DMC m ay request key efficacy data to put safet y observat ions into context and to confirm a reasonable benefit/risk profile fo r ongoing patients in the study . Hence, there will be no al pha adj ustm ent for these interim assessments. Study sites will receive informat ion about interim assessments only if they need to know for the safet y of their pati ents. This committee will make recommendat ions as to whether it is scient ifically and ethically appropriate to continue enrollment, discont inue a treatment group, or discont inue the study. Details outlining the roles and responsibilit ies o f the DMC will be finalized in the DMC charter and an associated DMC analysis plan prior to t he first unblinded assessment. To support regulatory submissi on, an analysis including the primary and major secondary endpo ints will be conducted after all pat ients com plete Week 52 or discont inue early. If all patients have entered the long- term extensio nStudy I6T-MC-AMAH , or di scont inued the study early , this analysis is deemed as the final analysis . Otherwise, this analysis will be an interim analysis for the primary outcome ;the final analysis will be conducted after all patients have entered the long- term extensi onStudy I6T-MC-AMAH , or have co mpleted the follow -up peri od of Study AMAJ, or di scont inued the study early. In addit ion, a limited number of pre -identified internal Lilly personnel that are not in contact with clinical sites m ay gain access to unblinded PK/PD data, as specified in the unblinding plan, prior to the Week 52 database lock, in order to init iate the final population PK/PD model development processes. Unbl inding details will be provided in the unblinding plan."

These samples will be discarded at the end of the study. Section 10.3. Statistical A nalyses 10.3.1. General Statistical Considerations For assessments of the primary endpo ints and other categorical efficacy and healt h outcom es endpo ints, the Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test will be used to compare the treatm ent groups wi th the stratification factors ment ioned above. The CMH chi-square p-value will be provided. In addit ion, the absolutetreatm ent difference in proportions will be provided along wi th the 95% 2 -sided confidence interval estimate. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and healt h outcome variables with multiple post- baseline measurements will be made using mixed -effects m odel for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. Sensit ivitySecondary analysis on key cont inuous efficacy and healt h outcom e variables will also be performed using analysis o f covari ance (ANCOVA). The l og-rank test will be used to analyze the time to clinical respo nse in theinduction period. 10.3.1.1. Missing Data Imputation Addit ional missing data imputation methodologies, for example, modified baseline observat ion carried forward (m BOCF), m ay be considered as sensi tivitysecondary analyses and will be fully detai led in the SAP. By using mBOCF, for patients discont inuing study treatm ent due to an AE, the baseline observat ion will be carried forward to the corresponding primary endpoint for evaluat ion. For pati ents di scont inuing invest igational product for any other reason, the last nonmissing postbaseline observat ion before discontinuat ion will be carried forward to the corresponding primary endpoint for evaluat ion. 10.3.3. Efficacy Analyses Non-inferiority Margin and Analyses: Similarly, a 10% NI margin will be used for the other primary major secondary endpoint sPGA (0,1), wi th noninferi ority tests com paring mirikizumab and secukinumab. There are several major secondary or other secondary endpoints to be tested for NI between e ach mirikizumab dose and secukinumab at Week 24 and Week 52 ( Table AMAJ.5 ). For ethical reasons, patients will need to be crossed over to an active treatment after Week 16 in psoriasis studi es. Therefore, no hi storical data of placebo rates on these endpoints were available, and there will be no placebo group bey ond Week 16 in Study AMAJ. Instead, wi th a reasonable and conservative assumpt ion that pl acebo rates at Week 16 could be carried over to the maintenance"
