To evaluate the long -term safety and efficacy of ALXN1210 Study Design and Methodology: This is a Phase 3, single- treatment arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety , efficacy , PK, and PD of ALXN1210 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion in approximately 23 to 28 pediatric patients, from birth to < 18 years of age , with confirmed diagnosis of aHUS. The study has 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 includes complement inhibitor treatment -naïve patients ; Cohort 2 includes eculizumab -experienced adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years of age). The study consists of a Screening Period (of up to 7 days for Cohort 1 or up to 28 days for Cohort 2), a 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, and a n Extension Period until the product is registered or approved (in accordance with country -specific regulations) or for up to 4.5 years, whichever occurs first . Abbreviations: q4w = once every 4 weeks; q8w = once every 8 weeks a The Screening Period is up to 7 days for complement inhibitor treatment -naïve patients (ie, Cohort 1) and up to 28 days for eculizumab -experienced adolescent patients (ie, Cohort 2 ). Consenting patients in Cohort 1 will be screened for study eligibility up to 7 days prior to Day 1 . Consenting patients in Cohort 2 will be screened for study eligibility up to 28 days prior to Day 1; first dose of study drug will be given 14 days from the eligible patient’s last dose of eculizumab. Patients who are eligible based on the Inclusion and Exclusion Cri teria will be enrolled into the Initial Evaluation Period and receive a weight- based loading dose of ALXN1210 on Day 1, followed by weight -based maintenance treatment with ALXN1210 on Day 15 and q8w thereafter for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or once every 4 weeks (q4w) for patients weighing < 20 kg, for a total of 26 weeks of treatment. Weight- based dosing is based on the patient’s body weight recorded on Dose Regimen Decision Days (if the Dose Regimen Day is a dosing day, body weight will be recorded predos e), as shown in the table below: Body Weight Range (kg)a Loading Dose (mg) Maintenance Doses (mg) Maintenance Dosing Frequency ≥ 5 to < 10 600 300 q4w ≥ 10 to < 20 600 600 q4w ≥ 20 to < 30 900 2100 q8w ≥ 30 to < 40 1200 2700 q8w"

If the Dose Regimen Day is also dosing day, body weight will be recorded predose with dosing that day based on the previous Dose Regimen Day body weight. An initial analysis, including review of AL XN1210 PK and serum free C5 levels, will be conducted after 4 complement inhibitor treatment- naïve (ie, Cohort 1) patients weighing ≥ 5 kg to < 40 kg have completed dosing through Day 71. In addition, safety data will be reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (D MC). Enrollment of patients will proceed without interruption while the analysis is ongoing. The primary purpose of this review is to assure patients are achieving adequate complement inhibition during this study with the goal of achieving complete terminal complement blockade. Based on this review, if dose adjustment is considered needed and tolerable , subsequent treatment for all patients will continue at the adjusted dose regimen. After the Initial Evaluation Period, patients will roll over into a n Exten sion Period in which all patients continue their weight -based maintenance dose of ALXN1210 on Day 183 and q8w thereafter for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or q4w for patients weighing < 20 kg, until the product is registered or approved (in accordance with co untry -specific regulation) or for up to 4.5 years, whichever occurs first . Note, q4w visits during the Extension Period are not applicable for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg and receiving ALXN1210 q8w. The end of trial is defined as the last patient’s last visit or follow -up (whether on site or via phone call) of the 4.5-year Extension Period , whichever is later . Number of Patients (planned): Approximately 23 to 28 pediatric patients with documented aHUS are planned . The minimum number of patients for each age category is as follow s: • Birth to < 2 years : 4 patients • 2 to < 6 years : 4 patients • 6 to < 12 years : 4 patients • 12 to < 18 years : 8 patients Cohort 2 patients must be 12 to < 18 years of age. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Patients must satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria , in order to have a confirmed diagnosis of aHUS and be eligible for the study . Patients who fail any of the eligibility criteria may be rescreened based on discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. Patients may be rescreened a maximum of 2 times. For Cohort 1, s amples collected at Screening may be tested at either a local or central laboratory. If a local laboratory is used to define eligibility, additional samples will be collected during the Screening Period for LDH, platelet count, hemoglobin and serum creatinine and tested at the central laboratory. All analyses in this study will be based on results from the central laboratory (unless the result is missing) . If Cohort 1 patients are found not to satisfy the eligibility criteria for serum creatinine (Inclusion Criterion 2c) based on central laboratory results, they must not be enrolled into the study; if the subject has received the first dose of ALXN1210 , the patient must be withdrawn from the study, and may be replaced. For Cohort 1 patients, laboratory results for Exclusion Criterion number 1 and/or Exclusion Criterion number 2 may not be available prior to first dose. Later results for Exclusion Criteri on number 1 and/or Exclusion Criterion number 2 could lead to discontinuation and replacement of the patient. For Cohort 2, samples collected at Screening must be tested at a central laboratory; however, historical test results via chart review should be utilized for Inclusion Criterion 3 and Exclusion Criteria 1, 2, 3 , and 24 . The following entry criteria are applicable for patients in both cohorts unless otherwise noted as specific for Cohort 1 or Cohort 2: Inclusion Criteria: 1. Patients from birth up to < 18 years of age and weigh ing ≥ 5 kg at the time of consent who: a. For Cohort 1 patients, have not been previously treated with complement inhibitors b.

Safety For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, t he long- term safety and tolerability of ALXN1210 will be evaluated by physical examinations, vital signs, physical growth (height, weight , and head circumference [the lat ter only in patients ≤ 2 years of age] ), electrocardiograms (ECG), laboratory assessments, and incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The proportion of patients who develop antidrug antibodies (ADA) will also be assessed. Sample Size: The total planned sample size is approximately 23 to 28 patients . This sample size is deemed appropriate to get proper representation in each of the 4 planned age groups. Statistical methods: General : All data collected will be presented using summary tables, figures, and data listings. All analyses will be performed using SAS® release, version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) or other validated statistical software. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including number of observations and mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency counts and percentage of patients. The analyses for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be conducted and reported separately. Analyses specific to Cohort 1 are indicated as such below; all other endpoints will be performed for both cohorts. T abulated summaries will not include a direct comparison between Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.

Available explorato ry data will be summarized after study completion but may not be included in the CSR . All data collected will be presented using summary tables, figures, and data listings. Planned summaries will be presented overall and by age groups when applicable. Efficacy : Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The analysis of the FAS will be the primary analysis. The FAS for Cohort 1 will be based on a modified intent to treat (mITT) approach . With this approach, confirmation of eligi bility in patients may occur after receiving study drug. This specifically applies to Inclusion Criterion number 2c (must be confirmed via a central lab oratory ), Exclusion Criterion number 1 (may be confirmed via a central or local laboratory ), and Exclusi on Criterion number 2 (may be confirmed via a central or local laboratory ). Based on the above, the FAS will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210, have at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment, and meet all of the following criteria (these are the same criteria that if not satisfied will result in discontinuation of the patient and potential replacement) : • Patients who satisfy Inclusion Criteri on number 2 c • Patients who satisfy Exclusion Criteri on number 1 • Patients who satisfy Exclusion Criterion number 2 The FAS for Cohort 2 will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210 and have at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment. The FAS will be determined prior to database lock and prior to the database snapshot s for the analys es performed at the end of the 26 -week Initial Evaluation Period. Primary efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint is Complete TMA Response during the 26 -week Initial Evaluation Period. The primary analysis will consist in estimating the p roportion of complete TMA responders among ALXN1210 treated patients. This will be performed by calculating the point estimate and a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the proportion of complete TMA responders in ALXN1210 treated patients. The CI will be bas ed on exact confidence limits using the Clopper -Pearson method. This analysis will only be performed for Cohort 1."

Amendment 6 (Global) 16 Jul 2019 Page 14 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL Secondary efficacy: For the secondary efficacy endpoint of time to Complete TMA Response, a Kaplan -Meier cumulative distribution curve will be generated along with a 2 -sided 95% CI. The corresponding summary table will present the cumulative distribution function (CDF) estimate, the number of patients at risk, the number of patients responding, and the number of patients censored at each postbaseline time point. The table will also present first quartile, median, and third quartile, along with corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI, of time to complete response. This analysis will only be performed for Cohort 1. Complete TMA response will also be summar ized over time by presenting the number and proportion of responders along with a 2 -sided 95% CI for each postbaseline time point. A similar approach will be used to summarize the number and proportion of patients with an increase from baseline in hemoglobin ≥ 20 g/L, observed at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between . This analysis will only be performed for Cohort 1. Kidney function (dialysis requirement status, eGFR, CKD stage) as well as hematologic parameters (platelets, LDH, hemoglobin) will be summarized at baseline and each postbaseline time point. These analyses will be performed for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables (eGFR, platelets, LDH, hemoglobin) will be used to summarize the observed value as well as the change from baseline. A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with the fixed, categorical effect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the specific test’s baseline value as covariates may be fit to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point. Dialysis requirement status and CKD stage will be summarized over time. Dialysis requirement status will be summarized amon g patients receiving dialysis within 5 days prior to ALXN1210 treatment initiation by presenting the number and proportion of those patients receiving and not receiving dialysis at each time point. A 2 -sided 95% CI for the proportion receiving dialysis wil l be provided. CKD stage will be summarized over time by presenting the number and proportion of patients that improved (excluding those with Stage 1 at baseline as they cannot improve), worsened (excluding those with Stage 5 at baseline as they cannot worsen), and stayed the same compared to CKD stage at baseline. Stage 5 will be considered the worst category, while Stage 1 will be considered the best category. A 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion will be provided for each category. Quality of life will be assessed in patients ≥ 5 years of age by the Pediatric FACIT Fatigue Questionnaire (patient- reported for patients who were ≥ 8 years of age at the time of enrollment; caregiver -reported or caregiver assistance for patients who were 5 to < 8 years of age a t the time of enrollment ). This measure will be summarized at baseline and each postbaseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the observed value as well as the change from baseline. A MMRM with the fixed, categorical eff ect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the test’s baseline value as covariates may be fit to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point. These analyses will be performed for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Analyses will be separate for pati ents who were 5 to < 8 years of age at the time of enrollment (ie, caregiver -reported or caregiver assistance ) and patients who were ≥ 8 years of age at the time of enrollment (ie, patient -reported) . Safety: Safety analyses will be performed on the S afety Set defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of ALXN1210 for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and SAEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) overall, by severity, and by relationship to treatment. Observed values and changes from baseline (last assessmen t prior to ALXN1210) in ECGs, vital signs, and laboratory assessments, as well as presence of ADA will be summarized. Shifts from baseline in laboratory assessments will be summarized for all study visits. These analyses will be performed for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics : Sparse PK and PD (serum free C5) samples will be collected over the course of the study. Individual serum concentration data for all patients from the FAS and who have evaluable PK data will be used to derive the PK parameters for ALXN1210. These analyses will be performed for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2."

INTRODUCTION Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), most often caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the alternative pathway of complement (APC) or by autoantibodies against APC regulatory proteins ( Noris, 2010). Patients with aHUS are at risk for life -threatening manifestations of disease resulting from endothelial damage, including thrombocytopenia, intravascular hemolysis, acute renal failure, and extra-renal tissue damage. Importantly, approximately 20% of patients experience extra-renal manifestations of disease, including central nervous system, cardiac, gastrointestinal, distal extremity, and severe systemic organ involvement ( Loirat, 2011 ; Brodsky, 2015). Before the availability of eculizumab, mortality rates among patients with aHUS were as high as 15% during the acute progressing phase of the disease ( Noris, 2010; Sellier -Leclerc, 2007). Up to 50% of patients progressed to end- stage kidney disease (ESKD), often within a year of disease onset, and required dialysis or kidney transplant to sustain life. Chronic, uncontrolled terminal complement activation, specifically, activation of complement component 5 (C5) and dysregulation of complement activity, is central to the pathogenesis of aHUS and the devastating manifestations of this disease. As a result, the targeted blockade of C5, with selective inhibition of generation of C5a and C5b- 9, represents an important therapeutic mechanism of treatment. Eculizumab (Soliris ®) is the standard of care for aHUS patients. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity. Eculizumab has no known off- target interactions with other proteins in vitro or in vivo. In addition, eculizumab is predicted to be effectorless, having no detectable binding to complement C1q or most Fcγ receptors (FcγR I, IIb/c IIIa, IIIb) and more than 10-fold weaker binding than an IgG1 isotype to FcγR IIa. Upon binding to the complement protein C5, eculizumab blocks cleavage to C5a and C5b by C5 convertase; which prevents generation of the terminal complement complex C5b- 9. These attributes underlie the established safety and therapeutic efficacy profile of eculizumab as demonstrated in the 3 pivotal Phase 2 clinical studies (C10 -003, C10-004, and C08- 002A/B) and supported by subsequent postmarketing experiences. ALXN1210 and eculizumab are both recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibodies against human complement protein C5 sharing over 99% amino acid sequence homology. The goal of treatment with these complement inhibitors is to achieve immediate, complete, and sustained blockade of terminal complement activity. ALXN1210 is produced in Chinese hamster cells and was designed through minimal targeted engineering to substitute 4 amino acids in the eculizumab heavy chain to extend antibody half- life. These changes are designed to increase the half-life of ALXN1210 relative to eculizumab, increasing the duration of complete terminal complement inhibition, while preserving both the high degree of specificity for binding to C5 and the effectorless nature of the antibody. Two studies of ALXN1210 are ongoing in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who are naïve to t reatment with complement inhibitors. Study ALXN1210- PNH -103 is a Phase 1b, open-label, multiple dose study, and Study ALXN1210 -PNH-201 is a Phase 2, open-label, multiple dose study. ALXN1210- PNH -103 is designed to assess dose ranging over a 2-fold range of trough exposure levels, while Study ALXN1210- PNH- 201 is designed to assess"
25,page_25,"Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -312 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 6 (Global) 16 Jul 2019 Page 25 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL dose intervals of 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks. Each study in patients with PNH also includes a 2- year extension phase. In addition, Study ALXN1210- HV-104 is being conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ALXN1210 in healthy Japanese subjects. Preliminary data from ALXN1210- PNH-103, indicate ALXN1210 treatment resulted in rapid reductions in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in 100% of patients, which were sustained through 2 to 4 monthly dosing intervals, consistent with the extended half- life (t½) of ALXN1210 ( Lee, 2016). There was a notable decrease in the need for blood transfusions. These preliminary LDH data suggest that rapid, complete, and sustained complement inhibition with ALXN1210 results in highly effective blockade of intravascular hemolysis. More information about the PK, mechanism of action, known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated adverse events (AEs) of ALXN1210 may be found in the cur rent edition of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). This amendment is designed to gain experience in adolescent patients switching from eculizumab to ALXN1210. 5.1. Benefits and Risks Assessment 5.1.1. Potential Benefits ALXN1210 and eculizumab are recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibodies that bind the same epitope on complement protein C5 and deliver rapid, sustained, and specific inhibition of C5 activation and the terminal complement cascade through identical mechanisms of action. Due to its close pharmaco logical relationship to eculizumab and specificity for C5, ALXN1210 is anticipated to allow longer dosing intervals while having a safety and efficacy profile similar to eculizumab. While eculizumab is an effective therapy for the treatment of aHUS, chronic administration of the eculizumab regimen may pose an important burden to patients, many of whom have to miss days of work or school to accommodate once- every -2-week treatment. In some cases, patients may refuse treatment or are not compliant due to the f requency of treatment. Practice survey research supports the assumption that less frequent once -every -8-week infusions associated with ALXN1210 will have a positive impact on daily life for patients and their caregivers. 5.1.2. Identified and Potential Risks 5.1.2.1. Meni ngococcal Infection Increased susceptibility to infection caused by N eisseria meningitidis , is a known risk associated with complement inhibition. Similar to eculizumab, the main risk associated with ALXN1210 is the risk of meningococcal infections. Specif ic risk mitigation measures are in place to address this risk, as described in Section 9.8. 5.1.2.2.

Summary of Study Design Study ALXN1210-a HUS -312 is a Phase 3 , open-label, single -treatment arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety , efficacy , PK, and PD of ALXN1210 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion to approximately 23 to 28 pediatric patients, from birth to < 18 years of age , with confirmed diagnosis of aHUS. The study has 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 includes complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients; Cohort 2 includes eculizumab- experienced adolescent pati ents (12 to < 18 years of age). The study consists of 3 periods : a Screening Period (of up to 7 days for Cohort 1 patients or up to 28 days for Cohort 2 patients), a 26-week Initial Evaluation Period , and an Extension Period until the product is registered or approved (in accordance with country-specific regulations) or for up to 4.5 years, whichever occurs first. Figure 1 illustrates the study design. Figure 1: Study Design Schematic for Clinical Protocol ALXN1210 -aHUS -312 Abbreviations: q4w = once every 4 weeks; q8w = once every 8 weeks a The Screening Period is up to 7 days for complement inhibitor treatment -naïve patients (ie, Cohort 1) and up to 28 days for eculizumab -experienced adolescent patients (ie, Cohort 2) . Consenting patients in Cohort 1 will be screened for study eligibility up to 7 days prior to Day 1. Consenting patients in Cohort 2 will be screened for study eligibility up to 28 days prior to Day 1; first dose of study drug will be given 14 days from the eligible patient’s last dose of eculizumab. Patients who are eligible based on the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria will be enrolled into the Initial Evaluation Period and receive a loading dose of ALXN1210 on Day 1, followed by maintenance treatment with ALXN1210 on Day 15 and q8w thereafter for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or once every 4 weeks (q4w) for patients weighing < 20 kg. The loading dose and maintenance dose will be based on the patient’s body weight recorded on Dose Regimen Decision Days ( Table 7). If the Dose Regimen Day is also dosing day, body weight will be recorded predose with dosing that day based on the previous Dose Regimen Day body weight."
32,page_32,"Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -312 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 6 (Global) 16 Jul 2019 Page 32 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL An initial analysis, including review of AL XN1210 PK and serum free C5 levels, will be conducted after 4 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve (ie, Cohort 1) patients weighing ≥ 5 kg to < 40 kg have completed dosing through Day 71. In addition, safety data will be reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Enrollment of patients will proceed without interrup tion while the analysis is ongoing. The primary purpose of this review is to assure patients are achieving adequate complement inhibition during this study with goal of achieving complete terminal complement blockade. Based on this review, i f dose adjustme nt is considered needed and tolerable, subsequent treatment for all patients will continue at the adjusted dose regimen. After the Initial Evaluation Period, patients will roll over into a n Extension Period in which all patients continue their weight- based maintenance dose of ALXN1210 on Day 183 and q8w thereafter for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or q4w for patients weighing < 20 kg, until the product is registered or approved (in accordance with country -specific regulation) or for up to 4.5 years, whichever occurs first . Note, q4w visits during the Extension Period are not applicable for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg and receiving ALXN1210 q8w. The end of trial is defined as the last patient’s last visit or follow -up (whether on site or via phone call) of the 4.5- year Extension Period, whichever is later. 7.2. Discussion of Design This Phase 3, open- label, study will evaluate the PK/PD, efficacy, safety and tolerability of ALXN1210 in the treatment of pediatric patients with aHUS . This amendment is designed to gain experience in adolescent patients switching from eculizumab to ALXN1210. The study has 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 includes complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients; Cohort 2 includes eculizumab -experienced adolescent patient s (12 to < 18 years of age). As the prevalence of newly diagnosed aHUS is lower in adolescents than in adults and younger ages, evaluation of ALXN1210 in an adolescent switch patient cohort (Cohort 2) will provide sufficient safety and PK data in this group to understand the safety and PK profile of ALXN1210 across the range of age groups. Four pediatric age groups were selected to test potential dose regimens across a series of body weight categories for the predicted C max and trough serum concentrations of ALXN1210 . The doses and regimen are expected to result in a complete terminal complement blockade after the first dose for all aHUS patients within each body weight group and to maintain ALXN1210 concentrations below the maximum ALXN1210 concentrations a chieved in Phase 2 . At least 4 patients are planned for the birth to < 2 year, 2 to < 6 year, and 6 to < 12 year age groups. At least 8 patients are planned for the 12 to < 18 year age group. 7.3. Schedule of Assessments The Schedule of Assessments for Screening and the Initial Evaluation Period is shown in Table 1. The Schedule of Assessments for the Extension Period is shown in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4. Refer to the Laboratory Manual for details on the number of samples and volumes for all sampling and tests during the study. An alternative blood sampling schedule for infants, for whom less blood volume should be collected, must be used as detailed in the Study Operations Manual."

Patients will be enrolled and assigned to treatment with ALXN1210 during the Initial Evaluation Period at approximately 70 investigative sites globally. All enrolled patients will also receive ALXN1210 during the 4.5 -year Extension Period. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be rescreened based on discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. Patients may be rescreened a maximum of 2 times. Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. The following entry criteria are applicable for patients in both cohorts unless otherwise noted as specific for Cohort 1 or Cohort 2. 8.1. Inclusion Criteria Patients are eligible for enrollment in the study only if they satisfy all of the following criteria: 1. Patients from birth up to < 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 5 kg at the time of consent who: a. For Cohort 1 patients, have not been previously treated with complement inhibitors b. For Cohort 2 patients, are between 12 and <18 years of age and have been treated with eculizumab according to the labelled dosing recommendation for aHUS for at least 90 days prior to Screening 2. For Cohort 1 patients, evidence of TMA, including thrombocytopenia, evidence of hemolysis, and kidney injury , based on the following laboratory findings: a. Platelet count < 150,000 per microliter (µL) during the Screening Period or within 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period , and b. LDH ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) during the Screening Period or within 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period , and hemoglobin ≤ lower limit of normal (LLN) for age and gender during the Screening Period or within 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period , and c. Serum creatinine level ≥ 97.5th percentile for age ( Appendix B ) at Screening (patients who require dialysis for acute kidney injury are also eligible regardless of serum creatinine level)."

Among patients with onset of TMA postpartum, persistent evidence of TMA for > 3 days after the day of childbirth . 7. To reduce the risk of meningococcal infection ( Neisseria meningitidis ), all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections within 3 years prior to, or at the time of, initiating study drug. Patients who receive a meningococcal vaccine less than 2 weeks before initiating ALXN1210 treatment must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Patients who have not been vaccinated prior to initiating ALXN1210 treatment should receive prophylactic antibiotics prior to and for at least 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination. Patients who cannot be vaccinated must receive antibiotic prophylaxis for the entire treatment period and for 8 months following last dose. 8. Patients must have been vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae according to national and local vaccination schedule guidelines. 9. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must follow protocol-specified guidance ( Section 9.10) for avoiding pregnancy while on treatment and for 8 months after last dose of study drug. 10. Patient’s legal guardian must be willing and able to give written informed consent and the patient must be willing to give written informed assent (if applicable as determined by the central or local Institutional Review Board [IRB]/ Institutional (or Independent) Ethics Committee [IEC]) and comply with the study visit schedule. For Cohort 1, samples collected at Screening may be tested at either a local or central laboratory. If a local laboratory is used to define eligibility, additional samples will be collected during the Screening Period for LDH, platelet count, hemoglobin and serum creatinine and tested at the central laboratory. All analyses in this study will be based on results from the central laboratory (unless the result is missing [see Section 15.12.1]) .

Discontinuation 8.3.1. Early Termination of Patients From the Study The criteria for early termination of patients from the study include: • Withdrawal of consent: A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time. • Patient with prior kidney transplant developing AMR (C4d positive renal biopsy) and for whom rituximab is deemed the appropriate therapy: patient must be terminated from the study and receive standard of care therapy. • Intake of certain prohibited medications as described in Section 9.7. • Patient who is receiving ALXN1210 as a part of retreatment ( Section 8.3.2.1) chooses to discontinue ALXN1210. • The Sponsor Medical Monitor or the Investigator deems it is in the best interest of the patient. During the Initial Evaluation Period, if any of the following occur, patient should be permanently discontinued from ALXN1210 treatment and terminated from the study: • Serious infusion reaction (such as bronchospasm with wheezing or requiring ventilator support, or symptomatic hypotension, refer to Appendix D ) or serum sickness -like reactions manifesting 1 to 14 days after drug administration • Pregnancy or planned pregnancy If a patient terminates from the study early , the Sponsor and site monitor should be notified and an Early Termination (ET) visit (as shown in the Schedule of Assessments, Section 7.3) will be performed as soon as possible. In addition, a Follow-up Phone Call will be performed 8 weeks (56 days) ± 5 days following the patient’s last ALXN1210 dose to collect concomitant medications, nonpharmacological therapies and procedures, and AEs. At the time of the termination, if there is an ongoing AE or an unresolved laboratory result that in the opinion of the Investigator, is significantly outside of the reference range and clinically significant ( Section 11.4 ), the Investigator will attempt to provide follow -up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory result or AE is achieved . The reason for early termination will be recorded on the eCRF . Patients who terminate early from the study will not be replaced."

Discontinuation of ALXN1210 Treatment in the Extension Period and Continuation in the Study In the Extension Period, patients who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment will be allowed to continue in the study for the remainder of the visits without receiving ALXN1210 dosing. Note: In the Initial Evaluation Period, patients who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment will not be allowed to continue in the study. Patients should be permanently discontinued from ALXN1210 treatment if any of the following occur during the study: • Receiving other complement inhibitors (including eculizumab) or undergoing PE/PI after the first dose of study drug (refer to Section 9.7) • Serious infusion reaction (such as bronchospasm with wheezing or requiring ventilator support, or symptomatic hypotension, refer to Appendix D ) or serum sickness -like reactions manifesting 1 to 14 days after drug administration; • Pregnancy or planned pregnancy; or • The Sponsor Medical Monitor or the Investigator deem s it is in the best interest of the patient. The Investigator should notify the Medical Monitor as soon as possible prior to discontinuing a patient’s study treatment and provide the rationale for discontinuing. If a patient is discontinued from ALXN1210 trea tment in the Extension Period, but remains in the study, patient should continue attending his or her scheduled protocol visits per body weight, until Day 1863. During these visits, all assessments except for ALXN1210 administration as described in the Schedule of Assessments, Section 7.3, should be performed. The PK/PD (1 sample at any time) and ADA samples will be collected as per protocol schedule until about 39 weeks after the last dose of ALXN1210. Any patient who discontinues the ALXN1210 treatment in the Extension Period, but remains in the study and develops abnormal TMA parameter (as specified in Section 8.3.2.1) before Day 1863, will have the opportunity for retreatment ( Section 8.3.2.1). If the study drug is discontinued again (after retreatment), then the patient will be terminated from the study and ET procedures and follow-up will be performed as described in Section 8.3.1. The reason for the treatment or study discontinuation will be recorded on the eCRF. If a female patient is permanently discontinued from ALXN1210 treatment due to pregnancy, the Investigator will attempt to follow -up until the outcome of the pregnancy ( Section 11.8 ). 8.3.2.1. Retreatment of Patients Who Discontinue ALXN1210 Treatment in the Extension Period A patient who discontinues ALXN1210 treatment in the Extension Period, but remains in the study, and develops abnormal TMA parameter (as i ndicated by criteria No. 1 below) before Day 1863, may be restarted on ALXN1210, if all 3 conditions below are fulfilled: 1. Evidence of TMA, including thrombocytopenia, evidence of hemolysis, or kidney injury based on any 1 of the following laboratory findings:"

Note: The TMA laboratory parameter must be confirmed on at least 1 repeated measure. The above laboratory results can be obtained at either the central laboratory (preferable) or the site’s local laboratory. 2. The Investigator believes that the patient will potentially benefit from retreatment, initiates a discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor, and provides a medically justified rationale. The Investigator and Medical Monitor mutually agree on retreatment, and the decision is documented. 3. The patient agrees to the consent addendum for retreatment. If the decision to re-treat with ALXN1210 occurs on a scheduled study visit, then dosing may begin on that day. Note: A negative pregnancy test result is required prior to administering any study drug to female patients of childbearing potential. • The p atient will receive a loading dose of ALXN1210 IV based on the body weight (Table 7). All assessments will be performed per the protocol schedule ( Section 7.3). If star t of the retreatment occurs on a visit which does not include PK/PD , ADA, exploratory serum and plasma biomarker, exploratory urine biomarker, hematology, coagulation, or chemistry sample collection, PK/PD samples will be collected predose and at EOI, and ADA, exploratory serum and plasma biomarker, exploratory urine biomarker, hematology, coagulation, and chemistry samples will be collected predose. • Two weeks after the loading dose, the patient will receive a supplemental maintenance dose of ALXN1210 IV at an unscheduled visit, based on the body weight ( Table 7). An abbreviated physical examination will be conducted, vital signs will be collected, predose hematology, coagulation, and chemistry samples will be collected, and the safety card will be reviewed with the patient. Pharmacokinetic/PD samples will be collected predose and at EOI along with a predose ADA sample. • The patient will return to the site for the next 2 maintenance doses of ALXN1210 IV at 3-week (if on q4w regimen) or 7- week (if on q8w regimen) intervals . These visits will correspond to the next 2 scheduled dosing visits per the protocol schedule and will not be considered deviations to the visit windows . At th ese 2 visit s, the patient will receive maintenance doses of ALXN1210 IV and undergo all assessments per the protocol schedule ( Section 7.3), including hematology, coagulation, and chemistry, if not included as a part of this visit, and then continue to attend the visits per the protocol schedule. If the decision to re- treat with ALXN1210 occurs between scheduled study visits, then the below apply. Note: A negative pregnancy test result is required prior to administering any study drug to female patients of childbearing potential. • At an unscheduled visit, a supplemental loading dose of ALXN1210 IV may be administered based on the body weight ( Table 7).

The timing of subsequent visits may be modified to accommodate realignment to the Schedule of Assessment s, these will not be considered deviations to visit windows. 8.3.3. Discontinuation of Study/Site Termination by Sponsor or Health Authority The Sponsor or Health Authority may terminate the study for reasonable cause. Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to: • Discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to patients enrolled in the study • Sponsor decision to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or development of the study drug • Failure of the Investigator to comply with the approved protocol, pertinent guidelines, and/or regulations • Submission of knowingly false information from the Investigator to the Sponsor and/or regulatory authorities Should the study be terminated early, the Sponsor will notify the national competent authority and the IRB/IEC according to local requirements. 8.3.4. Replacements For Cohort 1, i f it is determined at any point that a patient’s Screening data does not satisfy Inclusion Criterion number 2c , Exclusion Criterion number 1, and/or E xclusion Criterion number 2, after receiving at least 1 dose of investigational product (eg, patient local laboratory data used to confirm eligibility criteria are subsequently determined by a central laboratory to no longer meet eligibility criteria), the patient will be discontinued from the study and may be replaced. Early termination procedures will be performed on patients who are terminated early (Section 8.3.1) and all AEs will be collected until 8 weeks ( 56 days) after the patient’s last dose of study drug ( Section 11.7.6.1). As described in Section 15.3, the Full Analysis Set (FAS) for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be based on a modified intent to treat (mITT) approach, and the patients discontinued from the study for the reasons described above will be excluded from the FAS . The aim of the replacement process is to yield a FAS that includes the planned number of patients all satisfying key inclusion and exclusion criteria."

ALXN1210 will be administered as a n IV infusion. ALXN1210 must NOT be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. The dose regimen for ALXN1210 during the Initial Evaluation Period is based on the patient’s body we ight recorded on Dose Regimen Decision Days ( Table 7). If the Dose Regimen Day is also dosing day, body weight will be recorded predose with dosing that day based on the previous Dose Regimen Day body weight. Patients will receive a loading dos e of ALXN1210 on Day 1 , followed by maintenance dosing of ALXN1210 on Day 15 and q8w thereafter for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or q4w for patients weighing < 20 kg. For Cohort 2 patients, Day 1 of study treatment will occur 14 days from the patient’s last dose of eculizumab.

59,page_59,"Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -312 Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc. Amendment 6 (Global) 16 Jul 2019 Page 59 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL 9.4. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study The weight- based dosages of ALXN1210 in this study ( Table 7) are premised on PK/PD data from early development studies in healthy adult volunteers as well as the available data from patients with PNH in an ongoing Phase 1b dose-finding study (ALXN1210 -PNH-103) and an ongoing Phase 2 proof- of-concept study (ALXN1210- PNH-201). The selection of ALXN1210 dose regimen for patients with aHUS is based on targeting immediate, complete and sustained inhibition of terminal complement in patients with PN H, which is expected to correspond to immediate, complete and sustained inhibition of terminal complement in patients with aHUS. As stated in Section 7.1, a planned initial analysis of ALXN1210 PK and serum free C5 levels was conducted after 4 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve (ie, Cohort 1) patients weighing ≥ 5 kg to < 40 kg completed dosing through Day 71. Based on the results of this analysis, the loading dose for patients ≥ 5 to < 10 kg has changed by way of this amendment from 300 mg to 600 mg. 9.5. Special Treatment Considerations Infusion of other monoclonal antibodies has been associated with infusion reactions, with onset typically during or shortly after completion of the infusion. Please refer to Appendix D for guidance on identifying and managing potential drug infusion reactions. 9.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Nonpharmacologic Procedures Prior medications (including vitamins and herbal preparations)—including those discussed in the exclusion criteria (Section 8.2) and procedures (any therapeutic intervention, such as surgery/biopsy or physical therapy) the patient takes or undergoes within 28 days prior to the start of Screening until the first dose of ALXN1210—will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF. In addition, history of meningococcal vaccination must be collected for the 3 years prior to first dose of study drug, and for patients < 18 years of age at the time of enrollment, vaccination history for Hib and Streptococcus pneumoniae must be collected from birth. All medication use and procedures undertaken during the study will be recorded in the patient’s source document/medical chart and eCRF. This record will include all prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, over- the-counter medications, and current medications. Concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded from the first infusion of study drug through 56 days after the patient’s last dose of study drug. Any changes in concomitant medications also will be recorded in the patient’s source document/medical chart and eCRF. Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the patient’s standard of care during the study, or for the treatment of any AE, along with the allowed medications described below may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding all medications are recorded in full in the patient’s source document/medical chart and eCRF. A Follow-up Phone Cal l to collect concomitant medications, procedures, and adverse events is required 8 weeks (56 days) ± 5 days after the patient’s last dose of ALXN1210 in the following circumstances: 1. Patient terminates from the study early."

Patient completes the study on the q4w regimen and does not initiate commercially available aHUS treatment within 8 weeks of their last ALXN1210 dose. 9.7. Prohibited Medications and Procedures Patients are prohibited from receiving any of the following medications and procedures at any time after the first dose of study drug for all patients in the study (even those who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment in the Extension Period, but remain in the study) until completion of the study or early termination of the patient from the study: • Eculizumab or other complement inhibitors • Use of any other investigational drug or device as part of a clinical trial • IVIg (unless for an unrelated medical need e.g. hypogammaglobinemia) • Rituximab • PE/PI • New dialysis with in the first 48 -hour period following the first dose of ALXN1210 unless there is a compelling medical need as assessed by ( 1) hypervolemia unresponsive to diuretics, (2) refractory electrolyte imbalance, or (3) new-onset uremic encephalopathy. Exceptions must be approved prior to administration of dialysis on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor. The following concomitant medications and procedures are allowed under certain circumstances and with the following restrictions: • Use of other immunosuppressive therapies (such as steroids, mTORi [eg, sirolimus, everolimus], CNI [eg, cyclosporine or tacrolimus]) during the study are not allowed unless: a) part of an established post- transplant antirejection regime, or b) patient has confirmed anti-complement factor antibodies requiring immunosuppressive therapy, or c) steroids are being used for a condition other than aHUS (eg, asthma), or d) steroids initiated empirically prior to enrollment and are being tapered as standard of care. Any patients receiving other complement inhibitors (including eculizumab) or undergoing PE/PI after the first dose of study drug will be withdrawn from the study. 9.8. Vaccination Due to its mechanism of action, the use of ALXN1210 increases the patient’s susceptibility to infection. To reduce the risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated against N. meningitidis , Hib, and Streptococcus pneumoniae . Patients must be vaccinated against N. meningitidis within 3 years prior to, or at the time of, receiving the first dose of ALXN1210. Patients who will be treated with drug less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines against serotypes A, C, Y, W135, and B, where available, are recommended to prevent common pathogenic meningococcal serotypes."

It is recognized that some patients who have not been vaccinated against N. meningitidis within 3 years prior to receiving the first dose of ALXN1210 may not be able to recei ve a vaccination at the time of the first dose. Patients who have not been vaccinated prior to initiating ALXN1210 treatment should receive prophylactic antibiotics prior to and for at least 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination. Patients who cannot be vaccinated must receive antibiotic prophylaxis for the entire treatment period and for 8 months following last dose. Vaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infection. Consideration should be given per official guidance and local practice on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. All patients should be monitored for early signs of meningococcal infection, evaluated immediately if infection is suspected, and treated with appropriate antibiotics, if necessary. To increase risk awareness and promote quick disclosure of any potential signs or symptoms of infection experienced by the patients during the course of the study, patients will be provided a safety card to carry with them at all times and for 8 months after last dose of ALXN1210. Additional discussion and explanation of the potential risks, signs, and symptoms will occur at specific time points as part of the review of the patient safety card and throughout the study as described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). Patients must be vaccinated against Hib and Streptococcus pneumoniae according to national and local vaccination schedule guidelines, prior to, or at the time of, receiving the first dose of ALXN1210. Vaccination status for N. meningitidis , Hib , and S. pneumoniae will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF. 9.9. Treatment Compliance Patients will be administered study drug in a controlled setting under the supervision of the Investigator or designee, thereby ensuring compliance with study drug administration. The Investigator or designee will ensure that all patients are adequately informed on the specific dosing regimen required for compliance with the study protocol, ensure that the patient receives the appropriate dose at the designated time points during the study and that adequate safety monitoring occurs during the infusion ( Section 9.5). 9.10.

SAFETY ASSESSMENTS The I nvestigator or his/her designee will meet with patients/caregivers to discuss the potential safety risks of ALXN1210 and to give the Investigator the opportunity to address any of the patient’s safety concerns regarding the study. The collection of AEs will be monitored from the time informed consent is obtained until study completion. Investigators are inst ructed to follow any AEs through to their conclusion (resolution or stabilization) as described in Section 11.7.6. In the event of patient withdrawal from the study, AE monitoring should continue through the last patient’s last study visit if possible. The timing of the clinical and laboratory assessments to be performed is specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). Any clinically significant abnormal results should be followed until resolution or stabilization. 11.1. Demographic/Medical History 11.1.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics A review of demographic parameters, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity will be performed. A complete medical history will be taken and documented. Weight and height will be recorded. 11.1.2. Disease Characteristics The patient’s aHUS medical history, including onset of first aHUS symptom and date of diagnosis, will be documented at the Screening V isit. 11.1.3. Medical History The patient’s medical history, including prior and concomitant conditions/disorders, will be recorded at the Screening Visit. Medication (prescription or over- the-counter, including vitamins and/or herbal supplements) use within 28 days prior to the start of Screening will also be recorded. Meningococcal vaccination within 3 years prior to the first dose of study drug, and vaccination history for Hib and Streptococcus pneumoniae from birth , will also be recorded, as described in Section 9.6. For Cohort 2 patients, medical history should be used to document ADAMTS13, Shiga toxin status, and direct Coombs at the previous TMA event, if available. 11.2. Physical Examinations A physical examination will include the following assessments: general appearance; skin; head, ear, eye, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes; chest; heart; abdominal cavity; limb; central nervous system; and musculoskeletal system. An abbreviated physical examination c onsists of a body system relevant examination based upon Investigator (or qualified designee) judgment and patient symptoms. Physical growth (height, weight, and head circumference [the latter only in patients ≤ 2 years of age] ) will be assessed."

Vital Sig ns Vital sign measurements will be taken after the patient has been resting for at least 5 minutes, and will include systolic and diastolic BP (millimeters of mercury [mmHg]), pulse oximetry, heart rate (beats/minute), respiratory rate (breaths/minute), an d temperature (degrees Celsius [°C] or degrees Fahrenheit [°F]). 11.4. Laboratory Assessments Samples for serum pregnancy, hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis will be performed at the times specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). Specific laboratory assessments are provided in Appendix E . Samples for laboratory assessments will be collected before each study drug administration. An alternative blood sampling schedule for infants, for whom less blood volume should be collected, must be used as detailed in the Study Operations Manual. For Cohort 1, samples collect ed at Screening may be tested at either a local or central laboratory. If a local laboratory is used to define eligibility, additional samples will be collected during the Screening Period for LDH, platelet count, hemoglobin and serum creatinine and tested at the central laboratory. All analyses in this study will be based on results from the central laboratory (unless the result is missing [see Section 15.12.1]) . If Cohort 1 patients are found not to satisfy the eligibility criteria for serum creatinine (Inclusion Criterion 2c) based on central laboratory results, they must not be enrolled into the study; if the subject has received the first dose of ALXN1210 , the patient must be withdrawn from the study, and may be replaced. For Cohort 1 patients, laboratory results for Exclusion Criterion number 1 and/or Exclusion Criterion number 2 may not be ava ilable prior to first dose. Later results for Exclusion Criterion number 1 and/or Exclusion Criterion number 2 could lead to discontinuation and replacement of the patient (please refer to Section 8.3 for potential discontinuation and replacement details). For Cohort 2, samples collected at Screening must be tested at a central laboratory; however, historical test results via chart review should be utilized for Inclusion Criterion 3 and Exclusion Criteria 1, 2, 3, and 24. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for time windows for collection and detailed instructions for collecting, processing, storing, and shipping blood samples for safety assessments. Laboratory reports will be made available to the Investigators in a timely manner for clinical management of patients. It is anticipated that some laboratory values may be outside the normal value range due to the underlying disease. The Investigator s should use their medical judgment when assessing the clinical significance of these values. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in laboratory measurements that has medical relevance and which results in a change in medical care. If clinically significant laboratory changes from baseline value are noted, the changes will be documented as AEs on the AE eCRF. The Investigator will also assess the relationship to study treatment for all clinically significant out- of-range values ( Section 15.9.3). The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient through additional laboratory assessments until (1) values have returned to the normal range or baseline level, or (2) in the judgment of the Investigator, values that are outside the normal range are not related to the administration of study drug or other protocol- specific procedures."

Pregnancy Screen For females of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test (ie, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [β -hCG]) will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments (Section 7.3). 11.4.2. Hematology Blood samples will be analyzed for the hematology parameters listed in Appendix E . 11.4.3. Serum Chemistry Blood samples will be analyzed for the serum chemistry parameters listed in Appendix E . Indirect bilirubin is calculated from total and direct bilirubin values; therefore, indirect bilirubin results will not be available if direct bilirubin is below the limit of quantification. Chemistry assessments will be performed at the time points specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). The eGFR will be calculated for all visits at which serum chemistries are collected using the Schwartz formula. 11.4.4. Coagulation Blood samples will be analyzed for the coagulation parameters listed in Appendix E . 11.4.5. Urinalysis and Urine Chemistry Urine samples will be analyzed for the parameters listed in Appendix E . A microscopic examination of urine samples will be performed if the results of the macroscopic analysis are abnormal. Urine samples will also be analyzed to measure proteins and creatinine in order to calculate the urine t otal protein:creatinine ratio. 11.5. Electrocardiograms For each patient, single 12- lead digital ECGs will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collection and remain supine but awake during ECG collection. The Investigator or designee will be responsible for reviewing the ECG to assess whether the ECG is within normal limits and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be indicated on the CRF. For any clinically significant abnormal ECG results, the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the patient’s continued eligibility to participate in this protocol. 11.6. Immunogenicity Blood samples will be collected to test for presence and titer of ADAs to ALXN1210 in serum prior to study drug administration as indicated in t he Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). Further characterization of antibody responses may be conducted as appropriate, including binding and neutr alizing antibodies, to PK/PD, safety, and activity of ALXN1210."

Adverse Event Management An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (eg, hospitalization for elective surgery if planned before the start of the study, admissions for social reasons or convenience), and anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not w orsen are not AEs. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish drug effect. A medication error (including intentional misuse, abuse, and overdose of the product) or use other than what is defined in the protocol is not considered an AE unless there is an untoward medical occurrence as a result of a medication error. Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposure to investigational product are to be reported within 24 hours of Investigator/site awareness . Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding will be collected for regulatory reporting and safety evaluation. Adverse events should be recorded from the time of signed consent. An AE reported after informed consent but before study drug administration will be considered a pretreatment AE. Alexion has reporting standards for AEs that are to be followed as described in Section 11.7.6 regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent. 11.7.1. Targeted Adverse Events The following events are important identified risks in this study: • Meningococcal infections 11.7.2. Severity Assessment The severity of AEs will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ) version 4.03 or higher. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. Each CTCAE term is a Lowest Level Term ( LLT) per the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activ ities (MedDRA ®). Each LLT will be coded to a MedDRA preferred term (PT) . Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE assigns a grade of 1 through 5, with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE ( Table 8)."

Grade 5 Death related to AE. Abbreviations: ADL = activities of daily living; AE = adverse event a Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. b Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. Any change in the severity of an AE should be documented based on specific guidelines in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. Severity and seriousness must be differentiated: severity describes the intensity of an AE, while the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met specific criteria for a SAE as described in Section 11.7.4. 11.7.3. Causality Assessment An Investigator must provide a causality assessment (Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Definite) fo r all AEs (both serious and nonserious) based upon the Investigator’s medical judgment and the observed sym ptoms associated with the event (Table 9). This assessment must be recorded on the eCRF and any additional forms as appropriate. Table 9: Causality Assessment Descriptio ns Assessment Description Not Related/Unrelated Suggests that there is no causal association between the investigational product and the reported event. Unlikely Related Suggests that the clinical picture is highly consistent with a cause other than the investigational product but attribution cannot be made with absolute certainty and a relationship between the investigational product and AE cannot be excluded with complete confidence. Possibly Related Suggests that treatment with the investigational pro duct may have caused or contributed to the AE (ie, the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the investigational product, but could also have been produced by other fact ors). Probably Related Suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with the investigational product administration exists and the likely causal association of the event with the investigational product. This will be based upon the known pharmacological action of the investigational product, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the investigational product or class of drugs, or judgment based on the Investigator ’s clinical experience. Definitely Related Temporal relationship to the investigational produc t, other conditions (concurrent illness, concurrent medication reaction, or progression/expression of disease state) do not appear to explain event, corresponds with the known pharmaceutical profile, improvement on discontinuation, reappearance on rechalle nge."

Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: • Results in death • Is life -threatening (ie, patient was at risk of death at the time of the event) • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization , may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. The expectedness of an SAE will be determined by Alexion, based on the current version of the IB. Information pertaining to the collection and reporting of SAEs is provided in Section 11.7.6. 11.7.5. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspec ted unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the Investigator identifies as related to investigational product or procedure. United States Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or national regulatory requirements in participating countries require the reporting of SUSARs. Alexion has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expe dited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regulations and the associated detailed guidances. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the national competent authority and IRBs /IECs where applicable. 11.7.6. Collection and Reporting of Adverse Events 11.7.6.1. All Adverse Events All AEs (serious and nonserious) will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until 8 weeks ( 56 days ) after the last dose of study drug. For patients who discontinue study drug, but remain in the study, AE data collection will continue at subsequent visits per the Schedule of Assessments, until the patient’s last visit. For patients who terminate early from the study, an ET visit will be conducted as soon as possible, and a Follow-up Phone C all will be performed 8 weeks ( 56 days) ± 5 days following the patient’s last dose of the study drug. All AEs must be recorded on the eCRF upon the Investigator or his/her staff becoming aware of their occurrence. Investigators will be instructed to report the SAE including their assessment (eg, severity, seriousness, and potential relatedness to study drug) to Alexion Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV) within 24 hours of first awareness of the event via the Safety Gateway ."

Serious Adverse Events All SAEs will be recorded regardless of the Investigator ’s assessment of causality. No time limit exists on reporting SAEs that are thought to be causally related to the study drug. Inve stigators are at liberty to report S AEs irrespective of causality at any time. For all SAEs, the Investigator must provide the following: • Appropriate and requested follow- up information in the time frame detailed below • Causality of the SAE(s) • Treatment of /intervention for the SAE(s) • Outcome of the SAE(s) • Supporting medical records and laboratory/diagnostic information All SAEs must be reported to Alexion GPV within 24 hours of the Investigator or site staff awareness. These timelines for reporting SAE information to the sponsor need to be followed for the initial SAE report and for all follow -up SAE information . The Investigator or designee must record the SAE data in the eCRF and verify the accuracy of the information with corresponding source documents . The SAE report should be submitted electronically via the Safety Gateway . In the event that either the electronic data capture ( EDC) or the Safety Gateway is unavailable at the site(s) , the SAE must be reported on paper. Facsimile transmission or emai l may be used in the event of electronic submission failure. Email: Facsimile: (NOTE: A local facsimile number will be provided for non- US sites) When further information becomes available, the eCRF should be updated with the new information and an updated SAE report should be submitted to Alexion GPV via Safety Gateway .

Investigator Reporting Requirements The Investigator must fulfill all local regulatory obligations required for the study Investigators. It is the PI’s responsibility to notify the IRB /IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site , as required per IRB/IEC SOPs . Investigators will also be notified of all SUSAR events that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB/IEC of these additional SAEs as per IRB/IEC S OPs. 11.8. Exposure During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Pregnancy data will be collected during this study for all patients and female spouse/partner of male patients. Exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in utero) can be the result of either maternal exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following paternal exposure. For all Alexion products, both in development or postapproval, exposure during pregnancy must be recorded and the pregnancy followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (ie, spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality), even if the patient discontinues study drug or withdraws from the study. If a female patient or a patient’s female partner becomes pregnant during the conduct of this study, the Investigator must submit the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome/Breastfeeding” form to Alexion GPV via fax or email ( Section 11.7.6.2). When the outcome of the pregnancy becomes known, the form should be updated and submitted to Alexion GPV. If additional follow-up is required, the Investigator will be requested to provide the information. Exposure of an infant to an Alexion product during breastfeeding must also be reported (via the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form/Breastfeeding”) and any AEs experienced by the infant must be reported to Alexion Global Pharmacovigilance or designee via e mail or facsimile (Section 11.7.6). Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. However, complications of pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy are AEs and may meet the criteria for an SAE (eg, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly). Elective abortions without complications should not be reported as AEs. 11.9. Safety Monitoring The Alexion medical monitor, G PV physician, or both will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study. Alexion will review all information pertaining to the SAEs within the time frames mandated by company procedures.

STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSES The analyses for complement inhibitor treatment- naïve patients (ie, Cohort 1) and eculizumab - experienced adolescent patients (ie, Cohort 2) will be conducted and reported separately. Analyses specific to Cohort 1 are indicated as such below; all other endp oints will be performed for both cohorts. Tabulated summaries will not include a direct comparison between Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. 15.1. General Considerations All data collected will be presented in summary tables and tabulations. All data, as well as any outcomes derived from the data, will be presented in detailed data listings. Graphical displays may also be provided, when appropriate. All analyses will be performed using SAS ® release, version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) or other validated statistical software. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including number of observations and mean, standard deviation (SD) , median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency co unts and percentage of patients. Prior to finalizing and locking the database, all decisions concerning the inclusion or exclusion of data from the analysis for each patient will be determined by appropriate medical and statistical personnel. Any and all exclusions will be documented in patient listings. Planned summaries will be presented overall and by age groups when applicable. Details of the statistical analyses described below will be specified in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) before database lock and analysis. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment only if it changes the primary or key secondary objectives or the study conduct. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol or SAP, and the justification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report (CSR). Additional exploratory analyses of the data may be conducted as deemed appropriate. An interim CSR will be prepared when 12 to 14 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve (ie, Cohort 1) patients have completed or withdrawn from the end of the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period . An additional interim CSR will be prepared when all study patients have completed or withdrawn from the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period. Each interim CSR will include efficacy, safety , and PK /PD analyses. A final CSR to summarize long -term efficacy, safety , and PK /PD will be produced at study completion. Available exploratory data will be summarized after study completion but may not be included in the CSR. For patients who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment in the Extension Period, but remain in the study, their data will be summarized along with data from patients remaining on treatment for 8 weeks (56 days) after their last dose of study drug. Data beyond this point will be presented in separate supplemental listings strictly limited to these patients. If such patients start retreatment with ALXN1210, their data from the time of study treatment restart will also be presented in separate supplemental listings limited to patients who will have the study treatment restarted . However, data on AE, concomitant medications, and nonpharmacologic therapies and procedures from the time of treatment restart will be considered treatment emergent or"

Amendment 6 (Global) 16 Jul 2019 Page 78 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL concomitant, and will be summarized as such, combined with data from patients who remained on treatment throughout the study. Pharmacokinetic/PD and ADA data from patients who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment in the Extension Period, but remain in the study, will be summarized along with data from patients remaining on treatment, until 8 weeks (56 days) after their last dose o f study drug. Data beyond this point will be presented in separate supplemental listings limited to these patients. If such patients start retreatment with ALXN1210, their PK/PD and ADA data from the time of study treatment restart will also be presented i n separate supplemental listings limited to patients who will have the study treatment restarted . 15.2. Determination of Sample Size The total planned sample size is approximately 23 to 28. This sample size is deemed appropriate to get proper representation in each of the 4 planned age groups and provide adequate safety information and precision level for the planned estimation. 15.3. Analysis Sets Efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS. The analysis of the FAS will be the primary analysis. The FAS for Cohort 1 will be based on a mITT approach . With this approach, confirmation of eligibility in patients may occur after receiving study drug. This specifically applies to Inclusion Criterion number 2c (must be confirmed via a central laboratory), Exclusion Criterion number 1 (may be confirmed via a central or local laboratory), and Exclusion Criterion number 2 (may be confirmed via a central or local laboratory). Based on the above, the FAS will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210, have at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment, and meet all of the following criteria: • Patients who satisfy Inclusion Criterion number 2c • Patients who satisfy Exclusion Criterion number 1 • Patients who satisfy Exclusion Criterion number 2 The FAS for Cohort 2 will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210 and have at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment. The FAS will be determined prior to database lock and prior to the database snapshot for the analysis performed at the end of the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period . Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Set, defined as all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Pharmacokinetic and PD analyses will be performed on all patients from the FAS who have evaluable PK and PD data. 15.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including medical history and transplant history, will be summarized for the FAS and Safety Set for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2."

Patient Disposition All patients will be included in the summaries of patient disposition, which will describe the frequency and percentage of patients enrolled and treated and who completed or withdrew from the study, along with reason for withdrawal from the study. The numbers of patients who are treated, discontinue treatment (along with reason for treatment discontinuation), complete or withdraw from the Initial Evaluation Period (along with reason for withdrawal), enter the Extension Period, and complete or withdra w from the Extension Period (along with reason for withdrawal ) will be tabulated. These summaries will be presented for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. 15.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Nonp harmaco logic Therapies and Procedures Each patient’s prior and c oncomitant medication use will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary, and the frequency and percentage of concomitant medications will be summarized. Medications will be summarized by Anatomic-Therapeutic- Chemical (ATC) class and preferred drug name using frequency counts and percentages of patients in the FAS and Safety S et for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. 15.7. Treatment Compliance The number of infusions received per patient will be tabulated for the FAS and Safety S et for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. 15.8. Efficacy Analyses All efficacy analyses will be conducted for the FAS. The FAS is the primary analysis set for all efficacy analyses. 15.8.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis The primary efficacy endpoint is Complete TMA Response during the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period. The primary analysis will consist in estimating the proportion of complete TMA responders among ALXN1210 treated patients. This will be performed by calculating the point estimate and a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the proportion of complete TMA responders in ALXN12 10 treated patients. The CI will be based on exact confidence limits using the Clopper-Pearson method. This analysis will only be performed for Cohort 1. 15.8.2. Key Secondary Effica cy Analyses 15.8.2.1. Dialysis Requirement Status For patients requiring dialysis within 5 days prior to ALXN1210 treatment initiation, the proportion of patients no longer requiring dialysis will be summarized over time. A 2 -sided 95% CI for the proportion receiving dialysis will be provided for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2."

BLOOD SAMPLING VOLUM ES The following procedures for blood collection should be adhered to: 1. Number of attempts: The number of attempts for sampling blood is limited to 3 times per day. This means that, after 3 punctures for collection of blood have been performed and no or insufficient blood could be collected, no other puncture will be done on the same day. 2. Volume of blood samples: Per study patient, the study- related blood loss (including any losses in the collection procedure) should not exceed 3% of the total blood volume during a period of 4 weeks, and should not exceed 1% at any single time. The total volume of blood is estimated at 80 to 90 mL/kg body weight. Three percent (3%) is 2.4 mL blood per kg of body weight. If an investigator decides to deviate from these limits, the deviation must be fully documented, and the investigator should provide justification for the deviation. If the required blood volume cannot be obtained, due to the above mentioned safety limits, priority will be given to safety -relevant investigations. 3. EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream/plaster: To minimize the possible pain and discomfort due to collection of blood, the Investigator should apply an EMLA cream/pl aster at the puncture site.

Criteriaa,b,c Histologic evidence of acute tissue inj ury, including one or more of the following: Microvascular inflammation (g score > 0d and/or ptc score > 0) Intimal or transmural arteritis (v score > 0)e Acute thrombotic microangiopathy, in the absence of any other cause Acute tubular injury, in the absence of any other apparent cause Evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with vascular endothelium, including at least one of the following: Linear C4d staining in peritubular capillaries (involving at least 10% of ptc by immunofluorescence on frozen sections, or any ptc by IHC on paraffin sections) At least moderate microvascular inflammation (sum of g and ptc scores ≥ 2)f Increased expression of gene transcripts in the biopsy tissue indicative of endothelial injury, if thoroughly validatedg Serologic evidence of donor -specific antibodies (HLA or other antigens) Source: Haas, 2014a a For all antibody -mediated rejection (ABMR) diagnoses, it should be specified in the report whether the lesion is C4d-positive [involving ≥ 10% of ptc by immunofluorescence on frozen sections or any ptc by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on paraffin sections] or without evident C4d deposition (< 10% of ptc by immunofluorescence on frozen sections; completely negative by IHC on paraffin sections). b These lesions may be clinically acute, smoldering, or subclinical. Biopsies showing 2 of the 3 features, except those with donor -specific antibody ( DSA ) and C4d without histologic abnormalities potentially related to AMR or cell-mediated rejection (the latter seen main ly in ABO -incompatible renal allografts) may be designated as ‘suspicious’ for acute/active ABMR. c Modified from Haas, 2014b. d Recurrent/de -novo glomerulonephritis should be excluded. e It should be noted that these arterial lesions may be indicative of ABMR, T -cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), or mixed ABMR/TCMR. Arterial lesions are only scored in arteries having a continuous media with 2 or more smooth muscle layers. f In the presence of acute TCMR, borderline infiltrates, or evidence of infection, ptc score at least 2 alone is not sufficient to define moderate microvascular inflammation, and glomerulitis must be present (g score ≥ 1). g At present, the only validated molecular marker meeting this criterion is ENDAT expression, and this has only been vali dated in a single center (University of Alberta). The use of ENDAT expression at other centers or other test(s) of gene expression within the biopsy as evidence of ABMR must first undergo independent validation as was done for ENDAT expression by Sis, 2009."

MANAGEMENT OF POTENT IAL DRUG INFUSION REACTIONS Infusion of other monoclonal antibodies has been associated with infusion reactions, with onset typically during or shortly after completion of the infusion. For this reason, patients will be carefully observed during each infusion. Patients who develop AEs of rash, hives, itching, or dysphagia of mild to moderate intensity during their infusion of ALXN1210 may continue to receive the infusion if deemed to be medically appropriate by the Investigator. Medic al intervention may include, but is not limited to, slowing of the infusion rate (with or without treatment) or interrupting or stopping the infusion. Any acute reaction should be treated according to standard medical practice depending upon clinical sign s and symptoms. If a patient requires medical intervention, the patient should remain at the investigational site until his or her condition stabilizes. The AE and any associated concomitant medications must be captured on the patient’s source document and eCRF. Some patients treated with IV infusions of monoclonal antibodies have experienced concurrent reactions with signs or symptoms that can be classified as acute allergic reactions/hypersensitivity reactions or cytokine release syndrome. Signs and symptoms include headache, fever, facial flushing, pruritus, myalgia, nausea, chest tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, erythema, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, shivers, hypertension, lightheadedness, hypotension, palpitations, and somnolence. Anaphylaxis might occur at any time during an infusion; therefore, patients will be monitored closely during the infusion. In addition, the re- administration of some monoclonal antibodies has been associated with serum sickness- like reactions manifesting 1 to 14 days after drug administration. All AEs that may indicate an infusion- related response will be graded according to CTCAE Version 4.0 3 or higher. Before any infusion is started, the treating physician and other appropriate personnel must make certain that medication (ie, adrenaline, inhaled beta agonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids) and other equipment to treat anaphylaxis are readily available. The infusion must be stopped immediately if Grade ≥ 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (including drug fever) or Grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome/acute infusion reaction occurs. The sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of any infusion reaction requiring interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Patients who experience a reaction during the administration of study drug should be treated according to institutional guidelines. For a Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion reaction, the infusion should be temporarily stopped and treatment with an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg orally [PO] or equivalent) and acetaminophen (650 mg orally or equivalent) may be considered. If the patient’s signs and symptoms have resolved (with or without administration of the above medication), the infusion may be restarted. However, the patients should be infused at a slower rate and be monitored closely for any signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during the remainder of the infusion. Patients experiencing an infusion reaction should be observed in the clinic until resolution of the reaction, or until the Investigator determines the patient is no longer at risk. Patients who experience a severe reaction during administration of study drug resulting in disc ontinuation of study drug should undergo all scheduled safety, PK, and PD evaluations required by the protocol."

Amendment 6 (Global) 16 Jul 2019 Page 93 of 96 CONFIDENTIAL If anaphylaxis occurs according to the criteria listed below, then administration of subcutaneous epinephrine (1/1000, 0.3 to 0.5 mL, or equival ent) should be considered. In the case of bronchospasm, treatment with an inhaled beta agonist also should be considered. Patients administered an antihistamine for the treatment or prevention of an infusion reaction should be given appropriate warnings about drowsiness and impairment of driving ability before being discharged from the center. Table 10: Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any 1 of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: 1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula), and at least 1 of the following: a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow (PEF), hypoxemia) b. Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end- organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 2. Two or more of the following that occur rap idly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula) b. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze/bronchospasm, stridor, r educed PEF, hypoxemia) c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline Source: Sampson, 2006 Abbreviations: BP= blood pressure; PEF = peak expiratory flow"
