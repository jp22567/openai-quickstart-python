16,page_16,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 16 INTRODUCTION 1. Coronavirus (CoVs) are positive -sense single stranded enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA ) viruses, many of which are commonly found in humans and cause mild symptoms. Over the past two decades, emerging pathogenic CoVs capable of causing life-threatening disease in humans and animals have been identified, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS - CoV-1) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV). In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (Wuhan, China) identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients. This novel coronavirus has been abbreviated as SARS -CoV-2 and has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS -like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS -CoV-11. Initial ly, most of the infections outside China were travel -associated cases in those who had recently visited Wuhan City and were thought to have acquired the virus through contact with infected animals or contact with infected people . There has subsequently been global spread of the virus, including local (human -to-human) spread in many countries, including Canada. This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS -CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus has been designated COVID -19. Outbreak forecasting and mathematical modelling suggest that the number of people with COVID -19 will continue to rise in m any countries over the coming weeks to months2. Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID - 19 have intensified. There is an urgent public heal th need for rapid development of novel interventions. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus infections. Few treatment studies have been conducted because most human coronavirus strains cause self-limited disease and manageme nt is supportive care. Immunologic response to SARS -CoV-2 1.1. Much is still unknown concerning the immune response to SARS -Cov-2 viral infection both in normal individuals and in those that develop severe disease. A previous study of patients with severe S ARS-CoV-1 infection found that recovered patients had higher and sustainable levels of both N protein ‐specific and S glycoprotein ‐specific neutralizing antibody responses compared to those who succumbed to the disease3. This suggests that antibody responses likely plays an important role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of SARS ‐CoV‐infected patients. Immunologic senescence is also a hypothesis to explain the increased risk of complication of death or complication in the elderly population4. The details of how t his inappropriate humoral response translates to the severe inflammatory phenotype observed in complicating cases are still unknown5. One hyp othesis is that inefficient clearance of virus leads to disproportionate activation of cellular and innate immunity mechanisms, similar to macrophage activation syndromes seen with viral infections in patients suffering from hemophagocytic lymphohistiocyto sis. In fact, ineffective non neutralizing antibodies"
17,page_17,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 17 against SARS -CoV-1 have been shown to worsen the inflammatory state by contributing to macrophage response activation and skewing6. Most therapies currently under investigation for COVID -19 are aimed either at neutralizing the virus (e.g. remdesivir) or at preventing this disproportionate inflammatory response, with ARDS and cytokine storm (e.g. anti -IL-6). Given the suspected link between dysfunction al humoral response and COVID -19 complications, passive immuni zation approach es with hyperimmune produc ts or convalescent plasma could potentially do both and constitute a promising therapeutic avenue for severe COVID -19. Passive immunization 1.2. Passive immunization consists in the transfer of antibodies from immunized donor to non - immunized individual in ord er to transfer transient protection against an infective agent. A physiological example of passive immunization is the transfer of maternal IgG antibodies to the foetus through the placenta to confer humoral protection to newborns in the first years of lif e. Passive immunization differs from active immunization in which the patient develops their own immune response following contact with the infective agent or vaccine. Passive antibody therapy was used as early as the late 19th century to treat certain in fectious diseases prior to the development of antimicrobial therapy in the 1940s7,8. Convalescent plasma was also used in the 2013 African Ebola epidemic. A small non -randomized study in Si erra Leone showed an improvement in survival with convalescent whole blood9 but another study with convalescent plasma showed no improvement in survival10. Experience from prior outbreaks with other coronaviruses, such as SARS -CoV-1 finds that convalescent plasma contains neutralizing antibodies to the relevant virus11. Viral neutralization is a mechanism whereby antibodies directed against viral surface antigens prevent their interaction with receptors on host cells and fusion of membranes of action of passive immunisation12. However, other mechanisms may be possible, such as antibody dependent -cellular cytotoxicity , phagocytosis or virolysis . The relative importance of these mechanisms in passive immunization or in normal defenses against SARS -CoV-2 is unknown. Importantly, studies in HIV have shown that results of assays testing these various function s (e.g. neutralization vs antibody -dependent cytoxicity) may not always correlate and may be complementary 13,14. Experience with the use of convalescent plasma against other coronavirus diseases 1.3. In the 21st century, there were two other epidemics wi th coronaviruses that were associated with high mortality, SARS -CoV-1 in 2003 and MERS -CoV in 2012. In both outbreaks, the high mortality and absence of effective therapies led to the use of convalescent plasma. The largest study involved a cohort of 80 p atients with severe SARS -CoV-1 pneumonia deteriorating despite methylprednisolone in Hong Kong15. The convalescent plasma dose of 4 -5mL/kg was well tolerated in all patients and 33 (41%) were discharged from hospital by day 22 after the onset of symptoms. Three seriously ill patients with SARS in Taiwan were treated with 500 ml of convalescent plas ma, which was associated with a reduction in plasma virus titer and good clinical"
18,page_18,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 18 outcomes16. Three patients with MERS -CoV in South Korea were treated with convalescent plasma, but only two of the donors had neutralizing antibody in their plasma17. The latter study highlights a challenge in using convalescent plasma ; namely, that some people who recover from viral disease may not have high titers of neutralizing antibody18. Consistent with this point, an analys is of 99 samples of convalescent sera from patients with SARS -CoV-1 reported that 87 had neutralizing antibody with a geometric mean titer of 1:61 3. Experience with the use of convalescent plasma in COVID -19 1.4. A non -peer -reviewed phase I study from China enrolled 10 severe patients with COVID -19 who received one dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma showed a significant improvement in clinical symptoms and oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Also, within 7 days, all the patients showed different degrees of resorption of lung lesions. In seven pat ients, viral load became undetectable after transfusion. Importantly, no severe adverse reactions were observed19. Another group from China also published their uncontrolled experience with convalescent plasma in 5 ventilated critically ill patients with COVID -1920. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 pat ients, the SOFA score decreased, and PAO2/FIO2 increased within 12 days (range, 172 -276 before and 284 -366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days of the transfusion, and SARS -CoV-2–specific enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA ) and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40 -60 before and 80 -320 on day 7). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS ) resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanica l ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion . A third report from China described 4 critically ill p atients including a pregnant woman who received convalescent plasma and recovered from their illness21. On March 25th, 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of convalescent plasma under emergency investigat ional new drug category22. This has allowed licensed physicians to prescribe and obtain approval for this investigational product for the treatment of critically ill patients on very short notice. Our approach is to make this product available to Canadians in a Canada -wide clinical trial. In parallel, the U.S.-based sites and Brazil - based sites will make product available for this trial under an investigational new drug (IND) application from their regulatory agencies . The product is available at the Israeli site with per- patient Ministry of Health appro val. Known potential risks 1.5. 1. There is a theoretical risk of antibody -dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) whereby virus targeted by non -neutralizing antibodies contained in the convalescent plasma could facilitate entry into and activation of macrophag es. This is based on experiments using antibodies from peptide vaccination in macaques . The available evidence from the use of convalescent plasma in patients with SARS -CoV-1 and MERS -CoV23 and anecdotal evidence of"
19,page_19,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 19 its use in 245 patients with COVID -1924, suggest this does not happen when using convalescent plasma, which contains high titres of polyclonal and likely neutralizing antibod ies. 2. Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to those exposed to SARS -CoV-2 may mitigate severe disease but will modify the immune response such that those individuals mount attenuated immune responses, which would leave them vulnerable to subsequent re - infection. In this regard, passive antibody administration before vaccination with respiratory syncytial virus was reported to attenuate humoral but not cellular immunity25. Experience with measles prophyla xis has been that active immunization was indeed suppressed when treatment was given in the first 5 days of viral incubation and completely aborted the infection. However, patients for whom treatment was given 5 to 7 days after the incubation period had attenuated disease and later developed normal long -lived immunization . This suggests that active immunization would not be attenuated in patients with active SARS -CoV- 2 infection. 3. Finally, there are risks associated with any transfusion of plasma including t ransmission of blood transmitted viruses (risk <1 in 1 million for all known pathogens, e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic transfusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, febrile non -hemolytic transfusion reaction, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRA LI), transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO), and hemolysis should ABO incompatible plasma be administered (not permitted in the CONCOR -1 trial , except for centers where blood group A plasma can be transfused to blood group B or AB patients if AB pl asma is not available provided the donor´s anti -B titers are lower than or equal to 1:50) . Donors must fulfill all donor requirements for apheresis plasma donation . Known potential benefits 1.6. Potential benefits of COVID -19 convalescent plasma (CCP) include improved survival, improvement in symptoms, decreased risk of intubation for mechanical ventilation , decreased risk of intensive care unit ( ICU) admission, shortened hospitalization time and suppression of viral load. Optimal timing 1.7. A general principle of passive antibody therapy is that it is more effective when used early. When used in prophylaxis for measles, treatment within 5 days of contact would usually lead to infection abortion, whereas treatment between 5 and 7 days would lead to infection atte nuation26. When used for therapy, passive antibod ies are most effective when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms. In the Hong Kong SARS cohort, convalescent plasma was found to be most effective in patients who were reverse transcripta se polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive and seronegative for coronavirus15. Passive ant ibody therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia was most effective when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms and there was no benefit if antibody administration was delayed passed the third day of disease27. Wi th passive antibody therapy for SARS -CoV-1, Chen and al. found that administration of convalescent plasma before Day 14 of illness resulted in a higher discharge rate by day 22 compared to participants who"
20,page_20,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 20 received it later than Day 14 . Two controlled coho rt studies from the Spanish influenza pandemic reported efficacy only if treatment was administered within 5 days of onset of viral pneumonia (around day 12 of symptom onset) . In the 2 studies, t he risk of death was reduced [ odd ratio s (OR) for mortality = 0.60 and OR=0.31 , respectively ] when administered before 5 days , compared to an OR=1.13 and OR=0.93 when given after 5 days28,29. In a cohort of H1N1 influenza patients treated with convalescent plasma from 2013, the risk of death was reduced ( OR = 0.14 ) when treatment was administered in the first 4 days , but the risk of dea th was increased when administered after 5 days 30. Given the n atural evolution of COVID -19 which involves a slower progression of initial symptoms compared to influenza (Figure 1) , CONCOR -1 will enrol patients who are within 12 days of respiratory symptom onset and not yet intubated . Figure 1 (from Bouadma et al Int Care Med 2020) describes what is known about the potential patient course of COVID -19 pneumonia. Plasma therapy is expected to be most effective if given before the red zone31. Optimal dosage 1.8. The optimal dosage for passive antibody therapy is unknown.

Primary objective: 2.1. To determine the effect of CCP for adults admitted to hospital with COVID -19 respiratory illness requiring sup plemental oxygen on rates of death and intubation at 30 days . Secondary objectives 2.2. Safety: Determine the safety of CCP. We will capture adverse events (AE) associated with the transfusion of CCP including suspected TRALI, and all other serious adverse eve nts (SAE). Relevant data will be captured during the trial to provide information on the following:  Time to intubation or death  Ventilator -free days  In-hospital death by Day 90  Time to in -hospital death  Death by Day 30  Length of stay in intensive car e unit (ICU)  Length of stay in hospital  Need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)  Need for renal replacement therapy  Myocarditis  Patient -reported outcome at Day 30  Incremental cost per quality -adjusted life year (QALY)  Transfusion -associated ad verse events (AE)  Grade 3 and 4 serious adverse events (SAE)  Cumulative incidence of Grade 3 and 4 SAEs Exploratory studies: To determine the association between CCP characteristics and rates of intubation or death in hospital at day 30 in participants receiving CCP. CCP characteristics to be assessed include the amount of anti bodies against the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein and its receptor - binding domain ( RBD ),its neutralizing function , its Fc function and clinical characteristics of donors ."

Research Question – Does the transfusion of CCP collected from donors who have recovered from COVID -19 infection and who have detectable anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies reduce the risk of intubation or death at Day 30 in adults who are admitted to hospital with COVID -19 respiratory illness compared to standard of care? Study Hypothesis - We hypothesize that treating hospitalized adult patients with COVID -19 respiratory illness will reduce the risk of intubation or death at Day 30. In addition, we hypothesize that other outcomes will be improved including risk of ICU admission, length of stay in ICU and length of stay in hospital.

Plasma is contraindicated (e.g. history of anaphylaxis from transfusion) 4. Decision in place for n o active treatment Potential patients will be approached for informed consent . After consent is obtained, a screening ABO blood group will be collected if not already performed during the current hospital admission . Co-enrolment in other trials is allowe d. For patient s who fail screening, we will collect only the reason for screen failure with no personal identifiers. Pregnant patients will not be excluded from the study if they meet eligibility criteria , except for sites where pregnant patients are not permitted to participate in the research as per local regulatory requirements . While young adults and pregnant women have been infrequently reported to present with complications, data from current COVID -19 wards indicate that those who develop severe COVI D-19 pneumonia appear to have a similar risk of progression to intubation and critical disease than older patients . At the CHUM in Montreal, over half of COVID - 19 patients admitted to the ICU were younger than 55 years of age. From a safety standpoint, CCP was well tolerated in one pregnant patient in a case series reported from China21. Therefore, based on current eligibility criteria, the same risk/benefit considerations apply to pregnant and younger patients as compared to the elderly, hence t he reason not to exclude them from this trial. Participant recru itment 4.2. Only hospitalized COVID -19 patients are eligible so recruitment efforts will be focused on identifying consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute COVID -19 infection. No othe r external recruitment efforts are planned. At each participating hospital, a process for immediately identifying admitted patients with COVID -19 will be established. The mechanism of alerting the research assistants (RA) will be determined by local site p rincipal investigator. Patients who are confirmed to have COVID -19 infection and are admitted to hospital will be assessed for eligibility. Consent may be obtained verbally, given the infection control precautions"

The RA (or a bedside physician if deemed acceptable by local research ethics boards [REB]) will obtain consent from the patient or legally authorized representative (LAR) by phone or videoconference. After consent is obtained , the RA will confirm eligibility remotely through a review of the electronic medical record and discussion with the bedside physician/nurse. Informed consent will be obtained remotely and may use a variety of visual aids (video brochure, a visu al decision board). Documented written consent will be obtained from the patient or LAR as soon as possible as required by local REBs. At the time of assessing eligibility the RA will confirm with the site storing CCP that an ABO -compatible CCP plasma unit is available (for certain sites, group A plasma with low-titer anti -B (≤1:50) is allowed to be transfused to group B or AB patients). If 500 mL of CCP is available and eligibility criteria are met, the RA will randomize the patient. The RA will notify the blood bank of the allocation and a marker will be placed in the Labor atory Information System and the patient chart indicating that the patient is enrolled in the CONCOR -1 trial. For patients randomized to CCP, the RA will notify the bedside physician to order the study product. The CCP will be thawed in the blood bank, iss ued, an d infused by the bedside nurse within 24 hours of randomization . Randomization Procedures 4.3. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (CCP to standard of care). Patients will be randomized using a secure, concealed, computer -generated, web -accessed randomization sequence. Randomization will be stratified by centre and age (<60 and ≥ 60 years). Within each stratum, variable permuted block sizes will be used. This approach will ensure that concealment of the treatment sequence is maintained . Interven tion: 4.4. Patients will be assigned to the experimental treatment (CCP) or the control (standard of care). CCP 4.4.1. Patients will receive approximately 500 mL of CCP (from one single -donor unit of 500 mL or 2 units of 250 mL from one or two donor s) collected by apheresis from donors who have recovered from COVID -19 and frozen (1 year expiration date from date of collection). The plasma unit will be thawed as per standard blood bank procedures and infused into the patient slowly over 4 hours or as per local proced ures . When administering 2 units of 250 mL, the 2nd unit should be administered immediately after the first unit, and we recommend that it should be given within 12 hours after the first unit . The patient will be monitored for adverse events as per each si te’s policies. Details regarding the CCP are summarized in Section 5. 0. Standard of Care 4.4.2. Patients receiving standard of care will receive all medical care as per routine practices at each site."

Subjects i n this clinical trial may discontinue the investigational product for any of the following reasons:  Subject requests to discontinue the investigational product during transfusion or to be removed from clinical trial activities for any reason (reason for wi thdrawal will be requested)  Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the patient to substantial risk and/or does not allow the patient to adhere to the requirements of the protocol  Any SAE, clinically significant AE, severe laborato ry abnormality, intercurrent illness, or other medical condition deemed related to the investigational product that indicates to the Investigator that continued participation is not in the best interest of the patient (in such case the investigational prod uct must be discontinued).  Patient fails to comply with protocol requirements or study -related procedures Unless the patient withdraws consent, those who discontinue the investigational product during the infusion should remain in the study and be include d in the intention -to-treat population. The reason for participant discontinuation of investigational product should be documented in the case report form where known. Should the participant withdraw consent or requests discontinuation for any reason, whe never possible, the patient or LAR will be asked if the patient can be followed for outcome and safety evaluations (where permitted by the local REB). Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Participants 4.5.1. Participants who withdraw from this study or who are lost to follow -up after randomization will not be replaced. The reason for patient discontinuation from the study will be recorded on the appropriate case report form. In the case of a participant’s lost to follow -up, attempts to contact the patient will be made and documented in the patient’s study file. Blinding and Unblinding Procedures 4.6. This is an open -label trial. The decision to perform the trial unblinded was based on the following reasons: (1) to allow for participation of academic and non -academic hospital sites where masking procedures are not possible given the required short implementation timelines; (2) to avoid exposing patients to the risks of a standard plasma arm as the placebo has no anticipated benefit; (3) to avoid the need to creat e an inert placebo (e.g. coloured saline) including the need to mask, which would cause significant disruption of workflow and additional use of PPE during the pandemic. Number of Study Centers 4.7. The number of hospital sites across Canada will be ~40 -60 sites, including sites in every Province and potentially every territory in both academic and community -based hospitals . There will be a"

Thereafter sites will be on -boarded based on size and the current distribution of cases of COVID -19 to ensure the greatest access to the trial based on need. In addition, to enhance the rapidity of study enrollment, one New York City Institution in the U.S. will participate , as well as sev eral sites in Brazil and one site in Israel . Subject Identification and Randomization 4.8. Subject Identification 4.8.1. Subjects in this study will have specific screening number. Subjects failing screening will retain their screening number. The screening number for each subject will be a combination of the site number plus a number assigned to the subject according to her/his chronological order of screening at that site. The screening number will be used as the subject identifier throughout the study . Interim Analysis 4.9. A single interim analysis is planned when the primary outcome ( intubation or mortality at Day 30) is available for 50% of the target sample. An O'Brien - Fleming stopping rule44 will be used at that time , but treated as a guideline, so there is minimal impact on the threshold for statistical significance for the final significance test of the pri mary outcome."

The investigational pro duct consists of approximately 500 mL Apheresis Frozen Plasma (A FP) collected from patients who have recovered from COVID -19. Mechanism of action 5.2. Transfusion of A FP from COVID -19 co nvalescent patients allows the transfer of donor neutralizing antibodies directed against SARS -CoV-2 antigens in the recipient, thus allowing the generation of passive immunization. Naturally produced human antibody are polyclonal, meaning they are directe d against a variety of different viral antigens and epitopes allowing for a general neutralizing effect against the virus rather than focussing on a specific target. Administration of CCP has been associated with rapid decrease in viral load. It is also p ossible that passive immunization contribute s to improve d cell-mediated immunity by favoring the phagocytosis and presentation of viral antigens to host T cells.

This will permit the collection of CCP from the same donor at weekly intervals. SARS -CoV-2 antibody titers will be monitored at each donation to ensure the presence of sufficient a mounts of antibody for the treatment of patients suffering from COVID -19. Plasma collection using the TRIMA® Accel ™ technology (Terumo BCT) The TRIMA® Accel ™ technology allows the automated collection of different blood components and contains programs f or plasma collection only. Disposable sterile kits for plasma collection are available (kits with 3 or 4 plasma bags). Depending on the donor characteristics (calculated blood volume), plasma volumes up to 750 mL can be collected. The procedure starts with the collection of a small volume of blood in a sampling bag; this blood will be used for regulatory analyses at Magen David Adom National Blood Services (transfusion transmissible diseases) and to establish the anti -SARS -CoV-2 seropositivity. During colle ction, blood is mixed with ACD -A (anticoagulant citrate dextrose, solution A), plasma is separated from blood cells by centrifugation and collected in 2 or 3 bags (depending on the target volume that has been predefined) based on the estimated total blood volume of the donor whereas blood cells are returned to the donor. Plasma collection using the PCS®2 technology (Haemonetics) This automated system is used to collect plasma only. Samples required for regulatory analyses and antibody seropositivity dete rmination are taken directly from the collected unit after plasma collection is completed. During collection, blood is mixed with anticoagulant (sodium citrate 4%)"

When separation is completed, plasma is automatically transferred to the collection bag and thereafter, blood cells are returned to the donor. Packaging, Labeling and Storage 5.5. Labels bearing the ISBT 128 donation identification wil l be printed and placed on all collection bags and blood tubes before donation. After donation, plasma will be shipped to a component processing facility at Héma -Qué bec, Canadian Blood Services , or New York Blood Center and will be frozen at -18°C within 8-24 hours of collection. In Hemorio and in Magen David Adom National Blood Services the plasma will be collected at the same place where the component process facility is located. When results of regulatory analyses become available (this usually takes les s than 48 hours) and the product can be released for transfusion, a new label will be applied on the plasma bag showing all product information including the ABO group. The plasma will also be labeled as “convalescent plasma” at Canadian , Brazilian, and Is raeli sites and “apheresis plasma” at United States sites. For Canadian Sites: 5.5.1. The sponsor shall ensure that the drug bears a label that sets out the following information in both official languages: (a) a statement indicating that the drug is an invest igational drug to be used only by a qualified investigator; (b) the name, number or id entifying mark of the drug; (c) the expiration date of the drug; (d) the recommended storage conditions for the drug; (e) the lot number of the drug; (f) the name an d address of the sponsor; (g) the protocol code or identification. A segregated storage area will be set up and used to keep CCP apart from the other plasma products. A product list will be kept up to date in order to know at all times the volume of CCP available for each ABO blood group. When requested for transfusion, the products will be shipped to the hospital through the regular transportation system for blood products or to pre -identified regional “hub” hospitals where inventory will be maintained . Large sites and those at a geographical distance of more than 200 km may be permitted to hold a stock of one 500 mL dose for each ABO blood group and smaller sites will only be shipped the investigation product once a patient has been randomized to the act ive treatment arm.

36,page_36,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 36 Anti -SARS -CoV-2 seropositivity 5.6. There is currently no clinically validated method to characterize the therapeutic potency of COVID - 19 convalescent plasma. Importantly, non -convalescent plasma selected from the general population based on titers of neutralizing antibodies did not show efficacy in the treatment of influenza in 3 large RCTs questioning reliance of such assay to predict efficacy45–47. Because the validity of such assays to determine the therapeutic value of CCP constitutes an important clinical question, the neutralizing activity of plasma samples will be documented for all samples and correlated with treatment effect as an exploratory objective . These assays can be performed before or after the plasma has been released. However, as a minimal requirement, anti -SARS -CoV-2 seropositivity must be demonstrated on donor sample prior to release of product. This can be done by ELISA or with a neutralizing assay. In the U.S sites, seropositivity may be assessed after transfusion of the product for a minority of donors . The majority of donors will be referred by the treating center to the donor center and pre- screened for seroposi tivity prior to donation . However, if CCP units from the referred donors are unavailable , a general pool of CCP plasma can be used with seropositivity assessed from a tail segment following transfusion. ELISA or Chemoluminescence 5.6.1. The ELISA or Chemolumines cence will specifically test for antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS -CoV-2 glycoprotein S , which have been reported to correlated with plasma neutralizing activity (R2=0.96) 48. The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) provides no guidance with regards to a specific titer cut -off value to qualify convalescent plasma as the optimal titer is curre ntly unknown. The cut-off for seropositivity will be set as the mean value + 3 SD of the ELISA signal obtained with SARS -CoV-2 negative plasma (pool of plasma samples collected before 2020) at a 1:100 plasma dilution. Functional assays 5.6.2. Functional neutrali zation assays can also be used as a criteria to confirm seropositivity . The most direct method involves adding the diluted plasma to a specific number of infectious particles (in this case SARS -CoV-2 virus), plating the virus, and measuring the number of p laques that can still be formed. This provides insights into the levels of neutralizing antibodies and for treating Covid - 19. If used to qualify donation, a dilution of 1/160 will be used as threshold neutralizing titer will be used to confirm donor eligib ility. The antibody -dependent cell cytotoxicity assay, which measure Fc function of antibodies will also be performed on all plasma samples as per the study’s exploratory objective but will not be used as a criteria to qualify donations."
37,page_37,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 37 Administration 5.7. The investigational product will be administered by a bedside nurse or other clinical team member that is qualified and licensed to administer blood products . Administration date and time, will be entered into the case report form (CRF). The one (500 mL) or two (250 mL) plasma units collected from one or two donors will be considered one treatment dose. a. The plasma will be administered at an infusion rate of no more than 150 mL/h and a standard test dose of 50 mL/hour for the 15 minutes or as per local pro cedures is mandatory. b. If an AE develops during infusion, the infusion will be stopped and can be restarted as per investigator’s decision in consultation with the bedside physician. i. Most reactions to plasma are relatively minor (urticaria or volume overlo ad) and the infusion can generally be continued. Infusion can generally be continued in cases of itching or urticarial reactions after pausing the transfusion, administering antihistamines, and observing the patient for worsening. c. Severe allergic reactio ns such as, bronchospasm and hypotension, and will require discontinuation of the infusion. d. Transfusion of each unit must be completed within 4 hours of removal from storage. The complete study product ( either 1 x 500 mL or 2 x 250 mL ) must be infused with in 24 hours of randomization. e. No medication or solution may be added to or infused through the same tubing simultaneously, unless the solution has been approved by Health Canada for this use (i.e. normal saline). f. Participants must be under direct or remot e observation during the first 15 minutes . Vital signs should be assessed at 15 minutes, mid way through the infusion and at the end of the infusion. The maximum tolerated dose of AFP has not been determined. The most likely adverse effect from the transfu sion would be hypervolemia which may be treated with diuretics in symptomatic patients by the bedside physician. Any over -dosage needs to be reported as per section 9.1 0.2. Dose of CCP 5.8. The dose of CCP will be approximately 500 mL. This will be administere d as be either 1 unit of 500 mL or 2 units of 250 mL of apheresis CCP. Return and/or Destruction of Investigational Product 5.9. After the study treatment period has ended or as appropriate over the course of the study, disposition of unused and used plasma will occur following site procedures in the study protocol . In the context of the COVID -19 pandemic, this may include disposal of the used plasma in the biohazard disposal in the patient room. The final disposition of the product will be confirmed in the Laboratory Information System used by the hospital Blood Bank and provided to the investigator team to be kept in the investigational product log . These logs will be verified periodically by study monitors. Any site found to use a study product on a non -CON COR -1 trial patient will be"

At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of investigational product shipped, used, and remaining. This reconciliation will be documented. Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction of unused investigational product. Documentation of investigational product destroyed on site will be retained in the study files. Blinding and Breaking the Blind 5.10. This is an open -label trial. Investigational Product Accountability 5.11. The site PI is responsible for study product distribution and disposition and has ultimate responsibility for study product accou ntability. The site PI may delegate to the participating site’s blood bank responsibility for study product accountability. The participating site’s blood bank will be responsible for maintaining complete records and documentation of study product receip t, accountability, dispensation, storage conditions, and final disposition of the study product(s). All study product(s), whether administered or not, must be documented on the appropriate study product accountability record or dispensing log. The sponsor ’s monitoring staff will verify the participating site’s study product accountability records and dispensing logs per the site monitoring plan. Compliance 5.12. CCP will be transfused in the clinical area by the patient ’s nurse or physician, with oversight from the study team (site PI and/or site RA) who will not enter the room, thereby ensuring compliance with the investigational product and good practices in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic . Prior and Concomitant Medication 5.13. A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the subject concomitantly to any investigational medicinal product s (IMPs) or during study participation. Concomitant medications in a hospitalized population change daily and are difficult to collect and attribute to success and failure of therapy and impact on safety. Therefore, only select ed concomitant medications will be recorded in this trial. The list of medications will be assessed only from 7 days prior to enrolment to Day 30 or discharge, whichever comes first, and will be detailed in th e study operations manual ."

The local study coordinator will collect all study data and record the data in the CRF (electronic and/or paper) as per local study procedures and requirements for each site. Data to b e collected from the blood supplier 8.1. De-identified data on the plasma donor will be obtained from the blood suppliers. For Canadian and Brazilian sites, t his data will include unit information ( such as ABO group, volume, antibody titre) and donor informatio n (such as age, sex , symptom onset, severity, treatment, date of resolution) and will be sent via secure file transfer in accordance with institutional protocols . For US sites and the Israeli site , the data will include ABO group, volume, antibody titre (retrospectively) and donor information (such as age, sex, symptom onset, date of resolution) and will be sent via secure file transfer in accordance with institutional protocols. Subject Scree ning 8.2. At each participating site , there will be a process develop ed to immediately identify patients admitted to hospital with COVID -19. The local RA will then screen the patient for study eligibility, provide study details to the patient, and seek informed consent. Information from all patients approached for the study will be documented and logged using the screening study number including reasons for any exclusion. Once informed consent is obtained, a screening ABO blood group will be performed if one was not already performed during the patient’s current hospital adm ission . Once the ABO blood group testing has been performed, t he remaining sample (discard) will be retained for future testing. Alternatively, an extra tube can be added to the routine blood draw for research. Collection of d aily hospital data 8.3. Baseline data will be collec ted on Day 1 (see Section 8.5). During the index hospital admission, daily data will be collected until discharge or Day 30 from randomization, whichever comes first. For enrolled patients who are still in hospital beyond Day 30, the d ate of discharge or death will be recorded up until Day 90 at which point data collection will be censored. This information will be obtained by reviewing the medical chart, by telephone follow -up or, if feasible through, provincial /state or national datab ases. If the patient has routine blood drawn for laboratory testing pre -randomization and between 24 hours and 5 days (sample closest to 48 hours will be selected in preference) post -randomization, the discard plasma/serum from that sample will be retriev ed, aliquoted and frozen for future testing.

45,page_45,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 45 SAFETY VARIABLES 9. Adverse Event 9.1. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient or clinical investigation s ubject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment assignment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease t emporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the product. Because this is a trial focusing on a critical ly ill population where serious adverse events and death are expected to occur frequently, AE reporting will follow recommendations set out for trials in this population by Cook and colleagues50. During this trial , investigators will need to document all AEs that are defin itely or probably related to the intervention (defined in 9.4.1), and events that are grade 3 or higher for all other AEs. These will be documented on the paper CRF and in the electronic CRF ( e-CRF) with the maintenance of all source documentation in th e patient research file. Concomitant illnesses, which existed before entry into the study, will not be considered AEs unless they unexpectedly worsen during the treatment period. AEs must be documented regardless of the source of identification (for exampl e physical examination, laboratory assessment, reported by subject). Serious Adverse Event 9.2. A SAE is generally defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 1. Results in death; 2. Is life -threatening; this means that the subject is at risk of dea th at the time of the event; it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe; 3. Requires hospitalization (overnight or longer) or prolongation of existing hospitalization or invasive procedure ; 4. Results in persiste nt or significant disability or incapacity; 5. Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect; 6. Is not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the above outco mes. Events associated with hospitalization for the following will not be considered as an SAE: 1. Evaluation or treatment of a pre -existing and non -exacerbating condition as long as the condition is associated with the hospitalization (e.g. hospitalizatio n for investigation of a benign disorder) ; 2. Existed prior to the subject’s entry into the study and has been recorded in the subject’s disease/medical his tory as documented in the e -CRF;"
46,page_46,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 46 3. Has not worsened in severity or frequency during the subject’s expos ure to investigational product ; 4. Has not required a change in treatment management during the subject’s exposure to the investigational product ; 5. Elective or pre -planned treatment of a pre -existing and non -exacerbating condition . In the specific context of a clinical trial focussing on a critically ill population, the definition of SAE also excludes: a. AEs that are part of the natural history of the primary disease process or expected complications of critical illness. b. AEs that are already captured as study o utcomes. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an AEs is serious and whether expedited reporting is appropriate. Caution must also be exercised by the investigator when attributing death or prolonged hospitalization to a s pecific AE. All -cause mortality and hospitalization stay will be captured as study outcomes. Severity of Adverse Events 9.3. The severity of each AE must be assessed by the Investigator and graded based on CTCAE v4.0. A clinical AE NOT identified elsewhere in the grading table will be graded using one of the following categories: 1. Mild : Mild symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social & functional activities with intervention not indicated 2. Moderate : Moderate symptoms causing greater than minima l interference with usual social & functional activities with intervention indicated 3. Severe : Severe symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities with intervention or hospitalization indicated 4. Life-threatening: Potentially li fe-threatening symptoms causing inability to perform basic self - care functions with intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death. 5. Death: The A E resulted in the subject’s death. Causality of Adverse Event 9.4. Relation to investigational product 9.4.1. The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the investigational product and the AE and record that assessment in the source documents and in the e -CRF. The most likely cause of an AE/SAE (for example disease under treatment, concomitant disease, concomitant medication, other) will be indicated in the e -CRF."
47,page_47,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 47 In the absence of a definite causal relationship, any adverse event that is considered to have a reasonable causal relationship with the investigational p roduct should be classified as “probably related.” The causal relationship of the AE to investigational product will be described in terms of: 1. Related. The AE: 1. Follows a clear temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product . 2. Has no o ther possible explanations, such as the subject’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other therapies administrated to the subject. 3. Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the investigational product . 4. Follows a clear patt ern of response to the investigational product . 5. Reappears or worsens upon re -challenge. 2. Probable. The AE: 1. Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product . 2. Could not be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinica l state, environmental or toxic factors or other therapies administrated to the subject. 3. Disappears or decreases on cessation or dose reduction of the investigational product . 4. Follows a known pattern of response to the investigational product . 5.

Could be reasonably explained by the subject’ s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other therapies administrated to the subject. 3. Does not follow a known pattern of response to the investigational product. 4. Does not reappear or worsen upon re -challenge."
48,page_48,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 48 5. Not related . 1. The AE does not mee t the above criteria. 2. There is sufficient information that the etiology of the AE is not related to the investigational product. Recording Adverse Events occurring after the end of the study 9.5. Adverse events occurring after the end of the study should be re ported to the Sponsor by the Investigator if the Investigator considers that there is a causal relationship with the investigational product. Adverse Event Reporting 9.6. At each clinical evaluation, the Investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurre d. AEs will be recorded in the AE page of the e -CRF as well as in the source documents. Coding of AEs will be performed using MedDRA (https://www.meddra.org/ ). All AE reports in the e-CRF should contain the followi ng information of the event: date of onset, severity, relationship to investigational product , outcome at Day 30 , and whether the event is classified as serious or not. Serious Adverse Event Reporting 9.6.1. SAEs that are unexpected and either definitively or p robably related to the investigational products (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions – SUSARs) must be reported to the sponsor . SAEs that are expected and either definitively or probably related to the investigational product and non -CCP relate d SAEs that meet reporting criteria (unexpected in the context of COVID -19, critical illness, or a baseline medical condition; or not already reported as a study outcome) must also be reported to the sponsor. In the event of a SAE, the Investigator must: 1. Enter all relevant information in the AE page of the eCRF. 2.

Adverse event information will be entered into the CRF in a timely manner and no later than 7 days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event. Serious adverse event information will be entered into the CRF in a timely manner/ within 96 hours from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event (or 24h for SUSARs ). Reporting of Events Other than Serious Adverse Event 9.9. Even if none of the criteria for a SAE are fulfilled, any of the following events must be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor within 24 hours from the time the Investigator is notified.  Transfusion associated acute lung injury (TRALI)  Transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO) Adver se Events to Convalescent Plasma Transfusion 9.10. AEs to CCP will be categorized using the ISBT definitions for di agnosis, severity and imputability . AEs to any other blood products that the patient receives during the hospitalization will reported as AEs as well as declared following normal procedures in place locally. Pregnancy 9.10.1. The Sponsor has a responsibility to monitor the outcome of pregnancies where there has been maternal exposure to the investigational product . Pregnancy alone is not regarded as a contraindication to participation in the trial or as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the investigational p roduct may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs, unless they were therapeutic abortions (see below). Hospitalization for normal delivery of a healthy new born will not be considered a SAE. All pregnancies occurring in the CCP group must be reported by the Investigator to Sponsor on a separate CRF within 24 hours after becoming aware of the pregnancy. The Investigator must follow up and document the cour se and the outcome of all pregnancies even if the subject was discontinued from the study or if the study has finished. All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor on a specific preg nancy CRF within 96 hours after she/he h as gained knowledge of the normal delivery or elective abortion. Any SAE related to investigational product that occurs during pregnancy (including SAEs occurring after last administration of investigational product ) must be recorded in the SAE pages in t he CRF (for example serious maternal complications, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, ectopic"

Treatment of Overdose of investigational product 9.10.2. Overdose is unlikely since only the required amount of CCP will be issued to a patient. In the unlikely event of inadvertent overdose due to human error, with or without associated AEs, the event will be rep orted to the Sponsor as per procedures outlined in the operations manual . Overdose will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the overdose. Any AEs associated with the overdose should be reported in the relevant AE/SAE sections in the C RF. INDEPENDENT COMMITTE ES 10. Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee 10.1. Safety oversight will be conducted by an independent data safety monitoring committee ( IDSMC ) that is an independent group of experts that monitors subject safety. The IDSMC members will be separate and independent of study personnel participating in this trial and should not have scientific, financial or other conflict of interest related to this trial. The IDSMC will consist of members with appropriate expertise to contribute to the interpretation of the data from this trial. The IDSMC should be as broadly informed as possible regarding emerging evidence from related studies as well as from the conduct of the Master Protocol from which this was adapted. The IDSMC will operate under the guidelines of a charter that will be written at the organizational meeting of the IDSMBC. The IDSM C will review SAEs on a regular basis and ad hoc during the trial according to the IDSMC charter. The study will not stop enrolment awaiting these IDSMC reviews, though the IDSMC may recommend temporary or permanent cessation of enrolment based on their safety reviews. Additional data may be requested by the I DSMC, and interim statistical reports may be generated as deemed necessary and appropriate. The IDSMC may receive data in aggregate and presented by treatment arm. The IDSMC may also be provided with expected and observed rates of the expected AEs in an unblinded fashion and may request the treatment assignment be unblinded for an individual subject if required for safety assessment. The IDSMC will review grouped and unblinded data in closed sessions only. As an outcome of each review/meeting, the I DSMC will make a recommendation as to the advisability of proceeding with study interventions (as applic able), and to continue, modify, or terminate this trial. Criteria for s topping the trial due to harm are left to the judgement and discretion of the IDSMC as outlined in the charter of the IDSMC ."

In the U.S., consent will be obtained by the New York Blood Center through a separate IRB application , as well as by Hemorio for the Brazilian sites and by Magen David Adom National Blood Services for the Israeli site. The Investigator is resp onsible for ensuring informed consent is obtained from each hospital ized participant. In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), should adhere to GCP and to the ethical pri nciples that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to the beginning of the trial, the Investigator will have their applicable REB/Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ independent ethics committee’s (IEC) written approval/favourable opinion of the written informed consent form and any other information to be provided to subjects. Documentation of informed consent must be dated and retained by the Investigator as part of the study records. The Investigator will not undertake any investigation s pecifically required only for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained. Sites must follow local informed consent policies and guidelines. Subjects will be informed of the nature of the study, its aim, its possible risks and restrictions, its duration, and any compensation that they may receive. The trial and participant responsibilities will be explained during the informed consent discussion prior to study enrollment, and each subject must be informed that their participation in the study is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time. The subject or their legally authorized representative (LAR) must read or fully understand the study/ICF and have an opportunity to ask questions before they provide consent to participat e. Where applicable, the participant may be asked to sign a paper copy of the consent, prior to discharge, where it is safe to do so, for both the patient and health care team. A copy of the signed informed consent or documentation of remote consent must b e made a part of the subject’s medical file and a copy provided to the patient or their legally authorized representative. If a protocol amendment is required, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the protocol or safety profile. If th e consent form is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate REB/ IRB/ IEC, and may need to be re-signed by the subjects or LAR previously enrolled in the study as well as those currently enrolled in the study before Day 30. Sites should fo llow local policies and guidelines. The Investigator should inform the subject’s primary physician about participation in the clinical study where applicable."

The Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee will conduct a site visit or a site p hone contact to verify the qualification of each Investigator, review the site facilities, and inform the Investigator of her/his responsibilities and the required procedures for ensuring adequate site selection and correct documentation. On-site visits ma y be restricted due to site local visitor and research personnel restrictions. Where necessary, virtual site visits will continue to ensure compliance with the study protocol and procedures. Database Management and Quality Control 11.2.1. All data generated by t he site personnel will be captured electronically at each study centre using e-CRFs. Data from external sources (such as laboratory data) will be inputted manually . Once clinical data are entered and validated in the e -CRF, they are transmitted and record ed by the central server in the central database. Computerized edit -checks will be developed in addition to manual review to detect any discrepancies and to ensure consistency of the data. The appropriate staff at the study site will answer queries sent t o the site. The reason for changes, the name of the person who performed the changes, together with the time and date will be automatically recorded by the Electronic Data Capture (EDC). An electronic audit trail system will be used to track all data chang es in the database subsequent to the first data entry. If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor, data manager or the Sponsor will raise a query in the EDC application. Appropriate feedback to the study staff or other corrective measur es will be undertaken if any missing data, inconsistent data, outlier data and potential protocol deviations are identified during routine remote data review.

Before the start of the study, the study protocol and/or other relevant documents will be reviewed and approved by the REB/IRB/ IEC/Regulatory Authorities, in accordance with local legal requirement s. The Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first subject is enrolled in the study. This protocol is to be followed exactly. Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any potential amendment must be approved by the Sponsor. A written amendment must be submitted to the appropriate Regulatory Authorities and to the REB/IRB/IEC s assuming this responsibility. The Investigator must await REB/IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before implementing the changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to subjects. All substantial amendments to the protocol must be approved in writing by both the appropriate Regulatory Authorities and the REB/IRB/IEC , except for admi nistrative amendments, which require notification or protocol addendums but not written approval or modifications that are subject to the Health Canada interim order for clinical trials on COVID -19 issued June 2nd 2020 . Once approved, the protocol amendmen t will be distributed to all recipients of the original protocol, with instructions to append the amendment to the protocol. If, in the judgment of the local REB/IRB/IEC , the Investigator and/or Sponsor, the protocol amendment alters the study design, proc edures and/or increases the potential risk to the subject, the currently approved written ICF will require modifications. The modified ICF must also be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor, appropriate Regulatory Authorities, and the REB/IRB/IEC . In such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained from the enrolled subjects or parents/guardians before participation continues. Duration of the Study 11.9. For an individual subject, study ends for a subject 89 days after randomization (except for pregnant wo men on the CCP arm, which should be followed until pregnancy outcome is known) . The overall study will end when the last randomized subject has reached the Day 90 time point. The inclusion of new participants will be determined based on new data and clinic al needs according to the evolution of the pandemic. The planned study duration is 1 year . Premature Termination of the Study 11.10. If the Investigator, the Sponsor, or the Medical Monitor becomes aware of conditions or events that suggest a possible hazard t o subjects if the study continues, the study may be terminated after appropriate consultation between the relevant parties. The study may also be terminated early at the Sponsor’s discretion in the absence of such a finding. Conditions that may warrant te rmination include, but are not limited to: 1.

Novel scientific data on the efficacy or safety of COVID -19 convalescent plasma is published during the conduct of the trial that raise concerns regarding the safety of CCP In terminating the study, the Sponsor and the Investigators will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ interests. Confidentiality 11.11. All information obtained during the conduct of the study with respect to the subject’s state of health will be regarded as confidential. For disclosure of any such information, an agreement will be obtained in writing . The Investigator must ensure that each subjec t’s anonymity is maintained. On e -CRFs and other documents transmitted to the Sponsor or its representatives, subjects must not be identified by name. Instead, subjects will only be known by the unique subject screening number allocated to them in order to ensure confidentiality on all study documentation. Subjects will retain this unique number throughout the study. The Investigator will keep a separate log of these codes. In order to comply with government r egulatory guidelines and to ensure subject safety, it may be necessary for the Sponsor and its representative, the REB/IRB/IEC or Regulatory Authorities to review subjects’ medical records as they relate to this study. Only the subject’s unique number in the e -CRFs will identify her/him, but their full names may be made known to a Regulatory Authority or other authorized government or health care officials, if necessary, and to personnel designated by the Sponsor. Documents that are not for submission to t he Sponsor (for example consent forms) will be maintained by the Investigator in strict confidence, except to the extent necessary to allow monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor and inspection by Regulatory Authorities.

61,page_61,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 61 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 12. Sample Size Considerations 12.1. Assuming a baseline risk of intubation or death by Day 30 of 30% in hospitalized patients with standard of care, a sample size of 1200 (800 in the CCP arm, and 400 in the standard of ca re arm) would provide 80% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 25% with CCP therapy using a 2- tailed test at level α = 0.05 . This assumes no patient is lost to follow -up. Lost follow -up is expected to be minimal. There is uncertainty about the in tubation and mortality rate that will be observed in this study due to possibly evolving profile of COVID -19 patients admitted hospital over the course of the pandemic. To address this, a blinded sample -size re -estimation will take place when the primary outcome is available for 50% of the target sample. Sample size will only be adjusted if the estimated event rate is different than the originally specified event rate to a sufficient extent that the study is not expected to achieve the desired nominal power for the test of the primary outcome. Planned Interim Analyses 12.2. A single interim analysis is planned when information on intubation or death at Day 30 is available for 50% of the target sample. An O'Brien -Fleming stopping rule will be employed.44 The IDSMC may recommend early termination or modification of the protocol only when there is clear and substa ntial evidence of a treatment difference. More details about the interim analyses are described below as well as a separate guidance document for the I DSMC. Safety Review 12.2.1. Safety analyses will evaluate serious AEs by treatment. The unblinded independent statisti cian will prepare these reports for review by the I DSMC. The IDSMC will review data on the occurrence of all reportable AEs at each of their meetings to ensure there are not significant numbers of unexpected AEs (AEs that do not fit with the known course of COVID -19, based on emerging data from the published and unpublished literature). If there is a significant number of unexpected AEs, the I DSMC will be asked to review unblinded safety data in an ad hoc meeting . Regular safety reports will be creat ed to provide descriptive statistics on the occurrence of AEs to the IDSMC. The IDSMC may request safety data in a blinded or unblinded fashion as per their discretion. Efficacy Review 12.2.2. A single interim analysis is planned when information on the primary outcome ( composite of intubation or death at Day 30) are available for 50% of the target sample. The Lan-DeMets spending function54 analog of the O’Brien -Fleming boundaries44 will be used to monitor the primary endpoint as a guide for the DSMB for an overall two-sided type -I error rate of 0.05. Conditional power will be presented as an additional guide to the DSMB. Conditional power allows"
62,page_62,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 62 computation of the probability of obtaining a statistically signif icant result by the end of the trial given the data accumulated thus far, incorporating a hypothesized treatment effect (e.g., the treatment effect assumed for sample size determination) thereafter. If conditional power is less than 20% under the original trial assumptions, consideration could be given to stopping the trial. An unblinded independent statistic ian will prepare the reports for IDSMC to review when making their recommendations. An IDSMC charter will further describe procedures and membership. An additional document on statistical methods related to the interim analyses will be provided to the IDSMC prior to their first meeting. An additional document on statistical issues related to monitoring will be provided to the IDSMC prior to interim ana lyses. Stopping Rules 12.3. If there are a concerning number of unexpected AEs, the I DSMC will be asked to review safety data in an ad hoc meeting. This study may be prematurely terminated if there is reasonable cause, including but not limited to: determinati on of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects; results of interim analysis; insufficient compliance to protocol requirements ; data that are not sufficiently complete and/or not evaluable. If the study is prematurely terminated, the site Qualified Investigator will promptly inform study subjects and the REB as applicable. The site PI will assure appropriate follow -up for the subjects, as necessary. The sponsor will notify regulatory authorities as applicable. If there are a concerning numb er of unexpected AEs, the IDSMC will be asked to review all safety data in an ad hoc meeting. This study may be prematurely terminated by the IDSMC and/or co -principal investigators and/or Sponsor if there is sufficient reasonable cause (see section 11.1 0) Final Analysis Plan 12.4. The primary analysis will be based on the intention -to-treat population which will include data from all individuals who have been randomized. Outcomes will be attributed to the arm to which individuals were randomized irrespective of whether they received the planned intervention (e.g. plasma from a convalescent COVID -19 donor). A per protocol analysis will also be performed. The per protocol sample will be comprised of eligible individuals who are randomized and are treated acco rding to the protocol. In this trial, patients will be excluded from the per protocol analysis if any of the following protocol violations occur: -patient received less than two units of CCP -transfusion of second unit of CCP completed more than 24 hours after randomization (special consideration will be given for instances where 1 x 500 mL unit was given) -patient was randomized to SOC but receive d CCP"
63,page_63,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 63 -patient was randomized despite being ineligible for the trial Primary Efficacy Endpoint 12.4.1. Intubatio n or death at Day 30 is the primary endpoint. Given the fact that the times from admission to discharge or death are expected to be relatively short , we are using a binary response indicating intubation or death at Day 30. The primary analysis will theref ore be based on a 2 -sided Wald test of the null hypothesis that probability of intubation or death is the same among individuals receiving CP or standard of care. The relative risk reduction for death (CCP versus standard of care ) will be computed along wi th a 95% confidence interval. Efforts to minimize loss -to-follow -up will be considerable and we are expected to have complete data on individuals for the primary outcome. Sensitivity analyses will evaluate the impact of making different assumptions abou t missing data for secondary outcomes. These sensitivity analyses will be fully defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Secondary Endpoints 12.4.2. A cause -specific Cox regression model will be fitted for the intubation -free survival time defined as the f irst of the times of intubation or death with censoring at discharge or 30 days whichever comes first. A hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval will be computed from this fitted model. Cumulative incidence functions will be estimated and plotted for ea ch treatment arm for the time to intubation or death . The restricted mean number of ventilator -free days over the first 30 days will be compared between the two groups based on a nonparametric tests. The time to in -hospital death will be analyzed using a cause -specific Cox regression model treating the minimum of the time of discharge and 90 days as the censoring time. A hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval will be computed from this fitted model. Cumulative incidence functions will be estimated and plotted to estimate the proportion of patients who died during the initial hospitalization up to 90 days from randomization. Finally , the survival status of individuals will be recorded at day 30 and the proportion of individuals who have died will be c omputed for each arm with a two -sample Wald test carried out based on the proportions. Length of hospitalization over 90 days and length of stay in the ICU over 30 days will be modeled using a Cox regression without any distinction between reasons for di scharge."

The proportion of patients needing renal replacement therapy over the first 30 days will be compared between the two arms based on a Wald test. The proportion of patients developing myocarditis over the first 30 days will be compared between the two arms based on a Wald test. The change in EQ -5D-5L utility value from baseline will be comp ared between the two arms. Incremental cost per quality -adjusted life year between the CCP and standard care over the 30 -day time horizon. No multiplicity adjustments will be implemented for the secondary analyses. Procedures for addressing missing data will be described in the SAP. Safety Analysis 12.4.3. Safety endpoints include death through Day 30, SAEs, and severe AEs. These events will be analyzed univariately and as a composite endpoint. Time -to-event methods will be used for death and the composite endpoint. Each AE will be counted once for a given participant and graded by severity and relationship to COVID -19 or study intervention. AEs will be presented by system organ class, duration (in days), start and stop -date. AEs leading to premature discontin uation from the study intervention and serious treatment -emergent AEs should be presented either in a table or a listing. Counts of the number of individuals experiencing SAEs and severe AEs will be tabulated by event type and treatment group. They will th en be tabulated by organ system, duration (in days), start and stop -date. Then the total number of events of each type will be summarized by group, allowing for each individual to contribute a count response for the number of AEs. Each AE will also be ch aracterized in terms of its relationship with COVID -19 or the current study intervention. The occurrence of transfusion associated AEs will likewise be compared between the two groups based on proportions. Co-enrollment in other clinical trials is allowed in this protocol so we will record the nature of the interventions in these other trials and, if possible, the particular intervention to which our study participants were assigned. Cox regression models will also be fitted for the time to the first of each SAE and severe AE to deal with the fact that death and discharge are censoring events. AEs leading to premature discontinuation from the study intervention and serious treatment - emergent AEs will be tabulated or presented as a listing."

Interaction tests will be conducted to determine whether the effect of treatment varies by subgroup. Exploratory Analysis 12.4.5. Association between anti-SARS -CoV2 antibody in CCP and the primary outcome of intubation or death will be assessed using logistic regression. Anti-SARS -CoV-2 antibodies will be characterized according to the amount of antibodies against the native spike protein and the RBD, as well as to their neutralizin g and Fc functions. Exploratory analyses will also examine possible associations between donor characteristics and treatment efficacy . Change in viral load and in anti -SARS -CoV2 serology in the recipient following transfusion will also be assessed and corr elated with treatment outcome."

The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data. The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians. The WMA encourage s others who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles. General Principles 3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.” 4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and rights of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects. 6. The primary purpose of medica l research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. 7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights. 8. While the pri mary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects."
72,page_72,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 72 9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals a nd never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent. 10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. 11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes poss ible harm to the environment. 12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervi sion of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional. 13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research. 14. Physicians who combine medical research wi th medical care should involve their patients in research only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will n ot adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects. 15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of participating in research must be ensured. Risks, Burdens and Benefits 16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects. 17. All medical research involving h uman subjects must be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the condition under investigation. Measures to minimize the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher. 18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immedi ately stop the study. Vulnerable Groups and Individuals 19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm."
73,page_73,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 73 All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive spec ifically considered protection. 20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive to the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non -vulnerable group. In addition, this gro up should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result from the research. Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols 21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected. 22. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be clearly described and justified in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have bee n addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, potential conflicts of interest, incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are ha rmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial provisions. Research Ethics Committees 23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comm ent, guidance and approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and must be duly qualifie d. It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards, but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protec tions for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious AEs. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by the committee. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. Privacy and Confidentiality 24. Ever y precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information. Informed Consent 25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical research must be voluntar y. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees."
74,page_74,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 74 26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of g iving informed consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post -study provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without repris al. Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or a nother appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. All med ical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study. 27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship. 28. For a potential research sub ject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intend ed to promote the health of the group represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden. 29. When a potential researc h subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject ’s dissent should be respected. 30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a neces sary characteristic of the research group . In such circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed withou t informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consen t to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative. 31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient -physician r elationship. 32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be ex ceptional situations where consent would be impossible or"
75,page_75,"CONCOR -1 Protocol 15 January 2021 v8.0 75 impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee. Use of Placebo 33. The benefits, risks, burde ns and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or Where for comp elling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who rece ive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not receiving the best proven intervention. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. Post -Trial Provisions 34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed consent process. Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results 35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly accessibl e database before recruitment of the first subject. 36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results mu st be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist, or other known interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with i nformed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician’s judgement it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available."
