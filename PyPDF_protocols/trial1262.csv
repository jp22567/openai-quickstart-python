Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 2/Protocol CO39262, Version 5PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION 5: RATIONA LE Protocol CO39262 has been amended to update the risks associated with study treatment, including guidelines for management of atezolizumab -associated adverse events. Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are summarized below: The inclusion criterion that addresses female contracept ion has been modified to specify when women must refrain from donating eggs (Section 4.1.1) . Section 4.4.2 has been amended to align with language in Appendix 10 related to prohibited therapy for treating atezolizumab -associated infusion -related reaction s. The incidence and characterization of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) and non- cuSCC in relation to vemurafenib is well defined; as such, the additional requirement for submission of specimen blocks or sections of suspicious lesions (along with a paired normal skin sample) for pathologic examination by the central laboratory has been removed (Sections 4.5.6.1 and 4.5.7, Table 3 ,and Appendix 1) . Lists of risks for atezolizumab and guidelines for managing patients who experience atezolizumab -associated adverse events have been revised to include nephritis (Section 5.1.1 and Appendix 10). The maximum time for interrupting atezolizumab treatment has been changed from 105 days to 12 weeks for consistency with the guidelines for management of atezolizuma b-associated adverse events (Section 5.1.5.3 and Table 3) . It has been clarified that if vemurafenib is discontinued and study treatment (cobimetinib and or atezolizuamb/atezolizumab placebo) continues, ECGs are required as per standard of care or as clini cally indicated (Appendix 1). Appendix 2 has been amended to indicate that biomarker plasma samples are no longer required after atezolizumab is discontinued. Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency. Substantive new inf ormation appears in italics. This amendment represents cumulative changes to the original protocol.

A stratified, permuted -block randomization scheme will be used for treatment allocation and will be based on the following stratification factors: Geographic region (North America vs. Europe vs. Australia, New Zealand, and other s) Baseline LDH ( the upper limit of normal [ULN] vs. ULN, using central laboratory result) After signing informed consent, eligible patients will undergo screening procedures that include testing for the BRAFV600mutation, laborator y tests, 12 -lead ECGs, left ventricular function evaluation (echocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan), contrast enhanced brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast -enhanced CT or MRI scan of the c hest, abdomen, and pelvis, and ophthalmologic and dermatologic assessments. All standard -of-care assessments performed prior to signing the Informed Consent Form do not require repeating, if the assessment was completed within the time frame outlined in t his protocol. All patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. TheNational Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 will be used to characterize the toxicity profile of the study treatments for all patients. The protocol includes a detailed risk management plan for monitoring and managing molecule -specific and potential combination toxicities. Tumor response will be evaluated by the investigator and by an independent review commit tee (IRC) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1. will only be assessed by the investigator . All m easurable and non-measurable lesions will be documented at screening. Response will be assess ed by the investigator at 8 - or 12- week intervals until investigator -determined disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1) ordeath, whichever occurs first. Patients who experience disease progression (RECIST v1.1) must have scans repeated 4 8weeks a fter initial documentation of progression to confirm disease progression as required per the protocol. Tumor assessments (RECIST v1.1 and ) are to continue according to schedule in patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than confirmed disease progression. Clinically stable patients who have a favorable benefit -risk ratio will continue on study treatment following radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1 at least until a follow -up scan 4 –8 weeks later. Patients who continue treatment beyond radiographic disease progression will be closely monitored. Treatment will be discontinued if clinical deterioration due to disease progression occurs at any time or if persistent disease growth is confirmed by follow -up scans p erformed 48 weeks later. If the follow -up scans do not confirm disease progression, the patient may continue on study treatment. Study treatment will continue for all patients until investigator -determined disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 (or subsequent clinical deterioration or confirmed disease progression 48 weeks later), for clinically stable patients with a favorable benefit -risk ratio), death, unacceptable toxicity, or pregnancy, whichever occurs first. Patients who discontinue one s tudy drug may be able to continue other study drugs, per guidelines for management of specific adverse events. After treatment discontinuation, patients will be followed for disease progression if applicable, and followed for survival until death, withdra wal of consent, or loss to follow -up, whichever occurs first. Patients in the control arm are not eligible for crossover to the treatment arm at disease progression. An independent Data Monitoring Committee ( iDMC )will be employed to conduct periodic evalu ations of safety data. All analyses for the iDMC’s review will be prepared by an independent Data Coordinating Center. Sponsor personnel will not have access to by -arm data summaries or listings prior to the formal reporting of the primary efficacy resul ts.

BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND ON MELA NOMA Melanoma is a potentially deadly form of skin cancer that originates from melanocytes. Although the outcome for promptly diagnosed superficial tumors is good, in the metastatic setting, melanoma is associated with high rates of mortality and disease- related morbidity. The clinical outcome of patients with melanoma is highly dependent on the stage a t presentation. Despite recent therapeutic advances, metastatic melanoma continues to be one of the most de adly cancers, with a relative 5-year survival rate of 15% 17%. In 2012, there were around 232,000 new cases and 55,000 deaths from melanoma worldw ide, with more than 100,000 new cases and 22,000 deaths in Europe ( Ferlay etal. 2013 ). In the United States, an estimated 76,380 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed and approximately 10,130 patients are expected to die of the disease in 2016 (America n Cancer Society 2016 ). Moreover, the number of melanoma cases worldwide is increasing faster than any other cancer, especially in fair -skinned, Caucasian populations ( Diepgen et al. 2002); estimates suggest a doubling of melanoma incidence every 10 20 ye ars (Garbe et al. 2009 ). The incidence is particularly high among Caucasian populations in Australia (42.4 per 100,000) and Western Europe (10.6 per100,000) ( American Cancer Society 2016 ). Approximately 50% of all cutaneous melanomas harbor an activating mutation in BRAF , a major driver of signaling in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway. More than 40 distinct BRAF mutations have been described, the most common of which occurs in exon 15 and involves a substitution of glutamate for valine at co don 600 (V600E; Davies et al. 2002). Other less common types of BRAF mutation include V600K and V600G/R, which occur in approximately 16% and 3% of cases, respectively (Long etal.2011 ). Mutations in the BRAF oncogene trigger constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, which in turn drives oncogenesis through growth factor independent cellular proliferation and survival. In the past several years, new agents, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies, have been approved in the European Union and the United States for the treatment of BRAFV600mutation positive advanced melanoma. Targeting of the MAPK pathway is an effective treatment strategy in BRAFV600 mutation positive melanoma ( Richman et al. 2015). Melanoma cells are also highly immunogenic and thus an appropriate target for immunotherapy ( Zhu et al. 2016 ). Several immunotherapeutic agents that interrupt T -cell suppression, thereby rendering melanoma cells susceptible to immune attack, are curre ntly available or in development for treatment of melanoma ( Zhu et al. 2016 ).

28,page_28,"Atezolizumab, Cobimetinib, and Ve murafenib —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 28/Protocol CO39262, Version 5Approved therapies for malignant melanoma in the European Union and the United States include the following (please refer to local prescribing information for further details) : Targeted therapies: vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor), cobimetinib (MEK inhibitor) plus vemurafenib, trametinib (MEK inhibitor), dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor), and trametinib plus dabrafenib Immunotherapies: ipilimumab ( anticytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen -4 [CTLA-4]), pembrolizumab ,or nivolumab (anti-programmed death 1 [PD -1]antibodies ), ipilimumab plus nivolumab (in the European Union ) In the United States, ipilimumab plus nivolumab received accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Vaccine: talimogene laherparepvec ( recombinant viral vector vaccine, CSF2 gene stimulator) Combined targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibition, consisting of either dabrafenib plus trametinib (Long et al. 2014 ) or v emurafenib plus cobimetinib, has improved efficacy (as compared withmonotherapy with a BRAF inhibitor ), with response rates of approximately 70% and progression- free survival ( PFS)of 1114 months across trials. Immunotherapeutic agents that target co-inhibitory receptors or “immune checkpoints” that suppress T -cell activation have also significantly advanced treatment of advanced melanoma. Response rates for immunotherapeutic agents in patients with BRAF -mutant and BRAF wild-type melanoma are lower than rates achieved with combined BRAF and MEK inhibition, with approximately 30% of patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab and 10% 15% of those treated with ipilimumab achieving a response. However, patients can have prolonged responses to these agents. Combination immunotherapy withipilimumab plus nivolumab has demonstrated an increased overall response rate and improved PFS for treatment of BRAF wild-type and BRAFV600 mutation positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, but results in cha llenging toxicity, with more than 50% of patients experiencing Grade 3 adverse events and an unknown OS benefit ( Larkin et al. 2015 ). Despite recent advances in treatments for patients with advanced melanoma, a significant unmet medical for more efficac ious treatment options remains. 1.2 BACKGROUND ON ATEZOLIZUMA B Atezolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets programmed death ligand 1 (PD -L1)and inhibits the interaction between PD -L1 and its receptors, PD -1 and B7-1 (also known as CD80), both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on Tcells. Therapeutic blockade of PD -L1 binding by atezolizumab has been shown to enhance the mag nitude and quality of tumor specific T -cell responses, which results in improved anti -tumor activity ( Fehrenbacher et al. 2016 ; Rosenberg et al. 2016 ).

29,page_29,"Atezolizumab, Cobimetinib, and Ve murafenib —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 29/Protocol CO39262, Version 5Atezolizumab has minimal binding to Fc ・receptors, thus eliminating detectable Fc-effector function and associated antibody -mediated clearance of activated effector Tcells. Atezolizumab shows anti -tumor activity in both nonclinical models and cancer patients and is being investigated as a potential therapy in a wide variety of malignancies. Atezolizumab is being studied as a single agent in the advanced cancer and adjuvant therapy settings, as well as in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and cancer immunotherapy. Atezolizumab (Tecentriq ) is approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial bladder carcinoma and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have disease progression during or following platinum -containing chemotherapy . Additionally, atezolizumab is currently in clinical development in combination with other agents for other indications. Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for details on nonclinical and clinical studies . 1.3 BACKGROUND ONCOBIMETINIB Cobimetinib is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, central components of the MAPK pathway. Activated MEK triggers downstream signaling through ERK to promote growth. Cancer cells transformed by BRAFV600are exceptionally sensitive t o MEK inhibition in vitro. Allosteric MEK inhibitors can result in G1 phase growth arrest in melanoma cells ( Solit etal.2006 ; Haass et al. 2008). Invitro, MEK inhibitors reduce cell proliferation, soft agar colony formation, and matrigel invasion of BRAFV600mutation positive melanoma cells, and are also effective against BRAFV600 mutation positive melanoma xenografts, which is suggestive of a potentially important role for MEK inhibitors in melanoma and other tumors that harbor the BRAFV600mutation (Solit etal.2006 ). Cobimetinib is approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, in combination with vemurafenib. Refer to the Cobimetinib Investigator’s Brochure for details on nonclinical and clinical studies . 1.4 BACKGROUND ON VEMURA FENIB Vemurafenib is a compound that selectively inhibits oncogenic BRAF kinase. Discovery of oncogenic BRAF mutations highlights the central role of this kinase in signaling pathways that control cellular proliferation. Oncogenic mutations in BRAF result in constitutive activation of BRAF kinase, which causes dysregulated downstream signaling via MEK and ERK, leading to increased cell proliferation and survival.

44,page_44,"Atezolizumab, Cobimetinib, and Ve murafenib —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 44/Protocol CO39262, Version 53patients experienced Grade 3 ALT or AST elevation. As a result of these toxicities, subsequent cohorts incorporated a run -in period in which vemurafenib was given alone prior to initiation of vematezo . A 56-day run-in period was tolerated in Cohort 2, so a shorter run -in period of 28-dayswas tested and tolerable found to be tolerable in Cohort 3. Evaluation of adverse events across the three cohorts demonstrated a higher incidence of both atezolizumab -related and vemurafenib- related Grade 3 adverse events . Specifically, all patients in Cohort 1 had vemurafenib -related Grade 3 events ,and 67% of patients had atezolizumab- related adverse event s compared withCohorts 2 and 3, where 50% and 67% of patients experienced vemurafenib -related events and 38% and 33% of patients experienced atezolizumab -related events , respectively. These data suggest that a run -in period with targeted therapy prior to administration of atezolizumab provides an ameliorati ve effect ,potentially due to increased tolerability as patients acclimate to treatment , thus support ingthe use of a run -in period when combining these agents .Subsequent cohorts (following Cohort 3) assessed administration of cobivematezo and inclu ded a run -in period of cobivem for 28 days prior to the introduction of atezolizumab. 3.3.2 Rationale for Treatment Regimens InStudy GP28384 ,patients in atezo cobivem cohort sreceived atezolizumab 800 mg on Days 1 and 15 (every 2 weeks), cobimetinib 60 mg QD on Days 1 21, and vemurafenib 720 mg BID on Days 1 28of each 28 -day cycle. This treatment regimen wasfound to be manageable and tolerable and wasassociated with encoura ging preliminary efficacy data (see Section 1.5.2.1). 3.3.2.1 Run- In Period Theinitial treatment regimen forcobimetinib and vemurafenib during the run- in period in this study (cobimetini b 60 mg QD and vemurafenib 960mg BID on Days 1 21)isthe approved dosage for cobimetinib and vemurafenib, respectively.

Thereduced dose of 720 mg BID (one dose level below the maximum -tolerated dose ) was selected with the intention of balancing considerations for an experimental regimen with the need for patients to receive a therapeutic dose of this approved agent. This dose and schedule has been shown to be highly efficacious in the Phase Ib study GP28384 (see Section 1.5.1 ), which first assessed the combination of atezo cobivem in patients with BRAFV600mutation positive metastatic melanoma.

Randomization will be stratified by geographic region (North America vs. Europe vs. Australia, New Zealand, and others) and baseline L DH (ULN vs. ULN, using central laboratory result ). A stratified, permuted block randomization scheme will be used to obtain approximately a 1:1 ratio between the two treatment groups. The investigator, patient, and Sponsor will be blinded to treatment assignment except as described below. Dose modifications will be managed via the IWRSto avoid unblinding due to differences in permitted dose reductions in Arm A vs. Arm B (see Section 5.1.5.1 for details). Treatment codes should not be broken except in emergency situations. The investigator can request unblinding of a patient’s treatment assignment when such knowledge is essential fo r the safety of the patient. In such cases, an individual patient’s treatment assignment can be accessed through the I WRS by the treating investigator. The investigator should document and provide an explanation for any premature unblindi ng (e.g., accidental unblinding or unblinding due to a serious adverse event ). As per health authority reporting requirements, the Sponsor will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions (see Section 5.7) that are considered by the investigator or Sponsor to be related to study treatment. The treatment code will be available to the Sponsor's drug safety group through the IWRS. The patient may continue to receive treatment, and the investigator ,patient , and remaining Sponsor personnel will remain blinded to treatment assignment. Unblinding may be recommended by the iDMC. In such cases, an individual patient ’s treatment assignment can be accessed through the IWRSby the treating investigator . 4.3 STUDY TRE ATMENT The investigational medicinal product s(IMP s) for this study are atezolizumab, cobimetinib, and vemurafenib .

Systemic corticosteroids are recommended, at the discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse events when associated with atezolizumab therapy (see Section 5.1.5.4 ). 4.4.4.1 Medications Given w ith Precaution due to Effects Related to Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Cautionary therapies applicable to patients receiving cobimetinib Concomitant use of strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole) should be avoided during cobimetinib treatment because cobimetini b is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A and exposures will be increased in presence of these agents (approximately 7- fold increase in presence of itraconazole in healthy subjects). Strong and moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital) should be avoided during cobimetinib treatment because they increase the metabolism of cobimetinib. Strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided, or selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to i nduce CYP3A4 should be considered.

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 64/Protocol CO39262, Version 5Cautionary therapies applicable to patients receiving vemurafenib Vemurafenib is a moderate CYP1A2 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inducer. Concomitant use of vemurafenib with agents with a narrow therapeutic window that are metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 is not recommended. If co -administration cannot be avoided, exercise caution, as vemurafenib may increase plasma exposure of CYP1A2 substrate drugs and decrease plasma exposure of CYP3A4 substrate drugs. Dose reduction of the concomitant CYP1A2 substrate drug may be considered, if clinically indicated. In two drug -drug interaction studies, vemurafenib increased the exposure of a single, oral dose of digoxin. An approximate 1.8 -and 1.5 -fold increase in digoxin area under t he concentration -time curve (AUC) from Time 0 to the last measurable concentration and maximum concentration, respectively, was observed in Study GO28394. Digoxin and other p- glycoprotein substrates with a narrow therapeutic window are prohibited within 7 days prior to initiation of vemurafenib, during vemurafenib treatment, and for 30 days after the last dose of vemurafenib. Warfarin and vemurafenib should be co- administered with caution, as vemurafenib has been shown to increase the AUC of S -warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate. Ifwarfarin is given, additional INR monitoring should be considered. In vitro data have demonstrated that vemurafenib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8. CYP2C8 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window should be used with caution, astheir concentration may be increased when co -administered with vemurafenib. In vitro data have demonstrated that vemurafenib is a substrate of CYP3A4. Thus, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodon e, saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfainavir, voriconazole) and inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) should be used with caution when co -administered with vemurafenib. The above -listed cautionary medications are not necessarily comprehensive. The investigator should consult the prescribing information for any concomitant medication when determining whether it can be safely co- administered with study treatment . Inaddition, the inves tigator should contact the Medical Monitor if questions arise regarding medications not listed above. 4.4.4.2 Medications A ffecting the QT Interval Caution should be exercised when the study drugs are co -administered with drugs that cause QT prolongation or cardiac arrhythmia , especially in patients witha preexisting cardiac disease or ECG abnormality that may predispose them to cardiac dysrhythmia. Investigators should closely monitor patients who are on medications or supplements that may affect the QT interval. Alternative treatment options for medications known to affect QT interval should be discussed with each patient prior to their randomization in this study.

ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY 5.1 SAFETY PLA N The safety plan for patients in this stu dy is based on clinical experience with atezolizumab, cobimetinib, and vemurafenib in completed and ongoing studies. The anticipated important safety risks are outlined below (see Sections 5.1.1 [atezolizumab] , 5.1.2 [cobimetinib] , 5.1.3 [vemurafenib] , and 5.1.4 [combination use]). Guidelines for dose modifications and treatment interruption, as well as management of patients who experience specific adverse events, are provided in Section 5.1.5 . Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study, including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of patient s during the study. Administration of atezolizumab will be performed in a monitored setting in which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate equipment and medicine to manage potentially serious reactions. Adverse events will be report ed as described in Sections 5.25.6. In addition to the oversight provided by the Medical Monitor and drug safety personnel for this trial, an iDMC will monitor and evaluate patient safety throughout the study. 5.1.1 Risks A ssociated with A tezolizumab Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as the following: infusion -related reactions and immune -related hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, Guillain- Barré syndrom e, myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis , and nephritis .

In clinical studies with cobimetinib, events of cerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, reproductive tract hemorrhage, and hematuria, have been reported. Caution should be used in patients with additional risk factors for bleeding, such as brain metastases, and/or in patients that use concomitant medications that increase the risk of bleeding (including antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy). Instructions for dose modification for hemorrhage events are included in Section 5.1.5.3 (see Table 3 ). 5.1.2.7 Severe Hepatotoxicity (Grade 3) Liver laboratory test abnormalities, including increases in ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase , have been reported as adverse events and serious adverse events in patients treated with cobimetinib and vemurafenib. Generally, elevations in liver laboratory tests have been managed effectively with dose modifications. Guidelines for management of patients who develop elevations in ALT, AST, and/or bilirubin are provid ed in Section 5.1.5.3 (see Table 3). 5.1.2.8 Impaired Female Fertility Results from nonclinical studies indicate that there is a potential for effects on female fertility. W hile no dedicated fertility studies have been conducted with cobimetinib in animals, degenerative changes were observed in reproductive tissues of dogs. These changes were reversible upon discontinuation of cobimetinib. 5.1.2.9 Teratogenicity and Developmental Toxicity There are no data regarding the use of cobimetinib in pregnant women. When cobimetinib was administered to pregn ant rats, cobimetinib caused embryolethality andfetal malformations of the great vessels and skull at similar systemic exposures to those observed in patients administered the 60 mg dose. Therefore, teratogenicity and developmental toxicity is a potentia l risk for cobimetinib, and cobimetinib use is not recommended during pregnancy. 5.1.3 Risks A ssociated with Vemurafenib The following adverse events are classified as identified risks associated with vemurafenib: cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, new primary melanoma, progression of RAS-mutant malignancy, photosensitivity and sunburn, liver injury, QT prolongation, hypersensitivity and severe cutaneous reactions, uveitis, VIIth nerve paralysis, radiation recall and radiation sensitization, and acute kidney injury.

Following Days 121 of the run -in period, patients in Arm B will receive vemurafenib at a reduced dose (720 mg BID) compared with Arm A (960 mg BID). Thus, dose reduct ions will be managed via the IWRS system, and dose modifications will differ depending on the arm to which the patient is randomized. See Table 3 for additional details. During the run -in period (Days 128), one dose- level reduction of cobimetinib and vemurafenib is permitted for management of drug -related toxicities . No further dose reductions are permitted in the run- in period. Iftoxicities do not improve within 28 days following the one level -dose reduction and or treatment interruption for either cobimetinib and or vemurafenib, study treatment should be discontinued, unless resumption of treatment is approved by the Medical Monitor. The run -in period may be extended to a total of 56 days to allow patients to recover from drug -related toxicities prior to proceeding to Cycle 1. Following a dose reduction in the run -in period, no escalation is permitted. During the run -in period, the dose of cobimetinib can be reduced by 20 mg QD (one dose level) from 60 mg daily to 40 mg daily during Days 121.

Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section 5.4. 5.2.1 Adverse Events According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in Section 5.3.5.10 Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomit ant treatment or discontinuation from study drug Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 5.2.2 Serious A dverse Eve nts (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria: Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death) This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization ( see Section 5.3.5.11) ""Use of this document is governed by the terms of use on the first page of this document."""

All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. After informe d consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). After initiation of study treatment , adverse events will be reported as fol lows: All adverse events will be reported until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or until initiation of subsequent anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first Serious adverse events and will continue to be reported until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment or until initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. All new primary neoplasms (benign or malignant), including new primary melanoma, will be reported until 6 months aft er the last dose of vemurafenib.

YESThere is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by the patient's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and /or the adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge. NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below . Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, orconcomitant medicatio n); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after firstdose of study drug). For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually fo r each protocol -mandated therapy. 5.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.1 Infusion -Related Reactions Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and are judged to be related to study drug infusion should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., ""infusion -related reaction"") on the Adverse Event eCRF. If possible, avoid ambiguous terms such as ""systemic reaction."" Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infu sion-Related Reaction eCRF. If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion- Related Rea ction eCRF. 5.3.5.2 Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms For adverse events other than infusion -related reactions (see Section 5.3.5.1), a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/o r symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events ""Use of this document is governed by the terms of use on the first page of this document."""

A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vo miting should be reported on the eCRF. If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. All adverse events should be recorded s eparately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated. 5.3.5.4 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints. Su ch events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF. The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reported. If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severit y should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated bychanging the event from ""non -serious"" to ""serious,"" providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. ""Use of this document is governed by the terms of use on the first page of this document."""

A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the followi ng criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) ora change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment Note: For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse events. It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. M edical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with chole stasis ), only the diagnosis (i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the ab normality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., ""elevated potassium, ""as opposed to ""abnormal potassium ""). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as ""hyperkalemia. "" Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.6 Abnormal Vital Sign Values Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.

Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PROs , evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical departments involved in a clinical trial. Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol da ta to be entered directly onthe eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated o r destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.6. To facilitate source data verifica tion, the investigators and institutions must provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial -related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The study site must also allow inspection by applicable health auth orities. 7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system h as been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research .

All measurable and non -measurable lesio ns should be assessed at screening and at subsequent protocol -specified tumor assessment timepoints. Additional assessments may be performed as clinically indicated for suspicion of progression. DEFINITION OF MEA SUR ABLE LESIONS Tumor Lesions Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows: 10 mm by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness /interval 5 mm) 10-mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable) 20 mm by chest X -ray Malignant Ly mph Nodes To be considered pathologically enlarged and mea surable, a lymph node must be 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be 5 mm). At baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.

DEFINITION OF NON -MEASURA BLE LESIONS Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with short axis 10 mm but 15 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascit es, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal mass/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techn iques. SPECIA L CONSIDERA TIONS REG ARDING LESION MEA SURA BILITY Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular comment, as outlined below. Bone Lesions: Technetium -99m bone scans, sodium fluoride positron em ission tomography scans, and plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques for measuring bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as CTor MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable. Cystic Lesions: Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, t hese are preferred for selection as target lesions.

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 161/Protocol CO39262, Version 5Appendix 4 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1(RECIST v1.1) (cont.) METHODS FOR A SSESSIN G LESIONS All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinic ally assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study. Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option. CLINICA L LESIONS Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 10mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is suggested. CHEST X -RAY Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when prog ression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. CT AND MRI SCA NS CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. In this guideline, the definition of measurability of lesions on CT scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm. When CT scans have slice thickness of 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable.

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 162/Protocol CO39262, Version 5Appendix 4 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1(RECIST v1.1) (cont.) If prior to randomizati on it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT scans with intravenous (IV) contrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a non- contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the patient at baseline and during the study should be guided by the tumor type under investigation and the anatomic location of the disease. For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non- contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non- enhanced) will be performed should also be based on the tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease, and should be optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possible. Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward. Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions and interpretation of non-target disease or new lesions on a different modality, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size using a new modality. ENDOSCOPY, LA PAROSCO PY, ULTRA SOUND, TUMO R MA RKERS, CYTOLOGY, HISTOLOGY Endoscopy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, tumor markers, cytology, and histology cannot be utilized for objective tumor evaluation . ASSESSMENT OF TUMOR BURDEN To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measu rements. IDENTIFICA TION OF TA RGET AND NON- TARGET LESIONS When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. This means that, for instances in which patients have only one or two organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two sites), respectively, will b e recorded. Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those organs will be considered non- target lesions. ""Use of this document is governed by the terms of use on the first page of this document."""

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 163/Protocol CO39262, Version 5Appendix 4 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1(RECIST v1.1) (cont.) Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements . It may be the case that, on occasi on, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be selected. Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. As noted above, pathological nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor. Lymph node size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT, this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10mm but 15mm) should be considered non- target les ions. Nodes that have a short axis of 10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed. All lesions (or sites of disease) not selected as target lesions (measurable or non-measurable), including pathological lymph nodes, shou ld be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required. It is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g., ""multiple e nlarged pelvic lymph nodes"" or ""multiple liver metastases""). CALCULA TION OF SUM O F DIA METERS A sum of the diameters (longest diameter for non lymph node lesions, short axis for lymph node lesions) will be calculated for all target lesions at baseline and a t each subsequent tumor assessment as a measure of tumor burden.

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 164/Protocol CO39262, Version 5Appendix 4 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1(RECIST v1.1) (cont.) Measuring Ly mph Nodes Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the node regresses to 10 mm during the study. Thus, when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of diameters may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of 10 mm. Measuring Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure During the study, all target lesions (lymph node and non lymph node) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel c omfortable assigning an exact measurement and may report them as being too small to measure. When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF, as follows: If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned and ""too small to measure"" should be ticked. (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well and ""too small to measure"" should also be ticked). To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is 5 mm, and in that case ""too small to measure"" should not be ticked. Measuring Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment When non lymph node lesions fragment, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the sum of diameter s. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the l ongest diameter in this instance should be the maximum longest diameter for the coalesced lesion.

SPECIA L NOTES ON A SSESSMENT OF PROGRESSION OF NON -TARGET LESIONS Patients with Measurable and Non -Measurable Disease For patients with both measurable and non- measurable disease to achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of the non -target lesions, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non -target lesions in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest increase in the size of one or more non -target lesions is usually not suff icient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non -target lesions in the face of SD or PR in target lesions will therefore be extremely rare. NEW LESIONS The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for theidentification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ""new"" bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting lesions ). This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show PR or CR. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ""new"" cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identified during the study in an anatomi cal location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents tr uly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

MISSING A SSESSMENTS AND NOT -EVALUABLE DE SIGNA TION When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not evaluable at that timepoint. If measurements are made on only a subset of target lesions at a timepoint, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that tim epoint, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesions would not change the assigned timepoint response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD. For example, if a patient had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three measured lesions and during the study only two lesions were assessed, but those gave a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion. SPECIA L NOTES ON RES PONSE A SSESSMENT Patients with a global deterioration in health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ""symptomatic deterioration."" Every effort should be made to document objectiv e progression even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy. The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non- target lesions.

IRR, Grade 2 Interrupt atezolizumab infusion. Administer aggressive sy mptomatic treatment (e.g., oral or IV antihistamine, anti -pyretic medication, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, oxygen). After sy mptoms have resolved to baseline, resume infusion at half the rate being given at the time of event onset. For subsequent infusions, consider administration of oral premedication with antihistamines, anti -pyretics, and/or analgesics and monitor closely for IRRs. IRR, Grade 3 or4Stop infusion. Administer aggressive sy mptomatic treatment (e.g., oral or IV antihistamine, anti -pyretic, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, ox ygen). Permanently discontinue atezolizumab and contact Medical Monitor.a IRRinfusion -related reaction. aResumption of atezolizumab may be considered in patients who are deriving benefit and have fully recovered from the immune -related event. Patients can be re-challenged with atezolizumab only after approval has been documented by both the investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and t he Medical Monitor.

DERMA TOLOGIC EVENTS Management guidelines for dermatologic events are provided in Section 5.1.5.4. NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS Myasthenia gravis and Guillain -Barré syndrome have been observed with single -agent atezolizumab. Patients may present with signs and symptoms of sensory and/or motor neuropathy. Diagnostic work -up is essential for an accurate characterization to differentiate between alternative etiologies. Management guidelines for neurologic disorders are provided in Section 5.1.5.4. IMMUNE -RELA TED MENIN GOENCEPHA LITIS Immune -related meningoencephalitis is an identified risk associated with the administration of atezolizumab. Immune -related meningoencephalitis should be suspected in any patient presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or encephalitis, including, but not limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, motor or sensory dysfunction, and altered or depressed level of consciousness. Encephalopathy from metabolic o r electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from potential meningoencephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or progression of malignancy, or secondar y to a paraneoplastic process. All patients being considered for meningoen cephalitis should be urgently evaluated with a CT scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation, or edema. If deemed safe by the treating physician, a lumbar puncture should be performed and a neurologist should be consulted. Patients with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Section 5.1.5.4 .

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 193/Protocol CO39262, Version 5 RENAL EVENTS Immune -related nephritis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab. Eligible patients must have adequate renal function, and renal function, including serum creatinine, should be monitored throughout study treatment. Patients with abnor mal renal function should be evaluated and treated for other more common etiologies (including prerenal and postrenal causes, and concomitant medications such as non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs). Refer the patient to a renal specialist if clinically indicated. A renal biopsy may be required to enable a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Patients with signs and symptoms of nephritis, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Tabl e 4. Table 4 Management Guidelines for Renal Events Event Management Renal event, Grade 1 • Continue atezolizumab. • Monitor kidney function, including creatinine, closely until values resolve to within normal limits or to baseline values. Renal event, Grade 2 • Withhold atezolizumab for up to 12 weeks after event onset. a • Refer patient to renal specialist. • Initiate treatment with corticosteroids equivalent to 1−2 mg/kg/day oral prednisone. • If event resolves to Grade 1 or better, resume atezolizumab. b • If event does not resolve to Grade 1 or better while withholding atezolizumab, permanently discontinue atezolizumab and contact Medical Monitor. c a Atezolizumab may be withheld for a longer period of time (i.e., > 12 weeks after event onset) to allow for corticosteroids (if initiated) to be reduced to the equivalent of ≤ 10 mg/day oral prednisone. The acceptable length of the extended period of time must be agreed upon by the investigator and the Medical Monitor. b If corticosteroids have been initiated, they must be tapered over ≥ 1 month to the equivalent of ≤ 10 mg/day oral prednisone before atezolizumab can be resumed. c Resumption of atezolizumab may be considered in patients who are deriving benefit and have fully recovered from the immune -related event. Patients can be re-challenged with atezolizumab only after approval has been documented by both the investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and the Medical Monitor.
