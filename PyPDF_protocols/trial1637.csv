If the stent remains unobstructed at the time of infection, then the infection will not be attributed to the device.) • If the patient presents with a sterile or infected collection at the initial drainage procedure and then post- procedurally develops a wide -spread infection in the form of sepsis or blood stream infection, then the infection will be classified as systemic and will be considered a stent related or WON drainage related serious adverse event only if the AXIOS stent was clearly and visually occluded by solid necrosis at the time of repeat endoscopy.

The proportion of AXIOS patients with reduction of WON size to ≤ 3cm within 60 days from AXIOS TM stent placement in the original IDE is 76.7% (23/30) patients. Given that the WONs in the proposed I DE will have an estimated necrotic material content above 30%, namely larger than in IDE #G130264, a slightly lower success rate of 70 .0% is expected for this study . This success rate is within the range of reported WON resolution rates in several recent publications [2 -8] on plastic stent WON drainage, an established WON drainage method as described in the ASGE guidelines on treatment of pancreatic fluid collections [9].

Annually there are about 185,000 cases of WON that occur in the U.S, and the majority (at least 80%) are caused by alcohol and cholelithiasis [11]. WON was formerly known as pancreatic abscess and in 2012, the Atlanta Classification system for pancreatitis was revise d to update the terminology used to classify pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs) in an attempt to provide better clinical guidance on diagnosis and treatment of pancreatitis [12]. The revised classification introduced new terminology for the various types of PFCs that are based on the timing of the development of the collection into the clinical course of the disease, as well as on the presence or the absence of necrosis in the PFC. Fluid collections developing prior to 4 weeks are called acute peripancreatic fluid collections or acute necrotic collections. Once the collection develops a contrast -enhancing capsule, which usually occurs after 4 weeks, fluid collections are called eith er pseudocysts (no necrotic material present) or walled -off necroses (WONs) if necrotic material is present. Any of these PFC types can be sterile or infected according to the revised Atlanta Classification. When PFCs become infected or symptomatic, drainage procedures are performed. Currently, drainage can be accomplished surgically, via percutaneous interventional radiology techniques, or endoscopically [13-15] . Surgery for PFCs is associated with relatively high rates of morbidity (7 -37%) and mortality (6%) [16], and it has been reported that percutaneous drainage increases the risk of infection and the formation of pancreaticocutaneous fistulae [17, 18]. As a result, endoscopic drainage techniques have replaced surgery and percutaneous drainage techniques as the first- line therapy for symptomatic PFCs because they have high technical and clinical success rates with lower rates of complications, shorter recovery times, and lower cost [18, 19]. The most common type of endoscopic drainage procedure is the endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural approach. During this type of procedure, the P FC is accessed via creation of a tract between the PFC and the lumen of the stomach or duodenum and a drainage device is placed through this tract. The device connects the interior of the PFC with the lumen to allow internal drainage. Double- pigtail plastic stents (usually 7-10F in size) and fully- covered, self - expanding metal stents (usually those designed for the biliary tract) are used as the drainage device [20-23]. However, both of these stent types are associated with problems. While the double-pigtail design of the plastic stents tends to prevent migration, the narrow lumen of these stents tends to occlude quickly, particularly in the drainage of WONs where solid necrotic material may be present within the collection in addition to fluid [19, 24]. This necessitates multiple stent exchanges or placement of additional stents. The metal biliary stents offer a larger -diameter lumen and longer patency, but because they have a tubular design they can migrate quickly, resulting in poor drainage, leakage, and mucosal injury in the digestive tract [25]. Recently, the use of “barbell” shaped lumen -apposing, fully covered self-expanding metal stents such as the AXIOS TM stent for drainage of WONs has been reported. These large- diamete r stents may provide better drainage of both fluid and solid material from the WON with less chance of stent occlusion, and the flanges on this type of stent may prevent stent"

This could result in faster resolution of the WON using fewer endoscopic procedures. Rinninella et al, performed a retrospective study examining the drainage of PFCs, including WON. They included 93 patients with PFCs (80% with complex collections) who underwent drainage with AXIOS TM, 52 of whom had WON. Among those with WON, the solid component was judged to be less than 25% of the collection in 14 patients, between 25% and 50% in 20 patients, and more than 50% in the remaining 18 patients. Clinical success, resolution of PFCs without the need for additional endoscopic or percutaneous drainage procedures or surgery, was achieved in 47 of 52 patients (90.4%) with WON [26] . A separate study performed by Shah et. al. prospectively analyzed patients with chronic pancreatitis who received treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts or WONs using AXIOS TM. They concluded that the large lumen size of the metal stent allows for s uccessful necrosectom y through the stent when needed [27]. The current study is proposed to supplement this literature by documenting the safety and effectiveness of the AXIOS TM lumen apposing self- expandable metal stent system for the drainage of WON containing greater than 30% necrotic material . 2 Device Use and D escription 2.1 Device Description and Device Use Study devices are manufactured by Boston Scientific Corporation. The AXIOSTM Stent is a flexible, fully -covered self-expanding metal stent that is preloaded within the Electrocautery - Enhanced Delivery System. The stent is made of Nitinol and fully- covered with silicone. The AXIOSTM Stent and Electrocautery -Enhanced Delivery System is compatible with therapeutic echoendoscopes having a working channel of 3.7mm diameter or larger. Current cleared indication for use: The AXIOSTM Stent and Electrocautery Enhanced Delivery System is cleared in the U .S. “for use to facilitate transgastric or transduodenal endoscopic drainage of symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts ≥ 6cm in size and walled- off necrosis ≥ 6cm in size with ≥ 70% fluid content that are adherent to the gastric or bowel wall. Once placed, the AXIOSTM Stent functions as an access port allowing passage of standard and therapeutic endoscopes to facilitate debridement, irrigation and cystoscopy. The stent is intended for implantation up to 60 days and should be removed upon confirmation of pseudocy st or walled -off necrosis resolution.” Outside the U.S., the AXIOS TM Stent and Electrocautery Enhanced Delivery System is indicated for use to facilitate transgastric or transduodenal endoscopic drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst or walled- off necrosis wi th ≥ 70% fluid content or to facilitate drainage of the biliary tract. Proposed expanded indication for this IDE study: The AXIOSTM Stent and Electrocautery Enhanced Delivery System is intended “for use to facilitate transgastric or transduodenal endoscopic drainage of symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts ≥ 6cm in size and walled- off necrosis ≥ 6cm in size that are adherent to the gastr ic or bowel wall. Once placed, the AXIOSTM Stent functions as an access port allowing passage of standard and therapeutic endoscopes to facilitate debridement, irrigation and cystoscopy. ”"

A subject will be considered lost to follow- up if the subject remains unresponsive to communication after three documented attempts by study staff. 6.5 Source Documents The Investigator/institution guarantees direct access to original source documents, including imaging documentation, by BSC personnel, their designees, and appropriate regulatory authorities. In the event that the original medical records cannot be obtained for a patient that is seen by a non -study physician at a non-study institution, photocopies of the original source documents must be made available for review. 7 Statistical Considerations 7.1 Effectiveness Endpoint Primary Effectiveness Endpoint: The primary effectiveness endpoint for this study is the resolution of WON with endoscopic drainage defined as radiographic decrease of WON size to ≤ 3cm evaluated by CT scan or MRI Primary Effectiveness Endpoint Assessment: Note: Success will be based on the number of WONs resolved, not on the number of AXIOSTM Stents required to achieve resolution. • If it is determined that the fluid collection is actually two separate collections, and each collection is drained via an AXIOSTM stent, then each collection will be assessed individually via the drainage success criteria of ≤3 cm. • If it is determined that the fluid collection is a single collection but the drainage is inadequate via a single AXIOS TM stent, then the success of the AXIOSTM drainage will be assessed as follows: o If a second AXIOSTM stent is used at a new drainage site/original drainage site and the entire fluid collection is drained to meet the success criteria of ≤3cm then the collection will be considered to be a single collection drainage success. o If a second AXIOSTM stent is used at a new drainage site and the entire fluid collection does not drain adequately to meet the drainage success criteria of ≤3c m then the fluid drainage of the collection will be considered to be a single drainage failure. o If a plastic stent is used at a new drainage site and the entire fluid collection drains to meet the drainage success criteria of ≤3cm then the fluid drainage will be considered indeterminate."
32,page_32,"E7116 Form/Template 90702637 Rev/Ver AJ Confidential AXIOSTM WON Drainage IDE Study, 92153943, Rev/Ver I Page 32 of 60 o If a single, 7fr plastic stent is used at the same drainage site, through the AXIOSTM stent, and the entire fluid collection drains to meet the drainage success criteria of ≤3cm then the fluid drainage will be considered a single collection drainage success. o If a plastic stent is used at a new drainage site and the entire fluid collection does not drain to meet the drainage success criteria of ≤3c m then the fluid drainage will be considered a single drainage failure. Hypothes is: As in th e original IDE, #G130264, there is no formal statistical hypothesis for this study. The proportion of AXIOS patients with reduction of WON size to ≤ 3cm within 60 days from AXIOS TM stent placement in the original IDE is 76.7% (23/30) [95% CI (57.7%, 90.0% )] patients. Given that the WONs in the proposed IDE will have an estimated necrotic material content above 30%, namely larger than in IDE #G130264, a slightly lower success rate of 70% is expected in this study. This success rate is within the range of reported WON resolution rates in several recent publications [2 -8] representing 448 patients for which a random effects meta -analysis yields a mid -point WON resolution rate of 67.0% [95% CI (60.0%, 73.4%)] for WON drainage with plastic stents (Table 7.1) , an es tablished WON drainage method as described in the ASGE guidelines on treatment of pancreatic fluid collections [9].

A Clopper- Pearson exact 95% confidence interval will also be calculated. 7.2 Safety Endpoint Primary Safety Endpoint:"
33,page_33,"E7116 Form/Template 90702637 Rev/Ver AJ Confidential AXIOSTM WON Drainage IDE Study, 92153943, Rev/Ver I Page 33 of 60 The Primary Safety Endpoint is AXIOSTM stent related or WON drainage procedure related serious adverse events . Primary Safety Endpoint Assessment: If it is determined that the patient has an infection, then the primary safety success of the AXIOSTM device or the drainage procedure will be assessed as follows: • If the patient presents with an infected collection a t the initial drainage procedure, the infection will be classified as a localized infection and will not be considered a stent related or WON drainage related serious adverse event • If the pat ient presents with a sterile collection at the initial drainage p rocedure and post- procedurally develops an infected collection, the infection will be classified as a localized infection and will not be considered a stent related or WON drainage related serious adverse event as this is a known consequence of any endoscopic drainage procedure, where the access route to the collection is through a non- sterile GI lumen and is not a function of a particular stent or device (Note: If the stent is occluded at the onset of infection, then the infection will be attributed to th e device. If the stent remains unobstructed at the time of infection, then the infection will not be attributed to the device.) • If the patient presents with a sterile collection at the initial drainage procedure an d then post-procedurally develops a wide -spread infection in the form of sepsis or blood stream infection, then the infection will be classified as systemic and will be considered a stent related or WON drainage related serious adverse event only if the AXIOS stent was clearly and visually o ccluded by solid necrosis at the time of repeat endoscopy. This determination will be made by the operating physician at the time of endoscopy Hypothesis: As in the original IDE, #G130264, there is no formal statistical hypothesis for this study. The proportion of AXIOS patients with AXIOS TM stent related or WON drainage procedure related serious adverse events in the original IDE is 10.0% (3/30) [95% CI (2 .1%, 26.5%)] patients. A similar rate of AXIOSTM stent related or WON drainage procedure related serious adverse events is expected in this study . This event rate is within the range of reported stent related or WON drainage procedure related serious adverse event rates in several recent publications [3 -5, 10] representing 306 patients for which a random effects meta- analysis yields a mid -point related SAE rate of 16.7% [95% CI (10.1%, 26.3%)] for WON drainage with plastic stents (see Table 7.2 and Table 7.3 (categorized events from Table 7.2)), an established WON drainage method as described in the ASGE guidelines on treatment of pancreatic fluid collections [9]."

A Clopper- Pearson exact 95% confidence interval will also be calculated. 7.3 Sample Size and Success Crit eria The WON resolution rates and related SAE rates reported in the above provided study references are similar to those reported for WON drainage using plastic stents in a recent systematic review and meta- analysis comparing plastic stents to metal stents, inc luding lumen -apposing metal stents (LAMS) for the management of WONs [28] . Appendix I in Section 21 provides a few key points from this systematic review. Although reported effectiveness and saf ety event rates from different sources appear similar, 95% confidence intervals are fairly wide, mostly due to small sample sizes and heterogeneity in WONs and in detailed procedural WON drainage steps. Therefore we chose to increase the sample size of th e present study to be slightly larger than in the original IDE study #G130264, which was 30 patients."
35,page_35,"E7116 Form/Template 90702637 Rev/Ver AJ Confidential AXIOSTM WON Drainage IDE Study, 92153943, Rev/Ver I Page 35 of 60 We will conduct the present study in 40 patients. Effectiveness Endpoint Success Criteri a An o bserved rate of 67% or higher for t he proportion of AXIOS patients with reduction of WON size to ≤ 3cm within 60 days from AXIOSTM stent placement is required for success . This rate is the same as the point estimate of the random -effect meta -analysis of WON resolution rates provided in Table 7.1. Note that in the recent systematic review and meta-analysis [28] (Appendix I in Section 21) WON resolution rates were higher and number of procedures required to reach WON resolution were lower when using LAMS compared to plastic stents for WON drainage. Thus the proposed success criteria for effectiveness seems reasonable. Safety Endpoint Success Criteri a An observed rate of 17.5% or lower for the proportion of AXIOS patients with AXIOSTM stent related or WON drainage procedure related serious adverse events is requi red for success . This rate is similar to the point esti mate of the random -effect meta- analysis of AXIOS stent related or WON drainage related serious adverse events provided in Table 7.2. Note that in the recent systematic review and meta -analysis [28] (Appendix I in Section 21) the complication rates that showed statistically significant differences between plastic stents and LAMS for drainage of WONs were bleeding and stent occlusion, both in favor of LAMS. These findings are particularly important given that (a) bleeding is the most common ly reported serious adverse event, and (b) stent occlusion almost always requires reintervention. It should also be noted that of the plastic stent WON drainage references provided above, even the one reporting th e highest complication rates, namely Smoczynski et al [5] conclude that the benefits outweigh the risks: “ In a large group of selected patients with symptomatic walled -off necrosis, endoscopic drainage enables high success rate with acceptable complication rate and low procedure- related mortality .” Thus the proposed success criteri a for safety seems reasonable and acceptable. 7.4 General Statistical Methods Control of Systematic Error/Bias: All subjects who have met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and have signed the ICF will be eligible for enrollment in the study. Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC system and will be issued to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all queries in the database. Number of Subjects per Investigative Site: There will be no limit to the number of subjects enrolled at each investigative site. Data Analysis:"
36,page_36,"E7116 Form/Template 90702637 Rev/Ver AJ Confidential AXIOSTM WON Drainage IDE Study, 92153943, Rev/Ver I Page 36 of 60 Descriptive statistics will be presented for all ITT and treated subjects. If the treated and PP cohorts are different, the primary effectiveness and safety endpoints will be assessed for the PP cohort. The mean , standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will be used to describe continuous variables ; the median (and interquartile range) will be calculated where appropriate. Frequency tables will be used to summarize discrete variables. Proportions of subjects with adverse events and SAEs will be reported. Interim Analysis: No formal interim analyses are planned for the purpose of stopping this study early. Informal interim analysis may be conducted for the purpose of submissions of abstracts to major professional meetings. Subgroup Analysis: There are no planned subgroup analyses. Justification of Pooling: The analyses will be performed using data pooled across institutions and whether patients had a double pigtail plastic stent placed within the Axios stent. An assessme nt of the poolability of subject s across sites (double pigtail plastic stent groups ) for the primary effectiveness and safety endpoints will be made by fitting logistic regression models with site (double pigtail plastic stent) as a factor and the primary effectiveness and safety endpoin ts as outcomes. Certain baseline variables may also be explored for pooling. If the P value for the site (double pigtail plastic stent) is ≥0.05, it will be concluded that the endpoint is not different across sites (double pigtail plastic stent groups), and the data can be pooled. If the P value for site ( double pigtail plastic stent) from the logistic model is <0. 05, site (double pigtail plastic stent group) differences will be explored. Multivariable Analyses : No multivariable analyses are planned for t his study. Changes to Planned Analyses: Any changes to the planned statistical analyses made prior will be documented in an amended Statistical Analysis Plan. Changes from the planned statistical methods after performing the analysis will be documented in the clinical study report along with a reason for the deviation. 8 Data Management 8.1 Data Collection, Processing, and Review Subject data will be recorded in a limited access secure EDC system.

If possible, the device(s) should be returned to BSC for analysis. Instructions for returning the investigational device(s) will be provided. If it is not possible to return the device, the investigator should document why the device was not returned and the final disposition of the device. Device failures and malfunctions should also be documented in the subject ’s medical record. Device deficiencies (including but not limited to failures, malfunctions, and product nonconformities) are not to be reported as adverse events. However, if there is an adverse event that results from a device failure or malfunction, that specific event would be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Any Device Deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if a) suitable action had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate is considered a reportable event. 15.6 Reporting to Regulatory Authorities / IRBs / ECs / Investigators BSC is responsible for reporting adverse event information to all participating Principal Investigators and regulatory authorities, as applicable. The Principal Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC, and regulatory authorities of any UADE a nd SAE as required by local/regional regulations. 16 Informed Consent Subject participation in this clinical study is voluntary. Informed Consent is required from each subject or his/her legally authorized representative. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that Informed Consent is obtained prior to the use of any investigational devices, study-required procedures and/or testing, or data collection. The obtaining and documentation of Informed Consent must be in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO 14155, any applicable national regulations, and local Ethics Committee and/or Regulatory authority, as applicable. The ICF must be accepted by BSC or its delegate (e.g. CRO), and approved by the site’s IRB/EC, or central IRB, i f applicable. Boston Scientific will provide a study -specific template of the ICF to investigators participating in this study. The ICF template may be modified to meet the requirements of the investigative site’s IRB/EC. Any modification requires accepta nce from BSC prior to use of the form. The ICF must be in a language understandable to the subject and if needed, BSC will assist the site in obtaining a written consent translation. Translated consent forms must also have IRB/EC approval prior to their use. Privacy language shall be included in the body of the form or as a separate form as applicable."

The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by the subject or legal representative competent to sign the ICF under the applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines and by the investigator and/or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed consent process. If a legal representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide informed consent for continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. The original signed ICF will be retained by the site and a copy of the signed and dated document and any other written information must be given to the person signing the form. Failure to obtain subject consent will be reported by BSC to the applicable regulatory authorityaccording to their requirements (e.g., FDA requirement is within 5 working days of learning of such an event). Any violations of the informed consent process must be reported as deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities (e.g. IRB/EC), as appropriate. If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's future health and medical care, that information shall be provided to the affected subject(s) in written form via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled subjects may be requested to sign and date an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the course of a study, other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments to the applicable laws, protocol, a change in Principal Investigator, administrative changes, or following annual review by the IRB/EC. The new version of the ICF must be approved by the IRB/EC. Acceptance by Boston Scientific is required if changes to the revised ICF are requested by the site’s IRB/EC. The IRB/EC will determine the subject population to be re-consented."
