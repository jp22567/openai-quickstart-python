Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP): A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has established and will evaluate safety throughout the study. The DSMB will advise the Sponsor, Investigators and investigational sites regarding the continuing safety of study patients and the patients yet to be recruited to the study as well as maintaming validity and scientific merit of the study. The DSMB will review ongoing examinations of safety data and promptly give recommendations to continue, continue with modification, or terminate the study. The Excel Diagnostics DSMB will serve as the lead site DSMB. At UCLA, DSMB oversight will be provided by JCCC Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The monitor:ing board will meet quarterly to review safety records including compliance with follow up visits. Interim safety analyses: 4 interim safety analyses will be conducted by DSMB that will be initiated at the time when 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the total 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatments in the trial have been completed. The DSMB will meet and assess up-to-date safety information within two weeks of a treatment exposure rate being achieved (i.e., the-point when 25%, 50%, 75% andl 00% of treatments have occurred). Further patients may only be -randomized two weeks after the treatment exposure rate has been reached and after a positive opinion from the DSMB.

Introduction -------1:d.-B-aekgrottnfl•i--------------------------------- According to the American Cancer Society more than 1 million people in the United States are diagnosed with cancer each year. For American males, prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer related death [2]. A recent publication [3] estimated the prevalence of prostate cancer as 2,219,280 in the US in 2009 and 3,072,480 in 2020, and incidence of metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) as 36,100 and 42,970, respectively. Various therapies have been developed to improve survival of patients with advanced prostate cancer. However, despite such efforts currently all-cause mortality in prostate cancer has been estimated at 168,290 in 2009 and 219,360 in 2020, with 20.5% and 19.5% of these deaths, respectively, occurring in men with mCRPC. Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have a poor prognosis, and those patients with metastases are expected to survive :519 mo [3] . As patient disease progresses, quality of life deteriorates, and until recently, few treatment options were available. Several new therapies have shown an improvement in overall survi,val for patients with mCRPC who have already received chemotherapy with docetaxel (Fie:. 1) [4] [5] [6, 7] [8]. The impact of these new data on clinical practice, treatment sequencing, and best care for individu.al patients is not yet fully established. ______ C~nftde.ii:tial.~------------'p~~~~~~1~5~~~(~=..--------------------- VS.O 01JUN2018"

In the Immunotherapy for Prostate Adenocarcinoma Treatment (IMP ACT) study, median survival with sipuleucel-T was 25 .8 mo compared with 21. 7 mo with placebo [9]. It has to be considered, however, that only patients with a good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic osseous metastases, and C'.ii.iif].aem.r,a/ vs.a 01JuN201s"

Abiraterone acetate The COU-AA-302 (Cougar 302) trial randomized 1088 men with mCRPC to receive abiraterone acetate with prednisone (AA/P) or placebo [4] with the primary end points of overall and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) by central review. Median overall survival was 35.3 mo and 27.2 mo in the AA/P group and in the placebo group, respectively (p = 0.01) [10]. Also, the co-primary end point ofrPFS was significantly improved in the AA/P group, at 16.5 mo, as compared to 8.3 mo in the placebo aim (p < 0.001). On all secondary end points, AA/P treatment resulted in significantly improved effects. Doceta:xel/prednisone In 2004, cytotoxic treatment with docetaxel plus prednisone (Doc/P) was the main option for treatment ofmCRPC based on the TAX 327 trial [11]. The median survival was 18.9 mo versus 16.4 mo in the group of patients who received mitoxantrone/prednisone (p = 0.009), the 3-yr overall survival rate was 18.6% versus 13.5%, and pain response was 35% versus 22%. It has been shown recently that Doc/P is active in men with symptomatic mCRPC and especially in patients with poorly differentiated prostate cancer (PCa) (Gleason score: 8-10) [12]. Subsequent studies using combinations with docetaxel have not further improved the oncologic outcome [3]. The results of the Randomized Study Comparing Docetaxel Plus Dasatinib to Docetaxel Plus Placebo in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (READY) and the Aflibercept in Combination with Docetaxel in Metastatic Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer (VENICE) trial were disappointing [13] [11].

Patients who responded with a 2:30% decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, maintained for at least 8 wk after first exposure to docetaxel, demonstrated a positive PSA response in about 55% to 60% of the cases during re-exposure without increasing treatment related toxicity.

Overall survival was significantly improved from 10.9 mo in the placebo arm to 14.8 mo in the AA/Parm (p < 0.001). All secondary end points were met and all end points demonstrated a significantly improved benefit for the AA/P group. Adverse events with regard to the CYP 17 blockade were observed significantly more often in the AA/Parm (55% vs 43%;p < 0.001). Recently, Goodman et al.

The overall survival times were 12.9 mo versus 8.3 mo in the placebo group (p = 0.022). Albiges et al.

The median follow- up was 14.4 mo and the median overall survival was 18.4 mo and 13.6 mo (p < 0.0001) in the ENZ group and in the placebo group, respectively, with a 37% reduction in relative risk for death. All secondary end points were met with a statistically significant benefit in the ENZ arm. With regard to safety, the ENZ group experienced fewer grade 3/4 toxicities than the placebo group (53% vs 45%). The risk of seizures was slightly elevated in the ENZ group, with a :frequency of0.6% versus 0% in the placebo group. Recently, Scher et al. [20] demonstrated that the use of corticosteroids in parallel to ENZ not only increased grade 3/4 side effects from 34.4% to 63.3%, but it also decreased overall survival to a median 11.5 mo. These data suggest that one of the other second-line therapies, such as AAfP or cabazitaxel plus prednisone (CBZ/P), might be the drug of choice, rather than ENZ, in patients who need corticosteroids for the management of associated comorbidities . . Sternberg et al. [21] reported that ENZ is equally effective in patients aged >7 5 yr, with a median survival time of 18.2 mo as compared to the placebo group with 13.3 mo (p = 0.0044). Fleming et al.

The primary end point was achieved and CBZ/P treatment resulted in a median overall survival of 15.1 mo in the CBZ/P compared to 12.7 mo in the mitox.antrone/prednisone group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0. 70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59:--Q.83; p < 0.0001). All secondary end points of the trials were reached and they were in favor of CBZ. The most common side effects were neutropenia (CBZ/P group: 82% vs MP group: 58%), leukopenia (CBZ/P group: 68% vs MP group: 42%), and anemia (CBZ/P group: 11 % vs MP group: 5%). Diarrhea was the most common non-hematologic side effect and occurred in 6% of the CBZ/P group and <1 % of the MP group. · On ~e other hand, the German compassionate use program (CUP) included 111 patients with mCRPC who met the inclusion criteria of the TROPIC trial; the frequency ofneutropenia, leukopenia, and anemia decreased to 7.2%, 9.0%, and 4.5%, respectively [23]. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in only 0.9% of the patients. The most likely reason for the improved toxicity profile is the experience of the investigators, guideline-compliant application of GCSF even at cycle 1, and preventive measures with regard to the treatment of diarrhea. Recently, Heidenreich et al. [24] analyzed the European CUP, including 746 mCRPC patients, with regard to the frequency and management of adverse events in senior adults. In that study, 325 (43.5%) patients were aged ?:.70 yr and 145 (19.4%) men were ?:.75 yr.

Bone-targeting agents More than 90% of patients with CRPC have bone metastases,.which are a major cause of death, d~ability, and decreased quality oflife, as well as increased cost of treatment [25]. Zoledronic acid and the receptor activator of nuclear factor KB (RANK) ligand inhibitor denosumab are the two US Food and Drug Administration-approved bone-targeting agents in the management ofCRPC [3]. In a phase 3 study, the median time to first on-study, skeletal-related event was 20.7 mo with denosumab compared with 17.1 mo with zoledronic acid (HR: 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.95;p = 0.0002 for noninferiority;p = 0.008 for superiority) [26]. In a recent, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Smith et al. [27] evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of denosumab 120mg every week versus placebo in• 1423 men with nonmetastatic CRPC and aggressive PSA kinetics (PSA level >8.0 ng/ml and/or PSA doubling time <10 mo). The median time to first bone metastases was significantly prolonged by 4.3 mo (29 .5 mo vs 25 .2 mo;p = 0.028).

In the phase 2 portion of a dose-finding study, Orteronel (TAK- 700) 400mg twice daily with prednisone 5mg twice daily resulted in a reduction in PSA level 2:50% in 52% of the 96 chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients at 12 wk. There are two ongoing phase 3 clinical trials in the prechemotherapy (n = 1454) and postchemotherapy (n = 1083) landscape of mCRPC that are evaluating the oncologic activity of orteroneL Both trials have completed recruitment. Galeterone (I'OK.-001) has combined activity: It inlnbits the human CYPl 7 enzyme, it has pure antagonistic activity toward the AR, and it inhibits the binding of androgens to both mutant and wild-type AR [29]. In the Androgen Receptor Modulation Optimized for Response (AMORI) trial, 49% of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients experienced a PSA-level reduction of2'.:30%, and a 2:50% reduction was ~chieved by 22% [30]. Despite the absence of steroid co-treatment, no adrenal mineralocorticoid excess was observed and a phase 2 trial is underway. Androgen-receptor blocking agents ARN-509 is a full antagonist to AR overexpression: It inhibits androgen-dependent gene description, and it impairs nuclear translocalization and DNA binding of AR [31 ].

Heat shock proteins Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been identified as AR coactivator~ and chaperone proteins that are increased in PCa cell lines after castration [32]. Quite recently, antisense oligonucleotides targeting HSP27 were evaluated in a phase 2 clinical trial including 72 patients chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients who received OGX-427 plus prednisone versus prednisone alone. At 12 wk, 71 % and 40% of the patients were progression-free after OGX- 427 or prednisone, respectively.

The median progression-free survival was 29.7 wk, 23.9 wk, and 5.9 wk for patients who were docetaxel naive, docetaxel pretreated, and on placebo treatment (p < 0.001), respectively. Interestingly, PSA changes did not correlate with the antitumor effects in bone metastases and soft-tissue lesions. However, patients with complete resolution (n = 14; 12%) or partial resolution (n =65; 56%) of bone scans experienced significantly better response rates to soft-tissue metastases as compared to men with stable or progressing bone scans (81 % vs 61 %), and they also experienced longer progression-free survival rates at 6 mo (56% vs 48%, respectively). Cabozantinib has significant antitumor activity and a well-tolerated toxicity profile, so it might be well integrated into the therapeutic armamentarium to treat mCRPC. Targeted radionuclide Therapy Over the past several decades, numerous combined diagnostic and therapeutic radio ligands (Theranostics) were designed to target receptors on the cancer cell surface. Antibodies (whole or small fragments), small molecules, peptides with affinities to receptors (agonist or antagonist) have demonstrated in vivo efficacy for targeting cancers based on up-regulated antigens or receptor populations. This approach, also called radio ligand therapy (RL T), presents several advantages over conv~ntional chemotherapy. The expression of the antigens or special receptors can be identified by a diagnostic probe before exposing patients to therapeutic doses of these agents allowing identification of suitable subjects for therapeutic procedures and preventing unnecessary exposure of the patients to radiation without significant benefit. This approach allows the physician to select only those patients with high expression of the target prior to treatment. Since the unused radioactive materials are excreted from the body, RL Ts are generally well tolerated with no significant or generally reversible or ______ 'Corijj.aeri'lia, .• --: -:--::--:--:-----------P""--'@,,,.·.,::.e-z:ti-""'-'-""""'of98-""'-""-----------------------vs.o 01JUN2018"

Thus PSMA has become a biomarker for prostate cancer [35] [36] and has attracted significant interest as a target for the imaging [37] [38] and therapy [39, 40]. In particular, development of small urea-based PSMA ligands have received significant interest due to their high affinity for PSMA [41] [42]. The urea-based PSMA ligands were modified to deliver a variety of radio-imaging nuclides for both PET and SPECT. Gallium (68Ga) labeled urea-based PSMA ligands have been developed as diagnostic agents and studied by several groups [43] [44]. More recently a Lutetium (177Lu) labeled urea based PSMA ligand (DOTA PSMA or PSMA 617) were evaluated in preclinical and clinical phase. Characteristics .-... of 177Lu labeled PSMA are described below. 1.2 Characteristics of 177 Lu-DOTA-PSMA (l 77Lu-PSMA-617) Lutetium (177Lu)-DOTA PSMA has three components: PSMA is the targeting vector, DOTA (1, 4, 7, 1 O-tetraazacyclododecane-1, 4, 7, 10-tetraacetic acid) is a radiometal chelator and a linking group, and 177Lu is the beta emitter that upon internalization delivers radiation to the nucleus of tumor cells to cause DNA damage [43] [44, 45]. The targeting vector utilizes glu- urea-lys sequence which is an inhibitor capable of binding to the domain of PSMA. These components have been previously used in human subjects and in medical research. 1.3 Background of Drug Development There is substantial previous pre-clinical and clinical experience with 177Lu-PSMA-617 published in peer reviewed medical literature from multiple medical centers throughout the world.

Toxicity: Nuclear medicine physicians responsible for 177Lu-PSMA RL T and subsequent follow-up reported potentially related or unrelated adverse events based on a standard template. In addition toxicity was determined by baseline and follow-up findings for serum creatinine, AST, ALT, white blood cell count, hemoglobin and platelet count for 121 of 145 (83%) patients. The follow-up period for adverse events was 2 to 30 weeks. Reported toxicity sorted by organ system is given in Table l. Grade 3-4 anemia occurred in 15 (10%) patients and grade 3-4 tbrombocytopenia occurred in 5 (4%) patients. The rate of grade 3-4 events was low for all other categories (0 to 3 patients; 0 to 2%). There were fewer hematologic adverse events when compared to patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer treated with placebo or 223Ra within the ALSYMPCA trial [7] (grade ::::3 anemia: 14% in the placebo and 13% in the 223Ra group; grade::: tbrombocytopenia: 3% in the placebo and 7% in the 223Ra group). Toxicity data thus indicate a favorable safety profile for RL T using 2-7 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617 per cycle in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Majority of patients received 5.5-6.5 GBq (median 6.0 GBq) or>6.5 GBq (median 7.4 GBq) per cycle. Toxicity rates were comparably low: 9 of 71 (13%) patients with 5.5 -6.5 GBq and 3 of 17 (18%) patients with >6.5 GBq during the first RLT developed grade 3-4 toxicity. ~ge.JlJ:iiJj ."

Dosimetry was required to be performed in the initial versions of the study according to dosimetry protocol (Appendix V) provided by Prof.r. to determine dose to the kidneys. Treatment was continued until either of the following conditions applied: • PSA/radiographic progression at ?:12 weeks as defined above • Completion of four RL T cycles • 23 Gy kidney dose would be exceeded by the next cycle as estimated by dosimetry • Patient withdrawal (e.g. appearance of intolerable adverse events) Dosimetry data for 20 patients on study (16 from UCLA and 4 from Excel Diagnostics) was analyzed and it was found that the permitted renal dose of 23 Gy was not exceeded in any patient after 4 cycles demonstrating overall favorable renal dosimetry and dosimetry is no longer required per protocol.

For more information, please refer to the Schedule of Events (Appendix ID- 3.2 Rationale for Study Design 3.2.1 Rationale for a regimen with multiple therapy cycles Activity given during targeted radionuclide therapy is limited by radiation dose to healthy organs. Based on dosimetry radiation dose to healthy organs and subsequent maximal cumulative activity can be calculated. To obtain optimal safety margin maximal cumulative activity is not given in one treatment session but approached by application of a defined ,_..__ fraction of this activity in several cycles. The administration of a standard activity over several treatment cycles allows for early and individual estimation of radiation dose and tolerability. The efficacy and safety of a sequential approach was proven in patients with 223Ra therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) [7] and in patients with 177Lu- DOTATA TE tp.erapy for midgut neuroendocrine tumor (NET) [ 54] each in prospective, double-blind, randomized, international, and multicenter phase ID trials. Based on this evidence targeted PSMA Radioligand Therapy (RLT) will be performed by sequential applications of 177Lu-PSMA-617 with treatment-free intervals. 3.2.2 Rationale for eight weeks interval Highest level of evidence for subacute adverse events after radionuclide therapy was published for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Witzig et al analyzed safety and efficacy of90Y- Ibritumomab Tiuxetan in 73 patients in a prospective Phase ID randomized trial. Tbis study reports neutrophil, platelet and nadir approximately six weeks after application of the beta emitter [55].

Here 177Lu-DOTATATE was administered at seven to nine week intervals and rate of severe adverse events was below 10% for 115 patients in the treatment arm [54]. 3.2.3 Rationale for dose regimen Ahmadzadehfar et al reports safety and efficacy after application of a mean activity of 6.0 GBq . -1Z7Lu-PSMA-617 in 24 patients with mCRPC [50]. Patients were treated with up to two cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 RL T at eight week intervals. Grade 3 hematotoxicity occurred in two patients. No nephrotox.icity or hepatotox.icity grade 2:3 was documented. Kratochwil et al reports safety and efficacy after repeated application of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in 30 mCRPC patients [49]. 19 of 30 patients (63%) received 6.0 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617 every two mo. One patient developed grade 3 anemia, one patient grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Both patients had diffuse pattern of bone marrow infiltration at baseline. The German Society ofNuclear Medicine (DGN) performed a questionnaire based survey on the use ofinLu-PSMA-617 RLT in December 2015. Nuclear Medicine Clinics in Germany reported compassionate use of 177Lu- PSMA-617 RLT in 145 mCRPC patients until June 30th 2015 [52]. Majority of patients received 5.5 -6.5 GBq (median 6.0 GBq) or >6.5 GBq (median 7.4 GBq) per cycle (Table 1) and rate of serious adverse events was below 20% for both subgroups. Phase ill data for 177Lu- DOTATATE, a similar RLT for midgut NET patients, demonstrates a rate of severe adverse events below .10% after application of four cycles of 7.4 GBq in 115 patients [ 54]. Thus, present evidence indicates that repeated applications of 6.0 or 7.4 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT are well tolerated with low to very low rates of serious adverse events. Standard activities of 6.0 and 7.4 GBq are also supported by dosimetry data available in more rnifidential '<lge-4-3-ef-9, vs.a 01JUN201s"

Do-sittfetiyidentifies-kidney--and·sa:livary-gl-ands-as-organs-with-highes;-•t- -------- absorbed dose [56] [57]. Thus maximum cumulative activity is determined by absorbed kidney dose. Based on earlier evidence obtained from external beam radiotherapy the maximum tolerable per kidney dose is generally accepted 23 Gy [58]. Dosimetry after 177Lu-PSMA-617 application revealed absorbed doses of 0.6 Gy/GBq per kidney [56] [57]. Therefore maximum cumulative activity for 177Lu-PSMA-617 RL Tis considered 38.3 GBq (38.3 GBq x 0.6 Gy/GBq = 23.0 Gy radiation dose per kidney). Both the application of four cycles of 6.0 GBq (total 24.0 GBq) or 7.4 GBq (total 29.6 GBq) 177Lu-PSMA-617 results in lower cumulative activities with acceptable safety margin. Whether either activity regimen is associated with longer rPFS is unknown and will be evaluated as secondary endpoint of this trial. Salivary glands receive highest off-target radiation dose according to dosimetry [56] [57]. Absorbed dose after four cycles of 6.0 or 7.4 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617 (34.0 Gy or 41.6 Gy respectively) falls within the range of maximum tolerable dose reported for salivary glands in the literature [58] [59] [60]. Maximum tolerable dose to the bone marrow is generally accepted 2 Gy [61]. Bone marrow dose will not exceed this limit after four cycles of 6.0 or 7.4 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617 [57] 1 3.2.4 Determination of Sample Size Sample size calculation was based on the primary endpoint of this protocol, i.e. baseline to 12- week decline in tumor marker level (PSA) 2::50% [53]. Based on a recent publication [52], we estimate that the proportion of patients who meet the primary end point will range between 38% and 65% for both treatment doses. We thus define the following null hypothesis: Less than 40% ofpati~nts will reach the endpoint after 177Lu-PSMA RL T. 177Lu-PSMA RLT would therefore be considered worthy of further study if 50% or more patients met the end point and not worthy of :further study if 40% and less achieved the end point.

Serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events will be collected and reported as required under 21 CFR 31232 until the final study visit. Toxicity will be evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. 7 .1 Adverse Events 7.1.1 Deimitions An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject that is administered a pharmaceutical product, at any dose, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, w!i,ether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that falls into one or more of the following categories: 1. Results in death 2. Is life-threatening: An event which, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at immediate risk of tleath from the event as it occurred and does not include an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 3. Requires subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization: For the seriousness criterion of subject hospitalization to apply, an overnight stay in the hospital is required. Admission to an emergency room and release without an overnight stay would not satisfy the subject hospitalization seriousness criterion. 4.

A congenital anomaly/birth defect: A congenital anomaly/birth defect is defined as a condition believed to have been the result of exposure to study drug just before conception or during pregnancy. 6. Any other important medical event: An important medica! event may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization, but based upon appropriate medical ju<lc,oment, the event may significantly jeopardize the subject's health or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the serious definitions above. An important medical event may include development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse events. 7.1.2, Reporting Serious Adverse Events Seriousness is based on subject, event outcome, or action criteria that are usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining the sponsor's regulatory reporting obligations to the applicable regulatory authorities. Adverse event severity and seriousness should be assessed "" independently by investigators. If the investigator is unsure·ifthe event is serious it should be classified.as serious. Sponsors of the study, and the investigators are responsible for reporting relevant SAEs as safety reports to the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in accordance with ICH guidelines, the US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 CFR 312.32 for Good Clinical Practice, and/or local regulatory requirements.

A Serious Adverse Event Report (SAER) must be completed by the investigator or designee and faxed or emailed to project pharmacovigilance designee within 24 hours after the investigator first becomes aware of the serious event. A separate SAER will be needed for each reported SAE so that the onset, resolution date, causality and outcome can be assessed for each event. A copy of the source documents relevant to the event should be forwarded to sponsor's pharmacovigilance designee with the SAER form. The SAER form must be signed and dated by the investigator. If paper SAE forms are used, the original copy of the SAER form should remain at the investigational site. All SAEs are also to be entered into the CRF. In case of death, a comprehensive narrative report of the case should be prepared by the investigator and sent to project pharmacovigilance designee with the SAER. If an autopsy is performed, a copy of the· autopsy report should be actively sought by the investigator and sent to the sponsor or designee as soon as available. A copy of the autopsy report should remain at the investigational site with the subject's source documents. A new follow-up SAER form will be completed by the investigator jf important follow-up information (i.e., diagnosis, outcome, causality assessment, results of specific investigations) are made available after submission of the initial form. Toe follow-up SAER must be signed and dated by the investigator. The follow-up form and any additional source documentation regarding the event will be sent to project pharmacovigilance designee.

For each event, the following information will be recorded in the subject's source documents and entered into the Adverse Event CRF according to the instructions below: Classification of the Event as serious or non-serious: Classify the event as serious or non- serious (see definitions in Section 7). Description of Signs or Symptoms: Whenever possible, record a specific diagnosis for the event. If a diagnosis cannot be made, then record each sign or symptom representing a distinct medical concept separately, (e.g. nausea and vomiting should be recorded as separate events). Onset Date and Time: Record the date and time the event starts. If a laboratory result is reported as an AE, record the start date as the date of collection of the first lab sample that shows the change. Stop Date and Time: Record the date and time the event resolves, returns to baseline, or resolves with sequelae. Grade: Refer to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) Version 4. Relationship to the Study Drug: We make every effort to evaluate the relationship between the study drug and the AE as determined by the investigator per the definitions below: 1. Related: The event is reasonably suspected of a causal relationship to the study · drug. Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.
