Study Period: The study period will include a 4 -week screening period, a 2 week treatment period of vofatamab monotherapy, followed by a treatment period of vofatamab plus pembrolizumab to complete 2 years of combination vofatamab and pembrolizumab therapy (21 -days per cycle for combination treatment), End of Treatment visit, and telephone follow -up to monitor survival. Phase of Development: 1b/2 Study Rationale: To date, several FDA -approved second -line therapies for the treatment of bladder cancer are available, i ncluding immune checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) are highly effective in a small subset of patients, the majority of patients have disease which progre sses while receiving CPI therapy. A significant unmet medical need exists for patients with relapsed or refractory urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) who have failed first or second line therapy. The inhibition of programmed cell death protein (PD -1) pathway by CPIs relies on a host immune response against tumor cells for efficacy. Consequently, emerging clinical and nonclinical data suggest that tumors with a non -inflamed phenotype are less likely to respond to immune CPI therapy. Research has found that muta tions in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3 ) and FGFR3 expression are associated with the non -inflamed bladder cancer phenotype ( Sweis 2015 ). Furthermore, luminal type I bladder cancers, which have the highest expression of FGFR3 when compared across bladder cancer subtypes, have been reported to have the poorest response rate to CPI treatment ( Rosenberg 2016 ). Vofatamab is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody specific for FGF R3 that is being developed to target FGFR3 -positive tumors. Non -clinical studies have also shown that vofatamab suppresses FGFR3 mediated cell proliferation and exerts strong anti -tumor activity in mouse xenograft models of bladder cancer. Clinical data de monstrate that the majority of patients with UCC express FGFR3 on the tumor cell surface (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2014 ; Carneiro 2015 )."

Exploratory objective (Cohort 4): • To evaluate the efficacy of vofatamab in combination with pembrolizumab in the treatment of unselected subjects with UCC as measured by ORR, DOR, PFS, and DCR per iRECIST Study Design and Methodology: This is a Phase 1b/2 , multi -center, open -label study to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of vofatamab plus pembrolizumab in the treatment of subjects with locally advanced or metastatic UCC, who have progressed following platinum -based chemotherapy , and who have not received prior immune chec kpoint inhibitor or FGFR inhibitor -targeted therapy. The study consists of 3 parts: 1. A Phase 1b which planned to enroll up to 18 patients in a 6+6 design. 8 subjects, 7 WT and 1 Mut/Fus were enrolled (study completed). 2. A Phase 2 enrolling 60 subjects in 3 seperate cohorts : 20 WT (Cohort 1) , 20 Mut/Fus (Cohort 2) , and 20 with luminal biology sub-type (Cohort 3) . 3. A Phase 2 expansion enrolling 30 unselected subjects (independent of their FGFR3 genetic status) (Cohort 4) Prior to study enrollment, the availabi lity of an archival tumor sample must be requested from participants and availability must be confirmed during screening . A blood sample may be substituted to determine FGFR3 genetic status archival tumor is not available . If an archival biopsy is not available, during the screening window a pre -treatment diagnostic biopsy within 56 days of first study treatment may be obtained to satisfy this requirement, if submi tted for additonal required studies . A second biopsy will be taken during treatment for cohorts 1, 2 and 3 or i f an expansion phase patient opts in . Study biopsies may not be obtained from lung, bone , or brain ."

If the sample is adequate, it may be substituted for the initial (pre - treatment) Cycle 0 biomarker biopsy . After this first biomarker tumor biopsy, subjects will be treated in Cycle 0 with an intrav enous (IV) infusion of vofatamab alone. The second biomarker tumor biopsy should be obtained within 3 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 infusion of vofatamab plus pembrolizumab. If the biopsy occurs on Cycle 1 Day 1, it should be obtained prior to the start of the inf usion of vofatamab and pembrolizumab . The first cohort of 6 subjects will be treated with vofatamab 25 mg/kg IV monotherapy as a 2-week cycle (Cycle 0) and vofatamab 25mg/kg IV in combination with pembrolizumab as a 3-week cycle (Cycle 1). Subjects will b e followed for at least a 35 -day dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) window from first dose of vofatamab (14 days of vofatamab monotherapy and 21 days of combination therapy). If ≤ 1 subject experiences a DLT (a Grade 3 or higher AE attributed to vofatamab and/or pembrolizumab), then 25 mg/kg will be declared the RP2D . If 2 or more subjects experience a DLT, then the dose of vofatamab will be de -escalated as outlined in the table below. Dosing for Dose De -escalation Dose Level 0 Dose Level -1 Dose Level -2 Vofatamab 25 mg/kg IV q 3 weeks (n=6) 20 mg/kg IV q 3 weeks (n=6) 15 mg/kg IV q 3 weeks (n=6) On Cycle 1 Day 1, Phase 1b subjects will receive treatment of vofatamab (25 mg/kg [or the RP2D if different than 25 mg/kg]) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg) once every 3 weeks (Q3W) until disease progression, death, decision to discontinue treatment, investigator discretion, or study termination. Subjects who do not exp erience a s tudy defined DLT , but do not complete the 35 -day observation window may be replaced . As of April 03 2018, Phase 1 b of the study is complete. Phase 2 and Phase 2 expansion: Phase 2 opened on April 04, 2018 following review of the aggregate adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) by the vofatamab program Safety Steering Committee ( SSC) after the 35 -day DLT observation period in the Phase 1b subjects. The dose of vofatamab selected was dose level 0 (25 mg/kg given ever y 3 week s) for the RP2D as no subjects met the study DLT definition of a Grade 3 or higher AE attributed to vofatamab and/or pembrolizumab. After the 1st planned interim analysis which was conducted in April of 2019 , the decision to open the expansion phase was made based on initial efficacy and safety (reported ASCO 2019) to unselected subjects based on the ORR seen in both cohorts . Additionally , the exclusion criteria for ex isting anticoag ulation use was removed following a review of the existing safety data by the data safety steering committee that was accepted on review by the FDA . For Phase 2, s ubjects will be assigned to one of three cohorts by either baseline FGFR3 genetic status of WT (Coho rt 1) or Mut/Fus (Cohort 2), or by bladder cancer molecular subtype (Cohort 3) .

Cohort 3 will be enrolled at selected sites enrolling patients enriched with tumor s showing luminal biology as determined by IHC (GATA 3 positive with the absence of KRT14 ) and post enrollment by the Decipher Bladder test or acceptable comparable test on samples that were obtained at or after the time when the subject was found to have muscle invasive / metasta tic disease . Cohort 3 will be used to study the molecular changes in the tumor after the first dose of combination treatment of vofatamab and pembrolizumab. All subjects in Phase 2 (Cohorts 1, 2 and 3) will have a biomarker tumor biopsy taken within 14 days prior to Cycle 0 (lead -in cycle). If the subject has undergone a diagnostic tumor biopsy procedure within 56 days of enrolling in the study, and the biopsy has adequate material, this sample may be used in place of the first biomarker biopsy . A secon d biopsy will be taken during treatment. Subjects will be treated in Cycle 0 with an IV infusion of vofatamab alone (without pembrolizumab) . For Phase 2, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, a second tumor biopsy will be obtained 14 days after Cycle 0 Day 1 of vofatamab . The second tumor biopsy should always occur within 3 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 infusion and prior to the first dose of vofatamab plus pembrolizumab . For patients enrolled in Coh ort 3, the second tumor biopsy will occur at the end of cycle 1 of the combination ( Week 5 ), within 3 days before Cycle 2, Day 1 and prior to the administration of the second combination dose of vofatamab and pembrolizumab. Disease re -staging will occur following Cycle 1 for biomarker correlation for all subjects whom underwent paired biops ies but will not be utilized for RECIST evaluation . Subjects whom do not get paired biopsies would not be required to get a scan at the end of Cycle 1. Paired Biopsies will be optional for any patient enrolled in Phase 2 expansion, Cohort 4. If biopsies are performed, the second biospy will be taken at end of cycle 1, Week 5. On Cycle 1 Day 1, subjects will receive combined treatment of vofatamab (25 mg/kg) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg). Subjects will continue to receive vofatamab plus pembrolizumab Q3W until disease progression, death, decision to discontinue treatment, investigator discretion, or study termination or the completion of 2 years of vofata mab and pembrolizumab therapy . Subjects may continue vofatamab and/or pembrolizumab treatment beyond radiological disease progression following discussion with the medical monitor and based on clinical judgement of the investigator that the subject is exp eriencing clinical benefit. It is highly encouraged that prior to discontinuation of any subject whom is receiving clinical benefit that a consultation occur with the study PI or medical monitor. Subjects who discontinue vofatamab may continue on study and receive pembrolizumab alone until disease progression, death, withdrawal of patient consent, investigator discretion, or study termination , or the completion of 2 years of pembrolizumab therapy."

July 01, 2019 Page 28 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background on Urothelial Cell Carcinoma Urothelial cell carcinoma ( UCC; also known as transitional cell carcinoma [TCC] ) occurs in the urinary system (i.e., kidneys, urinary bladder, and accessory organs) and is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for 90% of all bladder tumors ( Eble 2004 ). It is the fifth most commo n cancer in the United States (US) ( Costantini 2011 ) and fourth most common cancer in Europe ( Jemal 2011 ); with an estimated 74,690 new cases and 15,580 deaths occurring in the US in 2014 ( Cancer.org ), and an estimated 136,000 new cases and 49,000 deaths occurring in Europe in 2009 ( Bellmunt 2009 ). Clinical and pathological studies have identified two variants of urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder ( UCB ) which arise via distinct mechanisms , a low -grade papillary variant and an invasive tumor variant (Wu 2005 , Vallot 2011 ). The low -grade papillary variant accounts for 80% of all UCBs and arises from urothelial hyperplasia . The five -year survival for this tumor type, when treated with surgery and intravesical immunotherapy, is greater than 90% (Cancer.org ). The invasive tumor variant represent s 20% of UCBs and has a poor prognosis . Cisplatin -based chemotherapy with either a dose dense MVAC ( Sternberg 2001 ) or gemcitabine cisplatin ( von der Maase 2000 ) remains the standard treatment for invasive UCC. D espite initial response rates on the order of 50 to 70%, this cancer typically progresses rapidly with a med ian survival of around 13 to 15 months ( von der Maa se 2000 ; Siefker -Radtke 2002 ). 1.1.1 FGF R3 in Bladder Cancer Recent studies have shown that UCC tumors often have genetic alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ( FGFR3 ) or amplification/overexpression of FGFR3 (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2013 , Tomlinson 2007a , Gust 2013 ). FGFR3 belongs to a family of structurally -related tyros ine kinase receptors encoded by four different genes (FGFR1 -4). These receptors regulate various biological processes, including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. Inappropriate FGFR3 signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of the majority of muscle invasive UCC tumors with a notable percentage ( approximately 20%) caused by activating FGFR3 mutations or gene fusions, and a significant percentage (50% or greater ) expressing the receptor ( Gomez -Roman 2005 , Tomlinson 2007a , Gust 2013 , Rainier unpublished data ). Preclinical data from several lines of investigation, including short hairpin ribonucleic acid knockdown ( Tomlinson 2007b , Qing 2009 ), antibody targeting (Martinez -Torrecuadrada 2005 , Qing 2009 ), and small molecule inhibition ( Lamo nt 2011 ) of FGFR3 in bladder cancer cell lines, also demonstrate that FGFR3 is essential for UCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo . Additional studies have shown that FGFR3 mutations and expression are associated with the non-inflamed bladder cancer phenot ype (Sweis 2015 ; Rosenberg 2016 ). Blockade of the FGFR3 pathway could enhance immune cell infiltrate into tumors that express FGFR3 or in which the FGFR3 pathway is activated. Luminal sub-type I bladder cancers are predicted to be highest in FGFR3 expression , have the highest prevalence of FGFR3 mutations (Choi 2014 , Robertson 2017 ), and have the poorest response rate to CPI treatment"
28,page_28,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 29 (Rosenbe rg 2016 ). There is pre -clinical data suggesting that treatment of luminal cell lines with FGFR inhibition may enhance response including immune markers (McConkey/Hahn unpublished dat a), making these tumors more susceptible to immunotherapy and providing the rationale for sequential treatment with FGFR3 and programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) inhibition. A single case report by Nassar et al. reported a complete response in an FGFR3 - TACC3 fusion patient who rec eived B -701 followed by a checkpoint inhibitor (Nassar 2018 ). 1.2 Background on Vofatamab Vofatamab is a phage -derived, affinity -matured, human monoclonal antibody specific for FGFR3. It is based on a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG 1) framework containing heavy chain V HIII and light chain VκI subgroup sequences. Vofatamab can be used to target FGFR3 -positive tumors via three possible modes of action: (1) the blocking of ligand binding , receptor dimerization and activation, and downstream receptor signaling, (2) eliciting effector function such as antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), a nd/or (3) antagonizing l igand -independent activating mutations (Qing 2009 ). 1.2.1 Non-clinical Data with Vofatamab In in vivo studies, vofatamab demonstrated binding to FGFR3 from multiple species, including mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human. Vofatamab also inhibited ligand binding to FGFR3, prevented receptor−receptor association, blocked receptor dimerization, and blocked downstream signaling from both wild -type (WT) and common mutant variants of FGFR3, as well as FGFR3 -TACC3 fusions linked with bladder cancer. --- Vofatamab suppresse d FGFR3mediated cell proliferation and exert ed strong antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models of both bladder carcinoma and t(4;14)po sitive multipl e myeloma . Anti - tumor activity was due to direct inhibition of FGFR3 signaling and/or engagement of ADCC. Vofatamab was well -tolerated and resulted in no severe toxicities when administered intravenously weekly for 8 weeks (total of nine dos es) in either rats or cynomolgus monkeys and weekly for 26 weeks in juvenile monkeys, at doses up to the maximum feasible dose of 50 mg/kg. Vofatamab -related effects in the repeat -dose toxicity study in rats were limited to microscopic findings of minimal to slight focal tubular hypospermatogenesis/atrophy in male rats at the recovery necropsy. These o bservations were limited in distribution and severity , and therefore considered unlikely to result in a detectable impact on fertility. Vofatamab - related effects that were observed in the 8 -week cynomolgus monkey study included increased spleen weight and minimal/moderate splenic lymphoid hyperplasia at terminal necropsy. These effect s were reversible and not considered adverse. Similarly, administration of vofatamab weekly for 26 weeks was well -tolerated in juvenile monkeys. Changes considered related to vofatamab treatment were limited to moderate increases in white blood cell counts at the 50 mg/kg dose (i.e., increases in lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils and large unstained cells). These changes were no longer present during the recovery period and in the absence of other correlating changes were not considered toxicologically sign ificant."

July 01, 2019 Page 30 Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of vofatamab in mice, Sprague -Dawley rats, and cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated both non -linear and linear PK characteristics , suggesting that the total clearance ( CL) of vofatamab consists of contributions of a specifi c (target -mediated) CL component and a non -specific CL component, with the specific CL component having a greater contribution at lower doses. In repeat -dose toxicology studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, drug exposure increased proportionally with w eekly (qw) intravenous ( IV) doses of 5, 15, and 50 mg/kg, suggesting limited contribution of saturable target -mediated CL to the overall CL at these dose levels. Overall, the PK assessment indicates that vofatamab behaves like a typical IgG1 , with some contr ibution of target -mediated clearance indicated by higher total CL estimates at the lower doses.

The safety and PK of escalating doses of vofatamab were evaluated following IV infusion of vofatamab to subjects once every 28 days (on Day 1 of each cycle) , with an additional loading dose on Day 8 of Cycle 1 only. Doses of 2, 4, 8, 15, and 30 mg/kg of vofatamab were evaluated in 26 subjects. The study was terminated early by the Sponsor for reasons unrelated to efficacy or safety. All 26 subjects enrolled were in the dose -escalation stage , and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The maximum a dministered dose was 30 mg/kg on a 28 -day schedule, and the median number of doses administered for all subjects was 3 (range 1 -16). Overall, vofatamab administered as an IV infusion at doses up to 30 mg/kg on a 28 -day schedule was well -tolerated in subje cts with advanced solid tumors. Two deaths due to disease progression were reported, and no deaths due to treatment -related adverse events (AEs) were reported. Only one dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) was observed in the study; and was reported by one subject in the 30 mg/kg cohort (Grade 4 thrombocytopenia which occurred on Day 4 of treatment and was attributed by the investigator as possibly due to concomitant treatment with levofloxacin ). The AEs assessed as related to vofatamab and occurring in ≥ 10% of t he subjects were fatigue (19.2%) and mucosal inflammation (11.5%). The majority of vofatamab -related AEs reported were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Ten (38.5%) subjects ex perienced Grade ≥ 3 AEs, with 1 (3.8%) having Grade 4 thrombocyto penia and 1 (3.8%) havi ng Grade 3 white blood cell (WBC) count decreased assessed as related to vofatamab . Eleven serious adverse events (SAEs ) were reported in 8 (30.8%) subjects, with 1 (3.8%) subject experiencing one SAE assessed as related to vofatamab . Serum exposure of vofatamab was approximately dose -proportional and increased with dose across the dose range of 2−30 mg/kg. All 26 subjects enrolled in the study had evaluable anti -vofatamab antibodies (ATA) samples after treatment, and all tested negative for antibodies to vofatamab . A total of 10 subjects (38%) had stable disease (SD) as their best clinical response on study . Furthermore, a post-hoc analysis comparing progression -free survival ( PFS) of high -dose vofatamab (30 mg/kg) vs. low doses of vofatamab (< 30 mg/kg) s howed greater PFS in the high-dose subjects (Figure 1). This finding was most notable in the evaluable UCC subpopulation , which had a median PFS of 5.7 months for the high -dose group (n = 5) compared with a median PFS of 1.7 months in the low -dose group ( n = 3). Two subjects with UCC were not considered evaluable and were not included in this analysis ."

The safety and PK of escalating doses of vofatamab were evaluated following IV infusion of vofatamab to subjects weekly for 3 weeks (Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle), followed by a single infusion of th e same dose on Day 1 of the subsequent cycles. Doses of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 15 mg/kg of vofatamab were evaluated in 14 subjects. The median number of cycles administered was 1.5 and the median number of doses administered was 3.5. The study was terminated early by the Sponso r due to unsatisfactory enrollment. All subjects had discontinued from the study at the time of study termination for the following reasons: 10 (71.4%) subjects due to disease progression, 3 (21.4%) subjects died (including 2 subjects who died due to dise ase progression and 1 subject who died due to disease progression with Grade 5 intracranial hemorrhage), and 1 (7.1%) subject due to subject/legal guardian decision to withdraw. All 14 subjects experienced at least on e AE. The most common AEs irrespective of study drug attributio n were fatigue experienced by 6 (42.9%) subjects; anemia and nausea experienced by 4 (28.6%) subjects each; diarrhea, dyspnea, headache, and thrombocytopenia experienced by 3 (21.4%) subjects each; and confusional state, cough, dec reased appetite, hypercalcemia, neutropenia, peripheral edema, platelet count decreased, pyrexia, and urinary tract infection experienced by 2 (14.3%)"

A total of 6 subjects experience d 9 SAE s between Cycle 1 Day 1 and 90 days after the last administration of vofatamab , including one SAE of Grade 5 intracranial hemorrhage and one SAE of Grade 2 pyrexia, which was deemed related to vofatamab . All other SAEs were considered unrelated to vofatamab . There were no AEs of special interest, and there were no additional AEs of interest identified during the conduct of the study. Furthermore, no events were identified as a DLT and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached prior to the Sponsor’s decision to stop enrollment. Given the small sample size, no definitive conclusions regarding anti -tumor activity could be drawn. The best overall response achieved was that of SD, which was reported in 7 of 14 subjects. Exposure to vofatamab increased with increasing dose. Increases in exposure were non -dose proportional in the lower dose groups of 1 and 2 mg/kg , and approximately dose proportional at all other dose groups ( i.e., 4, 8, and 15 mg/kg). FGFR3 levels d id not appreciably change upon vofatamab treatment, regardless of dose. 1.2.2.3 A Dose Escalation, Expansion Study of Vofatamab (B -701) Alone, Plus Docetaxel, or Versus Docetaxel in Subjects with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cell Carcinoma who have Relapsed After, or are Refractory to Standard Therapy (Study B -701-U21) Enrollmen t is complete of the study. In the Phase 1b, 20 subjects have been enrolled of whom 19 subjects have received at least one dose of study drug. No protocol -defined dose limiting toxicities were observed during the safety window in Cohort 1. The dosing regimen of 25 mg/kg of vofatamab and 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel every 3 weeks has been selected as the recommended dosing regimen for the remaining subjects on study. Of the 19 evaluable subjects in the Phase 1b safety population, subjects had a mean age of 65 years (range 57 -76), were predominately white (95%), and the majority were male (74%) and had an ECOG performance status of 1 (58%). All subjects received at least 1 line of chemotherapy and most subjects had received 2 or more prior treatments (73.7%), w ith 42.1% refractory to the last line of therapy. At study enrollment, 10.5% of subjects had liver metastases. Thirteen subjects had FGFR3 WT and 6 subjects had FGFR3 Mut/Fus, with similar pretreatment characteristics between the 2 groups. The median numbe r of days of exposure was 96, with a clear difference in exposure based on Mut/Fus versus WT (147 vs 22 days). All subjects in Cohort 1 have discontinued study treatment, predominantly due to disease progression (12/19 subjects/63%). Phase 2 consisted of two cohorts, cohort 2 of subjects who received vofatamab in combination with docetaxel, and cohort 3 of subjects who were treated with vofatamab monotherapy.

The study consists of 2 parts: a Phase 1b lead - in phase enrolling six (6) to 18 subjects and a Phase 2 dose expansion phase enrolling up to 74 subjects . Patients in the Phase 1b were unselected for FGFR3 status, whereas patients in the Phase 2 are assigned to Cohort 1 if their tumor is FGFR3 WT and to Cohort 2 if their tumor is FGFR3 mut/fus. Patien ts are treated with vofatamab 25 mg/kg IV monotherapy as a 2-week cycle (Cycle 0) and vofatamab 25mg/kg IV in combination with pembrolizumab as a 3-week cycle (Cycle 1 and following cycles) . The Phase 1b study initiated enrollment on October 2017 with the last subject enrolled in this cohort in February 2018. There was 1 subject enrolled under amendment 1 who received 1 dose of vofatamab and was taken off study after a program wide safety hold. This subject was not included in the DLT analysis as they neve r received the combination therapy but was included in the safety analysis. After review of safety data and an amendment to the protocol (amendment 2), the program resumed enrollment. A total of 7 additional subjects were enrolled in Phase 1b. Six subjects were evaluable , and 1 subject was replaced due to disease progression and the need for palliative treatment during the DLT safety window. Of the 8 subjects in the Phase 1b safety population, subjects had a mean age of 62 years (range 44 -78), all (100%) w ere white and male and the majority (75%) had an ECOG performance status of 1.

July 01, 2019 Page 35 UCC who have disease progression during or following platinum -containing ch emotherapy or disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum - containing chemotherapy . Pembrolizumab is also approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic UCC who are not eligi ble for cisplatin -containing chemotherapy . The regular approval for the second -line indication was based on data from Trial KEYNOTE -045, a multicenter, randomized, active -controlled study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinom a with disease progression on or after platinum containing - chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks (Q3W; n = 270) or investigator’s choice of a chemotherapy regimen (paclitaxel [n = 84] , docetaxel [n = 84], or vinflunine [n = 87]) Q3W (n = 272). The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) for patients assigned to pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy. Median OS was 10.3 and 7.4 months in the pembrolizumab and chemotherapy arms, respectively (HR : 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.91, p = 0.004). ORR was 21% for pembrolizumab and 11% for chemotherapy (p = 0.002). No statistically significant difference in progression -free s urvival (PFS) between the two arms was observed. The accelerated approval for the first -line indication was based on data from KEYNOTE --052, a single -arm, open -label study in 370 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were deemed not eligible for cisplatin -containing chemotherapy. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W . With a median follow -up time of 7.8 months, the ORR was 28.6% (95% CI 24, 34) and the median response duration was not reached (range : 1.4+, 17.8+ months). The most common adverse reactions reported for at least 20% of pembrolizumab -treated patients in either of the two studies included fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pruritu s, decreased appetite, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and rash. Discontinuation of pembrolizumab secondary to adverse reactions occurred in 8% of patients in KEYNOTE -045 and in 11% in KEYNOTE -052. Dose interruption of pembrolizumab occurred in approximate ly 20% of patients in either study . Serious adverse reactions occurred in approximately 40% of pembrolizumab -treated patients. Immune -mediated adverse reactions, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies (hypophysitis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and Type 1 Diabetes mellitus), and renal dysfunction , were reported in the studies and were managed according to guidelines in Warnings and Precautions of the label for pembrolizumab . Complete information on dosage and administration, safety information, non -clinical and clinical studies is contained in the FDA approved label for pembrolizumab (available at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/125514lbl.pdf ). 1.4 Rationale for Combin ing Vofatamab and Pembrolizumab To date, several FDA -approved second -line therap ies for the treatment of b ladder cancer are available, including the immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) such as atezolizumab , avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab . Although immune CPIs have the"
35,page_35,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 36 potential to be a major advance in the second -line treatment of UCC, the inhibition of the programmed cell death protein (PD -1) pathway by CPIs depends on an immune response against tumor cells for efficacy . Consequently, emerging clinical and non -clinical data suggest that tumors with a non -inflamed phenotype are less likely to respond to immune CPI therapy. Moreover, w hile CPIs are highly effective in a small subset of patients whose tumors express PD -1, the majority of patients have disease which will progress while receiving this therapy. Thus, a significant unmet medical need exists for patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic UCC, especially for those tumors that do not have an inflammatory signature. Recent work using gene expression profiling suggests there are at least two main intrinsic subtypes of UCC, which differ in their response and benefit to systemic chemotherapy (Choi 2014 ; McConkey 2016 ; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2014 ). The basal subtype, which is typically associated with markers associated with stem cells, CK 5/6 positivity, and rapid proliferation, in addition to markers of angiogenesis, and ma rkers of the immune system has a worse prognosis compared with luminal tumors which are typically associated with uroplakin markers, GATA3 positivity on immunohistochemistry (IHC) , FGFR3 overexpression and mutations, and lower proliferation with an improve d prognosis compared with untreated basal tumors. Using gene expression profiling the basal subtype was found to be predictive of improved survival outcomes when treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( McConkey 2016 ). This is the first clinical data which suggests that bladder cancer is not just one disease, and that with subtyping we may select patients most likely to benefit from specific therapies. Overexpression of FGFR and FGFR3 mutations are most commonly observed in lum inal type I tumors, and are often associated with downstream markers of pathway activation including PPARGamma expression (Choi 2014 ; Cance r Genome Atlas Research Network 2014 ). FGFR3 positive luminal tumors also lack immune cell infiltration, and the typical inflammatory markers associated with immune system sensitivity, leading us to predict that this subtype would also be resistant to immune checkpoint inhibition (Sweis 2015 ). Recent data from Rosenberg et al. support the hypothesis that the luminal subtype 1 is associated with the lack of response and benefit from PD -L1 inhibition (Rosenberg 2016 ). Therefore, inhibiting the FGFR3 p athway may overcome the immuno - silencing noted in the luminal I subtype. Vofatamab is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody specific for FGFR3 that is being developed to target FGFR3 -positive tumors. Non-clinical studies have also shown that vofatamab suppresses FGFR3 mediated cell proliferation and exerts strong anti -tumor activity in mouse xenograft models of bladder cancer. Clinical data demonstrate that the majority of patients with UCC express FGFR3 on the tumor cell surface (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2014 ; Carneiro 2015 ). This study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of combining vofatamab with pembrolizumab. It is designed to assess whether vofatamab enhance s immune cell infiltration or increase markers of immune system activation in subjects which in turn will enhance the efficacy of pembrolizumab. In addition , it will explore the impact of vofatamab on the tumor cell microenvironment . There is pre -clinical d ata suggesting that treatment of luminal cell"

The study consists of 3 parts: 4. A Phase 1b which planned to enroll up to 18 patients in a 6+6 design. 8 subjects, 7 WT and 1 Mut/Fus were enrolled (study completed). 5. A Phase 2 enrolling 60 subjects: 20 WT (Cohort 1) , 20 Mut/Fus (Cohort 2) , and 20 with tumors showing luminal biology (Cohort 3) . Of these, 20 WT and 8 Mut/Fus subjects have already been enrolled. No further WT patients will be enrolled; a further 12 Mut/Fus and 20 with luminal biology will be enrolled. 6. A Phase 2 expansion enrolling 30 unselected patients (independent of their FGFR3 status) (Cohort 4) Prior to study enrollment, the availability of an archival tumor sample must be requested from participants and avai lability must be confirmed during screening. A blood sample may be substituted to determine FGFR3 genetic status archival tumor is not available. If an archival biopsy is not available, during the screening window a pre -treatment diagnostic biopsy within 5 6 days of first study treatment may be obtained to satisfy this requirement, if submitted for additonal required studies. A second biopsy will be taken during treatment for cohorts 1, 2 and 3 or if an expansion phase patient opts in. Study biopsies may not be obtained from lung, bone, or brain . For the Phase 2 expansion (Cohort 4), the paired biopsies are optional, but if they are taken, the second biospywill be taken at end of cycle 1, Week 5. Subjects will be required to sign a separate consent form and must confirm their decision to opt -in. Phase 1b: Enrolled subjects in Phase 1b will have a biomarker tumor biopsy taken prior to Cycle 0 (lead -in cycle) • Within 7 days prior if an archival sample is available for screening • If an archival sample is not available, a biopsy should be obtained within the 28 -days screening window. If the sample is adequate, it may be substituted for the initial (pre - treatment) Cycle 0 biomarker biopsy. After this first on -study biopsy, subjects will be treated in Cycle 0 with an intravenous (IV) infusion of vofatamab alone . The second biomarker tumor biopsy should be obtained within 3 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 infusion of vofatamab plus pembrolizumab. If the biopsy is on Cycle 1 Day 1, it should be obtained prior to the start of infusion of vofatamab with pembrolizumab ."

Subjects who do not experience a study defined DLT but do not complete the 35 -day observation window may be replaced . As of April 03, 2018, the Phase 1b portion of the study was complete d with no protocol -defined DLTs reported. Phase 2 and Phase 2 expansion : Phase 2 opened on April 04, 2018 following review of the aggregate adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) by the vofatamab program Safety Steering Committee (SSC) after the 35 -day DLT observation period in the Phase 1b subjects. The dose of vofatamab selected was dose level 0 (25 mg/kg given every 3 weeks) for the RP2D as no subjects met the study DLT definition of a Grade 3 or higher AE attributed to vofatamab and/or pembrolizumab. For Phase 2, s ubjects will be assigned to one of three cohorts by eithe r baseline FGFR3 status of WT (Cohort 1) or Mut/Fus (Cohort 2), or by bladder cancer subtype (luminal biology, Cohort 3). As of December 31, 2018, the WT cohort has been fully enrolled and is closed. For Cohort 2, Mut/Fus status must be confirmed pr ior to initiation of treatment. Cohort 3 will be enrolled at selected limited sites based on their tumor showing luminal biology, to study the molecular changes in the tumor after the first dose of combination treatment of vofatamab and pembrolizumab. All subjects in Phase 2 (Cohort s 1, 2 and 3) will have a bioma rker tumor biopsy taken within 14 days prior to Cycle 0 (lead -in cycle). If the subject has undergone a diagnostic tumor biopsy procedure within 56 days of enrolling in the study, and the biopsy has adequate material, this sample may be used in place of the first biomarker biopsy. Biopsies will not be required for any patient enrolled in Phase 2 expansion, Cohort 4. If a second biopsy is performed, it will be at end of cycle 1, Week 5."

July 01, 2019 Page 45 3.2 Discussion and Rationale for Study Design 3.2.1 Selection of Dose and Dosing Schedule Pembrolizumab will be used at the dose regimen indicated on its package insert for metastatic UCC. The do se regimen of vofatamab is based on the Phase 1 clinical PK and safety data in advanced solid tumors and should ensure > 90% patients achieve the estimated efficacious exposure. Since each drug has distinct and non -overlapping targets and suppression of each target to the fullest extent possible is desirable, both drugs will be used at full dose from the beginning of the study with the option for de -escalation of vofatamab if unanticipated safety events are observed . To safeguard the interests of study participants, the toxicity of vofatamab plus pembrolizumab will be monitored closely by a Safety Steering Committee (S SC) (Section 3.2.2 ). 3.2.1.1 Vofatamab The vofatamab dose and schedule in this study is consistent with study drug administration in the ongoing Phase 2 study and based on safety and PK data obtained from completed Phase 1 studies. The dosing regimen of vofatamab at 25 mg/kg every 21 days was selected since it is estimated to provide a steady -state area under the concentration curve (AUC) comparable to 30 mg/kg every 28 days, a dose and regimen that was administered and found to be generally safe and well -tolerated in the completed Phase 1 study in advanced solid tumors. The safety of this dose in combination with pembrolizumab will be confirmed in the Phase 1b portion of this protocol. From an efficacy perspective, this dose is anticipated to be sufficient based on extrapolation from preclinical PK/pharmacodynamic analyses. Furthermore, the 14-day dosing period in phase 1b and initial phase 2 prior to initiating pembrolizumab therapy provides a window for immune cell recruitment without delaying the onset of immune checkpoint therapy for an extended period. Additional supporting details: • Murine PK modeling indicated a steady -state AUC of 850 day × µg/mL on a weekly basis, or 3400 day × µg /mL with administration every 4 weeks was needed for efficacy. Using compartmental PK analysis, IV administration of 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg of vofatamab every 21 days are expected to have steady state AUC of 3529 day × µg/mL and 5293 day × µg/mL, respective ly. Thus, 25 mg/kg every 21 days is predicted to provide adequate doses for efficacy. • In a Phase 1 study, administration of vofatamab across the dose range of 2 -30 mg/kg every 28 -days was well -tolerated in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Serum expos ure of vofatamab was approximately dose -proportional and increased with dose across the range tested. Six of the 10 subjects who had SD as their best clinical response on study were treated with 30 mg/kg vofatamab every 28 -days."
45,page_45,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 46 Based on a population PK an alysis, the post -hoc estimate of steady -state AUC for 30 mg/kg every 28 -days was 5021 day × µg/mL 3.2.1.2 Pembrolizumab Binding of the PD -1 ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2, to the PD -1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upr egulation of PD -1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T -cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD -1 and blocks its interaction with PD -L1 and PD -L2, releasing the PD -1 pathway -mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti -tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking the PD-1 pathway activity resulted in decreased tumor growth. In clinical studies , blockin g the PD -1 pathway resulted in efficacious treatment of melanoma, non -small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer. The recommended clinically approved dose of pembrolizumab for the treatment of UCC is 200 mg IV over 30 minutes Q3W. At t his dose pembrolizumab has activity in advanced UCC with an ORR of 29% in patients ineligible for platinum therapy and 22% in patients post-platinum therapy . 3.2.2 Safety Monitoring Rules and the Safety Steering Committee The toxicity of vofatamab plus pembrolizumab will be monitored by an SSC, composed of a Rainier medical representative and three independent UCC specialists . SSC review meetings will be defined in an approved SSC charter . Standard safety monitoring will be employed for DLT assessment a nd dose de-escalation decisions. All AEs will be considered during the DLT assessment period (Day 1 through Day 35) unless an event is clearly unrelated to trial treatment. Before dose de -escalation (if applicable) at each dose level of vofatamab and at any other time that safety data warrant review, the Rainier MM will review safety data in consultation with the S SC, as appropriate. For study monitoring and decisions about treatment, a subject in Phase 1b will be determined to have a DLT defined as follows: The subject experiences any Grade 3 or higher treatment -emergent AE that is possibly or definitely related to either vofatamab and/or pembrolizumab received on this protocol and occurs up to 35 days after Cycle 0 Day 1 . The e xception is that a treatment -emergent AE that is potentially treatable with steroids will only count as a DLT if it does not improve to Grade 1 or better within 2 weeks after starting steroids . 3.2.3 Selection of Study Population This study will be conducted in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic UCC who have progressed following treatment with platinum -based chemotherapy or who are not eligible for cisplatin -containing chemotherapy . This population was chosen on the basis of high unmet need , consistency with the cur rent pembrolizumab label , and preclinical and clinical evidence that vofatamab administered with a PD -1 inhibitor has promising therapeutic"

Subjects will begin combination treatme nt with vofatamab plus pembrolizumab on approximately Day 15 (i.e., Cycle 1 Day 1). Subjects will receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) by IV infusion over 30 ( -5/+10) minutes followed by vofatamab (25 mg/kg) by IV infusion over 90 (± 15) minutes. If Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 vofatamab infusions have been well -tolerated, subsequent doses of vofatamab may be administered over 30 (± 10) minutes, followed by a 30-minute observation period post -infusion . The vofatamab infusion will begin approximately 30 minutes after co mpletion of the pembrolizumab infusion. Thereafter, combination vofatamab plus pembrolizumab treatment will be administered Q3W (Day 1 of each cycle ± 7 days) until disease progression, death, decision to discontinue treatment, investigator discretion, or study termination. Dosing guidelines for vofatamab and pembrolizumab are summarized in Table 3.

July 01, 2019 Page 54 pembrolizumab treatment beyond progression if the investigator feels they are experiencing benefit . This decision wi ll be made in consultation with the medical monitor. Acceptable toxicity: All study drug -related AEs from prior infusions must have decreased to Grade 1 or baseline grade on or before the day of the next infusion. Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed after a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the subject by the investigator and approval from the Medical Monitor , with the option of dosing vofatamab at the full dose of 25 mg/kg or reducing the dose of vofatamab to 20 mg/kg (Dose Level -1) or to 15 mg/kg (Dose Level -2). No further dose de -escalation may be done in this study, and the subject should be discontinued for unacceptable toxicity if 15 mg/kg is not tolerated . In addition, delay of therapy due to toxicities not attributed to study drug may not require discontinuation and must be dis cussed with the Medical Monitor. This may also apply to pembrolizumab with the following caveats: hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypopituitarism which all may require hormone replacement and are likely irreversible. Subjects with asymptomatic e levations of amylase and lipase have been observed, and may continue on pembrolizumab as long as amylase and lipase levels are < Grade 4 using CTCAE. 5.1.2 Dose Modification There are currently no AEs that are more likely attributed to vofatamab than to pembroli zumab. Subjects will be closely monitored for platelets and coagulation factors including aPTT, PT/INR, and fibrinogen (see Table 1 for the timing of assessments). If either aPTT or PT/INR exceeds 1.5 × ULN or if fibrinogen falls below the LLN, all study drug treatment should be held until these factors return to baseline levels before re -dosing. Exceptions may be allowed upon discuss ion with the Medical Monitor and Investigator. 5.1.2.1 Vofatamab Dose Modification Subjects in whom toxicities have not reversed sufficiently by the scheduled day of infusion (for Cycle 1 and beyond) may have their dose of vofatamab delayed by up to 21 days. If al l study drug –related toxicities have reversed sufficiently and the additional criteria described in Section 5.1.1 have been met, then the subject m ay receive the subsequent dose of vofatamab . Subjects who do not fulfill the criteria for dosing after 21 days have elapsed will be discontinued from vofatamab , but may continue on study and receive pembrolizumab alone until disease progression, death, wi thdrawal of patient consent, investigator discretion, or study termination . Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed following a careful assessment and discussion of risk versus benefit with the subject by the investigator and app roval from the Medical Monitor , with the option of dosing vofatamab at the full dose of 25 mg/kg or reducing the dose of vofatamab to 20 mg/kg (Dose Level -1) or to 15 mg/kg (Dose Level -2). No further dose de -escalation may be done in this study, and the subject should be discontinued for unacceptable toxicity if 15 mg/kg is not tolerated . In"

Subjects will be monitored during and after each vofatamab infusion for 90 minutes after the Cycle 0 (if applicable) and Cycle 1 and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions in the absence of infusion --related AEs. Subjects who experience infusion -related symptoms should be managed as directed in Table 4 below. Table 4 Manageme nt of Infusion -Related Symptoms (e.g., fever, chills/rigors, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, headache, rhinitis, rash, hypotension, hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, dyspnea, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress) Infusion -Related Symptoms a Guidance Grade 1−2 • Slow or hold infusion. • Give supportive treatment b. • Upon symptom resolution, may resume infusion rate escalation at the investigator’s discretion c. Grade 3-4 • Discontinue infusion immediately, treat symptoms aggressively, and do not restart drug. a Refer to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.0, for the grading of symptoms. This table does not refer to management of IgE -mediated allergic reactions, which should be managed as directed in text following this table. b Supportive treatment: Subjects should be treated with acetaminophen/paracetamol and an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine if they have not been received in the last 4 hours. Intravenous saline may be indicated. For bronchospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, subjects may require antihistamines, ox ygen, corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg IV prednisolone or equivalent), and/or bronchodilators. For hypotension, subjects may require vasopressors. c Infusion rate escalation after re -initiation: Upon complete resolution of symptoms, the infusion may be resumed at 50% of the rate achieved prior to interruption. In the absence of infusion -related symptoms, the rate of infusion may be escalated in increments of 50 mg/h every 30 minutes. Subjects who experience vofatamab infusion -related temperature elevations of > 38.5C or other minor infusion -related symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen (≥ 500 mg) and/or H 1 and H 2 histamine -receptor antagonists (e.g., diphenhydramine, ranitidine). Serious infusion -related events manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should be managed with additional supportive therapies (e.g., supplemental oxygen, 2-agonists, and/or corticosteroids) as clinically indicated ac cording to standard clinical practice.

The subject or legal guardian must sign and date a consent form that has been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Ethic Committee (IEC) before any study -specific procedures are initiated. The subject or legal guardian will be given a copy of the signed and date d informed consent form. Informed Consent Forms for subjects who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. Additional details are provided in Section 10.1. 7.1.2 Collection of Biomarker Tumor Biopsy Samples All subject s in Phase 1b will have a biomarker tumor biopsy taken prior to Cycle 0 (lead -in cycle ) • Within 7 days prior if an archival sample is available for screening • If an archival sample is not available, a biopsy should be obtained within the 28 -days screening window. If the sample is adequate, it may be substituted for the initial (pre - treatment ) Cycle 0 biomarker biopsy. • No study related biopsy may be obtained from lung , bone, or brain (study exclusion CNS disease) • Biopsies should be obtained using the least invasive procedure feasible (no major surgical procedure are to be done for study purpos es) • If possible biopsies should not be performed in target lessions to allow for accurate ORR evaluations All subjects in Phase 2 (Cohorts 1, 2 and 3) will have a biomarker tumor biopsy taken within 14 days prior to Cycle 0 (lead -in cycle). If the subj ect has undergone a diagnostic tumor biopsy procedure within 56 days of enrolling in the study, and the biopsy has adequate material, this sample may be used in place of the first biomarker. For the Phase 2 expansion (cohort 4), a biopsy is optional . Subje cts will be required to sign a separate consent form and must confirm their decision to opt -in. For Phase 2, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, a second tumor biopsy will be obtained 14 days after Cycle 0 Day 1 of vofatamab. The second tumor biopsy should always occu r within 3 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 infusion and prior to the first dose of vofatamab plus pembrolizumab. For patients enrolled in Phase 2, Cohort 3 and Cohort 4 (optional) , the second tumor biopsy will occur at the end of cycle 1, Week 5, within 3 days before Cycle 2, Day 1 and prior to the administration of the second combination dose of vofatamab and pembrolizumab."
67,page_67,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 68 Biopsies will be used to evaluate how treatment with vofatamab affects the FGFR3 signaling pathway relative to FGFR3 expression, immunological status of the tumor, and to explore what markers are associated with and predictive of response to vofatamab . Sample analysis may include any or all of the following: molecular profiling (RNA analysis), sequencing of cancer related genes, IHC on cancer related proteins and markers of immune cell infiltration. Sample analyses will be performed by a laboratory selected by the Sponsor . 7.1.3 Archival /Diagnos tic Tissue Collection All subjects in thi s study must consent to submit archival tumor tissue that was obtained at the time or after the subject was found to have muscle invasive or metastatic disease . Availability of archival tumor tissue of suitable quality and quantity should be confirmed prior to study entry . If no suitable tissue is available, a blood sample may be used to determine FGFR3 genetic status . Subsequent to subject enrollment, blood samples used to determine FGFR3 status, or previous test results that were not provided by Foundatio n will be verified using archival tissue or the first biomarker tumor biopsy sample. If archival tumor tissue is not available, the subject may undergo a diagnostic tumor biopsy procedure within 56 days of enrolling in the study . For Phase 2, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, s ubjects will be assigned based on FGFR3 status of 1) WT or 2) Mut/Fus . Genetic sequencing of FGFR3, other cancer related genes, immune response related genes , and determination of mutation burden may also be performed by the Sponsor, a laboratory selected by the Sponsor or a participating institution. Detailed instructions will be provided in the Sample Collection & Processing Manual. 7.1.4 Subject Eligibility During the Screening visit, all subject s will be assessed for eligibility against th e inclusion and exclusion criteria described in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2. 7.1.5 Medical History and Demographics Complete medical history will be recorded at the S creening visit. 7.2 Safety Assessments 7.2.1 Adverse Events 7.2.1.1 Definitions 7.2.1.1.1 Adverse Event An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug -related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products."
68,page_68,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 69 All AEs resulting in discontinuation from the study should be followed until resolution or stabilization. Subjects who are discontinued from study drug will be followed for safety outcomes through the safety follow -up visit after the subject’s last dose of study drug or until the subject receives another anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. Suspected Adverse Reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. A life -threatening AE or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, in the view of either the inv estigator or Sponsor, places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 7.2.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Event An SAE or serious suspected adverse rea ction is an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at any dose, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes: • Death • A life -threatening AE • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • A congenital anomaly/birth defect Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalizat ion may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. All AEs that do not meet any of the crit eria for serious should be regarded as non -serious AEs. The definition of an SAE also includes any important medical event. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the previous definition. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse."
69,page_69,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 70 It is important to distinguish between serious and severe adverse events. Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea , which persists for several hours , may be considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE. On the other hand, a stroke which results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be considered an SAE. All deaths should be reported with the pr imary cause of death as the AE term, as death is typically the outcome of the event, not the event itself. 7.2.1.1.3 Adverse Event of Special Interest Bleeding and bleeding -related adverse events will be carefully followed . 7.2.1.2 Severity of Adverse Events Each AE and SAE should be graded as mild, moderate, severe, life -threatening, or death using the following definitions. The severity of all adverse events will be graded using the National Cancer Institute ( NCI) CTCAE v4.0 in Table 5."

The NCI CTCAE v4.0 can be found at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40. Note: Regardless of severity, some events may also meet regulatory serious criteria. Refer to definition of an SAE (see Section 7.2.1.1 ). a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or reported AE is not in the NCI CTCAE listing. b Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. c Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using th e toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms ""serious"" and ""severe,"" which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is provided. The term ""sever e"" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as ""serious"" which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 7.2.1.3 Relation ship of Adverse Events to Study Drug The investigator will assess the potential relationship of each AE and SAE to vofatamab and to pembrolizumab using the following descriptions. • Unrelated: This category applies to an AE or SAE that is clearly not related to the investigational agent/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent"
71,page_71,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 72 with the onset of the event and the exposure to study drug and/or a c ausal relationship is considered biologically implausible. • Possibly Related: This category applies to an AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug and that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspe cted study drug, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. • Related: This category applies to an AE that is certainly related to the investigational agent/procedure. That is, the AE has a temporal relationship to the administra tion of the investigational agent(s) or research intervention, which cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals; the response to withdrawal of drug is clinically plausible; and the event has been shown to be definitively pharmaco logically or phenomenologically related using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure. Note: The investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study documentation process. Regardless of the “Yes” or “No” causality assessment for individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all reported SAEs against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators and applicable regulatory authorities . 7.2.1.4 Eliciting Adverse Events A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all subject evaluation time points should be adopted. Examples of non -directive questions include: “How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” “Have y ou had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?” 7.2.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting Period After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g., SAEs related t o invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run -in). All medical occurrences from the time of signing the informed consent that meet this definition should be recorded. Events preceding first study drug administration, howev er, should be recorded as medical history, not as AEs. After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs regardless of attribution will be collected until 30 days following the last administration of study drug, 30 days after subject discontinuation, initia tion of another anti -tumor therapy, resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. After this period, investigators should report only SAEs that are felt to be related to prior study treatment (see Section 7.2.1.9 )."
72,page_72,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 73 7.2.1.6 Recording of Adverse Events Information on all AEs should be recorded immediately in the source document, and in th e appropriate adverse event module of the CRF. All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedure results should be recorded in the source document, grouped under one diagnosis. 7.2.1.6.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically cha racterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up information. For this study, the NCI CTCAE terms “cytokine release syndrome” should not be used. If multiple signs or symptoms occur with a given event, each sign or symptom should be recorded separately with its level of severity. 7.2.1.6.2 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events In general , AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE o r SAE on the CRF. However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Ad verse Event CRF. For example, if a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to ren al failure, both events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event CRF. 7.2.1.6.3 Preexisting Medical Conditions A pre existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical Hist ory and Baseline Conditions CRF. A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on an Adverse Event CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e .g., “more frequent headaches”). 7.2.1.6.4 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between subject evaluation time points. Such events should only be recorded once in the CRF unless their severity i ncreases. If a persistent AE becomes more severe, it should be recorded as a new entry on the Adverse Event CRF. If a previously reported SAE increases in severity, it should"
73,page_73,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 74 be reported on the previously submitted CRF as a follow -up or update and not as a new event. A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points and subsequently recurs. All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an Adverse Event CRF. 7.2.1.6.5 Abnormal Laboratory Values Only clinically significant laboratory abnor malities that require active management will be recorded as AEs or SAEs on the Adverse Event CRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic inv estigation, etc.). If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., ALP and bilirubin 5  the ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse E vent CRF. If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the Adverse Event CRF. If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clini cal term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the Adverse Event CRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or etiology changes. 7.2.1.6.6 Worsening of Urothelial Cell Carcinoma Progression of underlying malignancy should not be reported as an AE if it is clearly consistent with the suspected progression of the underlying cancer, as defined by respective disease criterion or other criteria as determined by protocol. Hospitalization due solely to the progression of underlying malig nancy should NOT be reported as an SAE. Clinical symptoms of progression may be reported as AEs, if the symptom cannot be determined as exclusively due to the progression of the underlying malignancy, or does not fit the expected pattern of progression for the disease under study. 7.2.1.6.7 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization, or Surgery Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as an SAE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol. There are some hospitalization scenarios that do not require reporting as an SAE when there is no occurrence of an AE. These scenarios include a planned hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization to: • Perform an efficacy measurement for the study"
74,page_74,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc.

All other on study deaths, regardless of attribution, will be recorded on an Adverse Event CRF and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor. 7.2.1.6.9 Pregnancy Conditions of pregnancy and lactation are excluded from study participation. During the study, females of childbearing potential must contact the treating Investigator immediately if they suspect that they may be pregnant (a missed or late menstrual period should be reported to the treating Investigator). If an investigator suspects that a subject may be pregnant after the subject started study drug, study drug must immediately be withheld until the result of the pregnancy test is confirmed. If a pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug(s) must be immediately and permanently stopped, the subject must be discontinued from the study, and the Investigator must notify the study Sponsor within 24 hours of confirmation. If a female subject becomes pregnant while rec eiving investigational therapy or within 120 days after the last dose of the study drug, a Pregnancy Report CRF should be completed. Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF. Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, should always be c lassified as serious (as the Sponsor considers these medically significant), recorded on an Adverse Event CRF, and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor. After the study period, such events should still be reported expeditiously to the Sponsor. Any congen ital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject or female partner of a male subject exposed to the investigational product should be classified as serious , recorded on an Adverse Event CRF , and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor during the study period. After the study period, such events should still be reported expeditiously to the Sponsor recorded and reported as an SAE. 7.2.1.7 Expedited Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and Serious Drug Reactions 7.2.1.7.1 Reporting Requirements for All SAEs Investigators will submit reports of all SAEs, regardless of attribution, and all protocol -defined non -serious expedited AEs to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the"

Adequate documentation must be obtained by Rainier showing that the IRB/IEC was properly and promptly notified as required. 7.2.1.7.3 Regulatory Agency Notification by the Sponsor The study sponsor or designee, shall notify all applicable regulatory agencies by telephone , by facsimile transmission , or registration in EudraVigilance database of any suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) associated with the use of the drug as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days from the Sponsor’s original receipt of the information. If a previous AE that was not initially deemed reportable is later found to fit the criteria for reporting, the study sponsor will submit the AE in a written report to the appropriate regulatory agencies as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days from the time the determination is made. 7.2.1.8 Type and Duration of Follow -Up after Adverse Events The investigator should follow all unresolved AEs and SAEs until the events are resolved to baseline grade, the event is assessed by the investigator as stable, new anti -cancer treatment is initiated, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause of the AE/S AE. Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the appropriate Adverse Event CRF and in the subject’s medical record to facilitate source data verification (SDV) during the study period."

The investigator should notify th e Sponsor of any death or other SAE occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation if felt to be related to prior study treatment. The Sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject who participated in this study.

Targeted physical examinations may be limited to systems of primary clinical relevance (i.e., cardiovascular, respiratory, those systems associated with symptoms, and any system that might be associated with tumor assessment). Changes from baseline for all targeted physical examinations should be recorded at each subsequent physical examination. New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs if appropriate. Height should be measured only at the Screening visit and weight should be measured at the Screening visit and on Day 1 of ea ch cycle. 7.2.3 Vital Signs Vital signs will include measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature. On Day 1 of Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 , vital signs for vofatamab should be assessed pre -infusion, every 15 (± 5) minutes during the infusion, at the end of the infusio n, and 30 (± 10) minutes, 60 (± 10) minutes, and 90 (± 10) minutes post -infusion. On Day 1 of Cycle s 2+, vital signs for vofatamab should be assessed pre -infusion , as clinical ly indicated during the infusion, and at the end of the vofatamab infusion .

The EORTC QLQ -C30 will be assessed from baseline for Cycles 0 (if applicable) through Cycle 2, then every 2 cycles , and 30 days after discontinuation. 7.4 Pharmacokinetic Assessments Blood samples will be obtained prior to the administration of vofatamab and within 30 (± 15) minutes after the completion of the administration of vofatamab on Day 1 of Cycle 0. Blood samples will be obtained prior to the administration of pembrolizumab and within 30 (± 15) minutes after the completion of the administration of vofatamab on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 4, and once at the End of Treatment/ ET visit. Serum samples will be analyzed for the quantitative determination of vofatamab . 7.5 Anti -therapeutic Antibody Assessme nts As may occur with any recombinant antibodies, either vofatamab or pembrolizumab may elicit an immune response and subjects may develop antibodies against either agent. Although ATAs directed against either agent are not expected to result in significan t clinical consequence, subjects will be monitored for any potential immune response to vofatamab in this clinical study. Blood samples for ATA assessment will be obtained prior to infusion of vofatamab on Day 1 of Cycles 0 (if applicable) , 1 and 4, and o nce at the End of Treatment/ ET visit. Serum samples will be analyzed for the determination of antibodies to vofatamab . 7.6 Biomarker Assessments Whole blood (PBMCs) , serum , and plasma samples for biomarker analyses will be obtained prior to infusion of vofatamab on Day 1 of Cycles 0, 1, 3, and 5, and once at the End of Treatment/ ET visit. Blood for circulating tumor DNA will be collected at the time of progression to assess FGFR3 status. The effects of vofatamab on the downstream signaling of the FGFR3 p athway , tumor sub - type and on the immune surveillance of UCC tumors will be monitored using a range of techniques that may include but are not limited to gene expression profiling (such as whole transcriptome RNAseq) , sequencing of TCRs, flow cytometry, EL ISA, and immunohistochemistry. Analyses will be performed on biopsy samples taken pre - and post-vofatamab treatment ( as described in Section 7.1.2 ), archival tissu e samples (described in Section 7.1.3 ), and whole blood , serum and plasma samples , as appropriate ."

The primary efficacy endpoint for Phase 2 of the study is ORR and will be compared against historical ORR of pembrolizumab (21.1%) ( Bellmunt J, et al., 2017 ). The total of 90 subjects in Cohort 1,2,3 and 4 will be the primary efficacy analysis set for Phase 2. Given the expected π=0.343 with Type I error (alpha) at 0.05 (one-sided), 90 subjec ts will give a power of approximately 87.5% to reject the null hypothesis of π≤0.211. With the expected π=0.343, the 95% CI half width is around 0.098 for the sample size of 90 subjec ts. The sample size calculation for Phase 2 was performed for a 3 -look group sequenti al design . The 𝛼-spending formula of Lan and DeMets O’Brian -Fleming stopping boundary was used . EAST v6.4.1 was used to derive the sample size and efficacy and futility boundary as well as the alph a allocation. Results are shown in Table 6.

July 01, 2019 Page 101 APPENDIX 2 RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS VERSION 1.1 (RECIST 1.1 ) Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009 ) are presented below, with slight modifications and the addition of explanatory text as needed for clarity. Measurability of Tumor at Baseline Definitions At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non -measurable as described below. a. Measurable Tumor Lesions Tumor Lesions . Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows: • 10 mm by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (CT/MRI scan sl ice thickness/interval no greater than 5 mm) • 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable) 20 mm by chest X -ray. Malignant Lymph Nodes . To be considered pat hologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. See also notes below on “Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions” for information on lymph node measurement. b. Non-Measurable Tumor Lesions Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph node s with short axis ≥ 10 but < 15 mm), as well as truly non -measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, and abdominal mass/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. c. Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treate d with local therapy require particular comment, as outlined below. Bone Lesions:"
101,page_101,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 102 • Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques for measuring bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. • Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic –blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable. Cystic Lesions: • Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same subject , these are preferred for selection as target lesions. Lesions with Prior Local Treatment: Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco - regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. Target Lesions: Specifications by Methods of Measurements a. Measurement of Lesions All measurements should be recorded in metric n otation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. b. Method of Assessment The same method of assessment a nd the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study. Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option. Clinical Lesions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥ 10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. Chest X -Ray. Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new"
102,page_102,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 103 lesions. However, lesions on a chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. CT, MRI. CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice th ickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thicknesses greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable. If prior to enrollment it is known that a subject is unable to undergo CT scans with intravenous (IV) contrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a non -contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the subject at baseline and during the study should be guided by the tumor t ype under investigation and the anatomic location of the disease. For subject s who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non -contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed shou ld also be based on the tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease and should be optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possible. Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other a pproaches is possible and, if not, the subject should be considered not evaluable from that point forward. Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions on a different modality and interpretation of non -target disease or new lesions since the same le sion may appear to have a different size using a new modality. Ultrasound. Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of measurement. Endoscopy, Laparoscopy, Tumor Markers, Cytology, Histology. The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation cannot generally be advised. Tumor Response Evaluation Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable lesion, as detailed above. Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions When more than o ne measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseli ne. This means that, for instances in which subject s have only one or two organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two sites), respectively, will be recorded. Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those organs will be recorded as non - measurable lesions (even if the size is > 10 mm by CT scan)."
103,page_103,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 104 Target lesions should be selected based on their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, but in addition, should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which circumstance, the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be selected. Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. As noted above, pathological nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterio n of a short axis of ≥ 15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT, this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an a bdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm × 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 mm bu t < 15 mm) should be considered non -target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis of < 10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed. A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to fur ther characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Me asurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present,” “absent,” or in rare cases “unequivocal progression.” In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the Case Rep ort Form ( CRF ) (e.g., “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastase s”). Response Criteria a. Evaluation of Target Lesions This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response for target lesions. • Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm."
104,page_104,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 105 • Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters • Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline In addition to the relative in crease of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study b. Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions Lymph Nodes . Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomic al plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to < 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of lesions may not be zero even if CR criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as h aving a short axis of < 10 mm. Target Lesions that Become Too Small to Measure. During the study, all lesions (nodal and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g ., 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure. When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows: • If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. • If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned and below measurable limit (BML) should be ticked. (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are f requently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well and BML should also be tick ed.) To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm, and in that case, BML should not be ticked. Lesions that Split or Coalesce on Treatment. When non -nodal lesions fragmen t, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that"
105,page_105,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 106 would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each indivi dual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximum longest diameter for the coalesced lesion. c. Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the group of non -target lesions. While some non -target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only qualit atively at the time point s specified in the protocol. • CR: disappearance of all non -target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker level All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). • Non-CR/Non -PD: persistence of o ne or more non -target lesions and/or (if applicable) maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits • PD: unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions . The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. d. Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non -Target Disease When the Subject Also Has Measurable Disease. In this setting, to achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsen ing in non -target disease in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest increase in the size of one or more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely based on change in non -target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. When the Subject Has Only N on-Measurable Disease. This circumstance arises in some Phase III studies when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above; however, in this instance, there is no measurable disease a ssessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non - measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: if all lesions are truly non -measurable), a useful test that can be applied whe n assessing subject s for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non -measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease, that is, an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in volume (which is equivalent to a 20% increase in diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to “large” or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread or may be described in protocols as “sufficient to require a change in therapy.” If unequivocal progression is seen, the subject should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have objective criteria apply to"
106,page_106,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 107 non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore, the increase must be substantial. e. New Lesions The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; th erefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in sca nning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some “new” bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting lesions). This is particularly important when the subject ’s baselin e lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at basel ine is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. Evaluation of Response a. Time Point Response (Overall Response) It is assumed that at each protocol -specified time point , a response assessment occurs. Table 6 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for subject s who have measurable disease at baseline. When subject s have non -measurable (therefore non -target) disease only, Table 7 is to be used. Table 6 Time Point Response: Subject s with Target Disease (With or Without Non-Target Le sions) Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response CR CR No CR CR Non-CR/non -PD No PR CR Not evaluated No PR PR Non-PD or not all evaluated No PR SD Non-PD or not all evaluated No SD Not all evaluated Non-PD No NE PD Any Yes or no PD Any PD Yes or no PD Any Any Yes PD CR = complete response; NE = not evaluable; PD = progressive disease; PR = partial response; SD = stable disease."
107,page_107,"Protocol Number: B -701-U22 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 5 Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. July 01, 2019 Page 108 Table 7 Time Point Response: Subject s with Non -Target Disease Only Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response CR No CR Non-CR/non -PD No Non-CR/non -PD a Not all evaluated No NE Unequivocal PD Yes or no PD Any Yes PD CR = complete response; NE = not evaluable; PD = progressive disease. a “Non -CR/non -PD” is preferred over “stable disease” for non -target disease since stable disease is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some studies ; thus, assigning “stable disease” when no lesions can be measured is not advised. b. Missing Assessments and Not -Evaluable Designation When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point , the subject is not evaluable at that time point . If only a subset of lesion measurements is made at an assessment, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that time point unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD. F or example, if a subject had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three measured lesions, and during the study, only two lesions were assessed but those gave a sum of 80 mm, the subject will have achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing le sion. If one or more target lesions were not assessed either because the scan was not done or the scan could not be assessed because of poor image quality or obstructed view, the response for target lesions should be “unable to assess” since the subject is not e valuable. Similarly, if one or more non -target lesions are not assessed, the response for non -target lesions should be “unable to assess” except where there is clear progression. Overall response would be “unable to assess,” if either the target response o r the non -target response is “unable to assess” except where this is clear evidence of progression, as this equates with the case being not evaluable at that time point . c. Best Overall Response: All Time Points The best overall response is determined once al l the data for the subject is known. Best response determination in studies where confirmation of complete or partial response IS NOT required: Best response in these trials is defined as the best response across all time points (for example, a subject who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best overall response of PR). When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet the protocol specified minimum time from baseline. If the minimum time is not met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient’s best response depends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a subject who has SD at first assessment, PD at second and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD. The same subject lost to follow -up after the first SD assessment would be considered unevaluable at a subsequent time point as specified in the protocol (generally"

In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as in Table 8. Table 8 Best Overall Response when Confirmation of CR and PR R equired Overall Response First Time Point Overall Response Subsequent Time Point Best Overall Response CR CR CR CR PR SD, PD or PRa CR SD SD provided minimum criteria for SD duration met, otherwise, PD CR PD SD provided minimum criteria for SD duration met, otherwise, PD CR NE SD provided minimum criteria for SD duration met, otherwise NE PR CR PR PR PR PR PR SD SD PR PD SD provided minimum criteria for SD duration met, otherwise, PD PR NE SD provided minimum criteria for SD duration met, otherwise NE NE NE NE CR = complete response; NE = not evaluable; PD = progressive disease; PR = partial response; SD = stable disease. a If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR . d. Special Notes of Response Assessment When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to “normal” size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that subject s with CR m ay not have a total sum of “zero” on the CRF . Subject s with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document objective progre ssion even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy. The objective response status of such subject s is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target disease."

July 01, 2019 Page 110 For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progre ssion is confirmed, the date of progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected. In studies for which subject s with advanced disease are eligible (i.e., primary disease still or partially present), the primary tumor should also be cap tured as a target or non -target lesion, as appropriate. This is to avoid an incorrect assessment of CR if the primary tumor is still present but not evaluated as a target or non -target lesion."

The following are the procedures to follow in the event of a suspected anaphylactic reaction during study drug infusion: 1. Stop the study drug infusion. 2. Apply a tourniquet proximal to the in jection site to slow systemic absorption of study drug. Do not obstruct arterial flow in the limb. 3. Maintain an adequate airway. 4. Administer antihistamines, epinephrine, or other medications, as required by subject status and directed by the physician in cha rge. 5. Continue to observe the subject and document observations."
