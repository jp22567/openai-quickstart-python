IBS is characterised by abdominal pain or discomfort in association with alteration in eith er stool form or frequency. IBS patients can be classified as either diarrhoea predominant (IBS-D ), constipation predominant (IBS-C), or with a mixed bowel pattern (IBS- M). Furthermore, IBS is associated with several comorbidities, including somatic pain syndromes (fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue , and chronic pelvic pain), gastrointestinal disorders (gastr oesophageal reflux and dyspepsia) and psychiatric disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety, a nd somatisation) ( Chey, Kurlander, and Eswaran 2015 ). Therefore, IBS- related symptoms can be debilitating and lead to a significant reduction in quality of life. While the complete pathophysiology of IBS has not been fully elucidated, a disruption of the function of the brain-gut axis a nd an altered intestinal microbiot a and/or host immune response are thought to be important factors. The risk of developing IBS increases six-fold after acute gastrointestinal infection. Furthermore, antibiotic s are known to affect the homeostasis of the gut microbiome and its usage appears to increase the risk of developing IBS. Several recent studies using high throughput sequencing me thods have independently show n that the microbiota of IBS patients is distinct from that of healthy controls and is characterised by di fferentially abundant taxa and lower global diversity ( Jeffery et al. 2012 ; Tap et al. 2017 ). Studies have demonstrated that treatment with live bacteria may have beneficial effects on IBS symptoms by restoring homeostasis in the gut mic robiota, normalisation of cytokine blood levels, normalising intestinal transit time, decreasing small intestine permeability, and eliminating small intestinal overgrowth of fermenting bacteria. This emerging field of rese arch demonstrates the feasibility of therapeutic manipulation of the microbiome using live bacteria to improve symptoms of IBS. (Shanahan F and Quigley EMM. 2014). 2.2.Scientific Ra tionale Test Blautix™ is a live biotherapeutic product (L BP) under development by 4D Pharma for the treatment of Irritable Bo wel Syndrome. The active ingredient of Blautix™ is a strain of the bacterium Blautia hydrogenotrophica (B. hydrogenotrophica ) (BHT), which is for oral administration. B. hydrogenotrophica is a Gram-positive anaerobic, non-sporulating cocco bacillus bacterium that is a sub-dominant commensal in the human gastrointestinal tract. CCI"

Blautix™ has also been shown to exert a positive impact on the microbiota in both pre-clinical models and the phase I clinical study. 2.3.3 Risk-Benefit Assessment In this study, there may be some potential bene fit of an 8-week treatment of Blautix™ >1x10 10 MPN given twice daily to IBS patients in the alleviation of IBS-related symptoms and associated quality of life. The risk benefit assessment is considered appr opriate to continue c linical development and initialise the Phase 2 study in the population described. CCI"

An 8-week treatment period of Blautix™ or placebo is considered sufficient to assess any changes in the subject assessment of IBS symptoms and the analysis of pharmacodynamic changes on the microbiota. Subject assessment of symptoms by use of rating scales/scores and a quality of life questionnaire are considered appropriate. Studies of microbiota composition in IBS have indicated that those patients with a normal microbiota displayed higher scores for anxiety and depression, whereas IBS patients with an abnormal microbiota had on average normal scores for anxiety and depression (ref). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression score (HADS) will be used to determine levels of anxiety and depression during the study. Use of periodic dietary recall by means of the Fo od Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) may be used to determine if dietary habits in fluence exploratory study outcomes. 4.1.2 Rationale for the Dosage Blautia hydrogenotrophica is a commensal bacterium that is naturally present in the human body. The bacterium was isolated and purified from huma n faeces and pre-clini cal toxicology did not detect any clinical, morphological or laboratory deviations of clinical relevance. As Blautia hydrogenotrophica is a bacterium that naturally occurs in man, it is expected that it does not have any genotoxic, carcinogen, or mutagenic potential. The dose of B. hydrogentotrophica administered in the study will be two capsules twice a day. Each capsule will contain a minimum of 5 x 10 9 MPN. Hence the daily dose will be 1010 to 1011 MPN. There is no established methodology for calculating human equivalent dose for live biotherapeutic products. In order to calculate the equivalent human dose, body surface area calculations were used. It is known that the ratio of intestinal surfa ce area (possibly the most relevant aspect for live biotherapeutic dosing) to total body surface area in rodents is similar to man (Casteleyn et al. 2010). In order to calculate body surface area, MPN/kg was first calculated, then multiplied by published factors ( Nair and Jacob, 2016 ) to convert to MPN/m2. CCICCI"

Subjects will be approached to determine if they are interested and willing to participate. The investigative sites will provide interested subjects with a ‘Research Study Information and Informed Consent Form’ and they will be booked in for the initial screening visit when consent will be obtained, and the Subjects will be asked to sign the Consent Form Screening Visit (Up to 4 weeks before dosing starts Day -28 to Day -1) Following completion of the study consent form, s ubjects will be screened against the protocol requirements, and a medical history and concomitant medications will be documented, a full physical examination will be performed, and bloods will be drawn for haematology, serum biochemistry and viral serology. Vital signs (pulse, blood pre ssure, respiratory rate and body temperature) will be assessed and recorded, a nd a 12 lead ECG will be taken. Women of child bearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test. Height and weight will be measured, and if subjects fulfil all the eligibility criteria at this part of the Screening process they will be provided with a Smartphone containing an ‘Electronic C linical Outcomes Assessment’ (eCOA) App and will be provided with training and instructions on how to use the device. At this Visit they will complete the IBS-Symptom Severity Score (SSS) on a tablet device during the clinic visit. The subject will be asked to take the smart phone home and complete the following assessments daily over a 7-day period. These assessments will need to be completed prior to attending the clinic for their Baseline Visit 1 x An abdominal pain intensity rating scale daily x Bowel movements, Stool consistency/frequency daily and laxative use x If no bowel movements, this should be recorded as zero The subject will need to ensure they complete these two assessments at least one day prior to the day next clinic visit. As soon as the subjects ha ve completed their assessments and click submit on the smartphone, their data will be sent to the hub for review by the investigator and study team. The same smartphone will be used throughout the study for all patient reported outcome assessments. CCI"

They will be asked to provide a stool sample from the night before or on the morning of the next clinic visit. If necessary, a stool sample may be provided up to 2 days after the visit provided it is from the night before or from the day it is delivered to the clinic . The next clinic visit will be booked with the Subjects prior to leaving the clinic. Reasons for screen failure will be documented in the subject’s notes. Subjects may be re- screened once, after the initial screening visit if considered to be appropriate by the Investigator. A waiting period of at least 2 weeks is required between screening visits. Baseline: Visit 1 (Day 1) Subjects will return to the clinical unit on Day 1 (Visit 1; within 28 days of screening visit or re - screening visit if appli cable). The study doctor will review the subject screening data obtained from the smartphone eCOA app and the subject will be classified into either IBS- C or IBS -D subtypes. A brief physical examination, assessment of vital signs and a urine pregnancy tes t for female subjects of child bearing potential, weight and BMI will be conducted and any changes in medication and adverse events will be checked. Blood samples will be taken for measurement of inflammatory markers (cytokine levels). A fresh urine sampl e will be taken to analyse the metabolites. Final confirmation of eligibility for the study will be documented, signed by the Investigator and filed in the subject notes. Classification into IBS subtype will be confirmed, and randomisation will take place. Subjects will receive either Blautix™ or placebo capsules, with instructions for two (2) capsules to be taken at approximately 12 hourly intervals; morning and evening, approximately 30 minutes before meals, giving a total of four (4) capsules per day. Subjects will receive instructions about storing the capsule packs in the fridge and be asked not to open the capsules.

Randomisation data will be kept strictly confidential, filed securely by the Sponsor (or designee) and accessible only to authorised persons of the Sponsor (or designee), and accessible only to authorised per Sponsor (or designee)’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) until the time of unbinding. 5.3.2 Blinding Procedures The blinding will be maintained using placebo capsules comparable in appearance to the Blautix™ capsules . 5.3.3 Subject Numbering The investigators must maintain a screening log of all screened subjects and those randomised into the study. Each subject will be given a unique identification subject number, to facilitate anonymous identification within the study. Once assigned to a subject, a subject number will not be re-used. 5.3.4 Emergency Unblinding Procedures The IV/WRS will be used for emergency unblinding of the treatment codes. The treatment codes should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the management of the subject requires knowledge of the treatment randomisation. The investigator must sign and date the code break form supplied and document the reason for breaking the code. The Sponsor Medical Monitor should be informed as soon as possible and within 24 hours of the event. In addition, each subject will be given a card and asked to carry it with them at all times in case of an emer gency. The card will include the study number, subject number, Investigational product and the name and 24-hour telephone number of the investigative site. Subjects should be asked to return this card at the end of the study. The Sponsor’s pharmacovigi lance provider may break the code for serious adverse events that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to the investigational product and potentially require expedited reporting to the regulatory authorities. 5.4 Subject withdrawal 5.4.1 Reasons for Withdrawal Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to future medical care by the investigator or at the institution. Reasons for removal from the Protocol-required investigational product(s ) or procedural assessments might include: • Withdrawal of informed consent • Pregnancy • Investigator’s opinion that it is in the best interests of the subject"

Subjects on inhaled steroids for asthma may be included but oral or infused steroids for asthma are not permitted. If these medications are required during the study, the subject does not need to be withdrawn but details will be recorded in the concomitant medication case report forms. 7 STUDY ASSESMENTS 7.1 Clinical Assessments Medical History A medical history including prior and current medication will be obtained during screening. In addition, demographic data will be collected, including gender, race, and ethnic origin. Physical Examination A full physical examination will be performed by the Investigator at screening and at study visits as indicated in Table 1. Body weight in kilograms (kg) and height in metres (m) will be measured and the BMI will be calculated. Vital Signs Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature will be taken as indicated in Table 1. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured in the supine position using an automated blood pressure monitor. ECG A 12 -lead ECG will be taken as indic ated in Table 1. Subjects will be in a supine position prior to recording an ECG. The ECG traces will be reviewed and commented on by the Investigator and the traces signed and dated. Subject Assessments: Refer to Table 1: Schedule of Assessments and Procedures. The assessments will be completed by the subject either at home using the smartphone provided or during the clinic visit. Abdominal Pain Score Subjects will be asked to rate their worst abdominal pain over the past 24 hours using an 11-point Num eric Rating Scale ( NRS ) and a weekly average will be recorded. This data will be recorded daily for a 7-day period up to Baseline (Visit 1) to allow Subject to be classified into Cohorts of IBS-C or IBS -D sub -types. Once subjects are randomised they will be asked to record their score daily on their smartphone. Subjects will respond to the following question: ‘How much abdominal pain have you felt today’ on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (worst possible pain)” using an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (worst possible pain)?"

Compared to the way you usually felt before entering the study, how would you rate your relief of symptoms during the past week?. Using a 5- point Likert scale with the following response options: Completely relieved; considerably rel ieved; somewhat relieved; unchanged; worse Subjects will be asked to record their assessment weekly on their smartphone. IBS Quality of Life (QOL) (Appendix 1) Subjects will be asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire consisting of 34 questions w ith a five-point response. The individual responses to the 34 items are summed and averaged for a total score and then transformed to a 0 -100 scale for ease of interpretation with higher scores indicating better IBS specific quality of life. Once subjects are randomised they will be asked to record their score on their smartphone at each clinic visit or within 24hrs prior to the Clinic Visit. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) (Appendix 2) Subjects will be asked to complete HADS which is a 14- item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and 7 relate to depression. Each item is scored from 0-3 so a subject can score 0 to 21 for either anxiety or depression. Once subjects are randomised they will be asked to complete this questionnaire on their smartphone at each clinic visit or within 24hrs prior to the Clinic Visit. Bristol Stool Chart Subjects will be asked to record stool frequency and consistency. Stool types will be based on the Bristol Stool Chart (Appendix 3). This data will be recorded daily for a 7-day period up to Baseline (Visit 1) to allow Subject to be classified into Cohorts of IBS sub -types. Once subjects are randomised they will be asked to record their stool frequency daily up to 10 bowel movements per day and score each stool type on their smartphone. No bowel movements in any given day will also be recorded. Stool frequency will be defined as a sum of weekly CSBMs. Stool frequency will be recorded using the following question: ""How many times did you open your bowels during the past 24 hours? If you have not had any bowel movements today, please enter 0."" Subjects will be reminded to rate all of their bowel movements in the Bristol Stool Chart before answering the question. CSBM s will be determined by absence of laxative use recorded in concomitant medication questions for the same 24 hour period. IBS Symptom Severity Score (SSS) (Appendix 4) Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire on severity of abdominal distension, severity of abdominal pain, frequency of abdominal pain, dissatisfaction with bowel habits, and interference of IBS symptoms with daily life. A score ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 500 (maximum severity) can be achieved as mild ( 74-174), moderate ( 175-299) or severe (>300) IBS symptoms."

This data will be used to classify into Cohorts of IBS sub-types prior to randomisation. Once subjects are randomised, they will be asked to record their responses to the questionnaire on a tablet device during each clinic visit. Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) (Appendix 5) Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire to obtain frequency information about food and beverage consumption over a specified period of time (day, week and month). FFQ completion at baseline will b e in relation to food (s) consumed over the prior 6 months. At each subsequent visit the FFQ shall capture responses to food (s) consumed since last subject visit. Subjects will be asked to complete this questionnaire on a tablet device during each Clinic Visit.  Concomitant Medications: Subjects will be asked to record name, dose and time of administration of any medication, other than IMP, taken during the study. This will be reviewed at each visit. Dosing Diary: Subjects will be asked to confirm their daily study medication intake by indicating ""yes"" or ""no"" to the following questions on the smartphone provided: ""Did you take two of your study medication capsules this morning? "" in the morning and ""Did you take two of your study medication capsules this e vening?"" in the evening. Subjects will be prompted with reminders via this device. Diet and S tudy R estrictions Dosing should be twice daily at twelve hourly intervals (approximately 30 minutes before breakfast and 30 minutes before evening meal). Subjects with lactose intolerance and Coeliac disease and those with a change of diet within the 3 months before screening are excluded. Subject s taking commercially available supplements (probiotics formulated as capsules or sachets as in Appendix 7) are excluded 1 month (30 days) prior to randomisation and throughout the study to follow-up. Probiotic yogurts, yogurt-type drinks and soft drinks e.g. fruit juices are acceptable if taken during the month before screening and continued to follow-up. 7.2 Laborator y Assessments A Laboratory Manual will be prepared to document the address and contact numbers for all laboratories involved in the study and the collection, processing, shipment, storage and reporting procedures for all samples. 7.2.1 Safety A ssessments: Refer to Table 1: Schedule of Assessments and Procedures for sample collection timepoints.

Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy. The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by non-direct questioning of the subject at baseline (pre- dose) Adverse events will be checked at ever y clinic visit. Adverse events may be detected when they are volunteered by the subject or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments. All adverse events must be recorded in the CRF with the following information: 1. Diagnosis: diagnosis if known, otherwise sign or symptom; 2. Seriousness: whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) and therefore requires reporting immediately (see Section 8.3) 3. Criteria for Adverse Events: Mild : Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnos tic observations only; intervention not indicated Moderate : Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting age - appropriate instrumental ADL (Activities of Daily Living) Severe: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated; limiting self -care ADL (Activities of Daily Living) 4. Relatedness: relationship to the study medication will be assessed as reasonable possibility of being related or no reasonable possibility of being related; 5. Duration: start and end dates or, if continuing, at final examination; 6. Action: any action taken to manage it (none, dosing interrupted, dosing stopped, other, medication);"
40,page_40,"Blautix™, Blautia hydrogenotrophica (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) Clinical Study Protocol No: BHT -II-002 Date and Version: 31-Mar -20 Version 3.1 Page 41 of 137 7. Outcome: the outcome (completely recovered, recovered with sequelae, condition improving, condition still present and unchanged, condition deteriorated, death). 8.2.2 Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is defined as an event which: • results in death • is life -threatening • requires hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation • results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • consists of a congenital anomaly or birth defect • is a medically important event All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the following: no action taken (i.e., further observation only); study medication discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication given; non-drug therapy given. The action taken to treat the adverse event or resolve the adverse incident should be recorded on the CRF. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution. The suspected relationship to the study medication, the interventions required to treat it and the outcome must be recorded in the CRF. 8.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Form must be completed for every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after protocol-specified procedures begin after signing the consent form until 4 weeks after the End of Treatment Visit and must be reported within 24 hours of the investigative site becoming aware of the event and ideally within 24 hours of its occurrence. The Safety and Medical Managem ent Plan will provide full details. Any SAEs experienced after this 4 -week period should only be reported to if the Investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study medication. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow-up to the original episode, regardless of when the event occurs. This report must be submitted within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information. An SAE that is considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event. If recurrence after resolution of the previous episode occurs if will be reported as a new SAE. SAEs should be followed to resolution. Follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation. If the SAE is not previously documented in the investigator’s brochure and is thought to be related to the investigational stud y medication, then this is defined as a serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction (SUSAR). It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to determine whether a reported SAE fits the classification of a SUSAR and to inform the Investigator of their decision as soon as"
41,page_41,"Blautix™, Blautia hydrogenotrophica (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) Clinical Study Protocol No: BHT -II-002 Date and Version: 31-Mar -20 Version 3.1 Page 42 of 137 possible. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to determine whether an event requires expedited reporting and to notify the Investigators of their decision as soon as possible. 4D Pharma, or its designee, reports SAE’s and/or SUSARS as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good clinical practice. The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of SAEs occurring at the site and other AE reports received from 4D Pharma or it’s designee, in accordance with local procedures and statutes. 8.3.1 Pregnancies There is no reason to believe that Blautix™ would be harmful to a mother or baby during pregnancy. If a patient becomes pregn ant during the study the investigator is to stop dosing with study medication immediately. A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or SAE; however, it must be reported to the sponsor using the Pregnancy report forms within the same timelines as an SAE. This applies to female patients as well as female partners of male patients. A pregnancy should be followed through to outcome, wherever possible. Subjects who are women and who may be able to have children will be given a serum pregnancy test at screenin g and a urine dipstick test at all subsequent study visits. If the result is positive at screening, the subject will not be able to enter the study. Sexually- active women of child bearing potential must use an acceptable form of birth control throughout the study until completion of two (2) periods after the last dose to avoid pregnancy for at least one complete menstrual cycle. The following methods of birth control are considered acceptable for this study; true abstinence, sterilis ation, birth control pills, vasectomised partner, injections or contraceptive implants. The following birth control pills are recommended: • Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: o Oral o Intravaginal o Transdermal • Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: o Oral o Injectable o Implantable Female Subjects must not breast feed an infant during the study. Male subjects, able to father children, and sexually active with a female partner who is able to bear children, must use a barrier method of birth control (male condom with or without spermicide) from the time of randomisation until the Follow -up visit. Th e study doctor will discuss methods of"

If a subject becomes pregnant or think they may be pregnant during the study, they will be told to stop using the study medication and contact the study doctor’s office immediately . They will be asked to withdraw from the study. For Male Subjects with a partner who becomes pregnant or thinks she may be pregnant during the study, the subjects will be asked to contact the study doctor’s office immediately. Refer to the Safety M anagement and Medical Monitoring Plan for further details. 8.4 Clinical Management of E vents If a subject chooses to withdraw or is withdrawn, the Investigator must ensure the safety and well- being of the subject prior to final discharge from the study. All adverse events will be evaluated, treated and followed up. Repeated and unscheduled examinations and laboratory assessments should be conducted as needed until appropriate and satisfactory resolution of any abnormalities. Every effort should be made for all randomised subjects to undergo final follow-up. In the event that a subject fails to return for the study visits and follow-up assessments, every effort should be made to determine the reason(s). Any pregnancy will be followed up by the investigator to determine outcome for the mother and baby. 9 DATA REVIEW, DATABASE MANAGEMENT AND STUDY DOCUMENTATION 9.1 Site Monitoring On behalf of 4D Pharma Plc contract research organisation (CRO) representative will manage the monitoring aspects of this study. Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit, a sponsor representative will review the protocol and CRFs with the investigator(s) and their staff. During the study, a sponsor representative (monitor) will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of entries on the CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrolment, and to ensure that study medication is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist during these visits. In addition, 4D Pharma Plc staff may also attend site initiation, monitoring and close out visits with CRO personnel. The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study and must provide the monitor access to all relevant source documents for confirmation of their consistency with the CRF entries. Monitoring will require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusio n criteria, documentation of serious adverse events, and the recording of data that will be used for all primary and safety variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs may be performed according to the study- specific m onitoring plan. 9.2 Source Documents Source documents are original documents, data (e COA Smartphone data) and records and may include medical records, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, pharmacy records, subjects’ diaries and the results of any other tests or assessments. Information on CRFs must be traceable to these"

Data not requiring a source document record will be defined before study start and will be recorded directly on the CRFs. The Investigator and clini cal site will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, EC review, and regulatory inspections as requested, and must give direct access to source data/documents, CRFs and the Investigator site file. Clinical Investigators and authorized study personnel will review and access the electronic eCOA data; collected on smartphones and tablets, according to patient activity on site (following screening and scheduled clinic visits as indicated in the Protocol, e.g. Screening Visit, B aseline Visit 1 , Visit 2, End of Treatment and Follow- Up. Discrepancies will be resolved using data queries and site response , with the oversight of the monitor. 9.3 Data Collection Data collected from the study must be recorded in case report forms by delegated personnel at the Investigator sites. Diary data will be collected using an app -based electronic Clinical Outcome Assessments (eCOA) solution for smartphone. Patients will receive daily reminders through the app to go and complete their diaries. As soon as they have completed their diary and click submit, their data will be sent to the hub. Patients will use the same devices to complete their other patient-reported outcome questionnaires when they come into sites. Only personnel delegated the duty from the site’s PI, with documentation on the signature delegation log, will collect and enter data. CRFs will be reviewed for completeness and accuracy by the monitor and site personnel may be asked to make any required corrections or additions, as applicable. The nature and location of source documents for the study will be documented in a specific document. Externally collected laboratory data will be received and processed to present a complete dataset. 9.4 Database Management and Quality Control The database includes password protection and encryption and the data management process includes quality checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Data will be reviewed, and queries will be raised by data management in accordance with the study Data Management Plan. Errors or omissions will be detailed as Data Queries by Data Management and sent to the Investigational site for resolution. Quality control of all data in the database will be made prior to locking the database and the data set will then be transferred to the statistical programming team for creation of Tables, F igures, and Listing for review in accordance with the Statistical Analysis Plan. Access to the eCOA data will be controlled via the vendor Support Helpdesk. Users must have successfully completed the vendor training module , with a pass rate of >80%. Full log of query and resolution steps will be maintained within the system, with full audit trail Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Current medical conditions and adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology."

As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly. Exemptions or eligibility criteria waivers for enrolment are not permissible. Any subject enrolled who does not meet eligibility criteria will be considered an enrolment deviation and must be reported as such. All protocol deviations, as defined above, must be addressed in study subject source documents. 9.6 Study Records Retention The study site will maintain a study file, which should contain, at minimum, the Investigator’s brochure, the Protocol and any Amendments, drug accountability records, correspondence with the IEC/IRB, 4D Pharma plc and assigned CRO and other study related documents. The investigator agrees to keep records and those documents that include (but are not limited to) the identification of all participating patients, medical records, study specific source documents, source worksheets, all original signed and dated ICFs, copies of all eCRFs, query responses and detailed records of drug disposition to enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities and 4D Pharma or its designees. Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 25 years after the end of the clinical study. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations. Medical files of subjects should be archived in accordance with national requirements. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the Sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained The Investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining an Investigator site file containing all study related Essential documents as defined by ICH GCP Section 8. This must be available at any time during the study for review by the sponsor monitor and for inspection by the regulatory authority. 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1 Populations for Analysis The Safety Analysis Set includes all subjects randomised into the study who received at least one dose of Blautix™ or Placebo. Subjects will be allocated to the treatment group corresponding to the treatment actually received. The Safety Analysis Set is the primary analysis set for the safety analyses. The Full Anal ysis Set includes all members of the Safety Analysis Set who were appropriately randomised into the Study. Subjects will be allocated to the treatment group corresponding to the treatment actually received. The Full Analysis Set is the primary analysis set for the efficacy analyses. The Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set includes all members of the Full Analysis Set who completed the 8 -week treatment and assessment period without major protocol violations. Subjects will be allocated to the treatmen t group corresponding to the treatment actually received."

The total planned study size is therefore 500 subjects. 10.3 Interim Analysis An informal interim analysis will be conducted once all recruited patients have completed the primary efficacy analysis 8 -week treatment period. This interim analysis is planned to enable 4D pharma to expedite the clinical development strategy based on the outcome of the interim analysis. Planning for pivotal trials and the EU Paediatric Investigation Plan and the US Paediatric Study Plan can be initiated in preparation for Agency meetings and further clinical development. There will be no other consequences of the interim analysis, there is no need to adjust the value of alpha. 10.4 Statistical Analysis P lan A detailed and comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) describing the planned final analysis in detail with tables, figures and listings templates will be developed and finalised before the study is unblinded. Minor changes to the analyses specified in this section need not trigger a protocol amendment but must documented in the Clinical Study Report. 10.5 Statistical Analysis All baseline, compliance, disposition, efficacy and safety variables will be listed and summarised. The standard summary statistics for continuous baseline and outcome variables are: N, mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, minimum and maximum. The standard summary statistics for categorical baseline and outcome variables are: count and proportion (expressed as percentage). There are 2 cohorts in the study: Cohort C: 250 subjects diagnosed with IBS- C Cohort D: 250 subjects diagnosed with IBS-D The two Cohorts will be analysed separately except there may be exploratory pooled or combined analyses. 10.5.1 Primary E fficacy Analysis The primary efficacy analysis is the c omparison of the proportion of overall responders between the Blautix™ and placebo groups using Pearson's test with Yates's correction in the full analysis set within each Cohort. All other analyses of the primary endpoint are secondary analyses."

The Investigator should notify the IRB/EC of serious breaches, urgent safety measures or SUSARs occurring at the site, in accordance with local procedures. The Investigator will be responsible for submission of periodic progress reports at intervals not to exceed 1 year, or as otherwise specified by the IRB/EC. The Investigator will notify the IRB/EC within 90 days of the end of the study or within 15 days of early termination. A reason for early termination will be provided. 12.2 Regulatory The Sponsor will obtain approval of the appropriate regulatory body prior to study initiation. The Sponsor will also ensure that the implementation of substantial amendments to the protocol occurs only after approval of the relevant regulatory body. The Sponsor should notify the regulatory body of serious breaches, urgent safety measures or SUSARs occurring at the site. The Sponsor will notify the regulatory body within 90 days of the end of the study or within 15 days of early termination. A reason for early termination will be provided. 12.3 Serious B reaches A serious breach of GCP is defined as a breach which is likely to effect, to a significant degree, the safety or mental integrity of the subjects or the scientific value of the study. Serious breaches must be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor. The Sponsor must notify the MHRA of any serious breach within 7 days of becoming aware of the breach. The Investigator should report a serious breach to the IRB/EC. 12.4 Informed Consent Informed consent must be obtained in writing for all subjects before any study specific procedure is performed. Subjects may be approached to discuss the study to determine if they are interested in participating in the study. Information sheets will be provided, and consent taken when they return for the initial study assessment. The information sheet will clearly explain what the study will involve and subjects must have adequate opportunity to ask questions. The physician or designee who conducts the informed consent discussion must also sign and date the consent form. A copy of the signed consent document must be given to the subject. The original signed consent document will be retained by the Investigator. The information sheet and consent forms must contain the minimum elements required by ICH GCP and must be submitted for favourable opinion from the IRB/EC. If an amendment to the protocol changes the subject participation schedule in scope or activity, or if important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent, the ICF must be revised with a new version number and submitted to the IRB/EC for review and favourable opinion. The revised ICF must be used to obtain consent from a subject currently enrolled in the study if he or she is affected by the amendment. The revised ICF must be used to obtain consent from any new subjects who are enrolled into the study after the date of the favourable opinion of the protocol amendment."

Collected samples will be transferred for analysis to the Sponsor, or to other laboratories working for the Sponsor. Biological samples will be stored for the time established by regulatory requ irements or destroyed after the final clinical study report has been finalized if storage is not required. There might be a new request for these samples to be used for purposes related to the QA of the laboratory tests described in this protocol, in which case they will be used for this purpose. This may include the assessment of the quality of current tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test methods for the markers described in this protocol, as well as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods and work reliably. If study results suggest that further investigations using stored biological samples are warranted, these tests might be carried out on an exploratory basis. In addition, biological samples may be used by the Sponsor or their research partners for further research that is not related to the disease or the product under study. This testing will be done on pseudonymized samples (meaning that subjects will not be identifiable from their biological samples as their identity will have been removed and they will be assigned a unique clinical study identification number). Subjects will be asked to sign an additional, separate consent form for this optional testing and refusal of consent will not affect their possibility of participating in the study. During the conduct of the study, an individual subject can choose to withdraw consent to have biological specimens stored for future research . 12.6 Subject Confidentiality In order to maintain subject privacy, all CRFs, diary cards, study drug accountability records, study reports, and communications will identify the subject only by the assigned subject number. The Investigator will grant monitors and auditors from the Sponsor or its designee, and regulatory authorities, access to the subject’s original medical records for verification purposes. 12.7 Insurance The Sponsor has established an insurance policy for the anticipated duration of the study, covering the subjects with respect to the risks involved in taking part in this study in accordance with this protocol. In the case of injury or disability deriving from participation in the study, subjects are requested to inform the Investigator or his/her staff responsible for the study at the institution without delay 13 PUBLICATION POLICY The Sponsor and Investigator will mutually manage the publication and presentation process. All manuscripts, abstracts, or other modes of presentation arising from the results of the study must be reviewed and approved in writing by the Sponsor in advance of submission in accordance with the"

Biological samples will be stored for the time established by regulatory requirements or destroyed after the final clinical study report has been finalized if storage is not required. There might be a new request for these samples to be used for purposes related to the QA of the laboratory tests described in this protocol, in which case they will be used for this purpose. This may include the assessment of the quality of current tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test methods for the markers described in this protocol, as well as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods and work reliably. If study results suggest that further investigations using stored biological samples are warranted, these tests might be carried out on an exploratory basis. In addition, biological samples may be used by the Sponsor or their research partners for further research that is not related to the disease or the product under study. This testing will be done on pseudonymized samples (meaning t hat subjects will not be identifiable from their biological samples as their identity will have been removed and they will be assigned a unique clinical study identification number).

As there will be no provision of stopping the study for efficacy and as – other than stopping for futility – there will be no other consequences of the interim analysis, there is no need to adjust the value of alpha. New Text: An informal interim analysis will be conducted once all recruited patients have completed the primary efficacy analysis 8 -week treatment period. This interim analysis is planned to enable 4D pharma to expedite the clinical development strategy based on the outcome of the interim analysis. Planning for pivotal trials and the EU Paediatric Investigation Plan and the US Paediatric Study Plan can be initiated in preparation for Agency meetings and further clinical development. There will be no other consequences of the interim analysis, there is no need to adjust the value of alpha. Reason: As there were no SUSAR submissions, it was deemed that there was no need to call a DSMB after the randomisation of 250 subjects and there was no need to stop the trial for futility. Although the DSMB was not called, this is not considered a withdrawal of the DSMB as no SUSARs have been raised during the study, to this point. As all patients have now been randomised and have completed the assessments which will be used in the primary efficacy analysis, 4D is including an interim analysis for efficacy. This change in the interim analysis is not considered to be a change of study design which is likely to have a significant impact on primary or major seconda ry statistical analysis or the risk/benefit assessment."
