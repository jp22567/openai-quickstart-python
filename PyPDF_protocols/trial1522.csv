Background and Rationale Castration- resistant prostate cancer represents a lethal transition in the progression of prostate cancer, with most patients ultimately succumbing to the disease. Prior to the recent approval of novel hormonal therapies (NHT) (e nzalutamide, abiraterone acetate/prednisone), the only approved therapies for metastatic CRPC w eredocetaxel, cabazitaxel and sipeleucel -T. The approval of NHTs in metastatic CRPC previously treated with docetaxel (De Bono et al, 2011 ; Scher et al, 2012 ) represented a therapeutic advance for these patients. Poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] -ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and PARP2 play important roles in DNA repair (Schreiber et al, 2006; Curtin, 2005). Inhibition of PARP catal ytic activit y results in sy nthetic lethalit y whereby persistent single -strand DNA breaks lead to irreparable double- strand DNA breaks in cells with defective homolo gous recombination mechanisms. Moreover, PARP inhibitors also trap the PARP enzy me on DNA to a variable extent, including that of tumor cells, thereb y preventing DNA replication and transcription. Talazoparib is a potent, orall y bioavailable, small molec ule PARP inhibitor in development for the treatment of a variety of human cancers. Single -agent treatment with talazoparib demonstrates potent antitumor effects in tissue culture studies, mouse tumor xenograft models, and in Phase 1 studies in patients wi th solid t umors. Talazoparib has also been shown to enhance the cy totoxic effects of DNA -damaging chemotherap y. Talazoparib in preclinical models demonstrates potent cy totoxic effects from PARP trapping. Proof of concept that a PARP inhibitor may treat a dvanced metastatic CRPC with DNA damage repair deficiency was established in a Phase 2study (TOPARP -A) with olaparib, which enrolled men heavily pre-treated with taxane -based chemotherap y and NHT (Mateo et al, 2015 ).

STUDY DESIGN This is an international, phase 2, open-label, soft tissue response rate study of talazoparib (also known as PF-06944076, MDV3800, BMN 673), a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor in development for treatment of cancer. PARP inhibition has been shown to produce clinical responses in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), particularly in patients with DNA damage repair deficiencies. PARP inhibitors are thought to induce cell toxicity by inhibiting PARP catalytic activity as well as by trapping PARP-DNA complexes, which prevent DNA repair, replication, and transcription. CCI"
17,page_17,"Talazoparib C3441006 (MDV3800-06) Protocol Amendment 4, 15 Nov 2018 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 18Nonclinical studies have shown that talazoparib has potent cytotoxic effects via both mechanisms, with greater cell toxicity from PARP trapping. In this study, a minimum of 100 men with measurable soft tissue disease and progressive metastatic CRPC with DNA damage repair deficiencies likely to sensitize to PARP inhibition will be studied. Patientswill be evaluated for genomic deficiencies in DNA damage repair genes as assessed by a gene mutation biomarker panel where relevant mutations are likely to sensitize to PARP inhibition. Eligible patients must have previously received 1 to 2 chemotherapy regimens including at least 1 taxane-based regimen for treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, and progressed on at least 1 line of novel hormonal therapy (enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate/prednisone) for treatment of metastatic CRPC. Patients will be evaluated at prescreening (optional) or screening for DNA damage repair deficiencies as assessed by a gene mutation biomarker panel. Approximately 100 patients with DNA damage repair deficiencies as assessed by a panel of genes likely to sensitize to PARP inhibition will be enrolled. Newly enrolled patients will have measurable soft tissue disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Patients must consent to submit sufficient tumor tissue (de novo tumor biopsy or archival tissue) to be centrally assessed for mutations in selected genes associated with DNA damage repair (DDR) deficiencies using the FoundationOne CDx™ (Foundation Medicine) panel. Previous identification of DNA repair deficiencies likely to sensitize to PARP inhibition, may be considered with sponsor approval. Patients enrolled in prior versions of the protocol, regardless of the type of DDR mutation or the presence of measurable disease, will follow the same schedule of activities and discontinuation criteria as described in the current amendment. Study periods include prescreening (optional), screening, treatment, safety follow-up, and long-term follow-up. Safety follow-up after permanent discontinuation of study drug treatment will occur approximately 28 days after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of a new antineoplastic or investigational therapy, whichever occurs first. Long-term follow-up will occur (usually ev ery 8-12 weeks) after safety follow-up. Radiographic imaging should continue during long-term follow-up for patients who discontinue study drug for any reason other than radiographic progression determined by independent central review, withdrawal of consent for follow-up, or death. Study Treatments Patients will receive talazoparib, 1 mg daily by mouth, with continued androgen deprivation (gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] therapy or bilateral orchiectomy). Talazoparib will be administered until radiographic progression is determined by independent central review, or unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, or death. In addition, talazoparib can continue to be administered upon disease progression only if, in the opinion of the investigator the patient is clinically benefitting, no new concurrent systemic therapy is CCI"

For patients with moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtrat ion rate [eGFR] 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2as per central laboratory ) at screening, the starting dose will be 0.75 mg/day . Study drug should not be discontinued based solel yon PSA or CTC count increases. Statistical Methods The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of single agent talazoparib in DDR+ mCRPC, as measured b y best objective response rate (ORR). An objective response is defined as a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECI ST 1.1. Response must be confirmed b y a follow -up radiographic assessment at least 4weeks later with a repeated computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and with no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria on repeat bone scan at least 6 weeks later b y independent central review. Efficacy Anal yses The statistical methods and anal yses for this study will be described in detail in the statistical analysis plan. DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population is defined as all enrolled patients who have measurable soft tissue disease at screening b y independent central review (ICR), have DDR deficiencies likely to sensitize to PARP inhibitor therap y and receive at least one dose of talazoparib. The DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population will be u sed for all baseline characteristics summaries and efficacy anal yses. Three anal yses are planned, including an initial safety /efficacy anal ysis followed b y two efficacy anal yses. The initial safety /efficacy anal ysis will be performed after 20 patients with measurable soft tissue disease and DDR deficiencies likely to sensitize to PARP inhibitor therap y have received the study drug for at least 8 weeks. Efficacy analyses of the primary endpoint will a lso be performed when 60 and 100 patients have com plete at least 6 months of study treatment or are no longer being followed (ie ,have withdrawn consent, discontinued from the study , died, or are otherwise lost to follow -up). All safety anal yses will be performed using the safety population, defined as all patients who receive any amount of study drug. Summaries and listings of efficacy and baseline data for patients that were enrolled under previous protocol versions andwho are not part of the DDR Defici ent Measurable Disease population wil l be described in the statistical analy sis plan. All patient -reported outcome (PRO) anal yses will be conducted on the PRO population, defined as allpatients from the DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population who hav e completed a baseline and at least one post -baseline PRO assessment prior to the end of stud y treatment."

The CTC evaluable population is defined as allpatients with a baseline CTC assessment and at least 1 postbaseline CTC assessment from the DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population. Primary Efficacy Endpoint : •Best ORR: The proportion of patients with a best overall soft tissue response of CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 by independent central review. Soft tissue responses must be confirmed by a follow-up radiographic assessment at least 4 weeks later with a repeated CT or MRI with no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression on repeat bone scan at least 6 weeks later per PCWG3 criteria by independent central review. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: •Time to objective response: The time from first dose of talazoparib to the first objective evidence of soft tissue response with no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression on bone scan per PCWG3. Soft tissue response is defined as a best overall response of CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 by independent central review. The response must be confirmed at least 4 weeks later with a repeated CT/MRI. •Duration of response: The time from the first objective evidence of soft tissue response (subsequently confirmed) per RECIST 1.1 by independent central review and no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression per PCWG3 to the first subsequent objective evidence of radiographic progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Radiographic progression is defined as soft tissue progression per RECIST 1.1 by independent central review or bone disease progression per PCWG3 by independent central review. •Proportion of patients with PSA response ≥50%: The proportion of patients with confirmed PSA decline ≥50% compared to baseline. •Proportion of patients with conversion of CTC count: The proportion of patients with a CTC count ≥5 CTC per 7.5 mL of blood at study entry that decreases to <5 CTC per 7.5 mL of blood any time on study. •Proportion of patients with a CTC count of 1 or more (detectable) per 7.5 mL of blood at study entry that decreases to CTC=0 (undetectable) per 7.5 mL of blood anytime on study ( Scher et al, 2017 ).CCI"

Analyses of best ORR, time to objective response, duration of response, and radiographic PFS will also be evaluated based on assessment by the investigator. The statistical methods and analyses are described in detail in the statistical analysis plan. PRO Analyses •Time to deterioration of pain ( ≥2-point increase from baseline, using question 3 of the BPI-SF), will be measured. In order to adequately measure pain, it is equally important to adequately track analgesic use to ensure that the pain palliation observed is not the result of an increase in analgesic use but rather the effect of the antitumor treatment being studied. After Day 1, pain and analgesic assessments will becompleted for each of 7 consecutive days before study visits; pain score averages during the period of reporting will be calculated. Analgesic data (from the analgesic log) will be mapped to the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic usage score and used concurrently to define pain progression with the BPI SF ( Basch E et al, 2013 ). •Longitudinal mixed effect-model analyses will be used to assess change from baseline in patient reported pain (assessed by BPI-SF) and general health status (assessed by EQ-5D-5L). PK Analyses PK data collections will include predose sampling at Day 1 (baseline sample, drawn prior to patient’s taking his first dose of talazoparib) and predose samples at weeks 5, 9, and 13, and postdose sampling at Day 1 and week 5. PK data analyses will include descriptive summary statistics of the predose trough and postdose plasma concentrations for talazoparib by study visit. In addition, the PK data from this study may be used to develop a population PK model. CCI"

Overview Talazoparib (also known as PF-06944076, MDV3800) is being investigated for the treatment of metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC) with DNA damage repair deficiencies in men whose disease has previousl y progressed on novel hormonal therap y (NHT: enzalutamide and/ or abiraterone acetate) givenfor the treatment of mCRPC and who were previousl y treated with taxan e-based chemotherap yfor metastatic disease . 1.1.2. Mechanism of Action/Indication Talazoparib is a potent, orally bioavailable, small molecule poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] -ribose) poly merase (PARP) inhibitor in development for the treatment of a variet y of human cancers. PARP inhibitors including talazoparib exert cy totoxic effects via 2mechanisms: (1) inhibition of PARP1 and PARP2 cataly tic activity , and (2) PARP trapping, a process in which PARP protein bound to a PARP inhibitor does not readily dissocia te from DNA, thereb y preventing DNA repair, replication, and transcription (Murai et al, 2012). Figure 1. Dual Cytotoxic Mechanisms of PARP Inhibitors Source: Adapted from Reference 1 PARP = poly (adenosine diphosphate -ribose) polymerase. Inhibiti on of PARP catalytic activity (upper pathway) interferes w ith the repair of single -strand breaks, leading to replication fork damage that requires homologous recombi nation DNA repair for cell survival. Trapping of PARP –DNA complexes with PA RP inhibitor (low er pathway; PARP inhibitor represented by ) also leads to replication fork damage with more DNA repair processes required for cell survival. Single -agent treatment with talazoparib has demonstrated potent antitumor effects in tissue culture studies, mouse tumor xenograft models, and in Phase 1 studies in patients with solid tumors. Talazoparib has also been shown to enhance the cy totoxic effects of DNA -damaging chemotherap y, including temozolomide and irinotecan, in both in vitro and in vivo preclinic al models."

Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. The American Cancer Society estimates that up to 180,890 men in the United States (US) will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and approximately 26,120 will die of the disease in 2016 ( American Cancer Society , 2016 ). In Europe in 2012, prostate cancer was the third most commo n cancer site, with an estimated 416,700 new cases and 92,200 deaths ( Ferlay et al, 2013 ). The androgen receptor signaling axis, the principal driver of prostate cancer growth, has long been targeted b y castration. However, a proportion of tumors progress despite castrate levels of testosterone, at which point the disease is considered castration -resistant. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) represents a lethal transition in the progression of prostate cancer, with most patients ultimately succumbing to the disease. Molecular profiling studies have revealed that the androgen receptor remains functional in a majority of progressing tumors. Rationally designed therapies targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway (Donovan et al, 2010 ) include enzalutamide, a novel androgen receptor antagonist that is active in the presence of androgen receptor overexpression ( Tran et al, 2009 ), and abiraterone acetate/prednisone (de Bono et al, 2011), an inhibitor of 17,20 -lyase (an androgen bios ynthetic enzy me overexpressed in CRPC) ( Stanbrough et al, 2006 ; Holzbeierlein et al, 2004 ). Prior to the recent approval of novel hormonal therapies (NHT) (enzalutamide, abiraterone acetate/prednisone), the only approved therapie s for metastatic CRPC were docetaxel, cabazitaxel and sipeleucel-T. The approval of NHTs in metastatic CRPC previously treated with docetaxel ( De Bono et al, 2011; Scher et al, 2012 ) represented a therapeutic advance for these patients. Clinical experience with these therapies validated findings that the and rogen receptor remains active despite androgen deprivation in men with CRPC, butresistance to these second -generation agents invariably occurs. Median survival remains low (approximately 15-18months) for men with metastatic CRPC who had previousl y recei ved docetaxel in studies of enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate/prednisone ( Scher et al, 2012 ; de Bono et al, 2011 ). Furthermore, in the C OMET-1 study of men with metastatic CRPC who had previous ly received both docetaxel and novel hormonal therapy , the median survival for those who received cabozantinib or prednisone was even lower at 11.0 months and 9.8months, respectivel y (Smith et al, 2015 ). No approved therap y has been tested in the target population of this study , as all currentl y approved treatments for s ymptomatic metastatic CRPC (including soft tissue disease) after docetaxel -based chemotherap y were tested in patients who had not received novel hormonal therapy . Thus, the target population in this study has an unmet medical need deserving of potentially promising experimental therapies. The key efficacy results of phase 2 and 3 studies in metastatic CRPC after chemotherap y (primarily docetaxel) are presented in Table 5."

PARP Inhibition PARP1 and PARP2 play important roles in DNA repair (Schreiber et al, 2006; Curtin NJ. 2005 ). Following DNA dama ge, PARP1 and PARP2 bind to single- stranded DNA bre aks, cleave nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and attach multiple ADP -ribose units to chromatin -associated proteins, including histones and PARP1 itself (Gibson & Kraus, 2012; Schreiber et al, 2002 ; Amé et al, 1999 ; Johansson 1999). The outcome is a highl y negativel y charged protein, which leads to the unwinding of the DNA strands and r ecruitment of proteins to repair the damaged DNA throug h the base -excision repair process. W hen PARP1 and PARP2 are inhibited, single -strand DNA breaks persist, resulting in stalled"
33,page_33,"Talazoparib C3441006 (MDV3800 -06) Protocol Amendment 4, 15 Nov 2018 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 34replication forks and conversion of single- strand breaks into double -strand breaks. These breaks must be repaired by homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining or they may become lethal. Thus, inhibition of PARP cataly tic activity results in sy nthetic lethality as defects in homologous recombination DNA repair prevent double strand breaks from being repaired, thereby killing the cell, including cancer cells. In addition, PARP inhibitors bind to PARP -DNA complexes trapping them , thereby inhibiting DNA repair, replicat ion, and transcription, with associated cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. Although other PARP inhibitors possess both activities , invitro studies demonstrated that talazoparib is a more potent PARP trapper than other PARP inhibitors in clinical development (Hopkins et al, 2015 ; Murai et al, 2014 ). 1.2.3. PARP Inhibitors as a Potential Targeted Therapeutic in Metastatic CRPC Proof of concept that PARP inhibition may treat prostate cancer with DNA damage repair deficiency was established in a Phase 2study (TOPARP -A) with the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Mateo et al, 201 5). In the TOPARP -A study , 50patients with metastatic CRPC were treated with the PARP inhibitor olaparib (400 mg orall y twice dail y). All had been previously treate d with docetaxel, 98% with abiraterone or enzalutam ide, and 58% with cabazitaxel. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 to2; disease progression per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) and/or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECI ST1.1); 5or more circulating tumor cells (CTC) per 7.5 mL of blood; and consented to a fresh tumor biops y. No prior exposure to platinum, cy clophosphamide, mitoxantrone, or other PARP inhibitors was permitted. Forty-nine patients were evaluable for response based on a composite endpoint of objective response according to RECI ST1.1, a reduction of at least 50% in prostate- specific antigen (PSA), or a confirmed reduction in CTC counts from 5 or more cells per 7.5 mL of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 mL of blood in patients with an identified homozygous deletion and/or putative deleterious mutation in DNA repair genes. Sixteen of 49 evaluable patients (33%) had a response and the median duration of treatment was 40 weeks for responding patients. Treatment with olaparib led to a response based on the composite endpoint definition in 14 of 16 patients (88%) with identified genomic deficiencies associated with DNA damage repair. On the other hand, onl y 2responses (6%) were seen in 33 patients without such ge nomic deficiencies. Of the 32 evaluable patients (65% of the 49 evaluable patients) who had measurable disease at baseline per RECI ST1.1, 7 patients had DNA damage repair deficiencies and 5 of those 7(71%) had a partial response (PR) per RECI ST1.1. Pa tients with DNA damage repair deficiencies had longer median radiographic progression -free survival (PFS) (9.8vs 2.7 months) and median overall survival (13.8 vs 7.5 months) compared with patients without DNA damage repair deficiencies. In an integrated analysis of somatic and germline mutation status in tumor biopsies from 150patients with metastatic CRPC, 22.7% of cases had mutations in DNA repair genes associated with sensitivity to a PARP inhibitor, including BRCA2, BRCA1, CDK12, FANCA, RAD51B, RAD51 C, ML H1, MSH2, and ATM. L oss of BRCA2 was observed in 12.7% of cases (approximately 90% of these were biallelic loss), and 8% harbored a germline"

Another clinical targeted sequencing analy sis of prostate cancer identified similar frequencies of somatic and germline alterations in DNA damage repair genes BRCA2, BRCA1, and ATM (Abida et al, 2015 ). PARP1 and PARP2 play important roles in DNA repair ( Schreiber et al, 2006; Curtin, 2005). Following DNA damage, PARP1 and PARP2 bind to single -stranded DNA breaks, cleave nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), and attach multiple ADP -ribose units to the target protein, including itself ( Gibson & Kraus, 2012 ; Schreiber et al, 2002 ; Amé et al, 1999 ; Johansson, 1999). The outcome is a highl y negativel y charged protein, which leads to the unwinding of the DNA strands and recruitment of proteins to repair the damaged DNA through the base -excision repair process. When PARP1 and PARP2 are inhibited, single -strand DNA breaks persist, resulting in stalled replication forks and conversion of single -strand br eaks into double -strand breaks. These breaks must be repaired by homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining or they may become lethal. Talazoparib (also known as PF- 06944076, MDV3800, BMN 673) is a potent, orally bioavailable, small molecule po ly(ADP -ribose) poly merase (PARP) inhibitor in development for the treatment of a variety of human cancers. PARP inhibitors including talazoparib exert cytotoxic effects via 2 mechanisms: inhibition of PARP1 and PARP2 catalytic activity and PARP trapping, a process in which PARP protein bound to a PARP inhibitor does not readily dissociate from DNA, preventing DNA repair, replication, and transcription ( Murai et al, 2012 ). Inhibition of PARP cataly tic activity contributes to the p rocess of synthetic lethalit y, as it results in persistent single -strand breaks that require homologous recombination DNA repair for survival. Stabilized PARP -DNA complexes (ie, trapped) inhibit DNA repair, replication, and transcription, and are more cy totoxic than unrepaired single -strand breaks because they do not readily dissociate. Although other PARP inhibitors possess both activities, in vitro studies demonstrated that talazoparib has greater PARP trapping activity than other PARP inhibi tors in cli nical development ( Hopkins et al, 2015 ; Murai et al, 2014 ). PARP inhibition exhibits an enhanced cy totoxic effect in cancers with DNA d amage repair deficiencies. The majority of responses in the TOPARP -A study of the PARP1 and PARP2 inhibitor olaparib in metastatic CRPC ( Mateo et al, 2015 , described in Section 1.2) were observed in men with kn own DNA damage repair deficiencies. In this phase 2 study of olaparib monotherap y, 16 of 49 evaluable patients with metastatic CRPC (33%) had mutations and/or deletions in genes involved in homologous recombination or other DNA repair pathways. Of the 16 patients (33%) who responded to treatment with olaparib, 14 (88%) had mutations in DNA repair genes. These data suggest that PARP inhibition may be a useful strategy for the treatment of tumors in men with metastatic CRPC, especiall y those harboring DNA repair pathway deficiencies. In an integrated anal ysis of somatic and germline mutation status in tumor biopsies from 150 patients with metastatic CRPC, 22.7% of cases had mutations in DNA repair genes associated with sensitivity to a PARP inhibitor, incl uding BRCA2, BRCA1, CDK12, FANCA, RAD51B, RAD51C, ML H1, and ATM ( Robinson et al, 2015). Loss of BRCA2 was observed in 12.7% of cases (approximately 90% of these were biallelic los s), and 8% harbored a germline alteration in BRCA2, BRCA1, or ATM. Another clinical targeted sequencing anal ysis of prostate cancer identified similar frequencies of somatic and germline alterations in DNA damage repair genes BRCA2, BRCA1, and ATM ( Abida et al, 2015 )."

The median duration of olaparib treatment for all patients was 12 weeks. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events included anemia (20% of patients), fatigue (12%), leukopenia (6%), thrombocy topenia (4%), and neutropenia (4%). At least 1 dose reduction was required in 13 patients (26%), primarily due to anemia; 3 patients (6%) discontinued due to adverse events. 1.3.Summary of Relevant Clinical Experience With Talazoparib As of 31 Jan 2018, talazopar ibhas been evaluated in approximately 659patients and 18healthy volunteers in both company -sponsored and investigator -sponsored studies in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors at doses up to 2 mg/day .

Study 673-201 (ABRAZO) is a Phase 2, 2- stage, 2 -cohort stud y of talazoparib in patients with germline BRCA mutation and locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer. As of December 2016, the confirmed objective response rate (CRs and PRs) was 20.8% for cohort 1(95% confidence interval [CI ]: 10.47, 34.99), including 2 CRs (4.2%), and 37.1% for cohort 2 (95% CI: 21.47, 55.08) per independent central r adiology assessment. The objective response rate across both cohorts was 27.7% (95% CI : 18.45, 38.62), demonstrating clinically meaningful responses in this population with a poor prognosis and a high unmet medical need. Activity of talazoparib in women with germline BRCA 1/2 mutation and locally advanced breast cancer has been confirmed in a phase 3 study (EMBRACA, Litton et al, 2018 ) comparing the safet y and efficacy of 1 mg/day talazoparib versus physician’s- choice of chemot herap y (PCT) which included capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine. The median progression -free survival was 8.6 months for patients treated with talazoparib, vs 5.6months for patients treated with physician’s -choice chemotherap y (HR = 0.542, P<.0001). Additional and updated information on the clinical efficacy of talazoparib is provided in the talazoparib investigator’s brochure. 1.3.2. Safety Aggregate safet y data from 5 open- label studies, including 1 randomized, company - sponsored clinical study(PRP -001, 673 -201, 673- 301, MDV3800- 13, and MDV3880- 15: N= 502 patients) evaluating talazoparib monotherapy in solid tumors at the proposed dose of 1 mg/day provide the basis for the reported treatment -emergent adverse event s(TEAEs). All causality TEAEs reported in ≥20% of patients administered single -agent talazoparib 1mg/day are related to my elosuppression (anemia, neutropenia), GI toxicity (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, and decreased appetite), fatigue, headache, and alopecia. Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in ≥ 5% of patients were associated with my elosuppression. Study drug -related TEAEs occurring in ≥20% of patients in the t alazoparib 1 mg/day population were anemia (45.8%), fatigue (36.1%), nausea (32.5%), neutropenia (21.9%), and alopecia ( 20.1%).

Of these, onl y veno-occlusive liver disease was assessed as related to stud y drug b y the investigator. Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 164 of 502 patients (32.7%) in the talazoparib 1mg/day population. SAEs occurring in ≥2% of patients were anemia (5.2%) and dyspnea (2.2%) and pleural effusion (2.2%). Fort y-seven patients had SAEs considered related to study drug. Study drug -related SAEs occurring in ≥ 1% of patents were anemia (4.6%), thrombocy topenia (1.2%) and platelet count decreased (1.2%). Twenty (20) of 502 patients (4.0%) in the t alazoparib 1 mg/day population discontinued study drug due to a TEAE. The events that led to study drug discontinuation were anemia (3patients), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 2 patients), and accidental overdose , increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bradycardia, metastatic breast cancer, cerebral hemorrhage, d yspnea, glioblastoma multiforme, headache, metastases to meninges, muscular weakness, neutropenia, obstructive airway s disorder, thrombocy topenia, tr ansient ischemic attack, and vomiting (1 patient each). Among the 502 patients in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day population, 63.9% had a TEAE that led to dose reduction and 61.2% had a TEAE that led t o dosing interruption. The most common TEAEs that led to dose reduction or interruption were associated with m yelosuppression. In the EMBRACA trial, the adverse events observed with talazoparib were consistent with findings from previous trials. The most common adverse events (AEs)observed with talazoparib (an y grade in at least 15% of patients) were anemia (52.8%), fatigue (50.3%), nausea (48.6%), neutropenia (34.6%), headache (32.5%), thrombocy topenia (26.9%), alopecia (25.2%), vomiting (24.8%), diarrhea (22%), constipation (22%), decreased appetite (21.3%), back pain (21%) and dy spnea (17.5%). The incidence of SAEs was 31.8% in the talazoparib arm and 29.4% in the PCT chemotherapy arm. Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 7.7% of patients in the talazoparib arm and 9.5% of patients in the PCT chemotherap y arm. For a dditional important safet y information from other talazoparib studies, please consult the current talazoparib investigator’s brochure. 1.3.3. Pharmacokinetics Talazoparib plasma exposure was dose proportional in the dose range of 0.025 mg to 2 mg once a day suggesting linear PK. Talazoparib absolute bioavailability is at least 54.6%. After administration of a single 1 mg dose of talazoparib to cancer patients, the median T max ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 hours across studies. Administration of a single 0.5 m g dose of talazoparib to healthy subjects with food (a high- fat, high -calorie meal) had no impact on the area under the plasma concentration ti me curve (AUC )while reduced the C maxby 46%. The reduction in the rate of absorption with food is not expected to be clinically relevant as efficacy is driven b ytotal overall exposur efor the ty pical targeted anti-cancer therapies. Therefore, talazoparib can be taken without regard of food."

Population PK analysis showed that talazoparib apparent steady- state volume of distribution (Vss/F) was 420 L , which is significantl y greater than total body water (42 L), indicating that talazoparib distributes to peripheral tissues. Talazoparib undergoes minimal hepa tic metabolism. Based on population PK analy sis, there was no effect of mild hepatic impairment (total bilir ubin ≤upper limit of normal [UL N] and AST >ULN, or total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST) on talazoparib exposure. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Talazoparib was eliminated slowly with a mean terminal plasma half-life (t½) of 89.8 hours. Talazoparib accumulated after 1 mg once a day dosing with a median accumulation ratio ranging from 2.33 to 5.15, consistent with its t½. Population PK analy sis showed that talazoparib CL /F was 6.45 L /hr. Excretion of uncha nged talazoparib in urine was the major route of elimination accounting for 54.6% of the administered dose. Population PK analy sis showed that talazoparib CL /F was reduced b y 14.4% and 37.1% in pati ents with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [Cr Cl], 60 to 89 mL /min) and moderate renal impairment (30 mL /min ≥CrCl <60 mL /min), respectivel y, compared to that of patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 90 mL /min). No dose adjustment is reco mmended for patients with mild renal impairment. For patients with moderate renal impairment, the rec ommended dose of talazoparib is 0. 75mg once a day . In vitro studies showed that talazoparib is a substrate for the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Populat ion PK analy sis indicated that concomitant administration of strong P gp inhibitors with talazoparib increased talazoparib exposure by 44.7% relative to talazoparib administered alone. Guidelines for concomitant use of talazoparib with P- gp inhibitors or inducers and BCRP inhibitors are provided in Section 5.10.

Nonclinical Pharmacology of Talazoparib The cy totoxic activity of talazoparib was demonstrated in cell culture, and antitumor effects were demonstrated in mouse xenograft models. In cell -free enzy me assays, talazo parib inhibited PARP1 and PARP2 catalytic activity with inhibitory constant (Ki) values of 1.2 nM and 0.87 nM, respectivel y (Wang et al, 2016 ). Talazoparib was approximately 3.4- to 8.3 -fold more potent than other PARP inhibitors in clinical development (veliparib, rucaparib, olaparib) in inhibiting PARP1 cataly tic activity (Shen et al, 2013 ). In addition, talazoparib was approximately 40-fold more potent than olaparib in stimulating the formation of stabl e PARP1 -DNA complexes ( Murai et al, 2014 )."

Nonclinical PK and Metabolism PK studies in rats and dogs show that talazoparib oral bioavail ability was >43% in rats and >51% in dogs. A Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) study in dogs demonstrated that the capsule formulati on used in clinical studies is approximately 2-fold more bioavailable than the suspension formulation used in nonclinical studies. In general, talazoparib display s greater than or approximately dose -proportional increases in exposure in rats and dogs with no evidence of sex differences. Studies of [14C]-talazoparib in rats and dogs indicate rapid absorption, wide distribution (greater than total bod y water), and nearl y complete elimination of drug substance (>90%) b y 7days. Fecal elimination was the main route of elimination in both species, and renal excretion was moderate (21- 26%). In a study in rats, [14C]-talazoparib was widely distributed, reaching maximum levels 1 to 4hours postdose. Excluding the gastrointestinal tract, the highest radioactivity levels were observed in liver and kidney (and the ey e uveal tract in albino rats). Tissue radioactivity levels were greater than blood levels in the target organs of talazoparib toxicity (bone marrow, spleen, and thy mus) through 7 days. Metabolic profil ing of plasma, urine, and feces samples indicated that [14C]-talazoparib is largely cleared via excretion of unchanged parent drug and metabolized to a minor extent via oxidation and dehy drogenation. In vitro metabolism studies in rat, dog, and human hepat ic microsomes demonstrated that [14C]-talazoparib has high metabolic stability (>90%) over 2 hours. A minimal extent or a lack of metabolism for [14C]-talazoparib was observed in the presence of freshly isolated mouse, rat, dog, and human hepatocy tes or c ryopreserved human hepatocy tes. Talazoparib does not appear to be a substrate of an y major cy tochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolizing enzy me. Mean binding to human plasma proteins is 78.7%; therefore, it is unlikely that talazoparib will demonstrate clinically significant drug-drug interactions related to displacement from plasma protein binding sites. At therapeutic exposures, talazoparib does not markedl y induce or inhibit CYP450 enzy mes. Therefore, it is unlikely that talazoparib will demonstrate clinically significant CYP450 inhibition -or induction-based drug- drug interactions when coadministered with corresponding substrates. Talazoparib is not a substrate of metabolizing CYP450 enzymes. At therapeutic exposures, talazoparib does not markedly induce or inhibit any transporters. Therefore, it is unlikely that talazoparib will demonstrate clinically significant drug transporter inhibition-based drug– drug interactions when coadministered with corresponding substrates. Additional information on the nonclinical PK and drug metabolism of talazoparib is provided in the investigator ’sbrochure."

Nonclinical Toxicology Safety pharmacology , single -and repeat -dose toxicity , genotoxicity , embryo -fetal development, and in vitro phototoxicity studies were conducted to evaluate the nonclinical toxicology profile of talazoparib. Repeat -dose toxicity /toxicokinetic studies were conducted with talazoparib utilizing the intended oral route of administration in mice, rats, and dogs. A repeat -dose study with talazoparib wa s conducted in BALB/c nude mice to select doses and exposures f or the mouse xenograft studies. Five-day, 28-day, and 13 -week repeat -dose GLP toxicity and toxicokinetic studies with 28-day recovery periods were conducted in the rat and dog. Themajor findi ngs are as follows: Dose -dependent pancy topenia with bone marrow hy pocellularity and depletion of lymphoid tissue in multiple organs was observed and considered possibly due to exaggerated pharmacology of talazoparib based on the higher (relative to baseli ne) poly(ADP -ribose) (index of PARP1/2 activity ) tissue levels in these organs. The hematologic findings were partiall y reversible and may be readily monitored in the clinic. The toxicities that resulted in mortality in dogs (0.1 mg/kg/day ) and some rats (1mg/kg/day ) occurred at AUC0 -24exposures that were >0.8 -and 4 -fold higher, respectivel y, than the exposure at the recommended human dose of 1 mg/day. The toxicities were mainl y due to septicemia that resulted from the severe bone marrow and ly mphoid depletion. A dose -dependent increased incidence of gastrointestinal tract findings of apoptosis/necrosis in the stomach and duodenum was observed. Additional findings at higher doses included reversible villous atroph y and increased apoptosis throughout t he gastrointestinal tract, most notably in the small intestine. Gastrointestinal tract toxicities of enteropathy and villous atrophy caused mortality in rats at 3.0 mg/kg/day . Exposures at 3.0 mg/kg/day are significantl y higher than the exposures at the recommended human dose. Additional findi ngs at the high dose ( ≥1mg/kg/day ) in the 5 -day GLP study in rats included focal necrotic changes in the ovarian follicular atresia and hepatocyte necrosis of the liver. These findings were not observed in the 28 -day or 13 -week repeat -dose studies in rat s. Atrophy and/or degenerative changes in testes and epididy mis and effects on the seminiferous tubules were observed in rats and dogs; the severity correlated with both dose and duration of treatment. There were no talazoparib- related effects on respirato ry or central nervous sy stem parameters after a single oral administration to rats (safet y pharmacology studies), or on cardiovascular parameters and electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluations after a repeat -dose oral administration in dogs (repeat -dose toxicity studies). Talazoparib had no effect on ophthalmologic endpoints in rats or dogs in repeat -dose toxicity studies. Talazoparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay , but consistent with the genomic instability of its primary"

Talazoparib caused fetal malformations, structural variations, and death in an embry o-fetal development st udy in rats. Based on an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake assay , which results in a high incidence of false positives, talazoparib is potentially phototoxic in humans. In conclusion, the main nonclinical toxicologic findings were earl y hematologic changes and subsequent bone marrow and l ymphoid organ depletion; focal atrophy and degeneration of testes, epididy mis, and seminiferous tubules; and dose-dependent apoptosis/necrosis in the gastrointestinal tract and liver after repeat -dose talazoparib. These fi ndings are consistent with the exaggerated pharmacology of talazoparib and its tissue exposure pattern. Additional information on the toxicology of talazoparib is provided in the talazoparib investigator’s brochure. 1.5. Talazoparib Benefits and Risks Assess ment The doses of talazoparib in this protocol are supported by nonclinical studies and phase 1-3studies in patients with advanced malignancies. Adverse drug reactions with talazoparib include my elosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicity , fatigue, and al opecia. Hepatotoxicity ,second primary nonhematologic malignancies and pneumonitis are adverse events of special interest per the investigator’s brochure. Seven AEs of second primary nonhematologic malignancies were reported in 6 patients (squamous cell carcinoma of skin [2 patients], and basal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, intraductal proliferative breast lesion, neoplasm skin, and ovarian neoplasm [1 patient each ,respectively ]). These second primary malignancies were mostly skin malignancie s. In general, latency to diagnosis of the malignancy was relativel y short, making a relationship with talazoparib unlikely . Diagnose s of my elodysplastic s yndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) have been reported in patients who received pol y(adeno sine diphosphate [ADP] ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Overall, MDS/AML has been reported in 2 (1 MDS and 1AML case) out of 561 solid tumor patients treated with talazoparib in clinical studies. The activity of talazoparib as monotherapy and in combination with other agents is being evaluated in multiple indications. Recent results from the EMBRACA study (Litton et al, 2018 ) aphase 3 trial comparing talazoparib, an oral PARP inhibitor, to phy sician's choice of therap y(PCT) in patients with advanced breast cancer and a germline BRCA mutation, demonstrated that s ingle -agent talazoparib at 1 mg/day significantly prolonged progression- free survival in HER2 -negative advanced breast cancer patients with a g ermline BRCA 1/2mutation compared to PCT. Data from the study indicate that talazoparib was generall y well tolerated with minimal non- hematologic toxicity and few AEs associated with treatment discontinuations. The benefit -risk profile of talazoparib in prostate cancer patients is not y et characterized. Additional information for this compound may be found in the single reference safet y document (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator ’sBrochure."

Overall Study Design and Plan: Description This is an international, phase 2, open-label, soft tissue response rate study of talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor in development for the treatment of cancer. PARP inhibition has been shown to produce clinical responses in metastatic CRPC, particularly in patients with DNA damage repair deficiencies. PARP inhibitors are thought to induce cell toxicity by inhibiting PARP catalytic activity as well as by trapping PARP-DNA complexes, which prevent DNA repair, replication, and transcription. Nonclinical studies have shown that talazoparib has potent cytotoxic effects via both mechanisms, with greater cell toxicity from PARP trapping. In this study, patients will be evaluated at prescreening (optional) or screening for DNA damage repair deficiencies as assessed by a gene mutation biomarker panel. At least100 men with measurable soft tissue disease (per RECIST1.1) and progressive metastatic CRPC and DNA damage repair deficiencies likely to sensitize to PARP inhibition will be enrolled. Eligible patients must have previously received 1 to 2 chemotherapy regimens including at least 1 taxane-based regimen for treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, and progressed on at least 1 line of novel hormonal therapy (enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate/prednisone) for treatment of metastatic CRPC.

Previous identification of DNA repair deficiencies likely to sensitize to PARP inhibition, using the FoundationOne CDx™ test may be considered for eligibility (with sponsor approval). Biopsies of the brain, lung/mediastinum, pancreas, or endoscopic procedures extending beyond the esophagus, stomach, or bowel may not be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility. The primary efficacy endpoint is best ORR by modified RECIST1.1/PCWG3. An objective response is defined as a best overall response of CR or PR per RECIST 1.1. Responses mustbe confirmed by a follow-up radiographic assessment at least 4 weeks later with a repeated computed tomography (CT)/MRI and with no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression on repeat bone scan at least 6 weeks later per PCWG3 criteria by independent central review. Talazoparib 1 mg/day orally will be administered until radiographic progression is determined by independent central review, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death. In addition, talazoparib can continue to be administered upon disease progression only if, in the opinion of the investigator the patient is clinically benefitting, no new concurrent systemic therapy is started, and the sponsor is notified. For patients with moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m 2per central laboratory) at screening, the starting dose will be 0.75 mg/day. Study drug should not be discontinued based solely on PSA or CTC count increases. Study periods include prescreening (optional), screening, treatment, safety follow-up, and long-term follow-up. Safety follow-up after permanent discontinuation of study drug treatment will occur approximately 28 days after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of a new antineoplastic or investigational therapy, whichever occurs first. Long-term follow-up will occur every 8 (if study treatment discontinuation is prior to week 25) to 12 weeks (if study treatment discontinuation is at or beyond week 25) after safety follow-up. Radiographic imaging shoul d continue during long-term follow-up for patients who discontinue study drug for any reason other than radiographic progression determined per protocol, withdrawal of consent for follow-up, or death. Survival status, new antineoplastic therapy(ies), and diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia will be assessed until the study is terminated. CCI"

Discussion of Study Design and Rationale for Dose Selection Treatment of men with metastatic CRPC previously treated with taxane-based chemotherapy and who progressed on novel hormonal therapy is an area of high unmet need. No therapy is approved for this patient population, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines do not specifically address treatment in this late disease stage. Study C3441006 (MDV3800-06) is based on nonclinical studies supporting the sensitivity of prostate tumors with DNA damage repair deficiencies, which may sensitize to PARP inhibition, and clinical evidence demonstrating a high response rate to the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, in a genomically selected subset of men with metastatic CRPC (the TOPARP-A study, discussed CCI"
48,page_48,"Talazoparib C3441006 (MDV3800 -06) Protocol Amendment 4, 15 Nov 2018 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 49in Section 1.2). Talazoparib has cy totoxic effects believed to be caused b y inhibition of the catal ytic activit y of PARP -dependent DNA repair and suppression of DNA sy nthesis and transcription at sites of PARP trapping. This study will evaluate patients at prescreening (optional) or screening for DNA damage repair deficiencies as assessed using a biomarker panel of gene mutations. The patients will be evaluated for gene mutations in apanel of genes that , when mutated, are likely to sensitize to PARP i nhibition. The sample size requirement for patients with measurable soft tissue disease supports the primary endpoin t of best ORR, which is a clinically relevant endpoint with precedent in oncology indications where high unmet need exists. Cabazitaxel is a possible therap y indicated for these patients and its previous use is permitted. Similarly, radium-233 is a possible therap y for patients with sy mptomatic bone metastatic CRPC without visceral metastases and its previous use is permitted. Mechanisms of resistance to PARP inhibition may be shared with DNA -damaging agents such as cy clophosphamide andor mitoxantrone; thus, these agents and prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor in an experimental setting are excluded to maximize the likelihood of treatment efficacy . Similarly , treatment with platinum- based therapies in the 6 months prior to screening, or progression on prior platinum- based therap y at an y time in the past, will exclude participation. Treatment w ith chemotherapy (eg,docetaxel, cabazitaxel ) within 28days of Day 1and on study is also prohibited given the heightened risk of myelosuppression. A known diagnosis of m yelodysplastic s yndrome or acute my eloid leukemia and central laboratory hematology values below specified thresholds for hemogl obin, absolute neutrophil count, and platelet count at screening are also exclusionary given the predicted risk of dose -dependent m yelosuppression. Pulmonary function testing is not mandated given the rarity of pneumonitis reports with exposure to other P ARP inhibitors. Current or anticipated use within 7 day s prior to first dose of study drug or anticipated use during the stud yof strong P-gp inhibitor sis exclusionary .For a list of strong P -gp inhibitors, refer to Section 5.11. C3441006 (MDV3800- 06)will include an efficacy assessment schedule of every 8weeks during the first 24 weeks based on the standard of care for the target patient population with progressive advanced disease. Efficacy assessments will be every 12weeks after the first 24weeks. Additional safety precautions will include monitoring for potential hematologic toxicities by evaluating complete blood counts every 2weeks through week 9, every 4weeks through week 25, a nd then every 8weeks thereafter during treatment. Prolonged myelosuppression will be monitored closely and diagnoses of m yelod ysplastic sy ndrome and acute m yeloid leukemia occurring during or after study drug treatment will be reported. The potential fo r liver toxicity will be monitored b y periodic transaminase testing with predefined dose modification and discontinuation criteria. Finally , patients with moderate renal impairment will receive talazoparib at a lower starting dose as they are at risk of higher exposure due to decreased renal clearance."

Based on population PK analyses, talazoparib CL/F was estimated to be 37.1% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment than in those with normal renal function, resulting in higher exposure ( Section 1.3.3 ). Simulations were performed to predict the steady-state exposure (AUC) for a 0.75 mg/day dose in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2) and for a 1 mg/day dose in patients with no rmal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) (Table 7). The predicted exposure at 0.75 mg/day for patients with moderate renal impairment is comparable to the exposure at 1 mg/day for patients with normal renal function as assessed by stead y-state AUC. Based on these data, the planned starting dose for patients with moderate renal impairment is 0.75 mg/day . Patient with moderate renal impairment should remain on a reduced talazoparib dose throughout the study ; dose escalation to a dose of 1mg/day is not permitted for those patients.

Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the team SharePoint site. To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on s tudy-related medical questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, patient study numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and con tact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patient’s participation in the study . The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the stud y.The contact number is not intended for use b y the patient directly, and if a patient calls that number, he will be directed back to the investigator site. 5.STUDY TREATMENTS For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) guideline s, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (I CH E6 1.33). For this study , the investigational product , or study drug, is talazoparib. The sp onsor will provide talazoparib capsules. 5.1.Allocation to Treatment This is an open -label study in which all eligible subjects will receive talazoparib. The stud y will use an interactive response technology (IRT) sy stem (interactive Web -based response system [IWRS]). The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, and the subject number. The site personn el will then be provided with asubject identification number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when investigational product is being supplied via the I RT s ystem. The I RT sy stem will provide a confirmation report containing the subject number , and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. The study -specific I RT reference manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system."

Any storage conditions stated in the talazoparib Investigator’s Brochure will be superseded by the storage conditions stated on the label. Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room- temperature products). This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study . Even for continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site pro cedure that ensures active evaluation for excursions should be available. The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last evaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations. The operation of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, shoul d be regu larly inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order. Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery . The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage conditio ns described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to Pfizer. Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the investigational product. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior t o Pfizer approval will be considered a protocol deviation.

STUDY PROCEDURES Study enrollment and procedures are summarized in the following subsections. The study periods will include prescreening (optional), screening, treatment, safety follow-up, and long-term follow-up. The timing of all study procedures is provided in the schedules of activities ( Table 1 , Table 2 , Table 3 , Table 4 ). The interactive response system user manual contains the information needed for registering patient status (eg, assigning screening numbers, indicating screen failure, and end of treatment). 6.1. Prescreening (optional) Certain procedures or activities may be performed during a prescreening period defined as any time before a prospective study participant signs an informed consent form to be formally screened for study enrollment. These include a biopsy procedure to obtain de novotumor tissue or the retrieval of archived tumor tissue for evaluation of a DNA damage repair deficiency as assessed using the FoundationOne CDx™ (Foundation Medicine) gene mutation panel. A separate prescreening consent form must be signed if de novo or archival tissue and blood sample will be obtained and analyzed before the patient signs consent for the protocol screening period. In addition, after the prescreening consent is signed, previously obtained (ie, historic) testing results from analysis of tumor tissue using the FoundationOne CDx™test may be submitted. Test results obtained using the FoundationOne CDx™ test identifying DNA repair deficiencies likely to sensitize to PARP inhibition may be considered for eligibility with sponsor approval. If sufficient residual DNA is available at Foundation Medicine, this could be used to confirm a patient’s eligibility for enrollment. Note that if eligibility for enrollment is established based either on historical results or residual DNA testing, available archival or de novo tumor tissue also should be submitted prior to Day 1. Study site personnel must document the informed consent process for tissue and blood sampling in the patient’s clinical record. After obtaining signed informed consent, study site personnel will access the interactive response system to assign a screening identification (ID) number for each potential study participant. In addition, the demographic data case report form (CRF), the Prior Anti-Cancer Therapies CRF and the Medical History- Prostate Cancer CRF should be completed at pre-screening if pre-screening is performed. For subjects for whom new tissue or blood sampling needs to be obtained and as applicable, AEs and/or research related injuries are to be reported as per Section 8.4.5 . Prescreening procedures are listed in the schedule of activities in Table 1 . 6.2. Screening Period The screening period will be from day -28 through day-1 for most procedures ( Table 2 ).

Informed Consent Study site personnel must explain to potential study participants all aspects of the study, including all scheduled visits and activities. Study site personnel must obtain signed and dated informed consent before any study-specific procedures are conducted unless the procedures are part of routine standard of care, and must document the informed consent process in the patient’s source documents. 6.2.2. Screening Identification Numbers After obtaining signed informed consent, study site personnel will access the interactive response system to assign a screening ID number (if not obtained previously during prescreening) for each potential study participant. For patients who provide informed consent and subsequently do not meet eligibility criteria or withdraw consent, study site personnel will document the screen failure or consent withdrawal in the patient’s source documents. The documentation will include demographics(which may have been assessed at pre-screening), and medical history for prostate cancer, prior treatment(s) for prostate cancer, the reason for screen failure, the eligibility criteria reviewed, and procedures performed and, as applicable, any AE/SAE that occurs during the active collection period (refer to Section 8.1.4 ) until the patient is determined to be a screen failure. 6.2.3. Screening Procedures Screening procedures are listed in the schedule of activities in Table 2 . All procedures must be completed within 28 days before day 1 except as noted. Scans obtained within 42 days before day 1 as part of standard of care may be used for the screening radiographic assessment. De novo or archival tumor tissue for analysis of DNA damage repair deficiencies is required for enrollment (if not collected at prescreening) as assessed using the FoundationOne CDx™(Foundation Medicine) gene mutation panel. In addition, previously obtained (ie, historic) testing results from analysis of tumor tissue using the FoundationOne CDx™ test may be submitted with sponsor approval. Should a patient qualify based either on prior results or DNA available at Foundation Medicine, available de novo or archival tumor tissue should be submitted prior to Day 1 to support planned concordance analysis The investigator will assess the eligibility of each patient. All screening procedure results and relevant medical history must be available before eligibility can be determined. All inclusion criteria must be met and none of the exclusion criteria may apply.

Eligibility will be determined as per the amendment approved at the site at the time the Enrollment Authorization Form is reviewed. No eligibility waivers will be granted . 6.3. Treatment Period 6.3.1. Treatment Period Visit Windows All treatment period visits have a visit window of ±3 days (ie, 3 days before or after the given day), except the day 1 visit (start of study treatment). The window for imaging assessments is ±7 days. Study drug supplies must be taken into account when scheduling visits. Procedures for a given visit may be split across the window to allow for drug resupply and completion of study procedures. 6.3.2. Treatment Period Procedures Specified study procedures will be performed at each clinic visit according to the schedule of activities ( Table 3 ). •All patients will have clinic visits every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks (through week 9), then every 4 weeks through week 25, and every 12 weeks thereafter. •Day 1 is the day of the first dose of study drug treatment (talazoparib). Questionnaires should be completed •Safety assessment labs will be done by the central laboratory per schedule of assessment. In addition, every effort should be taken to send unscheduled samples to the central laboratory to monitor resolution of AE/SAE. Pretreatment serum chemistry and hematology laboratory tests may be performed at the local laboratory within 3 days before the scheduled times (every 2 weeks through week 9, then every 4 weeks through week 25, and every 8 weeks thereafter). The investigator must review the laboratory results before dosing. Regardless of whether local laboratory testing is obtained for serum chemistry and hematology values, blood samples must be sent to the central laboratory for evaluation. Results from local laboratory assessments will be entered in the appropriate CRF.CCI CCI"

Study visits and study drug treatment will continue until criteria for permanent study discontinuation are met ( Section 6.4). PSA progression or CTC count increases alone should not lead to study drug discontinuation. 6.3.3. Unscheduled Visit Procedures Unscheduled visits/assessments may be perform ed any time to assess or follow up adverse events, to perform scans, or at the request of the patient or investigator or sponsor , or to account for an y insufficient, inadequate, or mis sed sample or assessments . The date and reason for the unscheduled visit must be recorded in the source documentation. A review of adverse events and changes to concomitant medications or treatments (including herbal therapies) occurring since the previous visit should be performed at unscheduled visits. If an unscheduled vi sit is necessary to assess toxicity or for suspected disease progression, diagnostic tests may be performed based on investigator assessment as appropriate. Imaging may be performed if appropriate for patients who are sy mptomatic or for whom radiographic progression or response is being determined. All radiographic assessments obtained (including unscheduled ones) will need to be submitted for independent central review .Unscheduled visits andvisit procedures are listed in Table 3. Other study procedures may be performed as clinicall y appropriate. 6.4.Permanent Treatment Discontinuation Treatmen t discontinuation is defined as permanent cessation of study drug treatment administration. After permanent discontinuati on, safet y follow- up will occur per Section 6.5, unless the patient withdraws consent for further follow-up. Temporary treatment interruption (eg, due to an adverse event) is n ot considered permanent discontinuation. The primary reason s for which patients permanently discontinue study treatment are listed in Table 10."

The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the patient return all unused investigational product(s), request that the patient return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the patient regarding an y unresolved adverse events (AEs). If applicable, patients who return for a final visit will undergo safet y and long term follow -up procedures as sho wn in Table 3and Table 4. Patients may withdraw from the study at an y time at their own request. If the patient withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for di sclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected.

Sponsor discontinuation of study The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study anytime for any reason as describ ed in Section 14.The sponsor will terminate this study following completion of the study objectives, or earlier if deemed necessary. 6.5.Safety Follow -up Patients will have safet y follow -up after permanent discontinuation of study drug treatment. Safety follow -up should occur approximately 28days after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of new antineoplastic or investigational therap y, whichever occurs first. In the event that new antineoplastic or new investigational therapy is initiated before safet y follow -up occurs (eg, a phy sician not associated with protocol C3441006 (MDV3800 -06) initiates the treatment, and study site personnel are not aware of the treatment until afterward), safet y follow -up should be scheduled as soon as possible. Safety follow -up procedures are listed in Table 3. If treatment is discontinued due to an adverse event or serious adverse event, the event(s) must be followed up as described in Table 3. For patients who refuse to come to the clinic for safet y follow- up, telephone contact must be attempted and documented to review for adverse events through approximately 28days after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of new antineoplastic or new investigational therap y, whichever occurs first. If the patient does not respond to telephone calls, the procedures for lost to follow -up in Section 6.7should be followed . 6.6.Long Term Follow up For long -term follow -up procedures see Table 4. This period begins after safet y follow-up and can be conducted b ytelephone unless imaging is required. Long -term follow -up begins after safet y follow- up and continues until the patient dies, withdraws consent or, refuses follow up, or the study is terminated. Radiographic imaging should continue during long- term foll ow-up for patients who discontinue study drug for an y reason other than radiographic progression ,determined b y independent central review ,when the patient has not w ithdrawn consent for follow -up. All known follow -up anticancer therapies have to be enter ed in the CRF.

Following unsuccessful telephone contact, the following should occur: An effort to contact the patient by mail using a method that provides proof of receipt should be attempted ; Alternate contacts are permissible if the patient is not reachable (eg, primary care providers, r eferring phy sician, relatives) ; Such efforts should be documented in the patient’s sour ce documents. If all efforts fail to establish contact, the patient will be considered lost to follow -up. Survival information will be collected from public records if allowed by local laws and regulations. 7.ASSESSMENTS Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol-required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In thes e cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safet y and well -being of the patient . When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study . CT scans/MRI /bone scans will be reviewed b y independent radiologists ( central review ). The purpose of this review is to evaluate images for a ppropriate study endpoints. Cent ral image review is not a complete medical review of the participant and no incidental findings will be shared with the principal investigator (PI), site staff, or the participant. All safety reviews will be the sole respo nsibility of site staff . 7.1. Assessment of Efficacy 7.1.1. Assessment of Primary Efficacy Endpoint: ORR The primary efficacy endpoint is best ORR and the assessment uses standard radiographic methods to evaluate response for soft tissue disease ."

The study assessments of efficacy for these endpoints will include standard radiographic and imaging methods to evaluate disease progression and response, PSA, survival statu s monitoring, pain and quality of life questionnaires, and CTC enumeration. 7.2.1. Assessment of PSA Local laboratory PSA values will be used to determine eligibility for the study at screening (Table 2) including a minim um of 3 consecutive, rising PSA values with an interval of at least 1 week between determinations; values are to be recorded on the CRF. The third PSA may or may not be the central lab screening PSA. (If the screening central lab PSA is lower than local lab PSA #2, then a third local lab PSA may be submitted instead if the PSA measurement is higher than the second local lab PSA .)"

The screening value must be ≥2ng/mL as assessed at the central laboratory if qualify ing solely based on PSA progression . During the study , PSA will be measured at the central laboratory according to the schedule of activities ( Table 3). PSA progression alone should not lead to study drug discontinuation, and study drug administration should continue regardless of PSA increases until radiographic progression is determined by independent central review. PSA progre ssion or response , as determined b y the central lab, must be confirmed at least 21 days later. 7.2.2. Assessment of Survival The survival status of each patient will be monitored during study treatment and after permanent treatment discontinuation for an y reason .Survival status will be documented during long -term follow -up according to the schedule of activities ( Table 4). Thedate and cause of death will be recorded. During the course of the study , the sponsor may request that a survival sweep be conducted to obtain an accurate number of deaths across the study . The sponsor will provide instructions on these survival sweeps immediatel y before they commence as well as a timeline for contacting patients. 7.2.3. Assessment of Circulating Tumor Cells The assessment of CTC swill be performed b y collecting blood samples according to the schedule of activities ( Table 3).CTC count increases alone should not lead to study drug discontinua tion. Details on sample handling and shipping will be provided separately in a laboratory manual. 7.2.4. Assessment of Pa tient Reported Pain The assessment of pain will use the BPI- SF. This questionnaire is a validated instrument that uses a self -reported scal e assessing level of pain, its effect on activities of daily living, and analgesic medication use. This study will use the short form containing 9 main questions related to pain. The primary question (paraphrased) is “On a scale of 0 to 10, please rate your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours.” The questionnaire is provided in Appendix 2.It is important that patients are fluent in reading the language used in the questionnaire and that they complete it wi thout influence of the investigator, study site staff, or any one else. Tracking analgesic use is pa rticularl y important to ensure that the delay in pain progression observed is trul y the result of the treatment being studied rather than the result of an in crease in analgesic use. After the Day 1 visit, pain (assessed using BPI -SF question 3, Appendix 4) and analgesic use (assessed using an analgesic log, Appendix 5) will be collected for each of 7consecutive day s prior to study visits; the timing of collection is shown in Table 3and described in Section 6.3."

Asses sment of Patient -Reported General Health Status The assessment of this patient- reported outcome will use the EQ -5D- 5L. The EQ -5D- 5L questionnaire is a standardized instrument that measures health- related quality of life for men with prostate cancer. Patients will self -rate their current state of mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety /depression by choosing 1 of 5possible responses that record the level of severity (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe probl ems, or extreme problems) within each dimension. The questionnaire also includes a visual analog scale to self- rate general health state on a scale from “the worst health y ou can imagine” to “the best health y ou can imagine.” The EQ -5D- 5L questionnaire i s provided in Appendix 3. On Day 1, patients will complete these questionnaires before the first dose of study drug. At subsequent visits, patients will complete these questionnaires at the site before an y othe r study activities and in the same order at each visit. These questionnaires will be collected according to the schedule of assessments in Section 6.3. 7.3.Assessments of Safety The assessment of safet y will include adverse events, phy sical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests. AE will be graded using CTCAE version 4. 03. The procedures for the investigator assessment of adverse events are presented in detail in Section 8. The procedures for clinical laboratory safet y tests are presented in Section 7.3.1 , and for ph ysical examinations and vital signs in Section 7.3.2 . 7.3.1. Clinical Laboratory Tests Routine clinical laboratory tests (hematology , serum chemistry ) will be performed accor ding to the schedules of activities by the central laboratory (Table 2, Table 3). Central safety laboratory assessments may also be collected as unplanned, at the investig ator’s discretion, or to monitor adverse events or determine if dosing modifications are required. Local safety laboratory assessments may also be performed but should not replace central lab assessments; results from local laboratory assessments are to b e entered in the appropriate CRF. Every effort should be taken to collect samples for central laboratory safet y assessments even if unplanned. Samples will be stored until the specified analy ses are completed and then will be destro yed in accordance with standard laboratory practice and applicable local regulations. A list of the required routine clinical laboratory tests and other evaluations is provided below . All samples for laboratory analy sis must be collected, prepared, labeled, and shipped accord ing to laboratory requirements. All clinical laboratory tests will be performed b y the central laboratory specified in Form FDA 1572 Section 4 unless otherwise specified. The central laboratory reference ranges will be used. Eligibility at screening wil l be based on central laboratory assessments ( preceding local laboratory PSA values will also be required if qualify ing based solel y on PSA progression).

Physical Examinations, Vital Signs, and ECGs The investigator will perform phy sical examinations according to the schedules of activities (Table 2, Table 3). Interval medical history will be reviewed as a part of phy sical examinations. Physical examinations will include an assessment of s ystems (eg, general appearance, head, ey es, ears, nose, mouth, skin, heart, lungs, l ymph nodes, gastrointes tinal, genitourinary , neurologic, and skeletal) per standard of care at the stud y site or as clinically indicated b y symptoms. Weight will be measured at the time of the examination. Height will be measured onl y at screening.

Pharmacokinetic Assessments Blood samples will be collected predose and postdose according to the schedules of activities (Table 3 ). Additional PK blood samples may be collected from patients experiencing unexpected or serious adverse events, or adverse events that lead to discontinuation. Plasma talazoparib concentrations will be measured using a validated method. All efforts will be made to obtain the PK samples at the scheduled nominal time relative to dosing. However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time AND collected prior to administration of the investigational product on that day (for pre-dose PK samples) will be considered protocol compliant. Patients must be instructed to withhold their daily dose of study drugs on PK sampling days until the pre-dose PK sample collection has been completed. The actual time of the sample collection and the most recent dosing time before and after each collection will be recorded on the CRF. The date of missing dose should also be recorded in the CRF.

These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safety Within 24Hours of Awareness SAE All All Non-serious AE All None Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposureAll (regard less of whether associated with an AE), except occupational exposureExposure during pregnancy, exposure via breastfeeding, occupational exposure (regardless of whether associated with an AE) All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s) w ill be reported as described in the following paragraphs. Events listed in the table above that require reporting to Pfizer Safet y on the CT SAE Report Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigator are to be reported regardless of whether the event is determined by the investigator to be related to an investigational product under study . Inparticular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Pfizer S afety must be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available event information. This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on previously forwar ded reports. I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become immediately aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the event. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate in formation both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE (see the Serious Adverse Events section below). In addition, the investigator may be requested b y Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion. This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF . In general, this will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical a ssessment of the case and independent determination of possible causalit y. An y information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. I n the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings mus t be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . An y pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory data) are to be sent to Pfizer Safet y ONLY upon request ."

I t should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise med ical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information. 8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneous ly reported b y the stud y patient/legally acceptable representative. In addition, each stud y patient/legall y acceptable representative will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a non-leading manner. 8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events ( see also the Permanent Treatment Discontinuation Section) Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. When a patient withdraws from the study or treatment because of an SAE, t he SAE must be recorded on the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the Requirements section above . 8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each patient begins from the time the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained before the patien t’s participation in the study (ie,before undergoing an y study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product . A different repor ting period applies only to pa tients who sign the molecular prescreening consent as described in Section 8.4.5 . For patients who are screen failures, the active collection perio d ends when screen failure status is determined."

Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a patient during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer Safet y on the CT SAE Report Form as of signing of the main informed consent document (ICD)at screening . SAEs occurring in a patient after the active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes awar e of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibil ity of being related to investigational product must be reported to Pfizer Safety .All SAEs of my elodysplastic s yndrome (MDS) or acute m yeloid leukemia (AML) are to be reported to Pfizer Safety irrespective of investigator’s opinion of causality or time o f diagnosis . Follow up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy , SAEs occurring during the above -indicated active collection period must still be reported to Pfizer Safety irrespective of any intervening treatment. 8.1.4.2. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF During the active collecti on period, both non -serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF. Follow -up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. If a pa tient begins a new anticancer therapy , the recording period for non-serious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started; however, SAEs must continue to be recorded on the CRF during the above -indicated active collection period. 8.1.5. Causality Assessment The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicabl e. An investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship s hould be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the sponsor. If the investigato r's causality assessment is “unknown but not related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study records."
81,page_81,"Talazoparib C3441006 (MDV3800 -06) Protocol Amendment 4, 15 Nov 2018 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 82In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements. 8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities AEreporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. 8.2.Definitions 8.2.1. Adverse Events An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study patient administered a product or medi cal device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: Abnormal test findings; Clinically significant signs and sy mptoms; Changes in ph ysical examination findings; Hypersensitivity ; Drug abuse; Drug dependency . Additionally , AEs may include signs and s ymptoms resulting from: Drug overdose; Drug withdrawal; Drug misuse; Drug interactions; Extravasation; Exposure during p regnancy (EDP); Exposure via breastfeeding; Medication error; Occupational exposure."

Disease progression assessed b y measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be reported as AEs. 8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following conditions are met: Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or Test result requires addit ional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or ot her therapy ; and/or Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor. Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an err or does not require recording as an AE. 8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: Results in death; Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect. Or that is considered to be: An important medical event. Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious."
83,page_83,"Talazoparib C3441006 (MDV3800 -06) Protocol Amendment 4, 15 Nov 2018 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 84Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Progression of the malignancy under stud y (including signs and s ymptoms of progression) should not be reported as a n SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the active collection period. Hospitalization due to signs and s ymptoms only of disease progression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the study or within the active col lection period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an AE on the CRF, and as an SAE with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.03) Grade 5 (see the Severit y Assessment section). 8.2.4. Hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent healthcare facility , or any prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit is assessed for medical importance. Hospitalization does not include the following: Rehabilitation facilities; Hospice facilities; Respite care (eg, caregiver relief); Skilled nursing facilities; Nursing homes; Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures). Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory abnormality ); Social admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep); Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);"
84,page_84,"Talazoparib C3441006 (MDV3800 -06) Protocol Amendment 4, 15 Nov 2018 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 85Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by the stud y protocol); Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective cosmetic surgery ); Hospitalization for observati on without a medical AE; Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures. These should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient; Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products. Diagnosti c and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not be reported as SAEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 8.3.Severity Assessment The investigator will use the following definitions of seve rity in accordance with the current CTCAE version (4.03) to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event. GRADE Clinical Description of Severit y 1 MILD adverse event 2 MODERATE adverse event 3 SEVERE adverse event 4 LIFE -THREATENING consequence s; urgent intervention indicated 5 DEATH RELATED TO adverse event Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above."
85,page_85,"Talazoparib C3441006 (MDV3800 -06) Protocol Amendment 4, 15 Nov 2018 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 868.4.Special Situations 8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study . All SAEs will be reported to Pfizer Safety by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y database. 8.4.2. Potential Cases of Dr ug-Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some patients, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These patients fail to adapt and therefore are ""susceptible"" to progressive and serious liver injury , commonly referred to as drug -induced liver injury (DILI). Patients who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more f requently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 × ULN) b y several days or weeks. The increase in TBili ty picall y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 × ULN ( ie,AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample). In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values mi ght have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been e xcluded. The threshold of laborator y abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Patients who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases to def initivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: Patients with AST/AL T and TBi libaseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value >2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2×ULN or not available; For patients with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline: Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values > 2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is smaller);"
86,page_86,"Talazoparib C3441006 (MDV3800 -06) Protocol Amendment 4, 15 Nov 2018 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 87Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches >3× ULN (whichever is sma ller). Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The patient should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment. In add ition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneou s analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology . A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history , sexual history , travel history , history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of A ST/AL T and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternat ive etiology . 8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Although this study will be conducted exclusively in male patients, it is theoreticall y possible for female partners to be exposed to study drug during pregnancy . Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness."

Exposure During Pregnancy For both unapproved/ unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if: A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigati onal product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products); A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is ex posed during his partner’s pregnancy ; If a patient or patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant and ha s been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safet y using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investiga tor will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can be assess ed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure tes t findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs."

In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the i nvestigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product; Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator mus t document in the source documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. 8.4.3.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding In female partners of study patients, scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved f or use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.4.3.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study , the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. 8.4.4. Medication Errors Other exposures to the investigational product under study may occur in clinical trial settings , such as medication errors."

Repor ting AEs and/or Research -Related Injuries for Patients Who Sign the Molecular Prescreening Consent This section is applicable only to those subjects for whom new tissue or blood sampling needs to be obtained at prescreening. For these patients, the re is a ninformed consent specifically for these procedures that is completely separate from the study informed consent. The investigator must obtain information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for c lassification as a research- related injury requiring immediate notification to Pfizer as described below. 8.4.5.1. Adverse Events Any AE that occurs from the time the patient undergoes a procedure to obtain de novo tissue or blood through and including 14 days upon completion of said procedure ,must be recorded. The investigator is required to assess whether the AE may be related to the patient’s participation in the study . Record adverse events on the CRF from the time the patient undergoes a procedure to obtain tissue or blood through until 14 days after completion of said procedure. 8.4.5.2. Research -Related Injuries Should a patient, in the investigator’s opinion, suffer a medicall y important research -related injury caused b y their participation in the study ,the desig nated Pfizer clinician must be notified immediately . A medicall y important research -related injury is any untoward medical occurrence that: Results in death; Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect. Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in de termining whether an injury is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization.

DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS Detailed methodology for summary and statisti cal anal yses of the data collected in this study is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical anal ysis plan ( SAP), which will be maintained by the sponsor. The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 9.1.Statistical and Analysis Plans The statistical methods and anal yses for this study will be described in detail in the statistical analysis plan. Three analy ses are planned, including an initial safet y anal ysis/efficacy analysis followed by two efficacy anal yses. The initial safety /efficacy analy sis will be performed after 20patients with measurable soft tissue disease and DDR deficiencies likely to sensitize to PARP inhibitor therap y have received the study drug for at least 8 weeks. Efficacy analyses of the primary endpoint will also be performed when 60and 100 patients have completed at least 6 months of study treatment or are no longer being followed (ie ,have withdrawn consent, discontinued from the study , died, or are otherwise lost to follow -up). 9.2.Analysis Populations The DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population is defined as all enrolled patients who have measurable soft tissue d isease at screening by ICR, have DDR deficiencies likely to sensitize to PARP inhibitor therap y and receive at least one dose of talazoparib. The DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population will be used for all baseline characteristics summaries and effic acy analy ses. Summaries and listings of efficacy and baseline data for patients that were enrolled under previous protocol versions and who are not part of the DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population will be described in the statistical analy sis plan. The safet y population is defined as all patients who receive at least one dose of talazoparib. The safet y population will be used for all safet y analyses. The PK population is defined as all patients from the safet y analysis set who have at least 1reportable drug concentratio n data point."
92,page_92,"Talazoparib C3441006 (MDV3800-06) Protocol Amendment 4, 15 Nov 2018 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 93The PRO population is defined as all patients from the DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population who have completed a baseline and at least one post-baseline PRO assessment prior to the end of study treatment. The CTC evaluable population is defined as all patients with a baseline CTC assessment and at least 1 post-baseline CTC assessment from the DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population. 9.3. Efficacy Analyses 9.3.1. Primary Efficacy Analyses The primary study objective is to evaluate efficacy as measured by the primary endpoint best ORR. The best ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall soft tissue response of CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 by independent central review. Soft tissue responses will be confirmed by a follow-up radiographic assessment at least 4 weeks later with a repeated CT or MRI with no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression on repeat bone scan at least 6 weeks later per PCWG3 criteria by independent central review. ORR will be summarized along with the 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method ( Clopper-Pearson; 1934 ). Analyses based on assessment by the investigator will also be performed. 9.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Analyses The following efficacy parameters will be evaluated. 9.3.2.1. Time to Objective Response The time from first dose of talazoparib to the first documented objective evidence of soft tissue response with no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression on bone scan per PCWG3. Soft tissue response is defined as a best overall response of CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 by independent central review. The response must be confirmed at least 4 weeks later with a repeated CT/MRI. Analyses will include the patients from the DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population who achieve a confirmed CR or PR without documentation of confirmed bone progression. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles) will be provided. Analyses based on assessment by the investigator will also be performed. 9.3.2.2. Duration of Response The duration of response is defined as the time from the first objective evidence of soft tissue response (subsequently confirmed) per RECIST 1.1 by independent central review and no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression per PCWG3 to the first subsequent objective evidence of radiographic progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Radiographic progression is defined as soft tissue progression per RECIST 1.1 by CCI"

Details on the conventions for censoring will be presented in the statistical analy sis plan. Anal yses will include the patients from the DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population who achieve a confirmed CR or PR without documentation of confirmed bone progression. Duration of response will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and 95% CI for median time will be calculated using the Brookmey er-Crowley method (Brookmey er & Crowley, 1982 ). Anal yses based on assessment by the investigator will also be performed. 9.3.2.3. Proportion of Patients With PSA Response 50% PSA response will be calculated as a decline from baseline PSA (ng/mL) by at least 50% measured b y central laboratory . A PSA response must be confirmed b y a second consecutive value at least 3 weeks later. Patients without a baseline and at least one post baseline PSA assessment will not be analy zed for this endpoint. Only assessments performed from the date of first dose of stud y treatment until confirmed PSA progression or start of new anticancer treatment given after the first dose of study treatment wi ll be considered. The proportion of patients in the DDR Deficient Measurable Disease population with confirmed PSA decline ≥50% compared to baseline will be calculated along with the 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method (Clopper -Pearson; 1934 ). 9.3.2.4. CTC Count Conversion Rate The CTC count conversion rate will be defined as the proportion of patients with a CTC count ≥5 CTC per 7.5 mL of blood at study entry that decreases to <5 CTC per 7.5 mL of blood any time on study . CTC counts <5 CTC per 7.5 mL of blood will be considered favorable and CTC counts ≥5 CTC per 7.5 mL of bl ood will be considered unfavorable. The conversion rate will be calculated along with the 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method (Clopper -Pearson; 1934 ). Patients with a CTC count <5 per 7.5 mL of blood at baseline are not analy zed for this conversion endpoint, though they are included in continuous summaries. In addition, the proportion of patients with a CTC count of 1 or more (detectable) per 7.5 mL of blood at study entry that decreased to CTC=0 (undetectable) per 7.5 mL of blood an ytime on study will be assessed. The conversion rate will be calculated along with the 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method ( Clopper -Pearson; 1934 ). Patients with a CTC count of 0 per 7.5 mL of blood at baselin e are not anal yzed for this conversion endpoint, though they are included in continuous summaries. The proportion of patients with baseline CTC counts <5 who show increased CTC counts post -baseline will also be assessed. 9.3.2.5. Time to PSA Progression The time to PSA progression is defined as the time from first dose of talazoparib to the date that a ≥25% increase in PSA with an absolute increase of ≥2μg/L (2ng/mL) above the nadir (or baseline for patients with no PSA decline) is documented, confirmed by a sec ond consecutive PSA value obtained ≥3weeks (21 days) later. Kaplan -Meier estimates will be presented together with a summary of associated statistics including the median and quartiles with two- sided 95% CIs. Conventions for censoring will be presented in the statistical analysis plan."

Radiographic PFS Radiographic PFS is defined as the time from first dose of talazoparib to radiographic progression in soft tissue per RECI ST 1.1 by independent central review, in bone per PCWG3 by independent central re view, or death due to any cause , whichever occurs first. Details on the conventions for censoring PFS will be presented in the statistical anal ysis plan. Radiographic PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method; the 95% CI for median time will be calculated using the Brookmey er-Crowley method ( Brookmeyer & Crowley , 1982 ). Anal yses based on assessment by the investigator will also be performed. 9.3.2.7. Overall Survival Overall survival is defined as the time from first dos e of talazoparib to death due to any cause. Details on the conventions for censoring will be presented in the statistical analy sis plan. Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to estimate overall survival. The 95% CI for median overall survival time will be calculated using the Brookmey er-Crowley method (Brookmey er & Crowley, 1982 ). 9.3.2.8. Patient Reported Pain Pain assessed b y the BPI -SF will be summarized using descriptive statistics by study visit . Patient-reported outcomes assessm ents will be analy zed using the PRO population. Missing items will be handled per the scoring manuals of each questionnaire administered. Deterioration in pain is defined as 2-point increase from baseline using question 3 of the BPI-SF. Additional pain and analgesic assessments will be completed for 7 consecutive day s before stud y visits. Four or more completed daily pain reports at each reporting time period are required for a patient to be considered evaluable. Pain score averages during each report ing period will be calculated. In order to adequatel y measure pain, it is equally important to adequatel y track analgesic use to ensure that the pain palliation observed is not the result of an increase in analgesic use but rather the effect of the antitum or treatment being studied. Analgesic data (from the analgesic log) will be mapped to the WHO analgesic usage score and used concurrently to define pain progression with the BPI SF ( Basch E et al, 2013 ). Time to deterioration in pain will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method and will include the median and 95% CI s based on the Brookmey er-Crowley method . Longitudinal mixed effects model analy ses will be used to assess change from baseline in pain sy mptoms. 9.3.2.9. Patient -Reported General Health Status (and Health Index) A patient -reported general health status assessed by the EQ -5D- 5L will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Longitudinal mixed effects model anal yses will be used to assess change from baseline in general he alth status. In addition, there will be a health status profile analysis consisting of a display of the number and percentage of patients in each of the 5response levels for each of the 5 dimensions at each visit."

Safety Analyses All safety analyses will be performed using the safety population, defined as all patients who receive any amount of any study drug. Drug exposure will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Treatment-emergent safety data will be collected from the first dose of study treatment through 28 days after the last dose (ie, permanent discontinuation) of study drug or before initiation of new antineoplastic or investigational therapy, whichever occurs first. The safety of talazoparib will be evaluated by the analysis of incidence of serious and nonserious adverse events, severity of adverse events, incidence of dose modifications and of permanent treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, and incidence of new clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory values and vital signs. Adverse events will be coded to preferred term and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and classified by severity using the CTCAE, version 4.03. The number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study treatment, and severity. Descriptive statistics will be used. Laboratory values will be classified by severity using the CTCAE, version 4.03. Laboratory shift tables of baseline to maximum postbaseline results to each subsequent visit will be produced as appropriate. 9.5. Pharmacokinetic Analyses PK data analyses will include descriptive summary statistics of the predose and postdose plasma concentrations of talazoparib by study visit. In addition, the PK data from this study may be used to develop a population PK model. CCI CCI"

Interim Analysis The study is designed to have an initial an alysis for safety and efficacy and an interim analysis for efficacy .The initial analy sis will be performed after 20 patients from the DDR deficient measurable disease population receive study treatment for at least 8 weeks. The subsequent interim anal ysis will be performed when 60 patients form the DDR deficient measurable disease population complete at least 6 months of study treatment or are otherwise no longer being followed (ie, have, withdrawn consent, discontinued from the study , died, or are other wise lost to follow -up). An interim anal ysis with at least 60 patients is planned and if the observed best ORR is ≥23%, the lower bound of the corresponding exact 2- sided 95% CI would exclude <13%. With 60 patients, the ORR can be estimated with a maximum standard error of 6.6%. Table 15provides the exact binomial 95% CI for ORR for 60 patients based on different observed responses. Table 15.

The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This verification may also occur after study completion. During stud y conduct and/or after stud y completion, the invest igator site may be subject to review b y the IRB/EC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. The investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, w henever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y data and the patient's medical records. The investigator will promptl y provide cop ies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings. It is importan t that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING 11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Rec ord As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study . A CRF is required and should be completed for each included pa tient. The completed original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer."
98,page_98,"Talazoparib C3441006 (MDV3800 -06) Protocol Amendment 4, 15 Nov 2018 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 99The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are true. An y correc tions to entries made in the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the original entry . In most cases, the source documents are the hospital or the ph ysician patient chart. In these cases, da ta collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator site and at Pfizer that clearl y identifies those data that will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 11.2. Data Protection All parties will comply with all applicable laws, including laws regarding the implementation of organizational and technical measures to ensure protection of participant data. Participants’ personal data will be stored at the study site in encry pted electronic and/or paper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to ensure that only authorized study staff has access. The stud y site will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data can be recovered in the event of disaster. In the event of a potential personal data breach, the study site shall be responsible for determining whether a persona l data breach has in fact occurred and, if so, providing breach notifications as required by law. To protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, participants will be assigned a single, participant spec ific numerical code. Any participant records or data sets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the numerical code; participant names will not be transferred. All other identifiable data transferred to the sponsor will be identified by this si ngle, participant specific code. The study site will maintain a confidential list of participants who participated in the study , linking each participant’s numerical code to his or her actual identity . In case of data transfer, the sponsor will protect t he confidentiality of participants’ personal data consistent with the clinical study agreement and applicable privacy laws. 11.3. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to k eep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, source documents, and det ailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records s hould be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guid elines, according to loca l regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer."

The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another institution, or an independent third party arranged by Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years afte r completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations. The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, even if retention requirements have been met. 12.ETHICS 12.1. Instituti onal Review Board/Ethics Committee It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable , from the I RB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file. Copies of I RB/EC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is where th e change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the implementation. 12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in a ccordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory requirements , and the general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002 ), ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of Helsinki. 12.3. Patient Information and Consent All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names or other identifiable data in any reports, publicati ons, or other disclosures, except where required b y law. When study data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, patient names, addresses, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y numerical codes based on a numbering s ystem provided by Pfizer in order to de -identify study patients. The investigator site will maintain a confidenti al list of patients who participated in the study , linking each patient’s numerical code to his or her actual identity . In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confid entialit y and protection of patients’ personal data consistent with applicable privacy laws."

The informed consent documents used during the informed consent process and any patient recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by Pfizer, approved by the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection. The investigator must ensure that each study patients fully informed about the nature and objectives of the stud y and possible risks associated with participation. Whenever consent is obtained from a patient’s legally acceptable representative or legal guardian, the patient’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the patient has the capacity to provide assent, as determined by the IRB/EC . If the investigator determines that a patient’s deci sional capacity is so limited he/she cannot reasonabl y be consulted, then, as permitted b y the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory and legal requirements, the patient’s assent may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not obtained. If the study patient does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents must record wh y the patient did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient’s legally acceptable representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study patient (eg, parent, spouse), and that the patient’s assent was obtained or waived. If assent is obtained verball y, it must be documented in the source docume nts. The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each patient before an y study -specific activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each patient's signed consent document. 12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable regulatory authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of an y new information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately . In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safet y measures taken b y the inves tigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of. 13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL 13.1. End of Trial in a Member State End of trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is deemed that a sufficient number of patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the regulatory application (ie, clinical trial application [CTA]) and ethics application in the Member State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal conclusion to the study in that Member State."

End of Trial in All Other Partic ipating Countries End of trial in all [other] participating countries is defined as last patient last visit (L PLV). 14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinio n of the IRB/EC, or investigational product safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of talazoparib at an y time. If a stud y is prematurel y terminated, Pfizer will promptly notify theinvestigator. After notification, the investigator must contact all participating patients and the hospital pharmacy (if applicable) as quickl y as is practical. As directed by Pfizer, all study materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the g reatest extent possible. 15.PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS 15.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the E uropean Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with appli cable local laws/regulations. In all cases, stud y results are reported b y Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and complete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in which the study was conducted. www.clinicaltrials.gov Pfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.gov for Pfizer -sponsored interventional studies (conducted i n patients) that evaluate the safet y and/or efficacy of a Pfizer product, regardless of the geographical location in which the study is cond ucted. US Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the primary completion date (PCD) for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the PCD for studies in pediatric populations. PCD is defined as the date that the final patient was examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary outcome, whether the clinical study concluded according to the prespecified protocol or was terminated. EudraCT Pfizer posts European Union (EU) Basic Results on EudraCT for all Pfizer -sponsored interventional studies that are in scope of EU requirements. EU Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the PCD for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the PCD for studies in pediatric populations."

Publications by Investigators Pfizer supports the exercise of academic freedom and has no objection to publication by the principal investigator ( PI) of the results of the study based on information collected or generated b y the PI, whether or not the results are favorable to the Pfizer produ ct. However, to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or unprotected inventions, the investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity to review any proposed publication or other t ype of disclosure of the results of the study (co llectively , “publication”) before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed. The investigator will provide any publication to Pfizer at least 30 days before it is submitted for publication or otherwise disclosed. If an y patent action is required to protect intellectual propert y rights, the investigator agrees to delay the disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days. The investigator will, on request, remove an y previously undisclosed confidential information before disclosure, except for an y study-or Pfizer product -related information necessary to the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the study results. If the stud y is part of a multicenter study, the investigator agrees that the first publication is to be a joint publica tion covering all investigator sites, and that an y subsequent publications by the PI will reference that primary publication. However, if a joint manuscript has not been submitted for publication within 12 months of completion or termination of the study at all participating sites, the investigator is free to publish separatel y, subject to the other requirements of this section. For all publications relating to the stud y, the institution will comply with recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II -“Ethical Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, established by the Internati onal Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Publication of study results is also provided for in the CSA between Pfizer and the institution. I n this section entitled Publications by Investigators, the defined terms shall have the meanings given to them in the CSA. If there is an y conflict between the CSA and an y attachments to it, the terms of the CSA control.
