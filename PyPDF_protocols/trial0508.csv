Patient symptomatic endpoints will form the basis for the assessment of treatment benefit of nasal polyp therapies. Currently, there is a lack of published qualitative data regarding nasal polyps to understand the symptoms (specific sympt oms, duration, frequency, severity) or health-related qualit y of life (HRQoL) impacts for patients, as well as the patient decision-making process in electing for surgery and their pr e- and post-surgical experience to treat nasal polyps. In li ne with regulatory requirements, 1,2 the patient experience of nasal polyps will need to be characterized. Additionally, there is a requirement to evaluate existing symptomatic endpoints with respect to relevance and comprehensiveness within this population to inform GSK’s clinical outcome assessment (COA) strategy for this trial. To address this unmet need GSK would like to conduct a qualitative research study with adult patients with nasal polyps to explore the disease experienc e from the patient perspective and to debrief existing symptomatic PROs (including overall and single item VAS’s and the SNOT- 22), via patient interviews and real-time data capture. This pr otocol details the methods and procedures that will be used in t he conduct of this study. Objectives (Primary, Secondary) Primary To explore the symptom, impact and surgery experience of patients with severe, recurrent nasal polyps and obtain patient feedback regarding the adequacy of the SNOT-22 and GSK VAS assessments (in terms of relevance and comprehensiveness) in assessing disease experience in nasal polyps. Secondary Combined concept elicitation (CE) and cognitive debriefing (CD) interviews Concept elicitation objectives:"
4,page_4,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 5 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 To identify through open-ended ques tioning the concepts that are important to patients with se vere, recurrent, nasal polyps, who have been treated with surger y and the language they use to describe their disease experience. The main areas of exploration will be the symptoms with particula r attention paid to the frequency, severity, durati on and bother of each symptom, patients’ surgical decision-making and surgical/treatment experience and the functional an d HRQoL impact experienced by patients. Cognitive debriefing objectives: To cognitively test and explore t he content and face validity of existing PRO instruments (single item VAS and SNOT-22) via assessment of the relevance and appropriateness of the items included in the instruments and the participants’ ability to read, and consistently understand the in strument item wording, instructions, response opt ion and recall period. Real-time data capture app To explore the patient expe rience of the symptoms, HRQoL impacts and treatment of nasal polyps and any day-to-day variability that exists in these experiences in ‘real time’ using smartphone/tablet app based technology. Study Design This is a cross-secti onal qualitative study comprising the conduct of semi-structured combined CE and CD telephone interviews (each 120 minutes in duration) with US (n=20) and German (n=10) adults with severe, recurrent nasal polyps. The combined CE and CD interviews aim to investigate the patient experience of nasal polyps, and the relevance and understanding of existing PRO instruments (e.g. VAS and SNOT-22).In addition to the intervie w, the study includes a real- time data capture task conducted with 10 of the 20 US participants over a 10-day period using smartphone/tablet app- based technology. Five of the ten participants (50%) will take part in the app task prior to their interview and the remaining five participants (50%) will take part in the app task following their interview. This study will be conducted by Adelphi Values, an independent research agency specializing in health outcomes research, on behalf of GSK. Study Population and Sampling Methods A sample of 20 US-English speaking patients and 10 German patients will be recruited, giving a collective sample of 30 patients. Recruitment wil l be facilitated by third-party vendors in"

7,page_7,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 8 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 Data Source This study will consist of combined concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing interviews, which will last for 120 minutes in total. All participants (20 parti cipants from the US and 10 participants from Germany) will all complete these interviews. Ten of the 20 US participants ( 50%) will also complete a 10-day real-time data capture app ta sk and provide feedback about their experience of co mpleting this task. No endpoints are specified or f eature as part of this study. Data Analysis Methods Descriptive socio-demographic a nd clinical characteristics Socio-demographic and clinical c haracteristics for participant collected from the demographics form and CRF respectively will be summarized using descriptive st atistics (e.g. n vales, means, ranges, percentages etc. where relevant). Analysis of interviews All interviews will be audio-recorded, and along with audio real- time data capture app task responses, transcribed/translated verbatim. Transcripts will be analyzed using thematic analysis methods and qualitatively coded us ing Atlas.Ti software. The Adelphi Values project team will create the initial code list, and each transcript would be assessed and participant comments that pertain to the main resear ch questions would be highlighted The code list will be updated it eratively during the coding process. The CE interview data will be analyzed in accordance with the principle of conceptual sa turation as fully outlined in section 4. Descriptive statistics for the SNOT-22 and visual analogue scales The data collected from the SNOT-22 and visual analogue scales during the CD interview will be scored by Adelphi Values and summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g., n values, mean scores, ranges and percentages ). Information relating to the distribution of responses wi ll be summarized in addition to any missing data. The data will be presented in tabular or graphical format, whichever is deemed most appropriate at the time of reporting the findings. Real-time data capture analysis"
8,page_8,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 9 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 Responses to the real-time dat a capture data will be collected using a variety of methodologie s (e.g., video, audio, text and photographic responses with captions). For audio responses these will be transcribed. Participants’ responses to questions/tasks in the real-time data capture activity and post-activ ity questions administered via telephone will be analyzed in the same way using Atlas.Ti for the qualitative interviews as outlined above. Video, free text photographic and transcribed audio responses will be entered into Atlas Ti and assigned codes in the same manner as the verbatim interview transcripts to tag/code what their content conveys. For any questions/tasks fielded to participants as part of the app with multiple choice or numerical responses options, descriptive analysis of t hese items will be performed and reported (e.g. mean item score, ranges etc.). The interview and app task results will be used to inform the further development of a conceptual model for nasal polyps, previously constructed based on lit erature review activity only. The qualitative analysis will also be used help summarize the content validity of the revi ewed PRO instruments and their suitability for use with pat ients with nasal polyps. Sample Size and Power Where the goal of qualitative research is to provide comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena (e.g. the holistic experience disease from the patient/caregiver perspective), it is recomm ended that sample sizes are determined based on the concept of ‘conceptual saturation’ where no new concepts are identified with repeated data collection. Past research and experience suggests that conceptual saturation can typically be achieved in as few as 12 individual interviews in a relatively homogenous population. 3,4 Taking the above into account, a total of 20 participants from the US and a total of 10 from Germany will be interviewed (total sample= 30). Limitations As the study has been designed using best practice methodology advocated by the Food and Drug Administration for exploratory qualitative studies used to support clinical measurement strategies, the fo reseen risk/limitations of the study are minimal but include the following:"
9,page_9,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 10 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017  Selection of participants : potential bias is always possible when selecting interviewees; however, as outlined in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 eligibility criteria and recruitment quotas will be employed to ensure the participant sample is as diverse and representative as possible given the overall study size (n=30).  Generalizability of data : The participant sample (n=30) is relatively small as the planned research is primarily exploratory in nature. The sa mple size is typical of qualitative studies conducted in this context. Nevertheless, the findings obt ained from the participant interviews cannot be extrapol ated or generalized to the wider population with nasal polyps; however, they will be relevant to GSK target nasal polyp population for their planned Phase III clinical trial.  Real-time data capture : The eligibility criteria for the real-time data capture task and information included within the consent form (A ppendix 5) will aim to ensure that those participants who take part in this activity are willing to take part over a per iod of ten days and that they would feel comfortable in providing responses using a variety of methods including video, audio, photographic and/or free text responses. As this methodology is exploratory and ethnographic in nature the quality of completion and the comprehensiveness of participant responses cannot be guaranteed. This said however, the participants will be contactable both via the app and also via email and/or telephone dur ing the completion of the app task and as such the project researchers will endeavor to encourage the completion of all task in as thorough manner as possible (e.g. provide reminders to participants to complete their task or probes/examples if they are unsure of how to respond to a task/question).  Conceptual saturation: Whilst conceptual saturation can typically be achieved in a sample of 12 in a relatively homogenous population, a potent ial limitation of the study is that conceptual saturation is not achieved across the 20 interviews. Should conceptual saturation not be achieved, discussion will be held with GSK to determine whether additional interviews should be conducted in"

14,page_14,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 15 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 1 INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND Nasal polyps is considered to be a subgroup of chronic rhinosinusitis and is defined as a chronic inflammatory disease of the nose and sinuses.5 Nasal polyps is characterized by the presence of two or mo re of the following symptoms: watery rhinorrhea from the nose (anterior), postnasal drainage (posterior ), nasal obstruction and a temporary or in extreme cases permanent decreased sense of smell (anosmia).6 The standard of care for patients with severe nasal polyps includes intranasal steroids, oral corticosteroids and surgery. However, there ar e currently no established crit eria for surgery; candidacy for surgery is considered on the basis of le vel of nasal obstruction, symptom severity, impacts to the patient and the per ceived risks/benefits of surgery. The patient experience of nasal polyps is ty pically assessed via clinical interview and review of clinical history and the use of existing patient-reported outcome instruments (PROs). PRO instruments used with patients with nasal polyps typically include single item visual analogue scales (VAS), whereby patients are asked to evaluate overall symptom severity, or the severity of i ndividual symptoms of nasal polyps along a continuum, typically of 10cm or 100 mm wh ereby 0 represents ‘no symptom’ and ’10 or 100 represents ‘as bad as you can imagine’, Scores of 0-3 (or 0-30) are defined as mild disease, >3-7 (or >30-70) as moderate disease and >7-10 (or >70-100) as severe disease.5 Historically, these items hav e not been developed based on patient characterization and therefore there is a need to understand the appropriateness of these measures for use within this populatio n. The Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test (SNOT- 22) is also used frequently within clinical re search and as a clinical trial endpoint to measure health-related quality of life associated with rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps. The SNOT-22, a derivative of the SNOT-20, is a modification of the 31-Item Rhinosinusitis Outcome Measure (RSOM), containing 22 nose, sinus, and general health-related quality of life (HRQ oL) items. Within the SNOT -22 patients are required to indicate the level of to which each listed nasal, sinus or HRQoL experience has been affected on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (No problem) to 5 (Problem as bad as it can be) and also identify the five most im portant items affecting their health. 7 Existing evidence supports the psychometric valid ity of the SNOT- 22 among patients with rhinosinusitis; with evidence of high reliability and sensitivity to clinical change.8 Preliminary searches, however , suggest that evidence regardi ng the content validity of the SNOT-22 may be lacking. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is embarking on a cl inical program to assess treatment of severe, recurrent nasal polyps with an ant i-interleukin-5 (ant i-IL5) (mepolizumab). Patient symptomatic endpoints will form the basis for t he assessment of treatment benefit of nasal polyp therapies. Currently, there is a lack of published qualitative data regarding nasal polyps to understand the sym ptoms (specific symptoms, duration,"
15,page_15,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 16 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 frequency, severity) or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impacts fo r patients, as well as the patient decision-making process in electing for surgery and their pre- and post- surgical experience to treat nasal polyp s. In line with regulatory requirements,1,2 the patient experience of nasal polyps will need to be characterized. Additionally, as described above, there is a requirement to evaluate existing symptomatic endpoints with respect to relevance and comprehensiveness within this population to inform GSK’s clinical outcome assessment (C OA) strategy for this trial. To address this unmet need GSK would like to conduct a qualitative research study with adult patients with nasal polyps to explore the disease experience from the patient perspective and to debrief existing symptomatic PROs (including overall and single item VAS’s and the SNOT-22), via patient interv iews and real-time dat a capture. This protocol details the methods and procedures that will be used in the conduct of this study. 2 OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary To explore the symptom, im pact and surgery experience of patients with severe, recurrent nasal polyps and obtain patient feedback regarding the adequacy of the SNOT-22 and GSK VAS assessments (in term s of relevance and comprehensiveness) in assessing disease experience in nasal polyps. 2.2 Secondary Combined concept elicitation (CE) and cognitive debriefing (CD) interviews: To identify through open-ended questioning t he concepts that ar e important to patients with severe, recurrent, nasal polyps, who have been treated with surgery and the language they use to describe their disease experience. The main areas of exploration will be the sym ptoms with particular attent ion paid to the frequency, severity, duration and bother of each sympt om, patients’ surgical decision-making and surgical/treatment experience and the functional and HRQoL impact experienced by patients. To cognitively test and explore the cont ent and face validity of existing PRO instruments (single item VAS and SNOT-22) via assessment of the relevance and appropriateness of the items included in the instruments and the participants’ ability to read, and consistently under stand the instrument item wording, instructions, response option and reca ll period. The CD interviews will:"
16,page_16,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 17 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017  Explore participants’ ability to read and consistently understand the item wording, instructions, response options and recall period of the overall and single item VAS and SNOT-22. • Explore the relevance and appropriatene ss of all of the items covered by the instruments based on the symptom experience of patients with nasal polyps. • Verify if the key concepts identified in the concept elicitation phase of the study are adequately assessed by the PRO instruments (confirmation of face validity) and if any gaps exist, provide recommendations for how these could be addressed.  Explore what level of change in symptoms and/or impacts the patients might consider meaningful. (E.g. what level of change they might consider noticeable and import ant in response to treatment, and how changes on the item scores might relate to changes in their experience in their symptoms and/or functional impacts. Real-time data capture application: To supplement the CE section of the interv iews with additional data regarding the patient experience of nasal polyps in ‘real time’ using smartphone/tablet app based technology. Real-time data captur e uses a smart-phone or web-based application allowing t he patient to communicate about their experience of nasal polyps in real-time as they go about thei r daily lives via varying video, audio, photographic and text responses. Real-time data capture will be used to fi eld a series of questions/tasks to patients with nasal polyps to:  Explore the patient experience of the symptoms, HRQoL impacts and treatment of nasal polyps and any day-t o-day variability that exists in these experiences in ‘real time’. Note: This is a low-interventional study – participants will not be asked to change their treatment as par t of this study. 3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 3.1 Study Design This is a cross-sectional qualitative study comprising the conduct of semi-structured combined CE and CD telephone interviews (eac h 120 minutes in duration) conducted in with US and German adults with severe, recu rrent nasal polyps. In addition to the interview, the study includes a real-time data capture task conducted with US participant only over a 10-day period using smar tphone/tablet app-based technology. The combined CE and CD interviews aim to inve stigate the patient experience of nasal"
17,page_17,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 18 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 polyps, and the relevance and understanding of existing PRO instruments (e.g. VAS and SNOT-22). A total of 20 adult participants from the US with severe, recurrent, nasal polyps, who have received nasal polyp removal surgery in the past 10 years, will participate in the study as well as 10 patients of the same c haracteristic in Germany. In qualitative research, sample size estimation is based on projections of the num ber of participants needed to reach conceptual saturation (i.e., the point in the data collection process after which no new information is elicited). Past evidence in the literature suggests that conceptual saturation can be achieved in as few as 12 individual interviews in a relatively homogenous population.7,8 As such, it is anticipated that conceptual saturation will be achieved within 20 interviews. This study comprises two qualitative research activities outlined in the sections below: combined CE and CD qualitative interv iews and real-tim e data capture. Combined CE and CD interviews (120 minutes) Twenty participants for the US and 10 from Ge rmany (total sample= 30 participants) will be invited to part in combined CE and CD interviews. The CE component of the interview will explore participants’ experienc e of living with severe, recurrent nasal polyps with particular focus on participants’ symptoms, impacts and treatment/surgical experiences relating to their condition and the terminology used to describe their experiences. Following CE, participants will complete the CD component of the interview. Participants will complete the existing PRO instruments (overall symptom VAS, single item VAS and SNOT-22) as part of a ‘think aloud’ process in which they will be asked to speak aloud their thoughts as th ey read the instructions and complete the questions. Participants will also be probed upon their experience of completing the instruments/items and the relevance and participant underst anding of the instrument items, instructions, recall period and res ponse options. Further details regarding the conduct of the combined CE and CD interv iews are provided in section 3.3. Real-time data capture application (10 days) All 20 US patients will be invited to take part in an app-based real world data capture activity. It is anticipated that of the 20 inte rview participants, a su b-set of ten will meet the inclusion criteria for this task. Therefore, the first ten patients to meet the cr iteria will make up the sample for this task. Five of the ten participants (50%) will take part in the app task prior to their interview and the remaining five participants (50%) will take part in the app task following their interview. Using this methodology, identified participants will be asked to download an app to their smartphone or tablet. Data capture will be conducted over a 10 day period and during this time participants will receive a series of questions/tasks via the application t hat they can response to in real-time, designed to"
18,page_18,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 19 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 explore the experience of nasal polyps. The task will aim to explore the patient experience of the symptoms, HRQoL impacts and treatment of nasal polyps and any day-to-day variability that exists in these experiences in ‘real time’. Participants will be able to provide responses to the questions/ta sks fielded to them using a variety of methodologies including video, audio, text and photographic responses with captions. Further details regarding c onduct of the real-time data application component are provided in section 3.3. 3.2 Study Population Twenty adult participants in the US, and 10 participants in Germany with severe, recurrent nasal polyps who have received nasal polyp surgery in the past 10 years prior to screening will take part in this study. Of these 30 participant s, 10 of the 20 US participants (50%) will also complete the real-time data capture app task. The real-time data capture app task will not be conducted in Germany. MedQuest Global, a recruitment agency, will assist in recruiting participants from a minimum of two geographically diverse sites in the US (e.g., East Coast, West Coast, Southern states). Zeste, a recruitment agency in Germany will assist with the recruitment of the German sample across 1-2 sites. Both agencies will recruit participants using the same methodology outlined below. Participants will be recruited through a combinat ion of primary care physicians/general practitioners and ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists. Physicians will identify suitable participants for the study using the case report form (CRF) (Appendix 4). Participants identified by their physician will be provi ded with two copies of the information and consent form (ICF) to read and sign to indica te informed consent/assent if they wish to participate in the study (Appendi x 5) – one for the participant to keep and one that the recruitment agency will send to AV. Participan ts will be given the opportunity to consider the information provided in the ICF and to ask the recruitment agencies/recruiting physician or AV any questions about the ICF bef ore providing their informed consent. If the participant verbally agrees to take part and also signs the ICF, they will be informed that their name and contact information will be passed to the respective recruitment agencies in each country who will contact t hem to screen them into the study and collect demographic information about each participant (Appendix 6), ensuring study quotas are met for obtaining a representative sample as outlined in section 3.2.2. No information will be passed to the recruitment agencies until verbal and informed consent has been obtained from the participant. After informed consent has been obtained, the participant’s physician will release the CRF dat a to the respective recruitment agencies in each country (Appendix 4); confirming that the participant meets the study inclusion requirements, and providing additional info rmation about the participant’s clinical condition and medical history.

Of these 30 participant s, 10 of the 20 US participants (50%) will also complete the real-time data capture app task. The real-time data capture app task will not be conducted in Germany. In addition to meeting the incl usion/exclusion criteria outlin ed in section 3.2.1, AV will employ a purposive approach to sampli ng to ensure patients with a range of demographic, educational and clin ical characteristics are recruited. To achieve representation of dem ographics and clinical characterist ics within the sample, sampling quotas will be employed. Overall sampling quotas for the US are detailed in Table 1 and for Germany outlined in Table 2. German de mographic data is not collected in regards to ethnicity and race separately, and thus, the quotas have been adjust ed to fit the norm in Germany. Quotas may be relaxed if recruitm ent proves challenging. The clinical and demographic information to support the achievement of these quotas will be captured using the clinician-completed case r eport form (CRF) and patient-completed demographic form."

The race category is also simplified in line wh ich what is typically expected in Germany. 3.3 Data Source / Data Collection All recruited participants will take part in a 120-minute telephone interview. A semi- structured interview guide wi ll be used to guide the conduct of the CE interview section and CD interview section and will ensure that all topics of interest are discussed (Appendix 7). The interview guide is designed to be used as a guide, not as a script to be read verbatim. The interviewe r will therefore be flexible in the order of questioning, following the lead of the participant and asking appropriate questions when topics of interest arise. All interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for the purpose of analysis. Any identifiable information (e.g. participant or doctor’s names) will be removed from the transcripts such that they are fully anonymized. Concept elicitation (55 minutes) During the CE section of the interview parti cipants will be asked a series of broad open- ended questions designed to encourage them to talk openly and as spontaneously as possible about their experience of having nasal polyps and how it affects their life. In addition to speaking open-endedly about their experiences, participants will be asked more focused questions designed to probe on i ssues that they may not have mentioned during the course of the interview or concepts/statements that require additional clarification. Asking probe questions in a dynamic and ‘as required’ fashion information will be important for ensuring all study objectives are met and all study questions and topics of interest are explored, thus supporting the identification of the concepts that are most important to patients and the terminology they use to describe their experiences. Cognitive debriefing (60 minutes) During the CD section of the interview participants will be asked to complete the PRO instruments using a ‘think al oud’ process in which they will be asked to speak aloud their thoughts as they read t he instructions, item and co mplete the questions. After completion of each ‘think aloud’ exercise, participants will take part in in-depth CD centered on their experience of completing t he instruments, with particular focus on the relevance and understanding of t he items, instructions, response options and recall period. In addition, the participants will be en couraged to discuss what level of change in their symptoms would they consider m eaningful and important and how this would relate to changes on the items scores. The questionnaires (Appendix 8) that will be used in the cognitive debriefing task will be sent to participants in the mail in advance of their interview by the recruitment agency. Participants will not be required to comple te these until instructed to during the interview. Following the interview, parti cipants will be asked to send the questionnaires"
25,page_25,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 26 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 back to the recruitment agency using a stamped addressed envelope which will be supplied to them. Real-time data capture All 20 US patients will be invited to take part in an app-based real world data capture activity. It is anticipated that of the 20 inte rview participants, a su b-set of ten will meet the inclusion criteria for this task. Five of the ten partici pants (50%) will take part in the app task prior to their interview and the remaining five participants (50%) will take part in the app task following their interview. Elig ible participants will receive instruction and supporting documentation on how to downloa d and access the application via their smartphone or tablet. Participants will be requi red to take part in the real-time data capture exercise over the course of 10 days and during this time a series of approximately 10 questions/tasks wil l be fielded to participant s via the application to explore the experience of the symptoms, HRQoL impacts and treatment of nasal polyps and any day-to-day variability that exists these experienc es in ‘real time’. Some questions/tasks may be issued daily over the 10 days and others may be issued once. Examples of the types of questions that might be asked to participants via the application are documented in Appendix 9. Each task will take no longer than 5-10 minutes to complete and participants will be able to provide responses to the questions/tasks fielded to them using a variety of methodologies including video, audio, text and photographic responses. Once recorded, the participants can submit t heir responses via Wi-Fi or 3/4G and they will become immediately viewable on a res ponse dashboard for the study researchers to track and analyses. The AV research team would be able to interact with participants via the dashboard (e.g. add new tasks, send re minders to complete a task), monitor compliance and review and run reports on received responses to questions/tasks. All data from the dashboard would be downloaded and stored by Adelphi Values. As part of this process any video or photographic data w hereby the participant’s face was visible would be blurred/redacted. Germany participants will not be invited to take part in the real-time data capture app task. For those participants who elect to take part in the app task and complete this activity prior to their interview, participants will also be asked a series of general questions at the end of their interview about their experience of the app and completing the tasks/questions over the 10-day period. For t hose participants who take part in the app task after their interview the same questions included in the interview about the app task will be asked during a separate brief telephone call (approximately 5-10 minutes) conducted upon completion of the app task."
26,page_26,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 27 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 Adelphi Values’ qualitative in terviewers who are experienced in conducting interviews with adult participants will conduct the interviews. Each interviewer will participate in a comprehensive briefing meeting to ensure that they are fully familiar with the interview guide and can anticipate difficult ies that may arise during the interview. The AV project team will also be responsible for the c ontent and management of the real-time data capture application. 3.3.1 Endpoints As this study is a low-interventional, qual itative interview study, there are no formal endpoints. Data from the interv iews will be used to supplement a provisional conceptual model that has been developed fr om a review of qualitative literature of nasal polyps, exploring the symptoms and qua lity of life impacts of nas al polyps. Patients will be asked to complete the SNOT-22 questi onnaire and overall and single item VAS assessment during the interview; however this is purely for cognitive debriefing purposes to explore the relevance and pat ients understand of the content of the assessments. 3.3.1.1 Primary Endpoint Not applicable 3.3.1.2 Secondary Endpoint(s) Not applicable 3.4 Sample Size / Power Calculations Where the goal of qua litative research is to prov ide comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena (e.g. the holistic experi ence disease from the patient/caregiver perspective), it is recommended that sample sizes are determined based on the concept of ‘conceptual saturation’ where no new concepts are identified with repeated data collection. Past research and experience suggests that conceptual saturation can typically be achieved in as few as 12 indivi dual interviews in a relatively homogenous population.3,4 Taking the above into account, a total of 20 participants from the US and a total of 10 from Germany will be intervie wed (total sample= 30). 3.5 Hypotheses As this qualitative research study is expl oratory in nature no formal hypotheses are required."
27,page_27,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 28 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 4 DATA ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS Descriptive socio-demographic a nd clinical characteristics Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics for partici pant collected from the demographics form and CRF respectively will be summarized. Ratio data (e.g., age) will be summarized using totals (n values), means, min/max (range) statistics and where relevant standard deviations and medians. Simila rly, categorical data (e.g., gender, ethnicity, race, education levels) will be summarized using totals (n values) and percentages to represent the sample in each sub-category. Descriptive data will be summarized in tabular format. Analysis of interviews All interviews will be audio-record and transcribed/translated verbatim. All identifiable information (e.g. participants’, interviewer’s and doctors’ names) will be removed from the transcripts to make them anonymous and all participants will be assigned a unique participants identification code (ID). Qualitative analysis of verbat im transcripts for the semi-structured interviews will be conducted using thematic analysis methods (CE interview data) and framework analysis (CD interview data). All in terview data will be audio-recorded, transcribed and entered into ATLAS.Ti, a software package which is designed to facilitat e the storage, coding, and analysis of qualitative data. This program allows the researcher to code data at different levels of analysis and search for coded data using Boole an operators. ATLAS. Ti software allows traditional qualitative analysis of transcripts, but facilitates an easier break-down and management of qualitative data into groups and assign ‘codes’. Each transcript would be assessed and participant comments that pertain to the main research questions would be highlighted. Ax ial coding enables the relationship between concepts to be explored. The AV project leader will review the analysis of the first tw o interviews with the project researcher and create a coding scheme to be used throughout the analysis process (each highlighted statem ent will eventually be coded). After analyzing each transcription, the coded statemen ts are then moved into their relevant domains. A list of participant statements would be generated for each domain, all of which will contain a prefix comprising the participant’s des ignated ID number and the corresponding transcript page from which the statement was derived. Of note, wh ilst the frequency of participants mentioning a particular issue may be reported, quantitative analysis of this data would not occur, since that is not t he purpose of qualitativ e research and the sample sizes are too small to utilize the data meaningfully in a quantitative or statistical fashion."
28,page_28,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 29 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 In assessing the adequacy of the qualitative research to explore the patients’ experience of nasal polyps, Adelphi Values will assess whether conceptual saturation has been obtained for the CE component of the qualitative interviews (i.e. that a point has been reached at which no substantially new themes or descriptions of the concept and no new terms are being introduced by patients). Assessment of conceptual saturation is important to ensure that a ll concepts of importanc e to participant have been elicited in the interviews and is a ke y means of justifying the adequacy of sample sizes used in qualitative research studies. If saturation has not been reached, additional concepts important to pat ients may not have been capt ured. The process for determining saturation involves comparison of sets of transcripts to identify any consistency or inconsistencies in the pattern elicited concepts and themes. This typically involves comparison of the findings from sets of consecutive interviews. Specifically, for this sample of 30 partici pants (20 in the US and 10 in Germany), five sets of six interviews will be compared. If new concepts and themes are emerging in the final set of interviews then this sugges ts that conceptual saturation has not been achieved and further interviews may be nec essary and would be discussed with GSK. Descriptive statistics for the SNOT -22 and visual analogue scales The SNOT-22 and VAS assessments completed as part of the CD interviews will be scored by Adelphi Values using the instru ment scoring instructions. For the collected VAS assessments the research team will measur e the vertical line bisection and record the corresponding score which will be factored into the instrument scoring. Instrument total scores and items scores and data from the VAS (ratio data) will be summarized using totals (n values), means and min/max stat istics. At the item level the distribution of participant responses (categoric al data) will be summarized using totals (n values) and percentages to represent the pr oportion of the sample selecting each response option. Any missing data at the item level will be summarized using total (n values) and percentages. Where relevant, data will be presented in tabular or graphical format, whichever is deemed most appropriate based on t he content at the time of reporting of findings. Real-time data capture analysis Responses to the real-tim e data capture data will be coll ected using a variety of methodologies (e.g., video, audio, text and phot ographic responses with captions). For audio responses these will be transcribed. Participants responses to questions/tasks in the real-time data captur e activity will be analyzed in the same way using Atlas.Ti for the qualitative interviews as outlined above. Video, free text photographic and transcribed audio responses will be entered into Atlas.Ti and assigned codes in the same manner as the verbatim transcripts to tag/code"
29,page_29,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 30 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 what their content conveys. For any question s/tasks fielded to partici pants as part of the app with multiple choice or numerical respon ses options, descriptive analysis of these items will be performed and reported (e.g. m ean item score, ranges etc.). For those participants who complete the app task after thei r interview, they will answer a series of questions via telephone about their experience of this activity. This data would also be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyz ed in the same way as the interview and app task data. The interview and app task results will be used to inform the further development of a conceptual model for nasal polyps, previous ly constructed based on literature review activity only. The qualitative analysis will also be used help summarize the content validity of the reviewed PRO instruments an d their suitability for use with patients with nasal polyps. Reporting Adelphi Values will prepare a single report, detailing the fi ndings from the CE and CD interviews and real-time data capture. Within the report, anonymized patient quotes will be reported. Findings from the study may also be published in peer-reviewed journals. Again, however, only anonymized information will be reported. 5 LIMITATIONS As the study has been designed using best practice methodology advocated by the Food and Drug Administration for exploratory qua litative studies used to support clinical measurement strategies, the foreseen risk/limitations of the study are minimal but include the following:  Selection of participants : potential bias is always possible when selecting interviewees; however, as outlined in sect ions 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 eligibility criteria and recruitment quotas will be employed to ensure the participant sample is as diverse and representative as possible given the overall study size (n=30).  Generalizability of data : The participant sample (n=30) is relatively small as the planned research is primarily exploratory in nature. The sample size is typical of qualitative studies conducted in this cont ext. Nevertheless, the findings obtained from the participant interv iews cannot be extrapolated or generalized to the wider population with nasal polyps; however, they will be relevant to GSK target nasal polyp population for their plann ed Phase III clinical trial.  Real-time data capture : The eligibility criteria for the real-time data capture task and information included within the consent form (Appendix 5) will aim to ensure that those participants who take part in this activity are willing to take part over a period of ten days and that t hey would feel comfortable in providing responses using a variety of methods including vi deo, audio, photographic and/or free text"
30,page_30,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 31 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 responses. As this methodology is ex ploratory and ethnographi c in nature the quality of completion and the compr ehensiveness of participant responses cannot be guaranteed. This said however, the participants will be contactable both via the app and also via email and/or telephone during the completion of the app task and as such the project researchers will endeavor to encourage the completion of all task in as thorough manner as possible (e.g. provide reminders to participants to complete their task or probes/examples if they are unsure of how to respond to a task/question).  Conceptual saturation: As outlined in section 4 t he CE component of the interviews will be analyzed according to the principles of conceptual saturation to assess that all concepts of importanc e have been elicited. Whilst conceptual saturation can typically be achieved in a sa mple of 12 in a relatively homogenous population, a potential limitati on of the study is that conceptual saturation is not achieved across the 30 interviews. Should conceptual saturation not be achieved, discussions will be held with GSK to determine whether additional interviews should be conducted in order to achieve saturation. 6 STUDY CONDUCT, MANAGEMENT & ETHICS 6.1 Ethics Committee/IRB Approval This study will be submitted to an independent ethical review board in the US for review and approval prior to any study related ac tivities and fieldwork being conducted. The German component of this study will be submitted for ethica l approval to the Freibruger Ethik-Komission Internationa l (FEKI) board in Germany. 6.2 Informed Consent Each participant will be given full oral and wr itten information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study. The participant will be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. Participants will also be notified of their right to discontinue t heir participation in the study at any time. The participant’s signed and dated inform ed consent will be obtained using the information and consent form (ICF) (Appendix 5) before any medical information is accessed (i.e. before completion of the CRF, Appendix 4), before the participant is contacted by the recruitment agencies, and bef ore they are asked to perform any study related activities. The participant will be pr ovided with the ICF (Appendix 5), be allowed to read it, and given the opportunity to ask the study investigat or or recruitment agencies any questions. Copies of the ICF will be signed by the recruitment agencies and the participant, with the partici pant given one copy to take away for their records."
31,page_31,"GK7818A v7_0 Page 32 of 131 Effective: 20 Jan 2017 6.3 Data Protection The ICF (Appendix 5) explains that the transcribed data will be st ored in a computer database in a folder that is password pr otected for 15 years by Adelphi Values. Confidentiality of this data will be maintained in accordance with HIPAA legislation. The database will be de-identified; participants will be assigned a participant ID number in place of their name and any identifiable data will be made anonymous – such as place names, family members, etc. If participants participate in the app task, for some questions/tasks they will have the option to submit video, picture, audio and text responses. In these situations all visible faces will be blurred/redacted following analysis and prior to storage, to ensure anonymity. The ICF also explains that for data verification purposes, authorized representatives of GSK, AV, a regulatory authority or an IRB may require di rect access to parts of the hospital or practice records relevant to the st udy including participant s’ medical history. The ICF further explains that in the event that a medical emergen cy should occur at the time of interview, the interviewer is permitted to break confidentiality and pass information onto persons such as medical pe rsonnel, in order for the participant to receive medical treatment. With regard to the real-time data app task, the ICF also expl ains that if participants choose to participate in the app task, for some questions/tasks they will have the option to submit video, photograph, audio and text respons es. If they choose to take part in the app task and choose to submit videos of themse lves or pictures, full anonymity of the data cannot be guaranteed if their face is visi ble in the recordings and images that are uploaded to Adelphi Values. If they consent to participate in the real-time data app task they agree that full anonymity of the data cannot be guaranteed. However, any data submitted via the real-time data capture task will not be shared with any individuals outside of the project team. For each app qu estion/task they will have the option of how they respond (e.g. video, audio, photograph/text ). Full anonymity and confidentiality can be guaranteed for any data files, written documents or repor ts that are produced about the data collected. 6.4 Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Participant data will be handled in accordance to the data protection information provided in section 6.3. All participant data (study forms, transcripts and responses to the real-time data task) will be de-identif ied and participants will be assigned a participant ID number. This ID number will be us ed to label the electronica data files and documents relevant to each participant and will be used to reference participant data in the reporting of the study fi ndings (e.g. study reports, pr esentations, publications)."

Adverse event reporting will be managed in line with the study-specific pharma covigilance plan (sPVP) that will be completed and filed internally at GSK. If a participant mentions during the interview any adverse event (AE) or product co mplaint, whether it is considered serious or not, experienced whilst taking a product pr oduced by GSK, this must be reported to the pharmacovigilance department at GSK. T he interviewer will complete an adverse event monitoring report form ( Error! Reference source not found. ) at the end of the interview that will capture information r egarding the reportable event and the GSK product involved and the role of the person reporting the event. As part of this process the interviewer will seek the participant’s per mission to include their contract details and the contact details of their physician on the form; however, should a participant not choose to include their contact details on t he AE form, they will be informed that the AE still has to be reported, but will be done so anonymously. Any completed forms will be sent to the designated contact at GSK within 24 hours of awareness of the adverse event or adverse drug reaction. 7 EXTERNAL INVOLVEMENT 7.1 Third Party Supplier Supplier Address Staff contact details Adelphi Values (Company conducting the study) Adelphi Mill Grimshaw Lane Bollington Macclesfield SK10 5JB Senior Lead: Project Lead: Researcher: Project administrator: MedQuest Global (Recruiter) MedQuest Global 30460 Cartagena Place, Castaic, CA 91384 Zeste Germany (Recruiter) Zeste Research Stockheimerstrasse 297647 Willmars, Germany Transperfect Transperfect PPD PPD PPD PPD PPD PPD PPD PPD PPD"

Why is this study being done? The purpose of this research study is to l earn more about the experiences of individuals living with nasal polyps, and how having nasal polyps affects individuals in their daily life. To do this, we would like to conduct interv iews with individuals with nasal polyps to understand their experience of nasal polyps. As part of this interview, we would also like you to complete a number of questionnaires about your experience of nasal polyps and give your opinion on whether they are easy to understand and complete, and relevant to your experience of nasal polyps. As an optional activity, we would also like a sub-set of ten individuals with nasal polyps to complete a series of activities via a free app downloaded to their sm artphone or tablet. This study will involve approxim ately 20 subjects from the Un ited States and 10 subjects from Germany. What will I need to do as part of the study? You are invited to take part in the following research activities: 1. Nasal polyp interview: Participants will take part in a 120-minute telephone interview about their experienc e of living with nasal polyps. During the first half of the interview you will be asked to discu ss the symptoms of nas al polyps that you experience, how they affect you, and your experience of any treatment/surgery you have received."

You will be asked about the relevance of the questi onnaires to your experience of nasal polyps and your ability to understand and complete the questionnaires. 2. (OPTIONAL) App task: Participants will be invited to download a free application (app) to their personal smartphone or tablet. Part icipants will be asked to complete approximately 10 questions/tasks via the app over a 10-day period. The questions/tasks will explore the partici pants’ experience of the symptoms, impacts and treatments of nasal polyp s and any day-to-day changes that the participant experiences, in ‘real time’ as participants go about their daily lives. Participants will be required to complete some questions/tasks once during the 10 days and other questions/tasks will need to be completed daily. Each task will take no longer than 5-10 minutes to co mplete and participants will be able to provide video, audio, text, multiple choice and photographic responses to the questions/tasks. Participants will also be as ked to complete a 5-10 minute phone call following completion of the app task to provide feedback about their experiences of completing the app task.

Interview objectives and overview [Note to interviewer]: The overall objective of this interview is to explore patients’ experience of severe, recurrent nasal polyps via the conduct of concept elicitation interviews and to obtain feedback from patients on a series of patient‐reported outcome (PRO) instruments designed to assess the symptom and impact experience of nasal polyps via the con duct of cognitive debriefing interviews. The concept elicitation phase will facilitate the identification of concepts of disease experience that are important to adult patients with nasal polyps and the language they use to talk about the concepts and describe those concepts. The main areas of exploration will be the symptoms expe rienced by patients. In particular we are interested in the intensity, frequency and duration of each symptom, how bothersome or intrusive each symptom is to each patient, and whether/ how the collective symptom experience of nasal polyps has any impact on the patient’s quality of life. The cognitive debriefing phase will assess a number of PROs including the following: Sino‐Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT‐22); Visual analogue scales (VAS) proposed for use in GSK phase III trial: Nasal obstruction VAS; Nasal discharge VAS; Throat mucus VAS; Loss of smell VAS; Facial pain VAS; Overall VAS symptom score. The relevance and appropriateness of the each of the items cover e d by each instrument will be assessed during the cognitive debriefing interview, as will patients’ ability to read and consistently understand the item wording, instructions, response options and recall period of each instrument. The cognitive debriefing phase will also investigate how patients define a meani ngful cha nge in score, for each item of each instrument.  Aim of the concept elicitation phase Explore the symptoms experienced by adults with nasal polyps, with particular attention paid to the frequency, intensity, duration of each symptom and how bothersome it is. Explore the language used by adult nasal polyp patients to describe their disease experience. Explore how each symptom (individually and collectively) affects the patients’ quality of life.  Aim of the cognitive debriefing phase  Evaluate the relevance of the PRO instruments to nasal polyp patients."

(PRO instruments include: SNOT‐22, Nasal obstruction VAS, Nasal dischar ge VAS, Throat mucus VAS, Loss of smell VAS, Facial pain/pressure VAS and an overall severity of condition VAS scale).  Overview of the interview process The interview should be conducted as follows: 1. Introduction to the study : Introduce Adelphi Values to the patient. Explain the objectives and the process of the interview. 2. Consent: Ensure the patients’ written informed consent to participate has been obtained prior to beginning the interview. Also obtain the patients’ verbal consent for the interview to be audio‐recorded. 3. Interview: In the interviews you should ask the patient questions in an open‐ended exploratory manner. Lead the patient as little as possible in this part of the interview. The interview is divided into the following sections: 1. Introduction to the study (5 minutes) 2. Experience of nasal polyps (55 minutes) 3. Cognitive debriefing of the collection of PRO instruments (60 minutes) In total, the interview shou ld take approximately 120 minutes."

Role of the interviewer and instructions The role of the interviewer before the interview: 1. Check that the patient’s clinician has completed the CRF and screener and that the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 2. Check the patient has provided written informed consent and provided verbal consent for the interview to be audio‐recorded. The role of the interviewer during the interview  Digital Audio recording . Ensure that the comments of the patient throughout the interview are clearly recorded on the audio‐recording. Audio recordings will be transcribed verbatim. Check the volume settings and positioning of the audio recorder to ensure the clarity of the audio recording prior to the interview making sure recordings are clearly audibl e. Check that the audio recorder has enough battery power for the duration of the interview. Avoid rustling papers near the recorder or jostling the recorder during the interview as this will lead to inaudible responses. The role of the interviewer is to inquire and support: Do not give your own point of view Be patien t and accept sile nce during open‐ended questioning to make sure the patient has time to think about her/his response Help the patient stick to the topics intended in the guide (but not necessarily in the order presented in the guide) Help the patient avoid repeating himsel f or herself Help the patient cross‐reference and make connections that they would not do spontaneously Ask the patient to clarify any comments that you are not certain you understood and for the benefit of the recording Ask the patient to explain any vague reference or commen t that is pertinent to the research question Most importantly: avoid biasing or leading the patient As much as possible your questions should be open‐ended and general rather than specific – use suggested probes to follow‐up on topics of interest if not adequately discussed in response to the open questions. It is very important that you do not lead the patient with your questions or remarks. Ask all questions in as open‐ended a manner as possible; take care not to bias the patient’s response one way or the other. Below for most questions, we have provided a number of possible probes that should help the patient explain his or her thinking when s/he is talking about the topics of interest. These probes are"
64,page_64,"Date:   /   / 2017 Center Number: /___/___/ Participant N°: /___/___/ MM DD GK7818A v3_0 Page 65 of 131 15th May 2017 optional and do not have to be asked if, when asked the initial question, the patient provides a fully elaborated response and addresses the topics noted in the probes. The probes are only provided for use when the patient finds it difficult to answer your questions, if s/he is reluctant to speak at length about experie nces or if key topics of interest have not been elicited spontaneously. You may have to invent your own probes or reword the probes indicated in the interview guide; this is fine. As a fully trained and experienced interviewer we rely on your judgment as to when more information is required from the patie nt and for you to probe as appropriate. POSSIBLE NON‐LEADING PROBES MIGHT INCLUDE:  Can you describe exactly how that feels?  Tell me more about that.  How does that affect you?  Can you talk more about ___________?  How often does that happe n?  How long does that last?  Is there anything that makes it better or worse? During the interview, it is not essential for you to ask the questions in exactly the way that they are written in this guide and for some interviewees it may be necessary for you to rewo rd questions as a means to enable open‐discussion. If you reword a question; however, you should be sure to avoid biasing the patient’s response. If a topic has been covered sufficiently in an earlier part of the discussion it is not necessary to go over it again later if this topi c comes up later in the interview guide. If the patient directs any questions to you that are of a medical nature, please explain that you are not a medical professional and that the patient should direct any medical queries to his or her doctor or nurse. Using the interview guide Throughout this guide we have coded the questions and instructions so that it is clear which questions are required and which are probes and do not necessarily need to be asked. The code is as follows: Blue font These are instructions to you  These are statements that you are to read aloud word‐for‐word 1. Questions prefixed by a specific number must be posed to all patients  All probes are bulleted – these do not need to be used specifically but are included to assist you in drawing further information from the patients Adverse event reporting If the respondent mentions an adverse event experienced while taking a product made by the sponsor company, or a product you suspect is a product made by the sponsor company ,whether it is considered serious (see definitions below) or not, you should make a note of it and at the end of the interview go through the ‘Adverse Eve nt Form’. At this time please state the following to the patient:"
65,page_65,"Date:   /   / 2017 Center Number: /___/___/ Participant N°: /___/___/ MM DD GK7818A v3_0 Page 66 of 131 15th May 2017 “During the interview you mentioned a problem that you experienced while taking [product name]. The sponsor of this research needs to collect information about their products in order to continue making them as safe and effective as possible. Every report they receive contains potentially useful information. I would like to spend a couple of minutes with you now to collect some mor e details. Is that OK with you?” If yes “Thank you. The information you provide will be sent to the study sponsor, who may wish to contact your doctor for further information. If you agree to provide your doctor’s name, this will not be linked in any way to your other responses given during the interview. Are you happy to provide the name of your doctor?” (If the respondent subsequently says no, then go to the ‘If no’ section) If no “OK that’s fine. However, as the information you were given about this stud y explained, we do have to report this problem to the sponsor. This will be done anonymously, and none of your personal details will be shared with them.” You should complete the ‘Adverse Event Form’ with as much detail as you can retrieve. Remember, an Adverse Event must be reported when the followi ng are present: PREP – Patient, Reporter, Event, Product 1. A Patient or group of patients  Identifiers such as age, age group, birth date, gender, role, profession should be collected if available, if not the event should still be reported. 2. An identifiable Reporting source  Information that identifies the reporter, establishing knowledge of the reportable event in an identifiable consumer.  A reporter can be a patient, doctor, patient’s parent, friend, colleague or caregiver. 3. An adverse Event  Description of at least one event or product complaint. 4. A suspect Product  This must be one of the products being marketed by the company that we are doing research for. Remember: The event need not have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. An adverse event is: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a sponsor medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.”"

For these purposes a PC is a complaint specific to the product itself, or packaging, as opposed to its effect on the patient. Examples include damaged or missing tablets; wrong strength or color of tablets; damaged packaging; a label that cannot be re ad; a liquid that should be clear but is cloudy or contains unexpected particles; a bent needle, a broken syringe; a missing patient information leaflet or the identification of a potentially counterfeit medicine. Cases where a woman is pregnant or breastfeeding while taking a company’s medicine also need to be collected even if no AE is specifically cited. In these instances, it is important to capture whether or not there were any complications during the pregnancy or any congenital abnormalities occurring in the baby. A serious adverse event (which should be reported to the FDA) is any undesirable exp erience associated with the use of a medical product in a patient when the patient outcome is: Death Report if you suspect that the death was an outcome of the adverse event, and include the date if known. Life‐threatening Report if suspected that the patient was at substantial risk of dying at the time of the adverse event, or use or conti nued use of the device or other medical product might have resulted in the death of the patient. Hospitalization (initial or prolonged) Report if admission to the hospital or prolongation of hospitalization was a result of the adverse event. Emerg ency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospital should be evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes (E.g., life‐threatening; required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; other serious medically important event). Disability or permanent damage Report if the adverse event resulted in a substantia l disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions, i.e., the adverse event resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of life. Congenital anomaly/birth defect Report if you suspect that exposure to a medical product prior to conception or during pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in the child. Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage (devices) Report if you believe that medical or surgical intervention was necessary to preclude permanent impairment of a body function, or prevent permanent damage to a body struc ture, either situation suspected to be due to the use of a medical product. Other serious (important medical events) Report when the event does not fit the other outcomes, but the event may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes."

Please have the patient read aloud the re sponse they have chosen so this can be recorded.  If the participant has difficulty reading a par ticular item, offer to read it for them and make a note of this.  Make sure you are non-judgmental in your tone when probing. If the participant hesitates when answering, use one or more of the following probes, or similar questions to elicit comments from them. Please feel free to vary which ones you ask for each questionnaire item – rather than going thr ough each one in rote fashion and getting one word answers. Not every probe has to be used for every item/participant.  Asking why : if appropriate, probe further by asking the participant why they have answered the interview q uestion in that way.  If the patient has chosen to skip a question remember to ask why they have chosen to do so.  If the patient has chosen “0” or “not applicable” option for any question ask why they have made this selection o Was the question not relevant? (e.g. they do not experience this symptom) o Is the question relevant, although they might not be currently experiencing this symptom?  Wherever possible, please make brief notes in the empty boxes provided for each item to summarize:  How the question was understood by the participant?  Was the concept relevant to the participant?  How easy/difficult was it for the participant to choose their answer?  Why did they choose the answer they did?

Nasal polyp description task “Please provide a written description of how you would describe nasal polyps to someone who had never heard of the condition.”  In addition to understanding the patient experience of nasal polyps, additional value could be gained by getting patient to provide written description of their nasal polyps as if they were describing to someone who doesn’t know what nasal polyps are. Assessment of global severity of nasal polyps “Please rate the severity of your nasal polyps today at their worst.”  Asking questions such as these, on a daily basis will allow the day‐to‐day variability of the global severity of nasal polyps to be reported.  Responses to this daily question could be collected in a number of ways: o Categorical response options (e.g. No symptoms through to Very severe) o Numerical response scale (NRS) o Implementation of the overall symptom VAS as intended for the Phase III trial. Due to variability in each participant’s screen size of their personal smart phone and the limitations of the app platform it won’t be possible to measure the VAS score as you would on paper or as would be on a provisioned electronic device. Here we would ask the participant to provide a response using a slider option (outlined in the table above) and also ask the participant to provide in a free text box the number the slider position represents. Assessment of global impact of nasal polyps “Please rate how much your nasal polyps affected your usual activities today”  As per global severity assessment, asking questions such as these, on a daily basis will allow the day‐to‐day variability of the global impact of nasal polyps to be reported.  As described above, categorical, NRS or VAS a VAS sliding response scale could be used to respond to this task. In the case of the sliding scale VAS, a text box will also be provided for the patient to coordinate their sliding scale response to a number. . Assessment of day in the life with nasal polyps “During the study period we would  Participants would be asked to complete this question/task once or twice during the study period.

You can choose any day during the 10-day period you would like complete this task. On your chosen day we would like you think about what you experienced, how it affected you and how you felt. You are encouraged to submit as many video or audio responses as you like as you move through your day. This may include submitting a response first thing in the morning to explain your ex perience of nasal polyps through the night (e.g. how you slept”. You could subm it responses throughout your day as you go about your usual activities, explaining your experience of nasal polyps and how it affects you. You could also subm it a response in the evening before bed describing your day’s experience with nasal polyps. These are just suggestion and you can submit any re sponses that you feel documents y our experiences that day” detailed description of their symptom and daily life experiences with nasal polyps and allow the researchers at AV further insight into their experience of the disease."
103,page_103,"GK7818A Page 129 of 131 19th May 2017 Example task/question Comments/Rationale Assessment of treatment experiences “Please take a photo(s) of the medications or remedies you use for your nasal polyps and provide a short text caption/description about what is shown in the photo(s and what it means to you).” “Using video, audio or text response please describe which of these treatments (if any) you used today? What are the benefits you have seen today from these treatments? Is there anything you have disliked about your treatments today?”  Treatments and surgical experiences and decisions for nasal polyps was discussed in both the qualitative literature and the patient blogs reviewed as part of an earlier nasal polyps literature review for GSK, and is included in the preliminary conceptual model. It is suggested that further detail regarding treatments and surgical decisions for nasal polyps is investigated using the app task. Capturing feelings/emotions “During the 10-day period take photos of things t hat describe your experience of nasal polyps that day and how you felt. You can submit as many photographs as you like. For each photo submitted please provide a short text caption/description about what is shown in the photo and what it means to you.” “For each photo provided, please rate the importance of this photograph to you?” Why did you give it this number?  A technique that has been utilised successfully in other AV studies is the implementation of creative exercises. Here, patients could be fielded creative question to ‘take a photo that best describes your feelings towards your nasal polyps today, and use the caption to explain why you chose this photo’. Again, this requires patient to consider their condition and experience of it differently and may allow for interesting insight. As part of this process patient could be asked to rank the importance of the photos submitted using a sliding scale. Ranking criteria could be discussed and drafted with input from GSK"
