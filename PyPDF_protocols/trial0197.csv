4,page_4,"5 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC 1.0 Background 1.1 Acute Myeloid Leukemias (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Despite progress in the treatment of AML and MDS, most adult patients with AML and advanced/progressive MDS still do very poorly with current therapy and many die from their disease (Abe et al. 2008). Patients with primary refractory or relapsed AML have a particularly poor outcome, as well as MDS patients who are refractory, progress on or relapse after hypomethylating agents (HMA) based therapies (Duong et al. 2013, Prébet et al. 2011, Jabbour et al. 2010). Acute myeloid leukemia patients who fail to achie ve a complete remission (CR) with first induction therapy have a dismal outcome and onl y a small percentage of patients are alive at 1 year (Bai et al 2008). Current therapy is also inadequate for relapsed leukemias with a true long-term cure rate of less than 10% (Bai et al. 2008). Recently, comparable clinical activity and outcomes between HMAs and cytotoxic chemotherapy has been demonstrated in secondary, elderly and unfavorable cytogenetics AML in first line therapy (Quantas-Cardama et al. 2012 and Fena ux et al. 2010). Thus, many experts feel that these patients are candidates for lower intensity treatment as first line intervention. The outcome of patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in the intermediate and IPSS intermediate-2, and esp ecially high-risk category is almost as poor as for patients with acute leukemia. Median surv ival in this group is 4-5 months (Schanz et al. 2012 and Greenberg et al. 1997). Th e two approved HMAs Azacytidine (AZA) and Decitabine (DAC) have activity, however CR rates are less than <10-18% and overall responses (CR, PR and clinical benefit such as hematological improvements) approach at a maximum 40-50% in the first line treatme nt setting in MDS (Fenaux et al 2009 and Lubbert et al 2011). Responses and survival in MDS patients having failed or progressed on or after HMA treatment is very poor with a median survival of 4.3-5.8 months and a 1-year survival of 17-29% in the largest three studies to date (Duong et al. 2013, Prébet et al. 2011, Jabbour et al. 2010). Accordingly HMA failure MDS repr esents one of the largest patient groups in need for novel agents and investigational therapies. In fact, apart from allogeneic transplant for which most patients do not qua lify, investigational regimens were as good and better than cytotoxic chemotherapy after HMA failure (Prébet et al. 2011). Azacitidine (AZA) and Decitabine (DAC) are often used as lower intensity, outpatient treatments in elderly AML patients not fit for induction treatment. Responses are comparable to somewhat lower than in tr eating MDS patients with CR/CRi rates ranging from 7-18% (Fenaux et al. 2010 and Kantarjian et al. 2012). Thus, there is likewise a great demand for improvement of alternativ e lower intensity, outpatient regimens and new combinations for elderly AML patients. Interestingly, in several earlier studies low- dose s.c. Cytarabine (AraC) alone or with growth factor support exhibited quite encouraging response rates of CR and PR of 18% and 8% respectively (Aul & Schneider 1989). Several studies also have been reported on the potential activity of low-dose AraC (AraC) in MDS (Visani et al. 2004). However, if the natural history of the disease is changed, and there is significant room for improvements in therapeutic options for these patients. In summary, available data demons trates the clinical activity of HMAs and AraC specifically in elderly AML and MDS patients, providing additional clinical"
5,page_5,"6 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC justification, in addition to our pre-clinical data, to combine AZD1775 with AraC as one of the treatment arms in this protocol. In conclusion, improvements in therapy for elderly AML patients, patients with relapsed/refractory AML as well as advanced MDS patients, particularly those who failed HMA treatments are urgently needed. I nvestigational therapies are one of the recommended therapeutic choices for these patients due to the lack of effective standard salvage treatments. Pre-clinically, inhibition of WEE1 kinase is one of the most potent sensitizers to AraC, identified in large-scale RNAi screens. Sensitization potential between WEE1 inhibtion and AraC was best at lower AraC concentrations as we have published (Tibes et al. 2012), and hence lower dose AraC will be used in the combination arm as proposed in this protocol. The design of this trial offers relapsed and progressive AML and MDS patients novel treatment options in the form of either single agent AZD1775 or in combination with AraC, and th ereby will investigate for the first time the clinical activity of WEE1 inhibition in AML and MDS. 1.2 Overview of the WEE1 pathway and DNA damage and Cell cycle inhibition 1.21 Background on Cytarabine, DNA Damage Repair and Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cytarabine (AraC) has been the most widely used and is still the overall most active drug in AML (Rowe 2009). It forms the backbone of most AML and MDS induction and consolidation regimens, and has activity at low doses given subcutaneously both in AML and MDS (Bolwell et al. 1987, Kantarjian et al 2012). AraC is an S-phase (cell cycle) specific agent that undergoes conversion and phosphorylation to a tri-phosphate form with subsequent incorporation into DNA of di viding cells. This usually triggers activation of the intra-S phase checkpoint a genotoxin-ac tivated signaling pathway that stabilizes stalled replication forks and slows cell cycl e progression by blocking the firing of late- acting DNA replication origins (Dimitrova & Gilbert 2000, Morita 1976, Grant 1998). AraC incorporation leads to single stranded DNA damage that later is converted to double strand DNA damage ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest and repair of damaged DNA (Do et al. 2013). Many of these processes are either directly regulated by WEE1 kinase, i.e. cell cycle arrest via CDK1/2, as well as WEE1 kinase plays a central role in the networks of DNA repair initiation, i.e. vi a its effect on CHEK1 or PLK1. Thus WEE1 kinase has a central role in many chec kpoint and DNA damage mediated processes (Langerak & Russell 2011, Perry & Kornbluth 2007). Interfering with cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair (DDR) in combination with agents that cause DNA single or dou ble strand breaks has been proposed as a promising concept in cancer therapy and captures a potential synthetic lethal molecular interaction. Advanced leukemias are genom ically highly unstable, with cell cycle checkpoints and DDR pathways impaired cau sing these cells to rely on a fewer number of checkpoints, and highly reliant on the later stage in the cycle cycle at the G2/M transition (Cavelier et al. 2009, Didier et al. 2008). Thus, interfering with cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair (DDR) in combination with agents that cause DNA single or double strand breaks such as AraC has been proposed as a promising concept in"
6,page_6,"7 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC cancer therapy and captures a potential synthetic lethal molecular interaction (Tibes et al. 2012). 1.22 Inhibition of WEE1 kinase by AZD1775 WEE1 kinase is an evolutionary conserve d kinase regulating late G2/M cell cycle checkpoints, directing cells either towards ce ll cycle arrest allowing time for DNA repair or proceeding with progression into mitosi s. However, emerging data indicates that WEE1 kinase activates the intra S-phase ch eckpoint as well and interferes with DNA damage response through various processes. WEE1 kinase acts through and is the main kinase phosphorylating and regulating Cdc2 (CDK1) , which in complex with Cyclin B is a master regulator of mitotic entry at G2/M. However, WEE1 is also the main kinase phosphorylating CDK2 (assembles with cyclin A) and exerts a prominent function in G1/S phase and the intra S-phase checkpoint (Perry & Kornbluth 2007). Based on two unbiased RNAi screens a nd subsequent validation studies, inhibition of WEE1 kinase was identified as one of the most potent sensitizers to AraC in AML cells (Tibes et al 2012, Porter et al. 2012). We postulate that WEE1 kinase is the essential kinase that governs the “escape path way” in malignant myeloid cells under cellular stress with cytotoxic agents, partic ularly AraC. Therefore inhibition of WEE1 kinase by AZD1775 with AraC is a rational combination in aggressive myeloid malignancies and leukemias. In addition, AZ D1775 had single agent activity and its anti- leukemic activity alone or in combination is independent of p53 mutation and function in AML (Van Linden et al. 2013 and Tibes, unpublished observation). 1.23 Rational of combined Cytarabine (AraC) and WEE1 inhibition AraC is the backbone of therapy for myeloid leukemias. It is used in regimens for lymphoid leukemias as well as for patients with advanced MDS. Pre-clinically WEE1 inhibition sensitized cells to several cytot oxic agents including AraC. In Phase 1 and 2 ongoing clinical trials in solid tumor patients, the only in class Wee1 inhibitor AZD1775 is well tolerated with platinum compounds and gemcitabine providing a therapeutic window even at full standard doses of cytot oxic chemotherapies. We have generated preliminary data that shows potent sensiti zation with synergy combining AraC and AZD1775 in vitro and ex vivo. In addition WEE1 is highly expressed in myeloid leukemias (Tibes et al. 2012). Based on these data we hypothesize that the combination of AraC and WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 will have strong synergistic clinical activity with manageable toxicity (given the already exis ting clinical data of tolerability in solid tumors) in patients with advanced myeloid ma lignancies. We further postulate that there will be single agent anti-leukemic activity of AZD1775 providing a rationale to compare AZD1775 single agent vs. in combination with AraC in patients with MDS and AML that would otherwise have limited th erapeutic options remaining. 1.3 Overview of AZD1775"
7,page_7,"8 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC The following overview of AZD1775 (Section 1.3 and 1.4) is based on the knowledge available at the time this protocol was first finalized and is based on Edition 12 of the Investigator’s Brochure, Edition 12, dated 18 Fe bruary 2015, with a data cut-off date of 11 November 2014. For more detailed and up-to-date information, please consult the current Investigator’s Brochure. AZD1775 is a highly selective, adenosine- triphosphate (ATP) competitive, small- molecule inhibitor of the WEE1 kinase that sensitizes tumour cells to cytotoxic agents and is being developed for the treatment of advanced solid tumours with p53 pathway deficient malignancies. Inhibition of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase WEE1 potentiates genotoxic chemotherapies by abrogating cell-cycle arrest and eliminating the opportunity for proper DNA repair to occur. From a therapeutic standpoint, inhibition of checkpoint kinases that mediate cell-cycle arrest may force tumour cells to continue cell division before chemically induced DNA da mage is repaired, eventually causing apoptosis or mitotic catastr ophe (Medema and Macurek 2012). The primary objective of the clinical development of AZD1775 is its use as a chemosensitizing drug in combination with a cytotoxic agent (or combination of agents) for treatment of advanced tumors. In vitr o experiments demonstrate that AZD1775 has synergistic cytotoxic effects when admini stered in combination with various DNA damaging agents that have divergent mechan isms of action. In studies with matched ovarian cell lines (p53 WT and shRNA p53 k nockdown), AZD1775 enhanced cell death induction by gemcitabine in p53-deficient but not in p53 positive control cells. AZD1775 also demonstrates synergistic effects on cell death induction when used in combination with cisplatin and carboplatin in a p53-depe ndent manner. Cervical cancer cells with HPV induced inactivation of p53 demonstrat ed chemosensitization to cisplatin and topotecan by AZD1775. The ability of AZD1775 to affect tumour gr owth as monotherapy or to enhance the antitumor effects of gemcitabine, carboplatin, cisplatin, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, and gamma irradiation was evaluated in imm unocompromised host animals bearing human xenograft tumors. The anti-tumor effect of AZD1775 dosed as monotherapy was investigated in the A427 non small-cell lung cancer nude mouse xenograft model. Daily treatment with AZD1775 led to 51% tumour regression (n=10) and mean body weight loss did not exceed 5% over the course of the study. AZD1775 single agent treatment also led to tumour growth inhibition in additional xenograft models: 92% TGI (Day 28) in SKMES1 model of non- small-cell-lung cancer (NSCLC), 13% regression (day 11) in LoVo colorectal cancer model and 64% TGI(day 19) in NCI-H2122 NSCLC. The anti-tumour effect of AZD1775 in combination with gemcitabine was investigated in the WiDr (human colorect al adenocarcinoma) nude rat xenograft model. Several schedules of gemcitabine + AZD1775 were explored. A 10 mg/kg dose of AZD1775 significantly enhanced the anti-tumour effect of gemcitabine in WiDr tumours with % treated/control (T/C) = -2%. The anti-tumour effect of AZD1775 in combination with carboplatin was investigated in the HeLa-luc (human cervical adenocar cinoma) nude rat xenograft model. AZD1775"
8,page_8,"9 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC dose-dependently enhanced the anti-tumour eff ect of carboplatin tumors with %T/C = 85, 39 and 28% at doses of 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg, respectively. The anti-tumour effect of AZD1775 in combination with carboplatin or cisplatin was also investigated in the HeLa-luc model. These experiments showed that AZD1775 dose- dependently enhanced the anti-tumour effect of cisplatin with %T/C = -5 and -16% at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg respectively, compared to or cisplatin alone (24% T/C) AZD1775 enhanced the anti-tumour efficacy of 5-FU and capecitabine when used in combination with these agents, as well; and experiments with nude mouse xenograft models of A549 (p53 wild type) and Ca lu-6 (p53 null) NSCLC cell lines showed enhanced antitumour growth effect of radiot herapy preferentially in p53 mutant xenograft tumors. Please refer to the AZD1775 Inves tigator Brochure (IB) for more detailed information regarding these experiments and findings. 1.31 Pharmcodynamics Inhibition of CDC2 (Y15) phosphorylati on and induction of Histone H3 (Ser10) phosphorylation were observed upon Wee1 inhibition in vitro . In vivo PD effects of AZD1775 were evaluated using the WiDr xe nograft nude rat model. AZD1775 (0.5, 1.0, 3.0 and 7.0 mg/kg/hr) was intravenously infused for 8 hrs, 24 hrs after administration of gemcitabine (50 mg/kg, IV). PD marker analyses were performed on tumor tissue isolated immediately after the infusion. Continuous infusion of AZD1775 caused reduction of phospho-CDC2 (Y15) in WiDr xenograft tumor tissue in a dose-dependent manner. The EC50 value was 0.28 μ M, and about 80% inhibition was achieved at 1.0 mg/kg/hr (0.45 μM at 8hr). Similar dose dependency was observed in the CEA (induction of phospho-Histone H3 [Ser10]) in tumor tissue. EC50 value was 0.21 μM, and maximal effect was observed at approximately 1.0 mg/kg/hr. These data suggest that phopsho- CDC2 (Y15) and phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) could be useful as AZD1775 PD biomarkers in tumors. Similar PD marker changes were observed in surrogate tissues, such as skin hair follicle and peripheral blood cells in the presence or absence of the DNA damaging agent gemcitabine. Strong pCDC2 (Y15) immunopositivity was observed in skin hair bulb in the hair follicle. In combination with gemc itabine (50 mg/kg, IV: 24 hr before AZD1775 dosing), AZD1775 (0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg/hr x 8 hrs, IV-infusion) dose-dependently decreased these signals. An almost comple te reduction of phos pho-CDC2 signal was achieved at 3.0 mg/kg/hr. Phospho-CDC2 (Y15) signal in peripheral blood cells were also reduced in a dose dependent manner w ith significant reduction at 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg/hr. These results suggest that hair follic les and blood cells are surrogate tissues in which phospho-CDC2 (Y15) can be used as a ma rker to predict PD/efficacy in tumors treated with gemcitabine. Similar dose dependent reduction of phospho-CDC2 (Y15) by AZD1775 (0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg/hr x 8 hrs, IV-infusion) was ob served without gemcitabine pretreatment in both skin hair follicles and tumors. Thus, th ese PD markers may be available to predict PD/efficacy in tumors in the presence or absence of DNA damaging agents. 1.32 Nonclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism The pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 were evalua ted in male Sprague -Dawley rats and"
9,page_9,"10 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC Beagle dogs following intravenous (IV) and oral administration. AZD1775 exhibited high plasma clearance in rats and dogs (57.3 and 50.8 mL/min/kg, respectively). The terminal half-life (T1/2) of the compound was s hort in both species (1.6 and 1.1 hr in rats and dogs, respectively). The oral bioavailab ility was 59.7% in rats and 33.6% in dogs. AZD1775 (1 μM) was moderately bound to plasma proteins from rat, dog and human, with the unbound fractions being 23.2, 40.0, and 39.5%, respectively. Metabolism was the major route of elimination of AZD1775 in rat and dog. The major metabolic pathway of AZD1775 in human liver preparations was oxidative metabolism. All metabolites observed in human liver preparations were al so formed in the rat and dog. Oxidative metabolism of AZD1775 was mediated predominantly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and FMO3. AZD1775 was a weak reversible inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. In addition, AZD1775 was a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Collectively, these data indicate that the pha rmacokinetics of AZD1775 could be altered if AZD1775 is coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inducers, and depending on AZD1775 therapeutic plasma concentrations, there is also some potential for drug drug interactions when coadministered with CYP3A4 substrates. 1.33 Toxicity and safety Studies with AZD1775 In rats, the toxicologic profile of AZD1775 was evaluated using 4 separate dosing schedules; single-dose, once weekly for three weeks, and daily for 7 consecutive days or one month. A recovery (treatment-free period) was included in each study design. With each of these schedules, the toxicologic profile for physical signs, hematological changes, and gross and histomorphological findings were expected based on the cytotoxic mechanism of action of AZD1775. The major organs affected were proliferation dependent organs such as lymphoid and hematopoietic organs and gastrointestinal tract. Evidence of reversibility of all changes, based on drug-related effects observed in early death rats, was generally demonstrated by th e end of the 2-week recovery period. In the fifteen-day oral toxicity study, co nducted in rats dosed once weekly for three weeks (Study Days 1, 8, and 15), no mortality or severe toxicity was observed at 300 mg/kg/day, however treatment-related body weight changes and hematological changes were observed. The magnitude of change of absolute reticulocyte counts and white blood cell parameters observed after the first dose were generally similar to those after the third dose, indicating that additive toxicity was not seen after 3 weekly intermittent doses. A trend toward recovery was observed for ma ny of these changes following the 14 day recovery period, however recovery of hemato logical changes appeared to be delayed. Since the histomorphologic examination of the bone marrow revealed normal cellularity at the completion of the 14 day recovery, it is expected that hematological changes will fully recover as was seen in dogs. The magn itude of the decreased WBC and erythroid parameters were close to those observed in th e previous single dose toxicity study in rats. No histological findings were noted at the completion of the 14 day recovery period in the 300 mg/kg/day once weekly group. In a single dose oral toxicity study, severe i rreversible toxicity (mortality) was seen in 1 female out of 10 female rats after a single dose at 300 mg/kg (1800 mg/m2). In a consecutive 7-day repeat dose study, expected toxicity of hematopoietic organs and the gastrointestinal tract were observed and associated with mortality at 75 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day. At 25 mg/kg/day (14.2 μM/hr), all animals su rvived to scheduled necropsies and all observed toxicities were de monstrated to be reversible during the 2- week recovery period. In a 1 month rat toxici ty study, toxicity of hematopoietic organs"
10,page_10,"11 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC (including bone marrow, spleen, thymus, mese nteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches) were observed at ≥10 mg/kg/day in females and at 25 mg/kg/day in males. Serum biochemical changes were observed at 25 mg/kg/day only and consisted mainly of very slight to slight decreases in total protein, albumin, and globul in and very slight increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in females whereas in males, the changes were limited to a slight decrease in globulin. Very slight to slight liver hepatocellular vacuolation, very slight centrilobular degeneration and slight cardiomegaly were observed at ≥10 mg/kg/day in females (except for cardiomegaly observed in females at 25 mg/kg/day only) and at 25 mg/kg/day in males; these findings in the liver and heart were considered to be corre lated with anemia. At 25 mg/kg/day (25 μM/hr in females and 10 μ M/hr in males), all animals survived to scheduled necropsies. In general, findings at 25 mg/kg/day were more marked in females compared to males, and all findings showed a trend towards recovery following a 4-week recovery period. In dogs, similar dosing schedules as studied in rats were evaluated (single dose, once weekly for three weeks, and daily for 7 consecutive days or one month). Severe irreversible toxicity was not observed at the highest dose tested of 36 mg/kg (720 mg/m2) after a single dose and 3-intermittent doses (mean area under the plasma concentration time curve [AUC] from time 0 to 24 hour s postdose [AUC0-24hr] for sexes combined = 17.4 μM/hr and 17.6 μM/hr, respectively). As reported in rats studies, similar hematologic changes were observed in dogs as was reported in rats; notably decreases in reticulocytes. In both the single-dose and 3 intermittent dose studies, reticulocyte counts returned to baseline following the 14-day recovery period and histomorphologic examination revealed normal cellularity in the bone marrow in these studies. In dogs receiving AZD1775 for 7 days, 15 mg/kg/day (9.5 μM/hr) was well tolerated and demonstrated expected toxicities to hematopoi etic organs and the gastrointestinal tract. During a 2-week recovery period, test artic le-related changes recovered or showed a trend towards reversibility. In a 1-month dog repeat dose study, dose levels of 3 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day were administered daily for about 1 month. Dose dependant toxicity of hematopoietic organs (including bone marrow, thymus, lymph nodes, Peyer's patches), gastrointestinal tract, testes as we ll as serum biochemical changes (very slight or slight decreases in total protein, al bumin, and globulin) were observed. At 10 mg/kg/day (3.60 μM/hr), all animals survived to scheduled necropsies. All findings showed a trend towards recovery foll owing the 4-week recovery period. AZD1775 was negative in the Microbial Mutagenesis Assay but positive in in vitro Chromosomal Aberrations Assays and in vivo micronucleus assay. These positive results in the chromosomal aberration assay were not unexpected based on the mechanism of action of AZD1775. Combination treatment with AZD1775 and 5-FU was administered to tumor-bearing female nude rats for up to 5 days with several administration schedules. Test article related hematological changes (decreases in erythroid parameters, reticulocytes, leukocytes, and/or platelets) were observed with the combination treatment with AZD1775 plus 5-FU. There were no remarkab le differences in the severity of these changes across the different AZD1775 administration schedules in combination with 5-FU. These preclinical observations were expected based on the intended pharmacologic action (cytotoxicity) of the compound. The toxic ity profile of AZD1775 in rats and dogs following 1 month of daily dosing was generally consistent with the toxicity profile"
11,page_11,"12 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC previously observed in studies of shorter dura tion. Observations in rat and dog toxicology studies are generally monitorable and with evidence of reversibility within a 4-week recovery period were demonstrated to be re versible following a 2 week recovery period. These studies support continued clinical trials in subjects with advanced stage cancer. 1.4 Clinical Experience with AZD1775 The following overview of the clinical experience with AZD1775 is based on the knowledge available at the time this protocol was written and is based on Edition 12 of the Investigator’s Brochure, Edition 12, dated 18 February 2015, with a data cut-off date of 11 November 2014. For more detailed and up-to-date information, please consult the current Investigator’s Brochure. As of 11 November 2014, a total of 372 pa tients have been exposed to AZD1775 in AstraZeneca-sponsored or Merck-sponsored c linical studies, which include 1 completed study (Study PN001), 2 studies that were terminated early (Studies PN005 and PN008) and 3 ongoing studies (Studies PN004, D6011C00001, and D6011C00002).  PN001: a first-time-in-patients (FTIP), Phase I, dose-escalation study evaluating AZD1775 both as monotherapy and combination therapy with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin in adult patients with advanced solid tumours. This study has been completed except for Part 3.  PN005: a Phase I, dose-escalation study evaluating AZD1775 as monotherapy (Part 1), combination therapy with 5-FU (Part 2), and combination therapy with 5-FU plus cisplatin (Part 3) in adult Japanese patients w ith advanced solid tumours. This study was terminated early due to portfolio pr ioritization in oncology at Merck after 3 patients had been enrolled in Part 1 and 8 patie nts had been enrolled in Part 2. Part 3 was not initiated.  PN008: a Phase I/IIa, dose-escalation study evaluating AZD1775 in combination with topotecan plus cisplatin in adult patients with cervical cancer was terminated early due to portfolio prioritization in oncology at Merck after 7 patients had been enrolled in the dose-escalation part of the study. The Phase IIa part was not initiated.  PN004: a Phase II study evaluating AZD1775 combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with platinum-sens itive p53-mutant ovarian cancer. This study is ongoing.  D6011C00001: a lead-in Phase II multicentre, randomised, double-blind study comparing AZD1775 plus docetaxel with placebo plus docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. This study is ongoing.  D6011C00002: a Phase II study of AZD1775 plus pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by a randomised comparison of pemetrexed and carboplatin with or without AZD1775 in patients with previously un treated stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. This study is ongoing. In addition, 93 patients have also receive d AZD1775 as part of externally-sponsored scientific research. These patients have received single doses per cycle as high as 1300 mg of AZD1775 as monotherapy, 325 mg of AZD1775 in a single-dose in combination"

The MTD of AZD1775 monotherapy has not been established. Single doses of AZD1775 up to 1300 mg were well tolerated. The MTDs of AZD1775 when administered with chemotherapy are presented in the table below: Maximum-tolerated doses of AZD1775 when admini stered in combination with chemotherapy Chemotherapy Dose Frequency AZD1775 (mg) Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Day 1 weekly for 3 consecutive weeks out of every 4 weeks Single-dose 200 Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21 days Single-dose 200 Carboplatin AUC 5 on Day 1 every 21 days Single-dose 325 Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Day 1 weekly for 3 consecutive weeks out of every 4 weeks Multi-dose 175 QD x2 days Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21 days Multi-dose 200 BID x 2.5 days Carboplatin AUC 5 on Day 1 every 21 days Multi-dose 225 BID x 2.5 days BID = twice daily; QD = once daily There were no DLTs observed for patients receiving monotherapy with AZD1775. For combination treatments, DLT rates at all MTDs were less than 30% in Study PN001. Oral administration of AZD1775 both as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin in pa tients with advanced solid tumours was tolerable. Based on the safety data from the 3 complete d clinical studies, the most frequently reported drug-related AEs were blood a nd lymphatic disorders (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia), gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea), and general disorders and administration site conditions (fatigue, pyrexia). The most frequently reported SAEs occurred within the gastrointestinal, infections and infestations, and blood and lymphatic disorder s system organ classes. The SAEs reported to be related to study medica tion in PN001 included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastric ulcer, colitis, dehydration, pyrexia, hemiparesi s, renal impairment, renal failure, urinary tract infection, dyspnoea, recall phenomenon, palpitations, lung infiltration, agitation, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, increased blood creatinine, and hyperbilirubinaemia. Events that led to death in that study included malignant neoplasm progression, renal failure, respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypoxia, and lung infiltration. Cardiac disorders (tachycardia, palpitations , QTc prolongation) and gastrointestinal haemorrhage were not observed frequently, but are considered to be important potential risks."
13,page_13,"14 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC The single-dose maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for both the gemcitabine and cisplatin combination therapies was 200 mg of AZD1775. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) tended to be hemato logical in nature (i.e. leukopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) in the gemcitabine group and constitutional (i.e. diarrhea and dehydration) in the cisplatin group. The single-dose MTD for the combination with carboplatin was 325 mg of AZD1775. DLTs in this group were related to serum chemistry. Hematologic DLTs were most comm only observed in the multiple-dose AZD1775 combination treatment groups with gemcitabine and cisplatin. An MTD of AZD1775 in combination with gemcitabine was established with a dose of 175 mg QD x 2 days during Week 1 with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks, every 4 weeks. Two DLTs (grade 3 febrile neutropenia and grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) increase) were observed at 200 mg once daily for 2 days with the regimen in combination with gemcitabin e. The dose was adjusted to 175 mg once daily for 2 days, and one DLT has been reported to date. The MTD for combination with cisplatin has been exceeded at the 250 mg dose level, and tolerability of the MTD at 200 mg BID has been confirmed. DLTs observed in the multiple-dose carboplatin combination have been both hematological and constitutional in nature. The multiple-dose MTD in combination with carboplatin is AZD1775 225 mg BID. The MTD for AZD1775 in combination with 5-FU was not reached due to early study termination. DLTs of encephalopa thy and hyponatraemia were observed in the AZD1775 20 mg BID in combination with 1000 mg/m2 5-FU treatment group. Triplet-based therapy was administer ed in the study PN004 with AZD1775, carboplatin, and paclitaxel. The starti ng dose of 225 mg AZD1775 (BID for 5 total doses) in Part 1 was generally we ll tolerated. One patient experienced a DLT in the first six patients treated and the dose remained at 225 mg BID 2.5 days. A total of 15 patients were treated, with 3 DLTs being reported (grade 3 and 4 febrile neutropenia and grade 4 th rombocytopenia). The study expanded to Part 2 and is ongoing. Other toxicities were generally blood and lymphatic system disorders and gastrointestinal. For the combination of AZD1775 with topotecan plus cisplatin in study PN008, toxicities were generally hematological and gastrointestinal in nature. No unexpected toxicities were observed. In study PN009 and the premarket fo rmulation substudy to PN001 (both combining 2.5-day BID dosing of AZD1775 with carboplatin) there were no appreciable differences in toxicity from the ones observed in the carboplatin arm of study PN001. However, increased hematological toxicity was observed, which is considered to be a function of a drug-drug interaction with aprepitant (which was administered as anti-nausea medication in these studies)."

Post-peak plasma concentrations declined essentia lly in a mono-exponential manner with a t1/2 in the region of 10 hours. Exposure as measured by maximum plasma drug concentration observed (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC 0- ∞) increased in a dose-proportional manner over the dose ra nge of 325 to 1300 mg. The urinary excretion of AZD1775 was investigated after single-oral-dose monotherapy at 325, 650, and 1300 mg of AZD1775. The mean percent of total AZD1775"
15,page_15,"16 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC excreted unchanged in urine over a 24-hour period was 5.15% to 11.9%, which is comparable to what was observed in pr eclinical species (urinary excretion as unchanged drug in rats and dogs were ~8.6% and 11.8% of the dose, respectively, over a 48-hour collection in terval). The mean renal clearance of AZD1775 at 325 mg was approximately 2.30 L/hour (38.3 mL/minute), below that expected due to filtration alone (based on an AZD1775 unbound fraction of 39.5% and a typical glomerular filtr ation rate of 120 mL/minute) of 47.4 mL/minute, indicating that net reabsorption appeared to be taking place. Overall, the results suggest that urinary excretion is not the major route of AZD1775 elimination Following single (100 to 325 mg) and multiple dose administrations of AZD1775 (25 to 325 mg BID and 100 to 200 mg once daily [QD]) with carboplatin, cisplatin, and gemcitabine, plasma expos ure of AZD1775 was consistent with predictions based on the single-dose regimen. The median Tmax values were between 1.02 and 4.25 hours. Given a t1/2 of approximately 10 hours, steady- state was expected to be achieved after approximately 3 days of AZD1775 treatment in adult patients. Accumulation ratios for AZD1775 BID doses (geometric mean ratio = Day 3/Day 1) for the area under the plasma-concentration time curve from ti me 0 to 8 hours post dose (AUC 0-8hr), Cmax, and plasma drug concentration observed at 8 hours post dose (C 8hr) averaged 0.991 to 3.82, 0.928 to 3.32, and 1.01 to 2.98, respectively, across tested AZD1775 BID doses in combination with gemcita bine, cisplatin, and carboplatin. Preliminary investigation of drug-drug in teractions in Study PN001 suggest a 40 up to 60% increase in the exposure of AZD1775 in the presence of aprepitant (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor), but no eff ect with the concomitant administration of steroids (moderate CYP3A4 inducers). Preliminary studies also suggested that the Pre-marketed Oral Formulation (PMF) of AZD1775 was similar to that of the Fit-For-Purpose (FFP) formulation. Preliminary PK data from a Japanese combination study with AZD1775 and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)5FU suggests that the pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 in Japanese and Caucasian patients were simila r, however, further work is ongoing. Pharmacodynamics evaluation PN001: Skin biopsies were obtained from patients in all 3 parts of this study in order to evaluate the pharmacodynamic eff ects of AZD1775 in a surrogate tissue. Formalin-fixed and paraffi n- embedded skin samples were analysed by immunohistochemical staining for the presence of total and phosphorylated levels of the WEE1 kinase substrate CDC2 (CDK1). Since CDC2 is expressed and phosphorylated in a cyclical manner and only observed in proliferating cells in the epidermis, the data was reported as the percent of CDC2-positive cells that were also pCDC2 positive. Post treatm ent values obtained from this scoring method were divided by the same value derived from the matched pre-treatment biopsy to generate a post/pre ratio to re flect the changes in pCDC2 observed at the time of the biopsy (see IB v12 for additional details). Additional pharmacodynamic inhibtion has been observed in a monotherpy study run by the NCI. Paired tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline and 2 to 5 hours"
16,page_16,"17 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC after the 5th dose of the first week of ad ministration of drug. Dramatic reductions in pY15-Cdk levels (67%, 84%, and 90% co mpared to baseline) were found in 3 of 5 paired tumor biopsies with 2 of tho se patients also demonstrating concurrent evidence of DNA damage response based on increased levels of γH2AX level on post-treatment tumor biopsy (Do et al., ASCO 2014) 1.5 Study Design and Treatment This study is a phase II study testing the clin ical efficacy of combined AZD1775 with AraC or single agent activity of AZD1775 in three patient strata: Elderly newly diagnosed AML patients (Arm A) will only receive the combination; whereas relapsed/refractory AML patients and HMA fa ilure MDS patients will be allocated to either the combination (Arm B) or single agent AZD1775 (Arm C). The study will have a run in safety cohort of six patients in each of the three arms to determine the safe use of combined AraC /AZD1775 or single agent AZD 1775 in the patient pop ulations. This will be followed by an expansion phase where el derly patients with newly diagnosed AML will receive a combination of AZD1775 and AraC (Arm A) while patients with relapsed or refractory AML or HMA failure MDS will be allocated to receive either AZD1775 with AraC (Arm B) or AZD1775 alone (Arm C). An early toxicity check will be conducted to determine safety an d tolerability. If indicated, dose levels will be reduced. The study will continue to enroll the rest of the patients at the tolerated dose. 1.51 Rationale for AraC and AZD1775 Dosing Schedule, Dose Selection and Dosing Arms: Dose and Schedule of AraC: AraC is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog that functions as an antimetabolite in a cell cycle specific manner. When given in high doses and in combination with other cytoreductive agents AraC can be too toxic in the elderly patients and t hose with relapsed/refractory disease. Subcutaneously administered low-do se AraC (defined as 5 to 10 mg/m2/d or 20mg fixed dose twice daily) for 10-12 days has been employed for specific AML subpopulations since 1979, with co mplete remission (CR) rates generally around 10-20% at maximum (Cheson et al. 1986). It is frequently used as a comparator arm in large phase 3 trials or in combination studies with other agents (Kantarjian et al. 2012, Fenaux et al. 2009). Clinically, AraC can be given at low, intermediate and high dose concen tration schedules. The strongest pre- clinical ex vivo and in vitro sensitization effects to AZD1775 occurred at low to moderate AraC concentrations of 9- 120 nanoMolar (nM) (Tibes et al.2012). Whereas, antagonism was seen at very high concentrations (AraC > 1000nM, AZD1775 > 1000nM), concentrations that clinically resemble high dose AraC dosing schedules. As the mechanism is not yet fully understood, we postulate that for maximum anti-leukemic activity of co mbined AraC and AZD1775, there has to remain a low level proliferation with incorporation of AraC into the DNA of dividing leukemia cells upon c oncurrent inhibition of WEE1 kinase. This results in abrogation of the DNA repair machinery (Tibes, ASCO 2014) and cell death/apoptosis originating directly from the damaged DNA. Therefore, we propose to use AraC that can achieve concentrations of up to 50-100nM, comparable to the pre-clinical data."
17,page_17,"18 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC Dose and Schedule of AZD1775: The optimal concentrations of AZD1775 in combination with AraC are in the range of 100-600nM based on in vitro and ex vivo data (Tibes et al, Blood 2012). Ph armacokinetic data for AZD1775 is available from the ongoing solid tumor Phase 1 trial. AZD1775 at once or twice daily dosing up to 200 to 225 mg orally (po) in combination with full doses of Gemcitabine, Cisplatin or Carboplatin w as well tolerated (Schellens et al. 2011, Leijenet al. 2010, IB AZD1775, Feb. 2015). The half-life of AZD1775 is ~9 hrs and C trough for AZD1775 is up to 570nM, with an unbound concentration of 225nM. Based on preliminary population PK model, simulations suggest that once daily dosing of 200 mg AZD1775 for 7 days will result in a median plasma trough total concentration level of 172 nM (range: 8-740 nM) for AZD1775. The unbound concentration will be 67 nM (3-292 nM). This would be in the range at which pre-clinically single agent activ ity and sensitization has been observed (Tibes et al, Blood 2012). AZD1775 dosing length: Currently there is a Phase 1/2 solid tumor single agent AZD1775 trial ongoing at the National Cancer Institute at 225mg orally BIDX5 for 2 weeks of a 3 week schedule. Additional studies investigating alternative more prolonged dosing schedules are underway. Information of toxicity and tolerability will be available prior to ope ning this protocol and inform the initial AZD1775 dosing strategies: to be given either 225mg continuously for 28 days as proposed; or alternative dosing may be explored i.e. 5 days on, 2 days off, 5 days on or only concurrently for 10 days during days of AraC administration. Either scheduling has a clinical rationale as there are 10 and 12 day dosing schedules for AraC given subcutaneously . If continuous dosing of AZD1775 is tolerated in ongoing studies, AraC will be given for 10 days. If a 5 on, 2 off, 5 on AZD1775 schedule is selected than Ar aC will be given for 12 days. 1.52 AZD1775 alone vs. AZD1775 plus AraC AZD1775 ex vivo and in vitro has single agent activity against myeloid malignant cells from relapsed/refractor y AML and HMA failure MDS patients. Pre-clinical data provides support for concu rrent exposure to both agents at lower AraC and moderate AZD1775 concentrations and these dosing concentrations are hypothesized to have the optimal biological effect. Further, the available clinical trial data of AZD1775 alone or with full dose cytotoxic chemotherapies is showing good tolerability without excessi ve cytopenias [cytopenias are less concern for the patient population under study in this protocol]. Clinical trials, including single investigational agents are recommended standard interventions for the patient population in this protoc ol. Therefore patients with relapsed or refractory AML or HMA failure MDS will be allocated to, either AZD1775 or AZD1775 plus AraC treatment. For patient s with newly diagnosed AML, AraC should in most cases be part of the upfront therapeutic regimens, therefore newly diagnosed untreated elderly AML patients will only be allocated to the combination treatment Arm of AZD1775 plus AraC. The dosing length/schedule of AZD1775 will be informed by the em erging clinical data from the ongoing continuous single agent AZD1775 trial. 2.0 Goals 2.1 Primary Goals"

MTD for the safety portion will be defined as the dose level below the lowest dose that induces dose-limiting toxicity in at least one-third of patients (at least 2 of a maximum of 6 new patients). 7.71 Three patients will be treated at a gi ven dose level combination and observed for one cycle to assess toxicity (accrual will be suspended while the 3 patients are treated and observed). 7.72 If DLT is not seen in any of the 3 patie nts or in 1 of 3 patients, 3 new patients will be accrued. and treated at the same dose level (accrual will be suspended while the 3 patients are treated and observed). If DLT is seen in 2 or 3 of 3 patients treated at a given dose level, then the next 3 patients will be treated at the next lower dose level, if only 3 patients were enrolled and treated at this lower dose level. 7.73After enrolling 6 patients on a specific dose level, if DLT is observed in 1 or less patients, then the combination dose will be considered safe for the expansion phase. If DLT is observed in at least 2 of 6 patients, then the MTD will have been exceeded and defined as the previous dose unless only 3 patients were treated at the lower dose level. In that case, 3 additional patients will be treated at this lower dose level. 7.75 If a patient fails to complete one cy cle of treatment for reasons other than dose- limiting toxicity defined adverse events , the patient will be regarded as non- informative for estimating the MTD and an additional patient will be treated at the current dose level. 7.8 Dose escalation will not be allowed for a patient. 7.9a For this protocol, the patient must return to the consenting institution for evaluation at least once every 28 days. 7.9b Local Medical Doctor (LMD) When it has been determined that a patient’s malignant disease is stable or objective tumor regression has been observed and th e patient is tolerating therapy without excessive toxicity, the drug(s) may be admi nistered by the patient’s Local Medical Doctor (LMD). The registering physician retains responsibility for the patient. In this case, a written statement outlining drug dosage, method of administration, follow- up tests required, and telephone number to call to discuss any questions with the responsible investigator must be sent with the patient to provide necessary information to the LMD. The LMD will be required to supervise the administration of the study drugs as stipulated in the protocol and provid e written documentation that the drug was administered."
33,page_33,"34 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC 8.0 Dosage Modification Based on Adverse Events - If multiple adverse events are seen, administer dose based on greatest reduction required for any single adverse event observed. Dose modifications apply to the treatment given in th e preceding cycle and are based on adverse events observed since the prior dose. Dose modification recommendations listed below are general guidelines, and appropriate dose adjustments for patient safety should be done if needed per treating physici an discretion. ALERT: ADR reporting may be required for some adverse events. See Section 10.0. 8.1 Dose Modification Individual drugs can be dose reduced as per the table below de pending on the adverse event attribution. The dose reductions outlined in table 8.11 should first generally apply to AraC. If, however, the AE is clearly due to AZD1775, then AZD1775 can be reduced first as indicated in Table 8.11 . After cycle 2, these modifications should be regarded as guidelines to produce mild‐to‐moderate, but not debilitating, side effects. If multiple adverse events are seen, administer dose based on greatest reduction required for any singl e adverse event observed. The treating MD, in discussions with the principal in vestigator, may reduce dose of either AraC or AZD1775 or the length of treatme nt at his or her discretion if it is in the best interest of the patient. 8.11 AZD1775 combined with AraC (Arms A and B) Dose AZD1775 [reduce AZD1775 first if clearly attributed to AZD1775] Cytarabine (AraC) [generally reduce AraC first] 0* 200 mg PO daily days 1-5 & 8-12 20 mg SC twice daily days 1-5 & 8-12 -1 200 mg PO daily days 1-5 & 8-121 10 mg SC twice daily days 1-5 & 8-12 -2 100 mg PO daily days 1-5 & 8-12 10 mg SC twice daily days 1-5 & 8-122 *Starting dose. 1If toxicity is clearly attributable to AZD1775, AZD1775 can be reduced to 100 mg PO daily (days 1-5, 8-12) with continued AraC 20 mg SC twice daily days 1-5, 8-12. 2AraC may be decreased to 10 mg or 20 mg SC once daily at physicians discretion based on myelosupression, tolerance and clinical benefit (see also dose modification section .

Note: Further dose modifications can be made , i.e. 150 mg PO daily days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19. The above dose modification tables consider the fact that at present it is not clear if dose (Cmax) or continuous (length of th erapy, AUC, trough) dosing of AZD1775 will achieve better disease control, hence the dose modification scheme (i.e. compared to hydroxyurea experience and titration). 8.2 A new course of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if: • AZD1775 or AraC related adverse event that may have occurred has resolved to ≤ Grade 2 severity, except hematological adverse events for WBC, ANC, Platelets and Hemoglobin, or per table 8.3 guidelines. If these conditions are not met on scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle, the subject will be evaluated as clinically indicated (i.e. weekly but at least every other week) and the new cycle of treatment will not be initiated until the adverse event has resolved as described above. Treatment can be continued on the drug that is not associated with the adverse event at the start of the following cycle and the drug associated with the adverse event may be reintroduced when the adverse event resolves to ≤ Grade 1 if the treating physician feels that the patient will derive benefit from continued AraC or AZD1775 alone. NOTE: If the patient experiences a significant adverse event requiring a dose reduction at the start of the next cycle, then the dose will remain lowered for that entire subsequent cycle. If that cycle is completed with no further adverse events >Grade 2, then the dose may be increased, at the investigator’s discretion, one level at a time, in the following cycles. 8.3 Dose modification table for adverse events felt to be at least possibly related to AZD1775*** or AraC   Use the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0* unless otherwise specified  "

All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site: (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic applications/ctc.htm ) 10.11 Adverse event monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. First, identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. Next, determine whether the event is e xpected or unexpected (see Section 10.2) and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.3). With this information, determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report (see Secti on 10.4). Expedited re ports are to be completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in Section 10.4. All AEs reported via expedited mech anisms must also be reported via the routine data reporting mechanisms defined by the protocol (see Sections 10.6 and 18.0). 10.12 Each CTCAE term in the current version is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientif ic analysis and is a single MedDRA Lowest Level Term (LLT). Grade is an esse ntial element of the Guidelines and, in general, relates to severity for the purposes of regulatory reporting to NCI. NOTE: A severe AE, as defined by the above grading scale, is NOT the same as serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 10.13 Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment are only considered adverse events if they wor sen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol). Adverse events occurring before starting study treatment but after signing the in formed consent form are not recorded. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy, and are recorded. 10.14 Any serious adverse event occurring after the patient has provided informed consent, has started taking the study medication, and until 4 weeks after the patient has stopped study participation must be reported. This includes the period in which the study protocol interferes wi th the standard medical treatment given to a patient (e.g. treatment withdraw al during washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of concom itant medication). The period after discontinuing study drug may be extended if there is a strong suspicion that the"

NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience that is neither identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information provided for IRB review nor mentioned in the consent form. 10.3 Assessment of Attribution When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s). Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s). Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s). Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event . 10.31 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) on the SAME Arm NOTE: When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same treatment arm as the investiga tional agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire combination (arm) is then considered an investigati onal intervention for reporting. Routine Reporting  Routine AE reporting for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies using an investigational agent /intervention in combination with a commercial agent is stated in the protocol. See Section 10.6.  Routine AE reporting using an investigational agent/intervention and a commercial agent in combination must be reported as defined by the general guidelines provided by sponsors, Groups, Cancer Centers, or Principal Investigators. See Section 10.6. Expedited Reporting"

54,page_54,"55 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC Objectives and overview of correlative studies: The below assays and studies to be perfo rmed are suggested at the time of protocol writing. Based on novel insights into the biology of WEE1 inihibition and AML/MDS that will arise during the protocol duration, below experiments may be adjusted to reflect the current state of the art knowledge. 1. WEE1 inhibition causes DNA damage and apoptosis. The degree of DNA damage in combination with AraC is unknown. Assessment of DNA damage induction by γH2AX and apoptosis by cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) as measured by flow cytometry on patient specimens at baseline and on follow up specimens, preferably on marrow aspirates, alternativ ely on peripheral blood samples will be conducted. Cell cycle distribution anal ysis and co-staining for total and phosphorylated CDK1/2 may be performed (using propidium iodide staining) at the same time points for samples with sufficient material. 2. Preclinical experiments (R.Tibes Lab) suggest that the damage and cell death induction is mainly/stronger in an earlie r, leukemia “stem cell like” population. Therefore the “stemness” of a γH2AX/CC3 dual positive population will be assessed by co-staining for CD34+/38- cell surface markers in parallel with γH2AX/CC3 by multi-color flow cytometry. Alternatively, selection of CD34+/38- cells can be performed with subsequent staining for γH2AX/CC3. 3. In vitro we have shown that WEE1 protein expression may correlate with sensitivity to the AraC/AZD1775 combination. WEE1 protein expression levels in baseline marrow or peripheral blood may be assessed as well as WEE1 mRNA expression levels (could be deduced from RNAseq experiments below). 4. In unpublished work we have found a potential modulation of DNA damage response genes/proteins by WEE1 kinase inhibition. We will examine changes in total and phosphorylation forms of essential DNA repair proteins within the HR repair pathway, transcript genes cha nges under treatment with single agent AZD1775 and in the combination with AraC. 5. The role of myeloid specific mutations is unknown. Hence mutational/targeted sequencing of hematology/myeloid specific genes will be performed by targeted sequencing of gene panels or WES at base line, at time of best response and at disease progression. A saliva sample will be used as germline control. 6. It is hypothesized that AZD1775 activity is independent of mutated/functional p53. p53 mutation status will be assessed by direct sequencing of the p53 gene (i.e. Sanger, Roche AmpliChip). Potentially, induction of p21 in fresh samples will be assessed as a transcriptional readout of functional p53 status. 7. Next Generation Sequencing - RNA sequencing: WEE1 target genes are master transcriptional regulators. Therefore we will use next generation sequencing for RNA and microRNAs to assess transcriptional changes before, during and after therapy. Expression and differential regulation for the WEE1 published signature genes [claspin, FBXO5, MCM10, CCNE 1 and 2] in patient specimens at baseline and follow up samples will be assessed, as well as p21 and HR pathway genes."
55,page_55,"56 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC 15.0 Drug Information 15.1 AZD1775 15.11 Background: AZD1775 is a highly selective, adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) competitive, small molecule inhibitor of Wee1 kinase, that is involved in regulation of intra-S and G2 cell cycle checkpoints through phosphorylation and inhibition of CDK2 and CDK1, respectively. AZD1775 has significant selectivity over other tested protein kinases. In vitro, AZD1775 inhibits Wee1 activity and induces DNA damage as well as G2 checkpoint escape in cell based assays. AZD1775 increases cytotoxicity when used in combination with DNA damaging agents, such as gemcitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin and topotecan, in p53-deficient cell lines. In vivo, AZD1 775 was well tolerated and showed enhancement of anti-tumor efficacy by gemcitabine, carboplatin, cisplatin, 5- fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine in nude rat xenograft tumor models. Similarly, in nude mouse xenograft models, AZD1775 treatment resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition at tolerated doses, and also enhanced the anti-tumor growth effect of gemcitabine, carboplatin, and radiation therapy. 15.12 Formulation: AZD1775 is currently available as dry filled capsules for oral administration containing 25, 100 or 200 mg of AZD1775 with the following excipients: lactose, microcrystallin e cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. 15.13 Preparation and storage : Capsules are packaged in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, and should be stored at room temperature, no more than 30° C. For further information, refer to the investigational product label. Provided by AstraZeneca. 15.14 Administration: 200 mg PO (or respective dose) once daily either 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal 15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : The PK data of AZD1775 following a single oral administration showed a moderate rate of absorption with a Tmax occurring at 3 to 4 hours. Post -peak plasma concentrations declined essentially in a mono-exponential manner with a t1/2 in the region of 10 hours. Exposure as measured by maximum plasma drug concentration observed (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC)0- ∞ increased in a dose- proportional manner over the dose range of 325 to 1300 mg. Following single (100 to 325 mg) and multiple dose administrations of AZD1775 (25 to 325 mg BID and 100 to 200 mg once daily [QD]) with carboplatin, cisplatin, and gemcitabine, plasma exposure of AZD1775 was consistent with predictions based on the single-dose regimen. AZD1775 was moderately bound to plasma proteins in all species tested, with the unbound fractions (at AZD1775 concentration of 1 μM) in plasma from the rat, dog and human being 23.2, 40.0, and 39.5%, respectively. Binding to plasma proteins was independent of AZD1775 concentration (0.1-10 μM) in the rat and human, but an increase in unbound fraction from 30.6% at 0.1 μM to 45.4% at 10 μM was observed in the dog. CYP3A4 is the"
56,page_56,"57 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC major CYP isoform involved in the oxidative metabolism of AZD1775, to the N-demethylated product. In addition, studies with flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) enzymes indicated that FMO3 and FMO5 were involved in formation of the N-oxide derivative of AZD1775. 15.16 Potential Drug Interactions : The following treatments and all the medications listed in Appendix VI are prohibited while in this study. Any further questions regarding concomitant treatments should be referred to the sponsor:  No other investigational therapy should be given to patients. No anticancer agents other than the study medications should be given to patients. If such agents are required for a patient, then the patient must first be withdrawn from the study.  No formal clinical drug interaction studies have been performed with AZD1775. An exploratory assessment of the effect of aprepitant on AZD 1775 exposure in oncology patients suggests that there is a drug interaction between AZD1775 and aprepitant, as exposure to AZD1775 increased by ~60% when aprepitant was co-administe red with AZD1775. The observed increase in AZD1775 exposure is likely the result of CYP3A4 inhibition by aprepitant. This increase in exposure is statistically significant. At the selected MTDs, this increase may also be of clinical importance. Therefore, concomitant treatment with aprepitant and fosaprepitant is not allowable per protocol until further evaluation. Potent or moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, sensitive CYP3A4 substrates, and CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic wi ndow should be avoided until additional data on drug-drug interaction becomes available (Appendix VI).  In vitro data suggests that AZD1775 may also be a weak reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of AZD1775 and agents that are sensitive substrates of CYP2C19, or substrates of this enzyme with narrow therapeutic range; refer to Appendix VI for a list of sensitive substr ates of CYP2C19, or substrates of this enzyme with narrow therapeutic range.  AZD1775 has been shown to be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vitro with a maximum measured response between donors of 39.9% to 93.1% (at 10 μ M) and 18.6% to 32.5% (at 5 μM) of the positive control omeprazole (50 μM), respectively. Given the nature of the AZD1775 dosing schedule, however, the risk of induction in the c linic is considered low. No specific precautions are recommended at this time, except to be initia lly vigilant when using substrates of CYP1A2 with a narrow therapeutic range.  In vitro studies have shown that AZD1775 may be a substrate and inhibitor for human P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Caution should be exercised when agents that are inhibitors or substrates of P-gp are administered concomitantly with AZD1775 (see Appendix VI).  Recent in vitro transporter studies have shown AZD1775 to be an inhibitor of BCRP (IC50 5.1 µM). This finding is particularly relevant for drugs administered orally where exposure is normally limited by BCRP-mediated efflux, in particular some statins. Modelling has predicted a substantial increase in the exposure of Atorvast atin when co-administered with AZD1775 and the"
57,page_57,"58 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC use of Atorvastatin is therefore prohibited in the current study. Other drugs where the disposition is mediated via BCRP should be administered with caution, dose modification considered or substituted by an alternative drug (Appendix VI).  AZD1775 has been shown to be an inhibitor or MATE1 and MATE2K transporters. A drug interaction with substrates of either transporter cannot be ruled out, the most important substrate known to date being metformin.  Herbal preparations/medications are not allowed throughout the study. These herbal medications include, but are not limited to: St. John’s wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng. Patients should stop using these herbal medications 14 days prior to first dose of AZD1775. . 15.17 Known potential toxicities : Based on the preliminary safety data available, the most frequent adverse events observed were blood and lymphatic disorders (anemia, febrile neutropenia), gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation), general disorders and administration site conditions (fatigue, fever, chills), and investigation findings (thromboc ytopenia, neutropenia, hematology and serum chemistry). 15.18 Drug procurement: Drug will be provided by AstraZeneca. 15.2 Cytarabine (AraC) 15.21 Background: Cytarabine (cytosine arabinos ide) inhibits DNA synthesis. Cytosine gains entry into cells by a carrier process, and then must be converted to its active compound, aracytidine triphosphate. Cytosine is a pyrimidine analog and is incorporated into DNA; however, the primary action is inhibition of DNA polymerase resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and repair. Cytarabine is specific for the S phase of the cell cycle (blocks progression from the G1 to the S phase). 15.22 Formulation: Commercially available for injection, powder for reconstitution: 100 mg, 500 mg, 1 gram, 2 gram 15.23 Preparation, storage, and stability : Store intact vials of powder at room temperature 15ºC to 30ºC (59ºF to 86ºF). Reconstitute with bacteriostatic water for injection. Reconstituted solutions are stable for up to 8 days at room temperature, although the ma nufacturer recommends use within 48 hours. Further dilution in 250-1000 mL of D5W or 0.9% NaCL is stable for 8 days at room temperature (25C). Note: Solutions containing"
58,page_58,"59 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC bacteriostatic agents should not be used for the preparation of either high doses or intrathecal doses of cytarabine. 15.24 Administration: Low-dose cytarabine (LD-AraC) will be administered at a starting dose of 20 mg BID subcutaneously (sc) for 10 days of a 28-day cycle., with dosing adjustments as outlined in section 8. 15.25 Pharmacokinetic information : Distribution: V d: Total body water; widely and rapidly since it enters the cells readily; crosses blood-brain barrier with CSF levels of 40% to 50% of plasma level Metabolism: Primarily hepatic; metabolized by deoxycytidine kinase and other nucleotide kinases to aracytidine triphosphate (active); about 86% to 96% of dose is metabolized to inactive uracil arabinoside. Half-life elimination: I.V.: Initial: 7-20 minutes; Terminal: 1-3 hours. Excretion: Urine (~80%) within 24 hours. 15.26 Potential Drug Interactions : Decreased Effect: Cytarabine may decrease the effect of Flucytosine; cytarabine may decrease digoxin absorption. 15.27 Known potential adverse events: Consult the package insert for the most current and complete information.

Pharmacies or clinics shall obtain supplies from normal commercial supply chain or wholesaler. 16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology 16.1 Overview: This study is a phase II screening study. It is divided into two portions. The safety portion is designed to determine the dose of the treatment agents. The expansion portion is designed to continue enrollment at the accep table dose levels to determine efficacy of treatment in elderly (age 60+) newly diag nosed AML patients (Arm A: AZD1775 days 1- 5 & 8-12) and AraC days 1-5 & 8-12) and to make a selection of one of the two randomized arms for Relapsed/Refractory AML and HMA failure MDS patients (Arm B: AZD1775 days 1-5 & 8-12) and AraC days 1-5 & 8-12; Arm C: AZD1775 days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26). The purpose of this screening design is NOT TO ensure a high probability that the very best treatment is selected, but to ensure a low probability that a poor treatment is selected. In other words, at the conclusion of this trial, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the superiority of one treatment compared to the other, but we can ensure that there is a small probability of bringing the inferior treatment forward. 16.2 Statistical Design and Analysis for the Primary Endpoint 16.21 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint of this trial is the rate of complete response (CR plus CRi). Throughout Section 16.0, complete resp onse will be considered synonymous with “success”, unless specified otherwi se. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria, who have signed a consent form , and have begun treatment at the study MTD will be evaluable for complete response, with the exception of patients who are determined to be a major treatment violation. Treatment Responses will be assessed by standard cr iteria for the respective disease per NCCN guidelines or according to specific criteria from expert panels (i.e. the International Working Group Criteria for the response in acute myeloid leukemias). Response will be assessed by peripheral blood criteria at the end of each cycle and every other cycle (for MDS) thereafter (Burnett et al. 2007. Gileset al. 2005, Kantarijian et al. 2012, Fenaux et al. 2009). Bone marrow tests to assess responses will be carried as outlined in the study tables Table 4.1 and 4.2."
60,page_60,"61 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC 16.22 Arm A: Efficacy and safety of AZD1775 + AraC in elderly newly diagnosed AML Statistical Design, Analysis and Decision Rule Efficacy and safety of AZD1775 + AraC will be tested in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML using a single-arm single-stage binomial design. The primary endpoint will be the complete r esponse rate, which will be defined as an objective status of CR or CRi. Complete response rate will be evaluated over all cycles of study treatment. The proportion of CR/CRi responses will be estimated by the number of CR/CRi responses divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be computed using an exact binomial confidence interval. The frequen cy and relative frequency of individual response categories will also be computed . For a subject to be considered evaluable for statistical analysis, the subject must be eligible, provide consent, initiate treatment and not experience a ma jor treatment violation during the first cycle of treatment. The largest CR/CRi response proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population is 15% (Burnett et al. 2007. Gileset al. 2005, Kantarijian et al. 2012, Fenaux et al. 2009) and the smallest CR/CRi response proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population is 40%. The following one-stage binomial design uses 21 patients to test the null hypothesis that the true CR/CRi response proportion in a given patient population is at most 15%. Decision Rule: Enter 21 patients into the study. If 5 or fewer CR/CRi responses are observed in the first 21 evaluable pa tients, we will consider this regimen ineffective in this patient population. Ot herwise, if 6 or more CR/CRi responses are observed in the first 21 evaluable patients, we may recommend further testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this population. We anticipate accruing an additional 2 patients to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons. Thus, the total maximum accrual to this arm is 23 patients. Assuming that the number of CR/CRi responses is binomially distributed, the significance level within this arm is </= 10% and the probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further studies (i.e., statistical power) under various CR/CRi response proportions can be tabulated as a function of the true CR/CRi response rate as shown in the following table. If the true CR/CRi rate is… 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 Then the probability of declaring that the regimen warrants further studies is… 0.08 0.23 0.43 0.64 0.80 0.90"
61,page_61,"62 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC 16.23 Arm B and C: Efficacy and safety of AZD1775 in combination with AraC compared to AZD1775 alone in relapsed/refractory AML or HMA failure MDS patients. Statistical Design, Analysis and Decision Rule Efficacy and safety of AZD1775 alone or with AraC will be tested in patients with relapsed/refractory AML and pa tients with HMA failure MDS using a flexible randomized phase II selection design. Patients will be randomized to AZD1775 alone or with AraC in a 1:1 fashion using a dynamic allocation procedure ( Pocock & Simon 1975 ). The primary endpoint will be the complete response rate, which will be defined as an objective status of CR or CRi. Complete response rate will be evaluated over all cycles of study treatment. The proportion of CR/CRi responses will be estimated by the number of CR/CRi responses divided by the total number of evaluable patients (by arm). Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be computed using an exact binomial confidence interval. The frequency and relative fre quency of individual response categories will also be computed. Estimates will also be computed by arm separately for each disease. For a subject to be consider ed evaluable for statistical analysis, the subject must be eligible, provide consen t, initiate treatment and not experience a major treatment violation during the first cycle of treatment. The selected design is a flexible randomized phase II selection design (Sargent & Goldberg 2001). This study will rando mize 40 evaluable patients (20 per arm). The minimum required number of CR/CRi res ponses for an arm to be considered as having evidence of efficacy is 3 (out of 20 evaluable patients). This decision rule is based on a single-arm single-stage binomial design testing the null hypothesis that the true CR/CRi response proportion in a given arm is at most 5% (Tawfik et al. 2014, Giles et al. 2005, Jabour et al. 2010, Prevet et al. 2011) with the smallest CR/CRi response proportion warranting subsequent studies being 25%. In the event that both arms meet this de cision rule for efficacy, the combination arm will be considered as having additiona l efficacy over the single-agent arm if the CR/CRi response rate on the combination arm is at least 10% greater than the single-agent arm. If the difference is <10%, then the trial is considered statistically ambiguous and the selection between the combination and single-agent arm will be allowed to include ot her factors (e.g., adverse event data) in addition to the CR/CRi response rate. We anticipate accruing an additional 4 patients (2 patients per arm) to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons. Thus, the total maximum accrual to Arm B is 22 patients and to Arm C is 22 patients. Assuming that the number of CR/CRi responses is binomially distributed, the significance level for the single-arm decisi on rule requiring a minimum of 3 (out of 20 evaluable patients) within an ar m is </=10% and the probability of declaring that a given arm’s treatment regimen warrants further studies (i.e., statistical power) under various CR/CRi r esponse proportions can be tabulated as a function of the true CR/CRi response rate as shown in the following table."
62,page_62,"63 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC If the true CR/CRi rate is… 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 Then the probability of declaring that a given arm’s treatment regimen warrants further studies is… 0.08 0.32 0.60 0.79 0.91 Probabilities for the combination arm being selected as the overall winner are provided in the following table. CR/CRi rate (AZD1775 alone) CR/CRi rate (AZD1775 + AraC) Probability combo selected over single-agent arm 0.05 0.05 0.07 0.25 0.25 0.30 0.20 0.25 0.44 0.15 0.25 0.61 0.10 0.25 0.77 0.05 0.25 0.88 16.3 Sample Size, Accrual Rate, and Study Duration This design is expected to accrue 18 patients to the safety portion with the possibility of enrolling up to 54. Six patients in each of the safety arms will be treated at the MTD and thus will be eligible for primary endpoint an alysis. An additional 15 patients in Arm A and 14 patients in both arm B and C will be en rolled per treatment arm in the expansion portion with the addition of another 2 per ar m to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons. Thus the final accrual may be as large as 102 or as low as 67 (Arm A: 23; Arm B: 22; Arm C: 22). The anticipated accrual rate is 4-6 evaluable patients per month. Therefore, the accrual period is expected to be approximately 1. 5-2 years. The primary endpoint will be evaluated approximately 2.5 years after the tr ial opens, or after the last patient accrued has been observed for at least 4 months. Th e total study duration is expected to be approximately 2.5 years. 16.4 Secondary Endpoints 16.41 Safety and tolerability data will be compiled. The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns (by arm, disease and overall). Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. The rate of grade 3 or higher non-hematologic adverse events, and the rate of grade 4 or higher adverse event (hematologic and non-hematologic) will be computed each with a 95% exact binomial confidence interval. 16.42 Summary statistics for clinical be nefit (mean and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for discrete variables) will be compiled for hematologic improveme nts and transfusion requirements."
63,page_63,"64 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC 16.43 Duration of response is defined for all evaluable patients who have achieved a response as the date at which the patient’s earliest best objective status is first noted to be a CR/CRi response to the earliest date progression is documented. If a patient dies subsequent to the response without a documentation of disease progression, the patient will be censored at the last date disease was assessed. In the case of a patient failing to return for evaluations before a documentation of disease progression, the patient will be censored for progression on the date of last evaluation. The distribution of du ration of response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier (1958). 16.44 Time to response/progression is defined as the time from registration to the earliest date of documentation of response/disease progression. If a patient dies without a documentation of disease progression the patient will censored at the last date disease was assessed. In the case of a patient starting treatment and then never returning for any evaluations, the patient will be censored for progression 1 day post-registration. The distribution of time to progression will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier (1958). 16.45 Survival time is defined as the time fro m registration to death due to any cause. The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier (1958). 16.46 Time to AML or death is defined fo r all evaluable patients with MDS as the time from registration to leukemic transformation or death due to any cause. The distribution of time to AML or death will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier (1958). 16.5 Exploratory Analysis An exploratory analysis will be conducted, if there is indication, to determine any differences in study endpoints for subgroups of patients within each treatment arm as defined by the grouping factors (section 5.0), descriptive factors (section 12.0), dose level or any other patient demographics. 16.6 Correlative Research 16.61 Statistical analysis of pharmacoki netics and biomarkers will be primarily descriptive. Continuous biomarker levels will be explored in a graphical manner including mean plots and plots of change and percent change from baseline and other summary measures. Any potential re lationships between the baseline level or change in the level of each biomar ker and clinical outcome such as overall response, 6-month progression and survival, and adverse event incidence will be further analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests or logistic regression methods, as appropriate. Association between a dichotomized biomarker and overall response will be assessed using a chi-squared test. Comparisons with 1-sided p-values ≤0.10 are considered significant. As this correlative component is exploratory in nature, we have not adjusted for multiple comparisons. 16.62 Patient-reported outcomes will be assess ed at baseline and at the end of each cycle of treatment. MPN-SAF TSS was created to address the constellation of"
64,page_64,"65 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC symptoms. The MPN-SAF includes 1 item measuring fatigue from the previously validated Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), as well as linear analog scales capturing early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, concentration problems, numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, night sweats, itching, bone pain, fever, and weight loss. The MPN-SAF TSS has previously been validated for use at a single time point by co-administration with previously validated instruments. Quality of life will be assessed prior to review of treatment response and discussions of patient’s general health since last treatment evaluation. QOL will be measured using the EORTC QL Q-C30, a 30-item patient-reported questionnaire about patient ability to func tion, symptoms related to the cancer and its treatment, overall health and qua lity of life, and perceived financial impact of the cancer and its treatment. 28 of the 30 items are measured on a 1-4 scale (1=not at all; 4=very much) with the remaining two items (overall health and overall quality of life) scored on a 1-7 numeric analogue scale (1=very poor; 7=excellent). The recall period for the EORTC QLQ-C30 is one week. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is the product of more than a decade of collaborative research and to date, more than 2200 studies using the EORTC QLQ-C30 have been registered with the EORTC (Fayers et al, 2001 [EORTC Scoring Manual]). The patient booklet containing this questionnaire will be administered to all willing patients via a paper booklet in clinic at baseline and on day 1 of every cycle starting with Cycle 2, and will be scored according to the published scoring algorithms. Scale score trajectories over time and changes from baseline over time will be examined using repeated measures or growth curve models, as appropriate, stream plots and mean plots with standa rd deviation error bars overall. Scores and changes at each cycle will be statisti cally tested using paired t-tests, and standardized response means (i.e. effect sizes) (mean of the change from baseline scores at a given cycle, divided by the standard deviation of the change scores) will be interpreted (after applying Mi ddel’s (2002) adjustment) using Cohen’s (1988) cut-offs: <0.20 = trivial; 0.20-< 0.50 = small; 0.50-<0.80 = moderate; and >=/0.80 = large. 16.7 Early Safety Analysis An early safety analysis will be performed af ter 6 patients have been accrued to each arm of the study and observed for one cycle. Accrual will be temporarily halted while these patients are evaluated. If 2 or more of th e first 6 patients experience a DLT, as defined below, then the dose level will be reduced as defined in Section 8.0 and another six patients will be treated. If < 2/6 patients experience toxicities defined as DLT, then this dose level will be defined as the operational MTD and moved into the expansion portion. Further dose de-escalation to dose leve l -2 will follow the same guidelines. Should additional modification be necessary, the study will be closed and evaluated by the study team regarding continuation. U pon determination of the safe dose level, the study will re-open for accrual. 16.8 Data & Safety Monitoring:"
65,page_65,"66 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC 16.81 The principle investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that might be developing. The Mayo Clin ic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by the MCCC Statistical Office. 16.82 Adverse Event Stopping Rules: To be evaluated in each arm independently, the stopping rules specified below are based on the knowledge available at study development. We note that the Adverse Event Stopping Rule may be adjusted in the event of either (1) the study re-ope ning to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in consid eration of newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of th e treatment(s) under investigation. The study team may choose to suspend accrua l because of unexpected adverse event profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below. Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe events considered at least possibly rela ted to study treatment (i.e. an adverse event with attribute specified as “possi ble,” “probable,” or “definite”) that satisfy one of the following:  if 3 or more patients in the first 10 treated patients in each arm experience a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event at least possibly related to treatment.  if after the first 10 patients in each arm have been treated, 30% of all patients experience a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event at least possibly related to treatment. NOTE: Only the arm(s) that crosses the stopping boundary rule will be closed, not then overall study accrual. We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatment-related adverse event. 16.9a Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activation, this study will have been registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints along with other required information for this study will be reported on www.ClinicalTrials.gov. For purposes of timing of the Results Reporting, the initial estimated completion date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 2.5 years after the study opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” (PECD) for this study is at the time the last patient registered has been followed for at least 4 months. 16.9b Inclusion of Women and Minorities 16.9b1 This study will be available to all elig ible patients, regardless of race, gender, or ethnic origin."
66,page_66,"67 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC 16.9b2 There is no information currently available regarding differential effects of this regimen in subsets defined by race, gender, or ethnicity, and there is no reason to expect such differences to exist. Therefore, although the planned analysis will, as always, look for differences in treatment effect based on racial and gender groupings, the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power for subset analyses. 16.9b3 The geographical region served by MCCC has a population which includes approximately 3% minorities. Based on prior MCCC studies involving similar disease sites, we expect about 3-5% of patients will be classified as minorities by race and about 33% of patients will be women.

81,page_81,"82 MC1488 Appendix VI: List of prohibit ed concomitant medications and concomitant medications requiring caution DISALLOWED MEDICATIONS AN D MEDICATIONS TO BE ADMINISTERED WITH CAUTION Formal drug-drug interaction studies have not ye t been performed with AZD1775, therefore, the potential for drug-drug interaction described in this prot ocol are based on fi ndings from in vitro studies and clinical experience. In vitro data has shown that AZD1775 is metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4, with an FMO3 and/or FMO5 component. As a result, th ere is potential for th e exposure of AZD1775 to be effected by drugs which inhibit or induce the metabolism of CYP3A4. In the clinic, coadministration of AZD1775 with the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, aprepaitant, resulted in a 60% increase in the plasma levels of AZD 1775. Drugs known to be moderate to strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 ar e therefore prohibited for use in the current study, including aprepitant. In vitro data suggests that AZD1775 may be a weak reversible i nhibitor of CYP2C19 (IC 50 12 uM). Caution should therefore be exercised when AZD1775 is coadministered with agents that are sensitive substrates of CYP2 C19, or substrates of this en zyme with a narrow therapeutic range. Based on in vitro studies, AZD1775 has been show to be a weak reve rsible inhibitor (IC 50 14 µM) and a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (K inact 0.061/min, K i 6.04 µM). The full impact of the time dependent inhibition is currently unknown, however, modelling da ta has predicted an 8-10 fold increase in the exposur e of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates when administered with AZD1775 (250 mg BID for 5 doses). To date, no significant DDI effects ha ve been reported in the clinic that may be related to the TDI finding. However, sensitive CYP3A4 substrates or substrates of CYP3A4 with a narro w therapeutic window are prohibited. AZD1775 has been shown to be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vitro (39% increase in activity of positive control). Given the nature of the AZD1775 dosing schedule, however, the risk of induction in the clinic is considered low. No specific precautions are r ecommended at this time, except to be initially vigilant when using substrates of CYP1A2 with a narrow therapeutic range. Transporter studies (in vitro) have shown that AZD1775 is both a substrate and inhibitor (IC 50 20 µM) of P-gp. Maximum impact of these finding is lik ely to occur for drugs administered orally at the same time as AZD1775. Caution should therefore be exercised when agents that are inhibitors or substrates of P-gp are administered concomitantly with AZD1775. Recent invitro transporter studies have show n AZD1775 to be an inhibitor of BCRP (IC 50 5.1 µM). This finding is particularly relevant fo r drugs administered orally where exposure is normally limited by BCRP-mediated efflux, in particular some statins. Modelling has predicted a substantial increase in the e xposure of Atorvastatin when co administered w ith AZD1775 and the use of Atoravastatin is th erefore prohibited in the current study. Other drugs where the disposition is mediated via BCRP should be administered with caution, dose modification considered or substituted by an alternative drug. Herbal preparations/medications can be substrates, inhibitors and inducers, similar to any registered medication. Herbal preparations are therefore not allowed throughout the study."
82,page_82,"83 MC1488 WEE1 MCCC These herbal medications include, but are not limited to: St. John’s wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng. In addition, any other drugs should be avoided at the Investigator’s discretion if, in their opinion, the co-administration with AZD1775 may increas e the risk of a clinically significant drug interaction.
