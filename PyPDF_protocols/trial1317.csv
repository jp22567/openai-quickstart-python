Number of Patients: Entered: Approximately 207(Phase 1b : 27;Phase 2: 180) Enrolled/Randomized (1:1 randomization [Phase 2 only ]): 186(Phase 1b: 24; Phase 2: 162)Phase 1b: Approximately 24 patients evaluable for dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs). Patients who are not evaluable for DLTs will be replaced. Phase 2: approximately 81patientsper treatment arm Treatment Arms and Duration: All patients enrolled in this study will receive olaratumab/placeboadministered via intravenous (I.V.)infusionin combination withnab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. After study completion, patients on study treatment who continue to experience clinical benefit and no undue risks, in the opinion of the investigator, may continue to receive study treatment until one o f the criter ia for discontinuation is met (see Section 8for details). Postdiscontinuation Follow -Up Period Assessments Terms used to describe the postdiscontinuation of study treatment are defined below: Postdiscontinuation Follow -Up: begins the day after the patient and the investigator agree that the patient will no longer continue study treatment. oThe short -term follow -up period begins the day after the patient and the investigator agree that the patient will no longer continue study treatment and lasts approximately 30 days. oThe long-term follow -up period begins 1 day after the short -term follow -up period is completed and continues until death or end of trial. Continued Access/ Follow -Up The continued access period will apply to this study as long as 1 patient is still on study treatment when study completion occurs. Lilly will notify investigators when the continued access begins. Continued access follow -up (Visit 901) begins 1 day after the patient and the investigator agree that the patient will no longer continue treatment in the continued access period and lasts approximately 30 days . Study Schedule of Activities (Section 2) describe sall assessments for the postdiscontinuation , continued access, and follow-up periods . Study Completion and End of Trial This study wil l be considered complete following the final analysis /evaluation of OS after approximately 113events (deaths) have been recorded . The end of trial occurs after study completion and after the last patient has discontinued from the study for oneof the following reasons: death,lost to follow-up,patient or investigator decis ion to withdraw the patient, or Lilly decision to stop the study. Investigators will continue to follow the study schedule of activities for all patients until notified by Lilly that the end of trial has occurred."

Platelet-derived growth fa ctor receptor (PDGFR)/ platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF) signaling has been shown to be an important signaling regulator in epit helial mesenchymal transition in several types of cancer . Platelet-derived growth factor receptor /platelet-derived growth factorsignaling has been shown to create anautocrine signaling loop in pancreat ic cancer that is an act ive participant in the format ion of desmoplast ic reactionas well as the activat ion of pancreatic stellate cells –hallmarks of pancreatic cancer and i mportant contributors to the pancreatic cancer microenvironment ( Mahadevan and Von Hoff 2007 ). Thus, the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodyspecific to human PDGFRα could provide atherapeutic target in metastatic pancreat ic cancer. Across numerous cancers evaluated based on data fro m The Cancer Geno me Atlas (TCGA) research, overexpressio n of PDGFRα in tumors relative to normal t issue was highest in soft tissue sarco ma(STS) (37.1% overexpressio n)and pancreat ic cancer (41.1% overexpressio n). Overexpression of PDGFRα ligands (PDGF -A, -B, and -C) wasobserved in sarcoma relat ive to normal tissue(PDGF-A 7.6%, PDGF -B 6.7%, and PDGF -C 20%). Though little to no overexpressio n was observed in pancreatic cancer tumors relative to normal pancreas tissue (PDGF-A 0%, PDGF -B 0%, and PDGF -C 5.4%), expressio n levels in normal pancreas were notably higher than expressio n levels in normal soft tissue, suggest ing that despite litt le to no overexpressio n of PDGF ligands in pancreat ic tumors, there are PDGF ligands p resent and overexpressio n of PDGFRα demonstrates necessary co mponents for PDGF signaling with in the tumor microenvironment. Tissue arrayfrom human pancreat ic cancer tumors show that while not direct ly expressed on the tumor, PDGFRα is expressed in pancrea tic cancer tum or stroma (9 of 12 samples)(data in- house). The strong stromal co mponent to pancreatic cancer and the associated PDGFRα staining seen may provide an opportuni ty to disrupt the tumor growth and support provided by PDGFRα signaling by blocking PDGFRα in pancreat ic cancer and its associated tumor stroma (Olaratumab Bi oinformatic Study Report 2015 ). 3.2.Background 3.2.1.Olaratumab Olaratumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1) -type monoclonal antibody that binds to PDGFRα. This anti body possesses high affinit y binding for PDGFRα and blocks PDGF -AA, -BB, and -CC from binding to the receptor. In addit ion to blocking ligand- induced cell mitogenesis and receptor autophosphorylat ion, olaratumab inhibits ligand -induced"
20,page_20,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 20 LY3012207phosphorylat ion of the downstream signaling mo lecules Akt and mitogen -activated protein kinase(Loizoset al. 2005). In 2 Phase 1 dose -escalation trials in patients with solid tumors (I5B-IE-JGDC and I5B-IE- JGDF) and in the 2 Phase 2 monotherapy studies (I5B-IE-JGDE[glioblastoma]and I5B-IE- JGDH[GIST]), single-agent olaratumab has consistently been well tolerated, with no dose - limiting toxicit ies (DLTs) observed up to a dose of 20 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks (q2w) and up to a dose of 16mg/kg administered weekly for 4 weeks fo llowed by 2 weeks off treatment for observati on. Olaratumab has been safely administered in combinat ion with liposomal doxorubi cin in Study I5B-MC-JGDA (olaratumab 20 mg/kg q2w)in patients with ovarian cancer , and with paclitaxel/carbopl atin in Study I5B-IE-JGDB (olaratumab 15 mg/kg on Days1 and 8of a3-weekcycle)in patients with NSCLC . However, certain tox icities,such as neutropeni a and infect ions,were observed at a higher rate for olaratumab plus chemotherapy compared with the chemotherapy alo ne. In the randomized, double -blind Phase 2 study (I5B-MC-JGDG[JGDG]) in patients with so ft tissue sarco ma (STS) , the combinat ion of olaratumab and doxorubicin had an acceptable, monitorable, and m anageable safet y profile even in light of a significantly higher median cumulative doxorubicin exposure in the olaratumab plus doxorubicin arm. An increase in neutropeni a, but not in neutropenic sepsis or febrile neutropenia, has been observed in the olaratumab plus doxorubi cin armcompared with doxorubicinalone. A higher rate of so me known doxorubicin -inducedtoxicities, such as , mucositis, nausea/vo miting, and diarrhea ,in the olaratumab plus doxorubi cin armwas observed ; however, these toxicit ies were readily monitored and manageable and were predominant ly Grade ≤2in severity. The combinat ion of olaratumab and doxorubicin resulted in a statist ically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in median overall survival (OS; 11.8 -month improvement; hazard ratio [ HR]= 0.463, p=0.0003) . An improvement in median progression -free survival (PFS) of2.5 monthswas observed for olaratumab plus doxorubicin over doxorubi cin alone; (stratified HR=0.672 ,p=0.0615 ) and the study met the protocol-defined significance level for the primary endpoint .Exposure -response analysis from StudyJGDG showed that when trough concentration at the end of the first cy cle (Cmin1) was used as the pharmacokinet ic (PK)endpoint, the model predicted an minimum half -maximal effective concentration at the end of the firs t cycle (EC min150) of approximately 66 μg/mL, which corresponds to the 25th percentile of C min1 in the JGDG populat ion. Patients with Cmin1concentrati ons below theECmin150 progressed earlier and had shorter OS than patients with Cmin1above the EC min150. 3.2.2.Pancreatic Cancers Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer -relateddeath in the United States ( US; ACS2016).Incidence rates in both sex are highestin North America and Europe and lowestin Asia and Africa (World Cancer Research Fund Internat ional [WWW]) . In 2016, the number of new cases and deaths of pancreat ic cancer in the U Sfor both sexes areestimated to be 53,070 and 41,780, respectively (Siegel et al. 2016). In 2013, there were estimated to be 9,4 08 new"
21,page_21,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 21 LY3012207cases of pancreatic cancer in the United Kingdo m (UK) in 2013 and 8817 deaths in 2014 ( Cancer Research UK [WWW]). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinom aand its variants account for more than 90% of pancreat ic malignancies (Temperoet al. 2010 ). Difficult y in early detection is a significant factor in the overall poor prognosis for patients with pancreat ic cancer. At the time of diagnosis, the tumor that is confined to the pancreas i s fewer than 10%,and over 50% have distant spread (Howard 1996), limiting the number of patients who are able to seek surgical resect ion as a treatment option. Gemcitabine was approved by US Food and Drug Administration in 1996 as treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer and was the standard of care for first -line metastatic pancreat ic patients. Since that time, 2 regimens, FOLFIRINOX (Conroy et al. 2011) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel(Von Hoff et al. 2011, 2013) , have supplanted gemcitabine as the current standard of care for fi rst-line metastatic pancreat ic cancer for patients with good performance status (0 -1). Nab-paclitaxel in combinat ion with gemcitabine was approved in the US in 2013 and in the European Union (EU)in 2014 for use in patients wit h metastatic pancreat ic cancer. The high-level results of the rando mized Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in 861 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, whichcompared gemci tabine with a combinat ion of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel(Von Hoff et al . 2013), demonstrated a median OS of8.5months in the gemcitabineplusnab-paclitaxelarm compared with 6.7 months in the gemcitabine alone. The HR for death was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.83; p<.001). Other end points, including PFS and response rate (RR), were superior with the combinati on. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia occurred in 38% of the patients treated with gemcitabine plus nab -paclitaxel, with 3% of these instances result ing in febrile neutropenia. Twent y-six percent of the patients received growth factors (GFs). Cumulative peripheral neuropathy occurred in 17% of the patients treated with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, and i t was managed wi th temporary discont inuation of nab-paclitaxel fo llowed by a reduction in dose. Despite available optionsfor the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer , there is still a poor prognosis for patients with metasta tic disease as evidenced by a 5- year survival rate that is less than 3% ( SEER 2016 ). 3.3.Benefit/Risk Assessment Olaratumab has demo nstrated efficacy i n combination with doxorubi cin in pat ients with STS. Pancreatic cancer, like STS, is another highly stromal tumor type and preclinical data has suggested increased PDGFRα levels in malignant pancreat ictissue, suggest ing olaratumab may be able to affect P DGFR signaling in pancreat ic cancer. Olaratumab has been used in several studies in combinat ion with chemotherapies and has been generally well tolerated,with some increase in hematologic toxicit y observed. The current study will evaluate the safet y of olaratumab in combination with nab-paclitaxeland gemcitabine. Weekly monitoring of hematologic parameters will be conducted to ensure patient saf ety during the dose escalation/Phase 1b portion of the study . The Phase 2 randomized portion will evaluate n ab- paclitaxel and gemci tabinewith or withoutolaratumab, so all patients will receive standard of care treatm ent in this study ."

The Phase 1b portion of the trial will consist of an open -label, dose-finding study and the Phase 2 portion will bea multicenter,randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo -controlled study in patients with metastatic unresectable pancreatic cancer (Stage IV) , who havenot received prior treatmentfor metastatic disease. Phase 1b : The Phase 1b will co mmence prior to Phase 2. Study cycleswill be 28days in duration. In the Phase 1b portion of the study ,a 3 + 3 dose escalat ion design will be used to evaluate the safety and tolerabilit y of olaratumab in combinat ion with gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel in patients with pancreatic cancer and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of olaratumab. Three patients will be treated init ially at each dose level. If no DL Ts occur i n a cohort of 3patients, a new cohort of 3 patients will be treated at the next higher dose level. If 1 of 3patients at any dose level experiences a DLT, that cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If no further patient experiences a DLT, the dose escalat ion can proceed. If a DLT is observed in ≥2 out of a maximum of 6 patients at any given dose, dose escalat ion will cease and the next lower dose will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The dose escalat ion can proceed if fewer than 2 out of 6 evaluable pat ients experience a DLT. During the dose escalat ion, no more than one cohort will be open for enrollment at any given time. After the MTD has been ident ified in the dose -escalation phase, approximately 9patients will be enrolled in a cohort e xpansion. The purpose of the cohort expansion is to confirm the safet y of the MTD in approximately 12 to 15 patients (including those in the dose escalation cohort) prior to proceeding to the Phase 2 portion of the study . Continuous evaluation of toxicit y in the cohort expansion will be performed throughout enrolment in the cohort. If the rate of DLT -like events exceeds 33% in the first cy cle, the findings will be discussed, and further enrolment may be interrupted. If the expansio n cohort i s discontinued because of toxicit y, a new cohort may be initiated at a previously tested lower dose level. In the first cohort, olaratumab will be dosed on Days 1, 8, and 15 (that is, on the same days as nab-paclitaxeland gemci tabinedosing as described in their United States Package Insert [ USPI] and Summaryof Product Characteri stics [SmPC]) at a starting dose of 15 mg/kg. If the 15mg/kg dose of olaratumab is tolerated, enrollment will co mmence in Cohort 2 at the 20mg/kg dose of olaratumab dosed on Day s 1, 8, and 15. If the 20 mg/kg dose is tolerated ,approximately 9to 12additional patients will be enrolled in the cohort expansio n to confirm the safet y and tolerability of the dose."

Gemcitabine plus nab -paclitaxel (Von Hoff et al. 2011, 2013) and FOLFIRINOX (Conroyet al. 2011) are the 2 current standard of care regimens for first- line metastatic pancreatic cancer for patients with good performance status (0 -1). Despite available options for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer, there is st ill a poor prognosis for patients with metastatic disease as evidenced by a 5 -year survival rate that is less than 3% ( SEER 2016 ). Pancreatic cancer is characterized by a highly stromal tumor microenvironment that is co mposed largely of extracellular m atrix proteins, fibroblasts, and pancreatic stellate cells. This tumor microenvironment, ordesplasmic react ion, has been associ ated with worse clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer (Erkan et al .2008) as well as other tumors (Hasebe et al .1997). PDGFRα expressio n has been shown to be upregulated in malignant pancreas relat ive to normal t issue (Ebert et al .1995). PDGF/PDGFRα signaling in the microenvironment may contribute to both the growth and maintenance of the dense tumor microenvironment as well as tumor growth . Tissue microarrays have shown the presence of PDGFRα in the stroma (46.7 % of 210tissues evaluated) of pancreat ic cancer in the tissues evaluated (data on file). The link between PDGF and tumor -associated angiogenesis is supported by its expressio n by tumor cells, and overexpressio n was found to be correlated with microvascular den sity and poor survival in a large variet y of human cancers, including pancreatic cancer ( Fujimoto et al. 1998). Blocking PDGFRα by the use of ol aratumab has been shown effect ive in another highly stromal tumor type, STS, with recent results showing improvement in OSand PFS. The abilit y to inhibit PDGFRα signaling in pancreat ic cancer may represent an opportunit y to disrupt signaling in the tumor microenvironment in a manner that could potentially enhance the ant itumor activity"

In addition, the design was changed to add a cohort expansio n to ensure an appropriate number of patients (12 to 15 patient s) are evaluated for safet y in Phase 1b at the highest tol erated dose. 5.4.2.Rationale for Amendment (b) Amendment (b) revised the definit ion of DLT based on Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) feedback to include toxicit ies related to the combination of olaratum ab plus gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. 5.4.3.Rationale for Amendment (c) Amendment (c) addresses several requests from FDA includinglanguage urging caut ion when administering nab -paclitaxel wit h CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers as well as further details regarding the sample size just ification. In addition, this amendment adjusts the study entry criteria-related pri or therapi es. DLT wordingswere clarified to ensure that clinically non -significant AEs are not included in the DLT definition. This amendment describes that a patient’s dose may be re-escalated after a dose reduction. The schedule and timing of PROs in the fo llow-up periods (both l ong-term and short - term) have been updated. Plans for the Phase 2 interim analysis and the Internal Asse ssment Committee ( IAC)have been updated. In addition, several administrative items have been updated to provide clarit y or correct errors. 5.4.4.Rationale for Amendment (d) Amendment D updates the protocol to include dose and schedule of olaratumab to be administered in the Phase 2 part ,based on the results of the Phase 1b part of study JGDP. In Part 1b of Study JGDP, a total of 22patients were enrolled and treated with olaratumab plus gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel as of 31 July 2018. Safet y review revealed th at the addi tion of olaratumab to the com bination of gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel in pancreat ic patients is safe and tolerable wit h a monitorable and manageable side -effect profile. Both dose levels of olaratumab (i.e.15 mg/kg and 20 m g/kg olaratumab [N=3 and 19 patients, respectively] ) were tolerated in co mbination with gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxelwith one DLT reported at the 20 mg/kg olaratumab dose level (Grade 4 neutropenia lasting greater than 7 days ). No maximum tolerated dose for olaratumab in combination with gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel was ident ified. AEs reported were consistent in nature and within the frequency range expected for chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel or ol aratumab therapy . Though the MTD of olaratumab was not re ached, a trend towards a higher number of early Grade ≥3 neutropenia and dose reductions in nab -paclitaxel and gemci tabine was noted am ong patients treated at the 20mg/kg"
30,page_30,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 30 LY3012207dose level relative to the 15 mg/kg olaratumab dose level. Therefore, considering safety and exposure-response analyses across olaratumab studies , the recommended dose for the randomized part of Study JGDP for ol aratumab in combinat ion with gemcitabine plus nab- paclitaxel was determined as a 20 mg/kg olaratumab l oading dose on Days 1, 8, and 15 in Cycle1, followed by 15 m g/kg on Days 1, 8, and 15 in Cycles 2 -n. This selected Phase 2 dose and schedule of olaratumab aims to maximize patients achieving concentrations above previously identified olaratumab serum levels associ ated with clinical activity, while also minimizing reductions/o missions of the standard-of- care chemotherapy backbone . This decisio n was mutually agreed upon following discussio ns between the sponsor and the Study JGDP Phase1b investigators. This amendment also formalizes a change from an IAC (internal assessment committee) to an IDMC (independent data monitoring co mmittee) for th e Phase 2 part of the study to enable monitoring of unblinded safet ydata by the IDMC while maintaining Lilly blinded to safety and efficacy interim data. This change is being made prior to any data being reviewed by the IAC. In addition, clarifications to the inclusio n/exclusio n criteria # [1], [3], [5], [9], and [22]; olaratumab premedication ;and infusio n instructions in alignment w ith the recent invest igators brochure are provided. S ome minor edi torial changes have been made throughout the protocol to improveclarity and pract icality of the protocol and secure alignment with the intended study design. 5.4.5.Rationale for Amendment ( e) Amendment (e)updates the protocol to include screening criteria for Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against galactose-α-1-3-galactose (α-gal) and premedicat ion requirements to mit igate the risk for an observed rate of Grade ≥3 infusion -related reacti ons (IRRs) on Study JGDP that was greater than the rate of 3.1% previously observed across the olaratumab program . Based on data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portion of Study JGDP, Grade ≥3 IRRs wereobserved at an approximate rate between 5% and 10% of olaratumab- treated pati ents. Infusion related reacti onsarea known A dverse Drug Reactionfor olaratumab, andthe rate of IRR is 12.5% (all grades) and 3.1% ( Grade ≥3). Grade ≥3 IRR occur within minutes of first infusion of olaratumab. Therisk of anaphylact ic reaction is associated with elevated IgE antibody levels. Across 8 studi es with olaratumab (401 evaluable olaratumab- treated pati ents), IgE antibody levels greate r than the m anufacturer -specified ULN hada positive predict ive value of 75% (34.9% -96.8%) and a negative predict ive value of 99% (98.2% -99.9%) for Grade ≥3 IRRs, with sensitivity of 75% (34.9% -96.8%) and specificit y of 99% (98.2% -99.9%). Two patients had Grade ≥3 IRR wi th an IgE antibody level ≤ ULN (0.28 kU/L and <0.10 kU/L, respectively ). Prior to this amendment, patient s in Study JGDPwere tested for pre -existing IgE antibody against α-galas pre-planned retrospective analysis. However,the results of these tests werenot availa ble prior to first dosing of o laratumab /placebo. Pre-testing for elevated IgE antibody levels against -gal forall untreated patients as part of screening is being implemented as arisk mitigation strategy ."
31,page_31,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 31 LY3012207This amendment implements actions to mitigate the risk of increasedGrade ≥3 IRRsobserved in Study JGDP. Specifically ,screening in the Phase 2 portion of the study was modified to i nclude immuniogenicit y testing,and the inclusio n/exclusion criteria were upd ated to clarify that patients with IgE anti-α-galantibody levelsgreater than the upper limit of normal will be excluded from this study. In addition, the required premedicat ion regimen prior to Cy cle 1 Day 1 of olaratumab/placebo was clarified to include: dexamethasone (or steroid equivalent) ; a histamine H1 antagonist ist (for example, di phenhydramine); and a h istamine H2 antagonist (for e xample, ranitidine). 5.5.Justification for Olaratumab Dose Olaratumab will be init ially dosed on Days 1, 8, and 15 to dose olaratumab coinciding with the dosing schedule of the gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel backbone chemotherapyregimen. In the event the Day 1, 8, and 15 dosing schedule is not tolerated, dosing of olaratumab on Day 1 and 15 may be evaluate d to determine if less frequent dosing of o laratumab may improve the feasibility of the combinat ion. The starting dose level of olaratum ab administered onthe Day 1, 8, and 15 schedule will be 15mg/kg(Cohort 1) . In monotherapy dose -escalation studies ,no DLTs were observed up to olaratumab doses of 20 mg/kg every other week and 16 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks fo llowed by 2 weeks off tre atment for observation. In prior studies of olaratumab plus chemotherapies (doxorubicin in STS [JGDG], paclitaxel plus carboplatin in non-small cell lung cancer [JGDB], mitoxantrone in prostate cancer [JGDD], and liposomal doxorubi cin in ovarian cancer [JGDA]), olara tumab was generally well tolerated with manageable toxicit ies. Some increase in hematological AEs (such as neutropenia) was noted over chemotherapy alone. In Studi es JGDG and JGDA, despite an increase in neutropenia there was no increase in febrile neutr openia upon addi tion of olaratumab to the respective chemotherapies. In Study JGDB, Grade ≥4 febrile neutropenia was 3.0% on the olaratumab plus paclitaxel/carboplat in arm versus 0% on t he paclitaxel/carboplat in arm. In several ongo ing studies, a Cycle 1 loading dose of 20 mg/kg has been safely administered in on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 in combination wit h doxorubicin. The exposures ant icipated fro m the starting dose of 15 mg/kg on Day 1, 8,and 15 would be ant icipated to be similar to those achieved for patients receiving the 20 -mg/kg loading dose on Days 1 and 8 of a 3 -week cycle. Based upon the increase in hematological AEs observed w henolaratumab was administered with previous chemotherapy regimens, i t is anticipated that myelosuppressio n may be a key safety measure in determining the maximum tolerated dose of olaratumab wit h the combinat ion of gemcitabine plus nab -paclitaxel. Weekly assessment of hematol ogic parameters will provide close monitoring of this toxicity and aid in determining t he safety of this combinat ion. The second dose level, 20 mg/kg (Cohort 2) , provides the opportunit y to achieve higher serum concentrations of olaratumab. CCI"
32,page_32,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 32 LY3012207 In the event that the Day 1, 8, and 15 dosing schedule is not tolerated, an alternate dosing schedule with o laratumab administered on Day 1 and 15 may be explored. For administration of olar atumab on the Day 1 and 15 schedule, t he starting dose is 20 mg/kg (Cohort 3). This dose and schedule of olaratumab has been administered in prior studies (JGDA, in combination with liposomal doxorubicin in patients with ovarian cancer). In addition, a loading dose of 20 mg/kg in Cycle 1 (Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle) has been safely administered in several ongo ing studies (JGDJ, JGDI ,and JGDK) in co mbination with doxorubicin. After determinat ion of the MTD in the dose escalation portion of the study and confirmat ion of the safety and tolerability of that dose in the cohort expansio n, a review of safety data, including the number and ty pe of DLTs, other safet y information , and relevant PK,will be conducted prior to proceeding to Phase 2. The decisio n to proceed to Phase 2 and selection o f the recommended Phase 2 dose will be made following discus sions between the invest igators and Lilly clinical research personnel. CCI CCI"

These adverse events aregenerally considered DLT -level toxicit ies and thus can confound DLT determination in the setting of co mbination with olaratumab. The criteria listed below will be used to determine the dose of olaratumab that can be added to nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine without causing a significant increase in toxicit y over that expected with nab -paclitaxel -gemcitabine alone. A DLT is define d as events such as the fo llowing, graded according to the NCI -CTCAE v ersion 4.03, when the event occurs within Cycle 1, and is considered to be related to olaratumabin combination with nab-paclitaxelplus gemci tabineby the investigator in conjuncture wi th Lilly: Any febrile neutropenia Grade 4 thrombocy topenia, or Grade 3 thrombocy topenia complicated by clinically significant hemorrhage Grade 4 neutropenia last ing 7 days or longer nonhematologic Grade ≥3 toxicity, except for -toxicities such as nausea ,vomiting,transient electroly te abnorm alities,diarrhea which can be controlled wit h optimal medical management within 48 hours; -non-clinically significant, treatable, or reversible laboratory abnormalities including liver funct ion tests, uric acid, e lectrolytes, etc. Any other significant toxicit y deemed by the primary investigator and Lilly clinical research personnel to be dose -limiting (e.g., any toxicity that is possibly related to the study medication that requires the withdrawal o f the patient from the study during Cycle 1). The MTD i s defined as the highest olaratumab dose level at which no more than 33% of patients experience a DLT during Cycle 1. Phase 1b In addition to the DLT assessment period in Cycle 1, safet y data beyond Cycle 1 m ay also be taken into consideration prior to a decisio n to dose escalat ion or determinat ion of the Phase 2 dose. If both dosing regimens do not exceed DLT criteria , factors such as m aintaining dose intensity of the standard of care treatment regimen and PK may be taken into consideration in selecting the dose recommended for use in the Phase 2 portion of the study .

After rando mization, patients shoul d receive thei r first dose of treatment within 72 hours (3 day s) whenever possible. Up to 3 additional days delay of fi rst dose of treatment will be permitted due to holidays, weekends, bad weather, or other unforeseen circumstances and will not count as a protocol deviation. 7.2.3.Selection and Timing of Doses A cycle is defined as an interval of 28 days. A delay of a cycle due to holiday, weekend, bad weather, or other unforeseen circumstances will be permitted for a maximum of 3days and not counted as a protocol deviat ion. The actual doses of olaratumab administered will be determined by measuring the patient ’s body weight inkilograms at the beginning of each cycle. If the patient’s weight does not fluctuate by more than 10% from the weight used to cal culate the pri or dose, the dose will not need to be recalculated. A 5% variance in the calculated total dose will be allow ed for ease of dose administration. The actual doses of n ab-paclitaxel and gemcitabineadministered will be determined based on estimation ofbody surface area (BSA) in m2on Day 1 of each28-day cycle. If the patient’s weight does not fluctuate by more than 10% from the weight used to calculate the prior dose, the BSA will not need to be recalculated, unless deemed clinically meaningful (recalculat ion"

A 5% variance in the calculated total dose will be allowed for ease of dose administration. A patient may continue to receive study treatment until he or she meets one or more of the specified reasons for discontinuation (as described in Section 8). 7.3.Blinding The Phase 1b portio n of this study is open-label. Phase 2 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled , randomized tri al. To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly personnel will see the randomization table and treatment assignments before the study is completed. Upon study completion, investigators may unblind patients to study treatment assignment. 7.3.1.Emergency Unblindi ng Phase 2 In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a patient’s treatm ent assignment is warranted. Patient safet y must always be the first consideration in making such a determinat ion. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effo rt to contact the LillyCRP prior to unblinding a patient’s treatm ent assignment unl ess this coul d delay emergency treatment of the patient. If a patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded, Lillymust be notified immediately. Emergency unblinding for AEs mustbe performed through the IWRS. Allactionsresulting in an unblinding event are recorded and reported by theIWRS. 7.3.2.Inadvertent Unblinding Every effort will be m ade to blind both the patient and the invest igator to the ident ity of the treatment, but the inadvertent unblinding of a patient may occur. If an invest igator, site personnel, or patient is inadvertent ly unblinded, the unblinding wil l not be sufficient cause for the patient to be discontinued from study treatment or excluded fro m study analyses. Additionally, there may be ethical reasons for the patient to remain on the study treatment. In the event of unblinding, the invest igator mu st obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly CRP for the patient to continue in the study . 7.4.Dosage Modification Guidance for dose adjust ment, delays, and discont inuationof blinded study drug (olaratuma/pl acebo), gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel due to hematologi cal and non-hematological toxicities are presented in Sections 7.4.2,7.4.3,and 7.4.4, respectively. Gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel are intended to be admin istered in accordance with standard-of- care in this study and dose modifications should follow the l ocal labels.Investigators will interpret and docum ent whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to each"
44,page_44,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 44 LY3012207of the study drugs, takin g into account the disease, concomitant treatments, or pathologies, in order to individually adjust study drug(s)doses. To begin dosing at each cy cle, the following criteria must be fulfilled: Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC)≥1.5 × 103cells/µL ( ≥1500 cells/µL; ≥1.5 × 109/L) Platelets ≥100 × 103cells/µL ( ≥100,000 cells/µL ; 100 x 109/L) Total bilirubin ≤1.5 ×upper limit of normal ( ULN)for Cycle 1. For subsequent cycles, monitor and administer as per standard of care with dose adjustment based on individual tolerance. Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST)and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) ≤2.5 ×ULN, or ≤5 ×ULN if the transaminase elevat ion is due to liver metastases Nonhematologic toxicit y must beCTCAE < Grade 2 or must have returned to baseline, unless the toxicit y is deemed not clinically significant by the invest igator (such as alopecia) or is a laboratory abnormality that is manageable by institutional standards (such as asymptomat ic electrolyte distur bances). TableJGDP.11provides addit ional guidance for non -hematological toxicities of peripheral neuropathy , cutaneous toxicit y and mucosit is or diarrhea. In the Phase 1b portion of the study , doses of ol aratumab and/or nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine may be delayed, omitted, or reduced if the pat ient experiences an AE or a DLT -equivalent toxicity. In the Phase 2 portion, invest igators will be blinded to treatment assignment (ol aratumab versus placebo) and shoul d adjust dosing of ol aratumab/placebo as if all pat ients are receiving olaratumab. In the event of an alteration in olaratumab/placebo dose due to an olara tumab/placebo-related toxicity, gemcitabine or nab -paclitaxelneed not be al tered, and the planned gemcitabine or nab- paclitaxel schedule shoul d be maintained. Similarly, o laratumab /placebotherapy neednot be altered for either gemcitabine -or nab-paclitaxel-related toxici ty. Omission or discontinuation of 1 of the study drugs in the combinat ion does not prohibit dosing with other study drugs,provided the patient meets dosing criteria. In case of difficult y in assigning relatedness to one study drug or the other, the doses of all study drugs may be delayed, reduced, or omitted. 7.4.1.Dosing and Dose Reductions Given the known adverse profile of the gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel co mbination, it is anticipated that bone marrow suppression will be a common reason for dose modification. In the case oftoxicity related to myelosuppressio n and its complicat ions, the relat ive roles of gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel are often impossible to separate, and thus it is expected such toxicity would result in dose reductions of both agents. In cases where AEs, i n the opinio n of the investigator, are more likely due to one drug than another, adjust ment of one of the chemotherapy agents and not the other is permissible."

In the event a patients toxicity in Cycle 1 requi res an olaratumab dose reducti on,the patient may start Cy cle 2 at the dose of 15 mg/kg olaratumab ,provided the toxi city necessitating dose reducti on has adaequately resolved. If a patient at the lowest dose level experiences toxicit y that would necessitate additional dose reductions, the patient shoul d discontinue that treatment . Patients whoundergo a dose reduction may be re -escalated at the discret ion of the investigator once the toxicit y requiring dose reduction has returned to Grade ≤1or baseline . In the case of recurrent, pers istent toxicity, the investi gator shoul d consider perm anent dose reduction. 7.4.2.Dose Modifications 7.4.2.1. Hematological Toxicites General guidelines for dose modificationsfor hematologic toxicit ies are shown in TableJGDP.10. Olaratumab has been safely administered wi thout any DLTsor significant myelo suppressive toxicity in monotherapy studies. In studi es with cytotoxic chemotherapies, ol aratumab has shown some increase in myelosuppressive toxicit ies; however, these toxicit ies are principally driven by the profile o f the backbone chemotherapy. In addit ion, exposure -response analysis of the Study JGDG dem onstrated the importance of achieving and maintaining o laratumab serum concentrations in a potentially therapeut ic range(see also Section 5.5). For these reasons, hematological toxicity management will focus on dose modificat ion of gemcitabine and nab - paclitaxel per label guidelines, and not by olaratumab dose reducti ons (TableJGDP.10). In the case of toxicit y related to myelosuppressio n and its complicat ions, the relat ive roles of"
46,page_46,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 46 LY3012207gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxelare often impo ssible to separate, and thus it is expected such toxicity would result in dose reductions of both agents. In cases in which AEs, in the opinio n of the investigator, are more likely due to 1 drug than another, adjust ment of 1 of the chemotherapy agents and not the other is permissible. In the case of toxicit ies deemed potentially related to olaratumab, the invest igator may deem it appropriate to reduce or modify o laratumab. TableJGDP.10.

If a patient does not re cover from the toxicity within 56days from the time of last treatment, the patient must be discont inued from study treatmentunless the investigator, in consultat ion with the Lilly CRP/CRS, agree that it is in the best interest of the patient to continue treatment. Delays for nab -paclitaxel due to peri pheral neuropathy are allowed to last longer than 28 days for toxicity to resolve (m edian durati on of delay/resolution of AE to Grade ≤1 was 23 days in MPACT study of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel [ Von Hoff et al. 2013]). Gemcitabine and olaratumab/placebo should be dosed on the planned schedule during delays for nab -paclitaxel- related peripheral neuropathy . If one (or more) study drugs will be withheld(omitted), Day 1 will be the day of administra tion of the first dose of any study drug in that cy cle. If one (or more) study drugs will be withheld (omitted), the regular dosing intervalfor the non-affected study drug(s) should try to be maintained within or between cy cles according to the planned treatment schedule ( Section 7.1)."

Nab-paclitaxel 7.4.4.2.1. Hepatic Impairment Exposure and toxicit y of paclitaxel can be increased with hepat ic impairment oradministration of nab-paclitaxel in patients. Do not administer nab -paclitaxel to pati ents with total bilirubin >5x ULN and/or AST > 10x ULN. 7.4.4.2.2. Sepsis Sepsis, wi th or without neutropenia, has been reported with the use of nab -paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine. Biliary obstructi on or presence of biliary stent were risk factors for severe or fatal sepsis. If a patient becom es febrile (regardless of ANC) ,initiate treatm ent with broad-spectrum ant ibiotics. For febrile neutropenia, interrupt nab-paclitaxeland gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500, then resume treatment at reduced dose levels (see TableJGDP.11). 7.4.4.2.3. Pneumonitis Pneumonitis, including so me cases that were fatal, has been reported in patients receiving nab-paclitaxel in combinat ion withgemcitabine. Monitor patients for s igns and sympto ms of pneumonitis and interrupt nab-paclitaxeland gemci tabine during evaluat ionof suspected pneumonitis.

For olaratumab IRR treatm ent guidelines see TableJGDP.7. Due the observed rate of Grade ≥3 IRRs in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of Study JGDP that was greater than the rate of 3.1% previously observed across the olaratumab program , testing for IgE anti-α-gal antibodies mustbe performed as part of screening, and pat ient with antibody levels >ULN should be excluded. Patients treated with olaratumab (olaratumab/placebo in the Phase 2 portion of the study )should be closely mo nitored for si gns and symptom s indicative of a hype rsensitivity/infusion-related reaction from the start of the infusio n until at least 1 hour after the end of the infusio n,in an area where emergency medical resuscitat ion equipment and other agents (epinephrine, predniso lone or equivalents, etc .) are available. No other study treatment (gemcitabine and/or nab -paclitaxel) should be administered during the observation period (prem edications for gem citabine and/or nab-paclitaxel are all owed to be administered during the observation period). If there is no e vidence of an IRR in the first 2 cy cles, no observation period is required for subsequent treatment cy cles. In the event that a Grade 1 or 2 IRRoccurs after Cy cle 2, the 1- hour observation period will be reinst ituted for a minimum o f 2 cycles. The reins tituted observation period may be suspended after 2 cy cles if the pat ient shows no further signs or symptoms of an IRR . If a patient experiences a nIRR, all attempts should be made to obtain an anti-olaratumab antibody and olaratumab PK blood samples as close to the onset of the event as possible, at the resolut ion of the event, and 30 day s (±3 days) following the event (See Appendix 4and Section 9.5). Signs and symptom s of IRRsmay vary in different pati ent populationsand include rigors/trem or, back pain/spasms, chills, flushing, dyspne a, pruritus or rash (without urticaria), fever, headache, body aches, abdominal pain, nausea, vo miting, and blurred visio n. In severe cases, symptoms have included wheezing, bronchos pasm, hypoxia, chest pain and/or tightness, supraventricular tachycardia, hypotensi on, and paresthesia. The Lilly medical m onitor should be contacted immediately if quest ions arise concerning the grade of the reaction."

Patients may receive full supportive care therapies concomitant ly during the study, including antiemetic treatment as per inst itutional guidelines. At each visit, appropriate documentation of all forms of premedicat ion, supportive care, and conco mitant medications must be captured on the study eCRF. Concomitant medicat ions and supportive care must also be documented unt il 30 days after the last dose of invest igational product. No other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiat ion therapy, surgery for cancer, or exp erimental medications will be permitted while the pati ents are on study treatment orduring short -term follow-upperiod. Any disease progression requiring other forms of specific ant itumor therapy will be cause for discontinuat ion from the study . 7.7.1.Other Concomitant Medication (CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers) The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalyzed by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. In the absence of formal clinical drug interaction studies, caution should be exercised when administering nab -paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit (e.g., ketoconazole and other imidazo le antifungals, ery thromycin, fluoxet ine, gemfibrozil, cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) or induce (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenyto in, efavirenz, and nevirapine) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4. 7.7.2.Supportive Care Patients will receive supportive care as judged by their treating physician.

Appendix 3 provides a list of the laboratory tests that wi ll be perform ed. Appendix 4 provides the schedule for collect ionofsamplesin this study. Unless otherwise stated in the fo llowing subsections, all samples co llected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed within 60 days after receipt of confirmed test results. Certain samples ma y be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or laboratory certificat ion standards. 9.1.Efficacy Assessments Tumor assessments will be performed according to Response Evaluat ion Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1 )for each patient at the times shown in the Schedule of Activities(Section2). Digital images are to be sent to a third -party organization for storage. For patients with solid tum ors, computed tom ography (CT) scans, including spiral CT, are the preferred m ethods of m easurement (CT scan thickness reco mmended to be 5 mm); however, magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI)is also acceptable i n certain situat ions and if there is a concern about radiat ion exposure associated with CT. Intravenous and oral contrast isrequired unless medically contraindicated. The CT portion of a positron emission tomography (PET) -CT scan may be used as a method of response assessment if the site can document that the CT is o f identical diagnostic qualit y to a diagnostic CT (with intravenous and oral contrast). A PET scan alone or as part of a PET -CT may be performed for addit ional analyses but cannot be used to assess response according to RECIST v.1.1 (Eisenhauer et al. 2009) . Patients will be treated until there is documented radio logical PD, toxi city requiring cessation of treatment, withdrawal of consent, or until other withdrawal criteria are met. In the event there is symptomatic deterioration result ing in treatment discontinuation, radiographic confirmat ion should be perform ed. For patients who discont inue treatment for any reason other than radiographically documented PD (for exam ple, symptom atic deterioration), radiographic assessments should cont inue as scheduled every 8weeks (±7 days) as calculated fro m randomization until objective radiographic evidence of PD. The method of tum or assessment used at baseline must be used consistently throughout the study. Radio logical scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis is required. See Section 10.3.1for definitionsof the efficacy endpo ints. 9.1.1.Appropriatenes s of Assessments The measures used to assess safet y and efficacy in this study are consistent wi th those used in most convent ional oncology trials."

An AEcan therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a m edicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (invest igational) product. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an untoward medical occurrence tha t emerges during a defined treatment period, having been absent pretreatment, or worsens relative to the pretreatm ent state, and does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with this treatment. 9.2.2.AE Reporting The invest igator will use NCI-CTCAE version 4.03 (2010)to assign AE term s and severit y grades. Documentation should include onset and reso lution/stabilization dates, AE grade, seriousness, relationship to study treatment, and outcome of the event. AE reporting will begin after the pati ent signs the ICF. Investigators are responsible for: monitoring the safet y of patients in this study and for al erting Lillyor its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the patient the appropriate medical care of patients during the study documenting their review of each laboratory safety report following, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to study treatment or the study, or that caused the patient to discont inue study treatmentbefore complet ing the study. The patient should be followed until the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. Frequency of f ollow-up evaluat ion is left to the discretion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record v ia eCRF the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study . In addition, study site personnel will record via eCRFany change in the preexisting condit ions and any new condit ions as AEs. Investigators should record their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to study procedure or study treatment via eCRF. The invest igator will interpret and docum ent whether or not an AE hasa reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatment or a study procedure, taking into account the disease,"
57,page_57,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 57 LY3012207concomitant treatments ,or pathologies. A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause and effect relat ionship between the study treatment and/or study procedure and the AE. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . Study site personnel must report any dose modifications or treatm ent discont inuations that result from AEs to Lillyor its designee via eCRF, clarifying, if possible, the circumstances leading to thedose modification ordiscontinuation of treatment. Adverse event will be co llected until at least 30 day s after the last dose of study treatment. After the 30-day short-term follow-up visit, only new and ongoing serious adverse events (SAEs) deemed related to study treatment will be collected . 9.2.3.Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that results in one of the fo llowing outcom es: death initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying) persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity congenital ano maly/birth defect considered signific ant by the invest igator for any other reason: important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious, based upon appropriate medical judgment. Although all AEs after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF, SAE reporti ng begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received study treatment. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving study treatment, i t needs to be reported ONLY if it is considere d reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must notify Lillyor its designee of any SAE within 24hours of investigator awarenessof the event via a Lilly -approved m ethod. If alerts are i ssued via telephone, they are to be immediately followed wit h official notification on study -specific SAE forms. This 24-hour notification requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up SAE information. Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to study treatment) does not meet the definit ion of an AE but shoul d be reported. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported following the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in pat ients once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the patientsummary eCRF has been com pleted). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatment or study participation, the invest igator must promptly notify Lilly ."
58,page_58,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 58 LY3012207Planned hospi talizations or procedures for preexisting condit ions that were recorded in t he patient’s medical history at the time of enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion without a preci pitating clinical AE (for example, for the administration of study treatment or other protocol -requiredprocedure) should not be considered an SAE. Serious adverse events, including death, caused by disease progression should not be reported unless the investigator deems them to be possibly related to study treatment. 9.2.4.Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to study treatment or study procedure. United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or national regulatory requirements in parti cipating countries require the reporting of SUSARs . Lilly has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUS ARs that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and associated detailed guidances. 9.2.5.Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are events that have been ident ified as safet y signals during preclinical or early clinical tri als or based on class effects of similar drugs. These events will be mo nitored prospectively in the clinical developmental program. Each event is defined by a careful assessment and grouping of individual related Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ™)preferred terms. Infusion-related reacti ons(IRRs)to olaratumab.As with other monoclonal antibodies, hypersensit ivity reactions (including fatal reactions) have been reported with olaratumab administration. IRRsto nab-paclitaxel. Severe and fatal hypersensit ivity reactions have been reported with administration of nab-paclitaxel. Pneumonitis–Pneumonitis (including fatal cases) ha sbeen reported in patient receiving nab-paclitaxeland gemcitabine. Refer to Section 7.4for specialtreatment considerations for dose del ays, modifications, and discontinuat ions from olaratumab/placebo and nab-paclitaxel /gemcitabine, including adverse events of concern or special interest. For olaratumab IRRs, refer to Section7.4.4.3.1 for instructions on the m onitoring and subsequent d osing and prem edication adjustments for patients who experience an IRRto olaratumab. 9.2.6.Complaint Handling Lilly collects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of studyparticipants, m onitor quality, and to facilitate process and product improvements."
59,page_59,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 59 LY3012207Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em with the invest igational product so that the situation c an be assessed. 9.3.Treatment of Overdose In case of o laratumab overdose, r efer to the olaratumab IB. In case of overdose of the other chemotherapeut ic agents, refer to the Product Labelfor the specific agent. 9.4.Safety 9.4.1.Other Safety Measures For each patient, electrocardiograms ( ECGs), vital signs, laboratory tests, or other tests should be collected as shown in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). ECGs will be co llected centrally for patients in the Phase 1 portion of the study and locally for pati ents in the Phase 2 porti on. Refer to JGDP Manual o f Operation for ECG storage requirement . Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collect ion and remain supine but awake during ECG collect ion. Electrocardiograms may be obtained at addit ional times, when deemed clinically necessary . Collection of more ECGs than expe cted at a parti cular time point i s allowed when needed to ensure high qualit y records. Electrocardiograms will be interpreted by a qualified physician (the investigator or qualified designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible , and ideally while the patient is still present, to determine whether the patient meets entry criteria and for immediate patient management, should any clinically relevant findings be identified. Any clinically significant findings that result in a diagn osis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of study treatmentshould be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF. 9.4.2.Safety Monitoring Lilly willperiodically review evolving aggregate safet y data within the study by appropriate methods. The LillyCRP will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study .The Lilly CRP will review trends in safet y data, laboratory analytes, and AEsincluding monitoring o f AESIs. Lillywill review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by company procedures. A safety review co mmittee (SRC) consist ing of the Lilly CRP /CRS, Global Patient Safety (GPS) physician, statist ician, the primary investigator, and ad hoc SCR members as needed will be responsible for review of safet y data. The SRC will convene to review data at the end of the DLT observat ion periodafter Phase 1b is complete prior to initiationof Phase 2. In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at the group level, only members of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) (refer to Section10.3.5) can conduct addit ional analyses of the safet y data. During the study , Lilly will perform a blinded review of all reports of deaths and SAEs to ensure completeness and accuracy. If a death or other clinical AE is deemed serious, unexpected, and"
60,page_60,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 60 LY3012207possibly related to study treatment, a limited number of Lilly GPS representatives external to the study team will be unblinded for regulatory reporting and safet y monitoring purposes. These measures will preserve the integrit y of the data collected during this study and minimize any potential for bias while providing for appropri ate safety monitoring. 9.4.2.1. Hepatic Monitoring If a patient experiences elevated ALT 5 × ULN and elevated total biliru bin 2 × ULN, clinical and laboratory monitoring should be initiated by the invest igator. Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory test abnorm alities.To ensure patient safety and comply wit h regulator y guidance, the investigator is to consult with the Lilly CRP regarding collect ion of specific reco mmended clinical informat ion and follow-up laboratory tests. Refer to Appendix 5 . 9.5.Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinet ic samples will be collected as specified in the Pharmacokinet ic, Immunogenicit y, and Biomarker Research Sampling Schedule ( Appendix 4 ). Based on the time and dates specified in Appendix 4 , blood samples will be drawn for all pat ients for the assessment of olaratumabPK. Serum concentrations of o laratumab obtained at different time po ints will be summarized by descriptive stati stics and nonco mpartmental analysis. Addit ional analysis utilizing the popul ation pharmacokinet ic approach may also be c onducted, if deemed necessary . At the visits and times specified in Appendix 4 , venous blo od samples of approximately 3 mL each will be collected to determine the concentrations of olaratumab in serum . A maximum of 5 samples in addit ion to those shown in Appendix 4 may be collected at addit ional time points during the study if warranted and agreed upon between both the invest igator and Lilly. Instructions for the collect ion and handling of blood samples will be provided by Lilly. It is preferred that the blood samples be obtained fro m a peripheral location. Blood samples can be collected via central access devices, but a sample drawn for PK fro m any type of central catheter cannot be diluted or it will not be viable for analysis. If mu ltiple samples are obtained centrally, the PK sample should be the last specimen drawn to reduce the potential for a diluted or improperly drawn sample. The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sampling will be recorded. These samples will be analyzed at one or more laboratories designated by Lilly. Serum concentrations of olaratumab will be assayed using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Drug concentration informat ion that could unblind the study will not be reported to i nvestigative sites or blinded personnel unt il the study has been unblinded. The PKsamples will be stored at a facilit y designated by Lilly. The rem aining serum and plasma from the samples collected for PK may be pooled and used for exploratory drug metabolism work and other exploratory PK/pharmacodynamic work as deemed appropriate."

Samples will notbe used to conduct unspecified disease or populat ion genetic research either now or in the future. Samples will be used to investigate variab le response to study treatment and to investigate genetic variants though t to play a role inmetastatic pancreat ic cancer. Assessment of variable response may include evaluati on of AEs or differences in efficacy. All samples will be coded with the patien t number. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patient only by the study site personnel. Sam ples will be retained for a maximum o f 15 years after the last patient visit for the study , or for a shorter period if local regulationsand/or ethical review boards ( ERBs)impose shorter time limit s, at a facilit y selected by Lilly. This retenti on period enables use of new techno logies, response to questions fro m regulatory agencies, and invest igation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later in the development of olaratumabor after olaratumab becomes commercially available. Molecular techno logies are expected to improve during the 15 -year storage period and therefore cannot be specifically named. However, exist ing technologies include whol e genome and exo me sequencing, geno me-wide associ ation studies, multiplex assays, candidate gene studies, and epigenetic analyses. Regardless of the technology utilized, data generated will be used only for the specific research scope described in this sect ion. 9.8.Biomarkers Biomarker research is performed to address questions of relevance to drug disposit ion, target engagement, pharmacodynamics (PD), mechanism of act ion, variabilit y of patient response (including safet y), and clinical out come. Sample collect ion is incorporated into clinical studies to enable examinat ion of these questions through measurement of bio molecules including DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular elements. Samples for bi omarker research , described in Section9.8.2,will be collected as specified in Appendix 4 ,where local regulat ions allow. It is possible that bi omarker data for patients in the study have already been generated from samples that were collected and analyzed prior to enro lling in this trial. This may include data generated fro m genetic analyses. If available, these data may b e requested fro m medical records for use in the research described in Section 9.8.2."
62,page_62,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 62 LY3012207In addition to the required tumor tissue and bio marker sam plesdiscussed below, patients may be asked to undergo collect ion of an addit ional biopsy specimen and blood sample after treatment with study drug(s) has been init iated, including potent ially after disease progressi on.Such additional biopsies shoul d be performed only if they do not create undue risk to the patient. If these additional samples are requested, they will be used to further invest igate molecular features that may explain treatment response and resistance mechanisms. 9.8.1.Samples for Non pharmacogenetic Biomarker Research Blood samples for nonpharmacogenetic bio marker research will be co llected as specified in Appendix 4 ,where local regulations allow. Samples will be examined for bio markers related to , but not limited to the drug targets, disease process, immune cells/immune and tumor microenvironment functioning within the disease state and/orcancer-related condi tions, pathway associated with cancer and study drugs, variable response to olaratumab and/or nab -paclitaxel and gemcitabine , the mechanism of action of study drugs, and/or for research -related methods, or validating diagnostic tools or assays. All samples will be coded with the patient number. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patient only by the study site personnel. Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15 years after the last patient visit for the study , or for a shorter peri od if local r egulations and/or ERBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y selected by Lilly. This retenti on period enables use of new techno logies, response to questions from regulatory agencies, and invest igation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later in the development of olaratumabor after olaratumabbecomes commercially available. 9.8.2.Tissue Samples for Research Phase 1b Collection of the fo llowing tum or tissue samples is optional for all patients participating in Phase 1b: an archived FFPEtumor tissue sample, if not restricted by local regulationsand available . Note: if sufficient archival t issue not available, a new biopsy is not required. Phase 2 Collection of the fo llowing tum or tissue samples is required for all rando mized pat ients in Phase2 in order to participate in this study : an archived FFPEtumor tissue sample;if such tissue is not available ,a newly obtained core or excisio nal biopsy of atumor lesion must be perform ed. In addition to the required tumor tissue and bio marker samples discussed above, patients may be asked to undergo collect ion of an addit ional biopsy specimen and blood sample after treatment with study drug(s) has been init iated, including potent ially after disease progressi on.Such additional biopsies shoul d be perform ed only if they do not create undue risk to the patient. If"
63,page_63,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 63 LY3012207these additional samples are requested, they will be used to further invest igate molecular features that may explain treatment response and resistance mechanisms. Tumor tissue samples will be examined for bio markers related to diseaseprocess, pathway s associated with pancreatic cancer and/or cancer -related condit ions, immune cells/immune and tumor microenvironment functioning wit hin the disease state and/or cancer -related condi tions, mechanism o f actionof olaratumab and/or gem citabine, nab-paclitaxel,and/or research methods or in validating diagnostic tools or assay (s) related to cancer. The analysis o f these tumor tissue samples mayinclude the assessment of expressio n of PDGFRα, P DGFRβ, and canonical ligands (PDGFA, B, C, and D ). Formalin-fixed paraffin -embedded tum or tissue obtained fro m the primary tumor or metastatic site should be provi ded as a blo ck or unstained slides. Due diligence should be used to make sure that tumor sam ple (not a norm al adjacent or a tum or margin sample) i s provided. Pathol ogy report accompanying archival t issue may also be requested. The report must be coded with the patient number. Personal ident ifiers, including the patient’s name and init ials, must be removed from the institutional pathol ogy report pri or to submissio n. Archivalblocks will be sect ioned and returned to the study site. Slides and t issue samples co llected on -study will not be returned. Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15 years after the last patient visit for the study, or for a shorter peri od if local regulations and/or ERBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y selected by Lilly or i ts designee. This retention period enables use of new technologies, response to questions from regulatory agencies, and investigation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later in the development of olaratumab or after olaratumab becomes co mmercially available. Technologies are expected to improve during the 15 -year storage period and therefore cannot be specifically named. However, exist ing techno logies, including mutation profiling, copy number variability, gene expressio n, multiplex assays, and/or immunohistochemistry ,may be performed on these tissue samples to assess p otential associations with these bio markers and clinical outcomes. 9.8.3.Immunogenicity Assessments Blood samples for immunogenicit y testing will be collected as shown in Appendix 4 to determine antibody production against olaratumab. Immunogenici ty will be assessed by a validated assay designed to detect anti -drug antibodies in the presence of olaratumab. Antibodies may be further characterized and/or e valuated for their abilit y to neutralize the activity of olaratumab. When possible ,immunogenicit y analysis will be done fro m the same blood drawn for PK analysis. In the event of an o laratumab/placebo infusion react ion, additional blood samples will be collected for addit ional immunogenicit y analysis. These addit ional samples will be co llected as close as possible to the onset of the event, at the point of resolut ion from the event, and within 30 days after onset of the event."

The duration allows Lilly to respond to future regulatory requests related t oolaratumab. 9.9.Patient-Reported Outcomes /Resource Utili zation(Phase 2 only ) 9.9.1. P atient-Reported Outcomes In the Phase 2 portion of this study , patient-reported outcome (PRO) for pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form, Modified ( mBPI-sf; Cleeland 1991). Health -related quality of life will be assessed with the European Organisat ion for Research and Treatment of Cancer Qualit y of Life Quest ionnaire Core 30 ( EORTC QLQ- C30; Aaronson et al. 1993). Health status will be assessed using the EuroQol 5-Dimensio n 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L). For the mBPI-sf, 2 baseline assessments will be collected, the first one within 7 days of the first cy cle (not on Cy cle1 Day1) and the second one at Day 1 of the first cycle pri or to study treatment administration. For patients who discont inued for reasons other than death or withdrawn consent, PRO data shall be co llected at the short -term and first l ong-term follow-up visits in accordance with the Study Schedule of Activities. Paper versions of the quest ionnaires will be used. It is recommended that the instruments be administered together and in sequence order, at the beginning o f the visit prior to other study procedures, with the mBPI -sf presented fi rst, followed by the EORTC QLQ -C30 and continuing with the EQ-5D-5L. Whenever possible, if administration is not possible prior to all other procedures, at least every effort shoul d be made to administer at the same t ime point in each visit. Questionnaires should be administered to th e patient prior to extensive in teraction with site staff and must be completed prior to study drug administration. Patient-reported questionnaires should be completed by pat ients when a language translat ion is available in which the pat ient is fluent or literate. 9.9.1.1. Pain assessments The mBPI-sf is an 11-item instrument used as a mult iple-item measure of cancer pain intensit y. In addition to pain intensit y (4 items), the m BPI-sf is designed for patients to record the presence of pain in general, pain relief, and pain interference with funct ion (general act ivity, mood, abili ty to walk, ability to perform normal work, relat ions with others, sl eep, and enjo yment of life). The mBPI-sf is administered per the Schedule of Activities(Section 2). The recall period is the past 24 hours or last week and complet ion time is ty pically 5 to 7 minutes. Responses for the mBPI -sf items are captured through the use of 11 -point numeric rating scales anchored at 0 ( no pain ordoes not interfere ) and ranged through 10 ( pain as bad as you can imagine orcompletely interferes ). The focus of the analysis will be on the “worst pain”. “Worst pain” intensit y has been shown to meaningfully impact pat ients’ lives as indicated by a strong correlation with functional interference scores in various ty pes of cancer (Daut et al . 1983; Serlinet al. 1995; Ger et al. 1999; McMillan et al. 2000; Shi et al. 2009). Moreover, a study by Stone et al. (2004) sugge sted that patients’ tendency to focus on the most severe level o f pain"
65,page_65,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 65 LY3012207during a recall period may bias average recalled pain. Therefore, t he focus of the analysis will be on the “worst pain”. Analgesic use will be recorded on the eCRF. Data on each indiv idual prescript ion and over-the-counter analgesic medicat ion will be recorded on the Concomitant Medicat ions eCRF, including but not limited to drug name and mode of administration. The use of analgesics should be reviewed with the patient during each vis it. Any changes to analgesic use (new or stopped analgesics) will be recorded on the eCRF. Analgesics will be classified into 1 of 6 categories, using an analgesic ladder approach with medicat ion category based on a World Health Organizat ion Pain scaleoutlined inTable JGDP. 12. A therapy category will be assigned according to the maximum category of therapy routinely administered based on analgesic data for that cycle. For the mBPI -sf, 2 baseline assessments will be collected, the first one within 7 days of the first cycle(not on Cycle1 Day1)and the second one at Day 1 of the first cy cleprior to study treatment administration .The baseline mBPI -sf score will be calculated as the average of the 2 baseline asse ssments. The mBPI-sf population will include all pat ients who com pleted the baseline assessment (2assessments within 7 days of Cycle1 Day1) followed by at least 1 mBPI -sf “worst pain” assessment after 1 cycle of study drug(Cycle2 Day1 or later). Table JGDP. 12. World Health Organization Pain Scale CodeDescription 0No analgesia 1Aspirin (for pain, not cardiovascular prophylaxis), acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 2Codeine, hydrocodone, pentazocine, oxycodone 3Oral morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, transdermal fentanyl 4Parenteral opiates 5Neurosurgical procedures (blocks) 9.9.1.2. EORTC QLQ- 30 Broadly used in cancer trials, validated, and available in over 80 different languages, the EORTC QLQ-C30 is a reliable and validated tool. The EORTC QLQ -C30 v3.0 i sa self-administered, cancer-specific questionnaire wit h multidimensio nal scales. The EORTC QLQ-C30 self- reported general cancer instrument consists of 30 items covered by 1 of 3 dimensi ons: global health status/qualit y of life (2 items) functional scales (15 total items addressing eit her physical, role, emotional, cognit ive, or social functioning) symptom scales (13 total items addressing either fatigue, nausea/vomit ing, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipat ion, diarrhea, or financial impact) The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is administered per the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). The recall period is the past week, complet ion time is ty pically 5 to 7 minutes, and the questionnaire will be scored as described by the EORTC scoring manual (Fayers 2001). The QLQ-C30 population will include all pat ients who com pleted the baseline assessment (Cycle 1"
66,page_66,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 66 LY3012207Day1) followed by at least 1 QLQ -C30assessment after 1 dose of study drug (Cycle 2 Day 1 or later). 9.9.1.3. EQ-5D-5L The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of self -reported heal th status (Herdman et al. 2011). Specifically, this quest ionnaire is included in this trial to evaluate health-state utilit ies associated with metastatic pancreatic cancer. These utilit y measures are an important input for economic evaluat ions concerning the value of treatment in terventions. The EQ-5D-5L is designed to be used in conjunct ion with other patient -reported measures. Patients will complete the 5 -dimension (mobility, self-care, usual act ivities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), 5-level (no problem, slight, mod erate, severe, or extreme problem) assessment according to the Schedule of Activities(Section 2). A unique EQ -5D health state is defined by co mbining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. Additionally, patients will indicate their current health status by marking on a visual analogue scale ranging fro m 100 (best imaginable healt h state) to 0 (worst imaginable healt h state). The recall period is “t oday.” The EQ -5D-5L is designed for self -completion taking only a few minutes to complete. The EQ-5D-5L populat ion will include all pat ients who completed the baseline assessment (Cycle 1Day 1) followed by at least 1 EQ-5D-5Lassessment after 1 dose of study drug(Cycle 2 Day 1 or later) . EQ-5D-5L responses may be incorporated into cost utilit y analyses, but will not be included in the clinical study report. 9.9.2.Resource Utili zation Investigators will be asked to document the use of best supportive care (BSC) measures, concomitant medicat ions, transfusio ns, and treatment -related hospitalizat ion days. Such assessments are to be taken throughout the study through the 30 -day short-term postdiscont inuation follow-up visit."
67,page_67,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 67 LY301220710.Statistical Considerations 10.1.Sample Size Determination The Phase 1b portion of the study will sequentially evaluate twoalternative dosing schedules using a “3 + 3”dose-escalation design. Based upon the design, the Phase 1b portion may enroll up to approximately 24patientsto determine the dose and regimen for olaratumabin combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabinerecommended for use in the Phase 2 portion of the study. The Phase 2 portion of the study will enroll approximately 162additional patients, randomized in a 1:1 fashion between study arms. The primary analysis of OSwill be performed when a minimum o f 113OS events have been observed. An overall study -wise, two -sided alpha level of 0.20 will be applied to the primary endpoint of OS. One interim safety and efficacy analysis and one final efficacy analysis will be perform ed. The interim efficacy analysis will occur after 70OS events, with OS compared between study arms. There will be no formal hypothesis testing or alpha -spending at the interim analysis wi th respect to efficacy in this study . The purpose of this interim analysis is solely to inform decision-making regarding whether or not to init iate early development of a separate Phase3 trial. Assuming the trueOS HRis 0.67, there is at leas t 80% statistical power at a 1-sided significance level of 0.10 (or equivalent ly a 2-sided significance level o f 0.20) to show a statist ically significant differ ence in OS between study arms. Researchers have reported a median OS of 8.5 months in pancreatic cancer patients receiving gemcitabine plus nab -paclitaxel versus 6.7 m onths with gemcitabine alone (Von Hoff et al . 2013). If the control arm in the current study performs similarly, the me dian OS for the experimental arm would be approximately 12 to 13 m onths, consistent with an HR of 0.67. Efficacy analysis will be based on intent -to-treat analyses. In addit ion, the safet y analysis requires only 1dose of study drug to be included ,thus patients excluded should be minimal. 10.2.Populations for Analyses Phase 1b DLT-evaluable Population : The DLT -evaluable populat ion will include all enrolled patients who complete Cycle 1 or di scontinue due to a DLT prior to complet ing Cycle 1 treatment. Safetypopulation: All enrolled pat ients who receive any quantity of study treatment, regardl ess of their eligibility for the study , will be included in the safety analysis. Safet y evaluation will be performed based on the actual init ial therapy a patient has received, regardl ess of any other cohort to which he or she was assigned.

Unless otherwise stated, all confidence intervals ( CIs)will be reported using a 2-sided95% level. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment only if it changes a princi pal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for making the change, will be described in the SAP and the clinical study report. Addi tional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate. 10.3.1.Efficacy Analyses 10.3.1.1. Primary Endpoint Overall Survival Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For each patient, prior to each data analysis, a reasonable effort will be made to obtain the most up -to-date status of the patient (date of death or last date known to be alive). If the patient is alive or l ost to follow -up at the time of data analysis, OS data will be censored on the last date the patient is known to be alive. For any patient who has withdrawn consent for"
69,page_69,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 69 LY3012207further fo llow-up of survival data, OS will be censored at the last date for which the patient consented to be fo llowed for the study . Overall survival will be compared between treatment arms using a stratified log -rank test, stratified by the rando mization strata. The corresponding hazard ratio between treatment arms will be estimated using a stratified Cox regressio n model (Cox 1972), stratified by the randomization strata. Overall survival curves, the median and survival rates at various time points with 95% CI, for each treatment arm will be estimated using t he Kaplan -Meier method (Kaplan and Meier 1958). Sensit ivity analyses for OS will be described in the SAP. 10.3.1.2. Secondary Endpoints Progression -Free Survival Progression -free survival is defined as the time from rando mization until the first radiographic documentation of progressi onas defined by RECIST (Version 1.1)or death fro m any cause in the absence ofPD. Patients who die wit hout a reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the day of their death. Pati ents who di d not progress or are lost to follow-up will be censored at the day of their last radiographic tum or assessment. If no baseline or postbaseline radio logic assessment is available, the patient will be censored at the date of randomization. If death or PD occurs af ter 2 or more consecutive missing radiographic visit s, censoring will occur at the date of the last radiographic visit prior to the missed visit s. The use of a new ant icancer therapy prior to the occurrence of PD will result in censoring at the date of last radiographic assessment prior to init iation of new therapy . Progression -free survival will be compared betwee n treatment arms using a stratified log- rank test, stratified by the randomizati on strata. The corresponding HR between treatment arms will be estimated using a stratified Cox regressio n model (Cox 1972), stratified by randomizat ion strata. Progression -free survival curves, m edian PFS, and PFS rates at various time po ints with 95% CI for each treatment arm will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method (Kaplan and Meier 1958). Sensit ivity analyses for PFS will be described in the SAP. Objective Response Rate Objective response rate is defined as the number of pat ients who achieve a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) from rando mization until PD/recurrence divided by the total number of patients rando mized to the corre sponding treatment arm (ITT population). Patients who do not have a tumor response assessment for any reason will be considered non -responders and will be included in the deno minator when calculat ing the response rate. The ORR, with 95% CI, will be summa rized for each treatment arm and compared between treatment arms using the Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel test adj usting for the randomization strata. Duration of Response Duration of response is defined as the time from the date measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that disease is recurrent or object ive"

The MedDRA Versio n 19.1 or laterwill be used when reporting AEs by MedDRA terms. The MedDRA Lower Level Term will be used in the treatment -emergent com putation. Treatm ent- emergent adverse events will be summarized by System Organ Class (SOC) and by decreasing frequency of Preferred Term within SOC. Phase 2 Safety analyses will include summaries of the fo llowing: AEs, including severi ty and possible rel ationship to study drug SAEs, including possible relationship to study drug AEsleading to dose adjust ments AESI IRR discontinuat ions from study treatment due to AEsor death treatment-emergent abnormal changes in laboratory values treatment-emergent abnormal changes in vital signs and ECGs 10.3.3.Other Analyses 10.3.3.1. Patient Disposition A detailed description o f patient disposition will be provi ded, including a summary of the number and percentage of patients entered into the study , enrolled in the study , and treated as well as number and percentage of patients completing the study , as defined in the SAP, or discontinuing (overall and by reason for discont inuation). A summary o f all important protocol deviations will be provided. 10.3.3.2. Patient Characteristics Demographic data are collected and reported to demo nstrate that the study population represents the target patient populat ion considered for regulatory approval. A summary of baseline pat ient and disease characteri stics, historical diagnose s, preexist ing conditions, and prior therapies will be reported using descript ive statist ics. 10.3.3.3. Concomitant Therapy A summary of prior and concomitant medications by treatment arm will be reported."

Poststudy -Treatment -Discontinuation Therapy The numbers and percentages of patients receiving poststudy -treatment-discontinuation anticancer therapies will be provided by t ype of therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy), and by drug cl ass and/or nam e, overall and by line of therapy . 10.3.3.5. Treatment Compliance The number of cycles received, dose omissio ns, dose reductions, dose delays, and dose intensit y will be summarized for all treated patients by treatment arm . Study treatment will be administered at the invest igator site, therefore treatment compliance is assured. 10.3.3.6. Pharmacokinetic Analyses Pharmacokinet ic analyses will be conducted on patients who have received at least 1 dose of the study drug and have had sufficient postdose samples collected to allow estimat ion of PK parameters. In the Phase 1b part, PK parameter estimates will be co mputed by standard nonco mpartmental methods of analysis for olaratumab. The maximum concentration (C max), time of C max(tmax), area under the concentration -time curve (AUC), half -life (t1/2), steady-state volume of distribution (Vss), clearance (CL), and other relevant parameters that can be calculated from the data will be reported from these nonco mpartmental analyses. In the Phase 2 part, PK parameters for olaratumab (CL, exposure, V ss, and t 1/2) and inter-individual PK variabili tywill be computed using nonlinear mixed effect modeling implemented in NONMEM. The versio n of any software used for the analysis will be documented and the program will meet the Lilly requirements of software validation. If warranted by the data,PK/pharmacodynamic analyses using OS, PFS, and/or other appropriate clinical endpo ints will also be conducted to characterize the exposure -response relationship in this study. 10.3.3.7. Patient Reported Outcomes Analyses -Phase 2 only Patient-reported outcomes are measured through the fo llowing: mBPI-sf EORTC QLQ -C30 EQ-5D-5L For each instrument (mBPI -sf, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EQ -5D-5L), percentage compliance will be calculated as the number of completed assessments divided by the number o f expected assessments (that is, patients still on study and alive). Percentage compliance and reasons for non-compliance will be summarized by treatment arm and t ime point. Data will be separately summarized by treatment and time po int using descript ive statistics. The main efficacy measure for the pain endpo int will be the time to first worsening of the mBPI -sf “worst pain” score. Time to first worsening in pain will be described using the method of"
72,page_72,"I5B-MC-JGDP(e)Clinical Protocol Page 72 LY3012207Kaplan and Meier and analyzes will be made between th e 2arms by a log-rank test. “Worsening” will be defined as eit her a “worst pain” increase o f >2 points postbaseline or an analgesic drug class increase of >1 level(Farrar et al . 2001; Rowbotham 2001). However, other approaches to defining clinically me aningful worsening in pain might be considered. Further detailswill be provided in the SAP. Additionally, time to first worsening of QLQ-C30 scale scores(see Section 9.9.1.2) will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier and Cox methods. Further statistical analysis to be performed for PROs will be defined and detailed in the SAP. The EQ-5D-5L responses may be incorporated into a cost -utility analyses but w ill not be included in the clinical study report. 10.3.3.8. Biomarker Analyses The markers in peripheral blood, plasma, serum, and tumor that may indicate pharmacodynamics/tailoring effect of olaratumab or the combinat ion partners may be explored and characterized by appropriate statist ics for the associat ion to clinical outcomes or for the characterizat ion by baseline markers. See Section 9.8for details reg arding bio marker evaluat ion. 10.3.3.9. Healthcare Resource Utilization Hospitalizations, transfusio ns, and concomitant medicat ions during study treatment will be summarized descript ively by treatment arm. Investigators will be asked to document the use of best suppo rtive care measures, conco mitant medications, transfusio ns, and treatment -related hospitalization days. Such assessments are to be taken throughout the study through the 30 -day short-term postdiscontinuation follow-up visit. 10.3.4.Subgroup Analyses A prespecifi ed list of subgroups will be ident ified in the SAP. The treatment effect within each subgroup will be summarized. Other subgroup analyses not specified in the SAP may be performed as deemed appropriate. These subgroups will be based on important charact eristics, for example, prognosti c significance. 10.3.5.Interim Analyses An interim analysis that includes both safet y and efficacy will be conducted . The analysis will occur after at least 70 OS events have been observed among Phase 2 patients . The interim analysis will not be used for purposes of formally testing any efficacy hypotheses . The results from the interim analyses will be examined by an independent Data Moni toring Committee (i DMC).The membership, roles, and responsibilit ies of the of the iDMC will be defined in the SAP or iDMC Charter.

Study Design … 5.4.5. Rationale for Amendment ( e) Amendment (e) updates the protocol to include screening criteria for Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against galactose -α-1-3-galactose (α -gal) and premedicat ion requirements to mit igate the risk for an observed rate of Grade ≥3 infusion -related reacti ons(IRRs) on Study JGDP that was greater than the rate of 3.1% previously observed across the olaratumab program. Based on data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portion of Study JGDP, Grade ≥3 IRRs were observed at an approximate rate between 5% and 10% of olar atumab-treated pati ents. Infusion related reacti ons are a known Adverse Drug Reaction for olaratumab, and the rate of IRR is 12.5% (all grades) and 3.1% (Grade ≥3). Grade ≥3 IRR occur within minutes of first infusion of olaratumab. The risk of anaphylact ic reaction is associated with elevated IgE antibody levels. Across 8 studi es with olaratumab (401 evaluable olaratumab -treated pati ents), IgE antibody levels greater than the manufacturer -specified ULN had a posit ive predict ive value of 75% (34.9% -96.8%) and a negative predict ive value of 99% (98.2% -99.9%) for Grade ≥3 IRRs, with sensitivity of 75% (34.9% -96.8%) and specificit y of 99% (98.2% -99.9%). Two patients had Grade ≥3 IRR wi th an IgE antibody level ≤ ULN (0.28 kU/L and <0.10 kU/L, respectively). Prior to this amendment, patients in Study JGDP were tested for pre -existing IgE antibody against α-galas pre-planned retrospective analysis. However, the results of these tests were not available prior to first dosing of o laratumab/placebo. Pre-testing for elevated IgE antibody levels against -gal for all untreated pati ents as part of screening is being implemented as a risk mit igation strategy . This amendment implements actions to mit igate the risk of increased Grade ≥3 IRRs observed in Study JGDP. Specifically , screening in the Phase 2 portion of the study was modified to i nclude immuniogenicit y testing, and the inclusio n/exclusion criteria wer e updated to clarify that patients"
