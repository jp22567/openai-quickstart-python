For patients rolling over from Study TV50717 -CNS -30046 or Study TV50717- CNS -30060, the week 13 visit ( Study TV50717 -CNS -30046) or the week 9 visit (Study TV50717- CNS -30060) will be the day 1 visit for Study TV50717 -CNS -30047. I f the patient does not wish to enroll in Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 at that visit, they can enroll up to 1 week following the week 13 or week 9 visits, respectively . The end of study is defined as the date of the week 56 visit of the last participant. Patients who have successfully completed a parent study may be eligible to enroll in this study after they complete a 1- week washout period and the final evaluation at week 13 (TV50717- CNS -30046) or week 9 (TV50717- CNS -30060) in the parent study . Site-administered scales include the YGTSS, , Mini I nternational Neurops ychiatric Interview For Children and Adolescents ( MINI Kid, version 6.0 ), and the C -SSRS ;and self-administered scales include the TS -PGII, , , CDI - 2,and C&A- GTS -QOL . For the YGTSS ,input from the caregiver/adu lt is required. For TS-PGII , input from the caregiver/adult is permitted. Forall other scales, for"

For children over 13 y ears of age, caregiver/adult involvement is strongl y encouraged. Questions should be directed to the child, but the caregiver/adult should be encouraged to add rel evant information .It should be noted that the CDI -2 has individual parent and child questionnaires. Informed consent/assent, depending on the child’s age , as appropriate, will be obtained before any study procedures are performed. For patients rolling ove r from Study TV50717- CNS -30046 or Study TV50717- CNS -30060, informed consent/assent, as appropriate, may be obtained prior to the day 1 visit, up to 4 weeks in advance of open -label study participation. Any patient that turns 18 years of age during the course of Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 will need to be re-consented as an adult. In the stud y period descriptions below, “week X” refers to the end of that week, which coincides with the study visit, unless stat ed otherwise. Some dose changes will occur at the start of a week rather than at the end of a week and will be indicated as such. Screening For patients from Study SD-809-C-17 : During the screening period (up to 31 day s), all screening procedures will be performed for patients rolling over from Study SD-809-C-17 as they will have been off IMP for several months at the time of enrollment into this study . After informed consent /assent, depending on the child’s age , as appropriate, is obtained, patients who are stable from a medical and ps ychiatric standpoint will undergo a screening evaluation, including medical history, phy sical and neurological examination, assessment of vital signs, laboratory testing, and 12- lead ECG, along with rating scales to assess comorbid TS sy mptoms and behavioral status . At the discretion of the investigator, the screening visit may be divided into 2 visits if the visit length is deemed to be too burdensome for the patient. Patients may be rescreened 1 time if there is a change in the patient’s medical background, a modification of study entry criteria, or other relevant change .(Note: Details of rescreening must be approved and documented by the medical monitor and/or C linical Surveillance and Training team .)Forpatients from Study TV50717- CNS -30046 or Study TV50717 -CNS -30060: The screening evaluation for this open label stud y occurs at the end of the treatment period in the double -blind study . To reduce patient burden and not collect duplicate information , after obtaining informed consent/assent , depending on the child’s age , as appropriate, relevant data collected in Study TV50717 -CNS -30046 or Study TV50717 -CNS -30060 will be used to provide corresponding data in this open -label stud y (see Table 1). YGTSS Rater Certification: All investigators and subinvestigators who will be administering the YGTSS from screening th rough the end of stud yvisit must undergo and pass a Rater Certification Program which will be provided separatel y from this protocol. Every effort must be made to ensure that the same certified rater administers the YGTSS to a specific patient at all visits where this scale is administered, especially at day 1 and at weeks 28, 30, and 54/ early termination visits. However, if due to unforeseen circumstances the same rater is absolutel y unavailable to complete a visit rating, the YGTSS can be administere d only by another certified individual from that study site."

Titration period (7 weeks): As patients from Study SD-809-C-17 will have been off IMP for several months at the time of enrollment, and since patients from Study TV50717 -CNS -30046 or Study TV50717- CNS -30060 will have discontinued IMP (TEV -50717 or placebo) for at least 1week at completion of the parent stud y, all patients will undergo TEV -50717 dose titration in this study .Patients will receive 6 mg of TEV -50717 with food on the evening of day 1. Tablets should be taken with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty stomach. The titration scheme and maximum dose will be deter mined by body weight and cy tochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) impairment status from the parent study . Patients will be classified as CYP2D6 impaired if they are receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or are a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer based on blinded assessment of CYP2D6 genot ype at baseline of the parent study .Patients who are CYP 2D6 impaired w ill have a dose cap in the open- label trial ,as shown in the table below . Patients and their caregiver/adult will interact weekly with the clinical research staff, either b y telephone contact or in-clinic visits from week 1 through week 7 of the titration period, in order to evaluate safet y and establish a dose of TEV -50717 that optimally reduces tics and is well tolerated (optimal d ose). Safety evaluations during the titration period include assessment of vital signs, monitoring for adverse events and concomitant medications, 12-lead ECGs, and rating scales for depression and suicidality . In-person (in- clinic) study visits will be s cheduled at weeks 2, 4, and 6, and telephone contacts will be scheduled for weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 in order to assess tic severit y andadverse events. The dose of the IMP should be increased on a weekly basis until one of the following occurs: The investigator determines there has been a clinically meaningful reduction in tics . The patient experiences a protocol- defined “clinically significant” adverse event (defined as an adverse event that is related to the IMP and is either moderate or severe in intensity or meets the criteria for a serious adverse event). The maximum allowable dose is reached based on the patient’s weight and CYP2D6 impairment status."

Dose adjustments of TEV -50717 (upward or downward) may be made during the maintenance per iod, if necessary , but not more often than every 5days and only in increments of 6 mg. As during titration, dose adjustments should be made based on all available information. During the maintenance period, in- person (in- clinic) study visits will be sched uled at weeks 8, 15, 34, 41, and 54 for assessments of safet y and efficacy and telephone contacts will be scheduled for weeks 21 and 47 in order to assess adverse events and tic severity . The randomized drug withdrawal and re-titration period (Part B) will occur from the end of week 28 through the end of week 33, and then the Part A maintenance period will resume , along with the ability to make dose adjustments as described above . At week 54, patients will undergo a complete evaluation, including ph ysical and neurological examination, safet y laboratory testing, 12 -lead ECG, CDI -2, and C -SSRS assessments, as well as the YGTSS, TS -CGI, , TS-PGII, , and C&A -GTS -QOL. Washout and follow -up period: All patients will discontinue I MP at the week 54 visit and will return 1 week later (week 55) for evaluation of safety and tic reduction. Patients will have a follow -up telephone contact for safety evaluation 1 week after the end of the washout period (2weeks after their last dose of I MP)(week 56). Part B: Blinded, Randomized Drug Withdrawal Period and Titration P ost-Drug Withdrawal (5weeks) : At the week 28visit, the patients will be randomized 2:1 to the ircurrent dose of TEV -50717 or placebo in order to check for the return of sympto ms.Because IMP is dispensed as enough doses for 2 weeks (current dose level and next dose level) , the week 28 visit (Day 196) is considered the first day of the randomized withdrawal period, although the patient will begin taking blinded I MP the nex t morning on Day 197. Patients will have a follow -up telephone contact for safety evaluation 1 week after the start of the randomized drug withdrawal period. At week 30, safety and efficacy will be assessed . At the week 30 visit, patients who receive TEV -50717 during the randomized drug withdrawal period will continue at the same dose in a blinded manner from the start of week 31 to the start of week 34.Any patient who was randomized to placebo during th e 2 -week randomized drug wi thdrawal period will undergo blinded re -titration (titration post -drug withdrawal) to their previousl y established maintenance dose over the 3 weeks of treatment following the randomized drug withdrawal period (start of week 31 through start of week 34 [Days 211 through 232]) . The titration scheme and maximum dose will be determined based on the previously established maintenance dose as tabulated below . The dose of IMP for each patient who underwent 2weeks of placebo will be titrated back to the mainten ance dose that was used by the patient up to week 28followed by continued maintenance therap y at that dose. Patients will have a follow -up telephone contact for safet y evaluation at week s 31 and 33 . All patients should be back at their maintenance dose on or before the start of week 34 and return to open -label treatment for the remainder of the study (note that, because IMP is dispensed for 2-week periods, patients will use blinded bottles through the end of week 34; however, all patient s will be known to be on active treatment at the start of week 34)."

During the blinded drug withdrawal and re-titration period, patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment. In addition, the sponsor’s and development partner’s clinical personnel and all vendors (with the exception of the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) vendor and the IMP pac kaging vendor) involved in the study will be blinded to the I MP identity until the database has been locked for anal ysis and the treatment assignments are revealed. IMP Dose, Mode of Administration, and Administration Rate: IMP will be administered as ora l tablets at a starting dose of 6 mg once daily , to be taken in the morning (except for day 1, when it should be taken in the evening after the clinic visit) . Titration schemes ba sed on bod y weight are shown in the first table above (“Titration period [7weeks] ” section) . The maximum daily dose is determined by body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status (see the first table above ). Dose adjustments can be made during the titration period and also, if clinically indicated , during the maintenance period dosing before and after the randomized drug withdrawal and re-titration period. During the open- label period, TEV -50717 tablets are available in the following dose strengths: 6, 9, and 12mg.Each dose strength will have a marking of SD 6, SD 9, and SD 12 corresponding"

During the randomized drug withdrawal and re-titration period, T EV-50717 tablets are available in the following dose strengths: 6, 9 , 12, 15, and 18 mg, all of which are identical in size, shape, and color (white). The IMP will be supplied in 20 -count bottles. The placebo tablets and packaging will match those for TEV-50717. Patients who receive TEV -50717 during the randomized drug withdrawal period will remain on their maintenance dose of blinded active IMP from the start of week 31 to the start of week 34; those assigned to placebo during the randomized drug withdrawal period will undergo blinded re-titration from the start of week 31 to the start of week 34 back to their previously establ ished maintenance dose from the end of week 28. Note that, because IMP is dispensed for 2 -week periods, patients will use blinded bottles through the end of week 34; however, all patients will be known to be on active treatment at the start of week 34. IMP will be administered as follows: IMP should be swallowed whole and taken with food . Tablets should be taken with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty stomach. Dosing will be based on body weight and strong CYP2D6 impairment status , as shown in the tables above . The starting dose is 6 mg in all patients. With the exception of the 6 -mg dose (administered once dail y), doses will be administered twice dail y, approximately 8to10hours apart during the day . A minimum of 6 hours should elapse between doses. If a patient misses a dose and it is within 6 hours of the irnext dose, the missed dose should be skipped. After week 1, dose increases may not occur more frequentl y than every 5 days. Dose reductions, if required, should be in increments of 6 mg. If more than 1 dose reduction is required for an adverse event, the medical monitor should be notified . After dose adjustment, if the maintenance dose for a patient is 6 mg, the dose should be taken once a day in the morning with food. During the titration period, the dose of IMP should be adjusted acco rding to the first table above (Maximum Daily Dose of IMP by Study Day and Weight Category on Day 1 for Titration at Study Initiation ) to identify a dose level that optimally reduces tics and is well tolerated. A dose cap for impaired patients isprespecified by the IRT. After week 24, patient dose should bekept stable, if possible, until beginning Part B. During the randomized drug withdrawal period, the patient will continue to receive theircurrent dose of TEV- 50717 or receive matching placebo until returning to their dose of TEV -50717 at the start of week 31 (patients who receive TEV -50717 during the randomized drug withdrawal period will remain on their maintenance dose of blinded active IMP from the start of week 31 to the start of week 34; those assigned to placebo during the randomized drug withdrawa l period will undergo blinded re-"

Statistical Considerations: Sample Size Rationale: This is an open -label study . The sample size for this study is not based on statistical considerations; hence, only descriptive statistics will be presented and will be analyzed by age group at baseline . Up to approximately 227 patients who also meet patient exclusio n/inclusion criteria will be enrolled (approximately 1patient is estimated to enroll from the Phase 1b Study SD-809- C-17, up to approximately 99 patients are estimated to enroll from the Phase 2/3 Study TV50717 -CNS -30046, and up to approximately 127 patients are estimated to enroll from the Phase 3 Study TV50717 -CNS -30060) . For the randomized drug withdrawal period, 190 patients to be included in the anal ysis will provide approximately 90% power to detect a difference between TEV -50717 -treated and placebo -treated patients assuming a difference in YGTSS TTS of 4.5 with a standard deviation of 9 using a two-sided test for difference at a significance level of 0.05. Planned Interim Analysis: When approximately 100 patients have completed the 28 -week clinic visit, an interim anal ysis, including data from day 1 and up to week 28 visit only ,will be conducted to provide descriptive, long-term safet y and efficacy data to be used in regulatory submissions. To maintain data integrit y of Stud yTV50717 -CNS -30047, only a limited number of personnel who do not have contact with the sites will have a ccess to this interim data in preparation for the regulatory filing."

Analyse s of Safety : All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or s ystem organ class category for the anal yses of safety . Summaries will be presented for all adverse events, adverse events determined by the investigator to be related to IMP, serious adverse events, and adverse events causing withdrawal from the study. Patient listings of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented. Observed values and changes from day 1in laboratory results and vital signs will be summarized descriptivel y. Observed values in ECG parameters will be summarized, and counts and percentages of abnormal findings will be presented. Changes from parent study baseline (for patients rolling over from Study TV50717 -CNS -30046 or Study TV50717- CNS -30060) or from day 1 (for patient[s] rolling over from Study SD-809-C-17) in ECG parameters will be summarized descriptively . In addition, the number and percentage of patients with on -treatment QTcF value s >450, >480, or >500 msec and change from baseline (Study TV50717 -CNS -30046 or Study TV50717- CNS -30060) or day 1 (Study SD-809-C- 17)>30 or >60 msec will be presented. The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive statistics. Concomitant medications will include all medications taken while the patient is treated with IMP .

Introduction Tourette s yndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple motor and phonic tics and a variet y of behavioral and ps ychiatric comorbidities ( Jankovic 2001, Jankovic and Kurlan 2011). Studies have suggested that up to 7% of school children fulfill the diagnostic criteria for TS ( Kurlan et al 2002 ). Tics are classified as either simple or complex ; simple motor tics include ey e blinks, shoulder shrugs, while simple vocal tics include grunting, coughing ,and sniffing. Complex motor tics include touching/tapping and walking in patterns, while complex vocal tics include echolalia (repeating another’s speech) and coprolalia (shouting obscenities or profanities) ( Jankovic 2001 , Shaw and Coffey 2014 ). TS was thought to be a psy chogenic disorder until improvement with neuroleptics was first observed in the 1960s, leading to the theory of central dopaminergic hy peractivit y as a possible mechanism of tics associated with TS. When the sy mptoms impair function, most phy sicians utilize alpha adrenergic drugs (guanfacine, clonidine), ty pical neurol eptics (haloperidol, pimozide, fluphenazine), or aty pical neuroleptics (olanzapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole) to control tics ( Gilbert and Jankovic 2014, Wijemanne et al 2014). In the United Stat es of America (USA), haloperidol and pimozide are approved for the treatment of tics associated with TS, while aripiprazole carries a broader indication of “for the treatment of TS”. Neuroleptics have the potential for serious adverse effects, including ta rdive dyskinesia (TD), which ty pically manifests as an irreversible orofacial stereoty py, and other forms of h yperkinetic movement disorder ( Waln and Jankovic 2013 ). Up to 25% of adults chronicall y treated with dopamine recept or antagonists (neuroleptics; including the so- called “atypical” neuroleptics, such as aripiprazole) eventually develop TD ( Jankovic 1995, Pasricha et al 2006, Peña e t al 2011 ). Although elderly individuals, especiall y women, are particularl y susceptible to developing TD, this iatrogenic condition may also rarel y occur in children ( Mejia and Jankovic 2010 ). Tetrabenazine, which depletes do pamine pres ynaptically, has been shown to be effective in treating the tics associated with TS ( Jain et al 2006, Jankovic 2015 , Jankovic and Beach 1997, Kenney et al 2007, Paleacu et al 2004 , Porta et al 2008 ) but has not been documented to cause TD in clinical use. While generally effective in reducing the tics of TS, tetrabenazi ne is associated with frequent adverse events, including somnolence, nausea, depression, insomnia, and parkinsonism, that may limit its utility . Moreover, tetrabenazine is an immediate -release formulation with the following limitations: (1) adverse events of tetrabenazine, such as somnolence, akathisia, and anxiety , are often associated with peak concentration after dosing; (2) the active metabolites have short half-lives , with the attendant requirement to dose the immediate-release formulation frequentl y; and (3) the active metabolites alpha- dihydrotetrabenazine (α -HTBZ) and beta-dihydrotetrabenazine (β -HTBZ) are either primarily (α) or exclusively (β) metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Poly morphisms in the CYP2D6 gene necessitate genoty ping to prevent poor metabolizers from experiencing significantly greater exposure to the active drug moiety than extensive metabolizers ( Mehanna et al 201 3). To address the limitations of commercial tetrabenazine (Xenazine®), Auspex, a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc, has developed a deuterated tetrabenazine (referred to as TEV -50717 , previously SD-809) that is eliminated more slowly than"
38,page_38,"Uncontrolled Study –Toure tte Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protoc olwith Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 38tetrabenazine. TEV -50717 has been shown to reduce plasma fluctuation and dosing frequency and thus has the potential to improve overall tolerability as compared to that of tetrabenazine. Data in patients receiving TEV -50717 for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington ’s disease (HD) demonstrate a favorable safet y profile with low rates of neuropsy chiatric adverse events. In TS patients with troublesome motor and phonic tics, preliminary efficacy and safet y data for TEV -50717 have been generated in an open -label, Phase 1b pilot study (SD-809-C- 17). Results of this study are summarized in Section 1.3.2.2 and support further devel opment of TEV -50717 for treatment of tics associated with TS. TEV -50717 was granted breakthrough status for treatment of TD by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on the results of Study SD-809-C- 18, and NDA 209885 was granted priorit y review stat us. TEV -50717 was approved for the treatment of chorea associated with HD on 03 April 2017. 1.2. Name and Description of Investigational Medicinal Product TEV -50717 (deutetrabenazine) is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor with the chemical na me (RR, SS) -1,3,4,6,7,11b- hexahy dro-9,10-di(methoxy- d3)-3-(2-methy lpropy l)- 2H-benzo[a]quinolizin -2-one. During the open- label period, TEV -50717 tablets are available in the following dose strengths: 6, 9, and 12 mg. Each dose strength will have a marking of SD 6, SD 9, and SD12 corresponding to the dose strength and a distinct color: 6 mg –purple, 9 mg – blue, and 12mg –beige. The investigational medicinal product ( IMP)will be supplied in 20 -or 60-count tabl ets per dose strength per bottle. A more detailed description of the product is given in Section 3.8 During the randomized d rug withdrawal and re-titration period, TEV -50717 tablets are available in the following dose strengths: 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 mg, all of which are identical in size, shape, and color (white). The IMP will be supplied in 20 -count bottles. 1.3. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies Brief summaries of nonclinical pharmacology , pharmacokinetic s, and toxicology studiesand clinical studies are provided in the following sections . More detailed information is provided in the current Investigator’s Brochure ( IB), including the IB supplement for TS (if available) . 1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies The key nonclinical study findings are provided below, with details available in the IB. 1.3.1.1. Nonclinical Pharmacology TEV -50717 is a selectively deuterium -substituted VMAT2 inhibitor structurally related to tetrabenazine. The metabolites formed from TEV -50717 (α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ) are potent inhibitors of VMAT2 binding, with K ivalues of 3.8 and 22 nM, respectively, that are similar to previously reported values of their corresponding nondeuterated forms ( Scherman et al 1988 ). Off-target binding occurs to a similar extent with deuterated and nondeuterated α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ. TEV -50717 and tetrabenazine in male rats at doses resulting in similar sy stemic exposure to the test articles (α-HTBZ and β -HTBZ) produced similar, expected, exaggerated central nervous s ystem pharmacological effects. In particular, the adverse event of cataleps y, a"
39,page_39,"Uncontrolled Study –Toure tte Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protoc olwith Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 39known response in rats to drugs that reduce central nervous s ystem dopamine concentrations (Fuenmay or and Vogt 1979), was similar in magnitude after TEV -50717 and tetrabenazine administration. 1.3.1.2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism In human liver S9, the metabolite profile of TEV -50717 overlapped with that of tet rabenazine. In a clinical comparative human [14C]-absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion ,and mass -balance study , the approximately 22metabolites of TEV -50717 were also metabolites of tetrabenazine. Thus, previous clinical experience with tetrabenazine provides predictive information about the safety of TEV -50717 and its metabolites. Tetrabenazine, α -HTBZ, and β -HTBZ, and b y extension, their deuterated forms, do not inhibit or induce cy tochrome P450 ( CYP) isoenzy mes at clinically relevant concentrations ( Xenazine Prescribing Information 2015 ). M1, a minor metabolite that may circulate in greater concentrations as a metabolite of TEV -50717 as compared to tetrabenazine, is neither an inhibitor of major CYP iso enzymes or transporters nor an inducer of CYP iso enzymes. 1.3.1.3. Toxicology General and Reproductive Adult Toxicology : Oral administration of TEV -50717 in rats reduced body weight gain, increased mammary hyperplasia, and produced estruscyclechanges, all of which occurred with tetrabenazine at doses that produced similar s ystemic exposures to test articles and metabolites. Mammary and estrus effects are likely consequences of reduced central dopamine and subsequent lyincreased prolactin, consistent with information in the Xenazine® (tetrabenazine) label. Oral administration of TEV -50717 in pregnant rats did not produce test article -related embry ofetal toxicities, even at doses that led to reduced body weight gain in dams. Oral administration of metabolite M1 to pregnant rat s from gestational day s 6 to 17 produced no test article -related maternal or fetal toxicities. Genetic Toxicology : TEV -50717 and its α-HTBZ and β -HTBZ metabolites were negative in invitro studies for mutagenicity (bacterial reverse mutation, or the Ames t est) and for chromosomal structural aberrations in human peripheral blood ly mphocy tes. Oral doses of TEV -50717 were negative for inducing micronuclei in the bone marrow of treated mice. Juvenile Toxicology : The effects of TEV -50717 on juvenile development was assessed in male and female rats with oral dosing from weaning (postnatal day [PND] 21) to PND 71, similar to human dosing from Year 2 through earl y adolescence and overlapping with TEV -50717 oral dosing in a general adult toxicology study . The effect s of M1 were assessed in male and female juvenile rats from PND 25 to PND 70 with a recovery phase and postdosing reproductive assessment. TEV -50717 produced no test -article -related effects on learning and memory functions, on histopathology assessments, o n reproductive capacity (male and female fertility , estrus cy clicit y), or on intrauterine survival of emb ryos from matings during recovery from test article administration. Adversely reduced bod y weight gain and adverse clinical observation of tremors and in- cage h yperactivity were all noted in previous studies with adult rats; these effects have not predicted adult clinical intolerance to TEV -50717. The highest dose level of M1 (50 mg/kg/day ) produced no test article -related toxicities (clinical observations, changes in body weight gain,"
40,page_40,"Uncontrolled Study –Toure tte Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protoc olwith Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 40clinical pathology , histopathology , ophthalmology, and performance in learning and memory tests). Theno-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL ) for toxicities in juvenile rats is lower than that in adults; however, the total (α+β) -HTBZ exposure multiples or safety margins comparing rat to humans at the adult and juvenile age categories are similar. The potential for increased sensitivity to the effects of TEV -50717 in pediatric patients is mitigated by 2 factors. First, the effects of TEV -50717 on behavior and weight gain recovered with cessation of test article administration in the juvenile rat toxicology study. Second, the clinical signific ance of tremors and reduced bod y weight gain in rats dosed with TEV -50717 are unclear because these findings were not adverse events of note in adults or adolescent patients. While hy poactivity in rats has the potential to relate to clinical observations of somnolence, this adverse effect is controlled with dose reduction. In clinical comparison, the adverse event profile of tetrabenazine in adult patients is qualitatively similar to patients from approximately 22 months to 18 y ears of age ( Jain et al 2006 , Kenney et al 2007 , Porta et al 2008 ). 1.3.2. Clinical Studies The clinical development plan for TEV -50717 to date includes: 7completed Phase 1 studies in healthy adult volunteers 2 ongoing Phase 1 studies in healthy adult volunteers 1 completed Phase 3pivotal study for the treatment of chorea associated with HD 1 completed Phase 3 long -term safety study in patients with HD 2completed Phase 2/3 study in patients with TD 1ongoing Phase 3 long-term safet y study in patients with TD 1 completed Phase 1b study in patients with T S 2 ongoing Phase 2/3 and Phase 3 studies in patients with TS 1 ongoing Phase 3 long- term safet y stud y in patients with TS Further details may be found in the IB. 1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies Seven Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies were conducted in healthy adult volunteers. In addition, sparse pharmacokinetic sampling was included in the Phase 3 studies with HD patients where population pharmacokinetic analy ses were performed to extensively evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetics/pharmacody namics relationship of TEV -50717. A summary of the clinical pharmacology findings is provided in the IB. Pharmacometric anal yses of TEV -50717’s a ctive metabolites based on the Phase 1 clinical pharmacology in healthy adult volunteers were performed to support dose selection and pharmacokinetic characterization in a pediatric population. Subsequently, a further pharmacometric anal ysis of TEV -50717’s active metabolites following administration of TEV -50717 to adolescent TS patients with tics ( Study SD-809-C-17) was recentl y completed . The results of these analyses are described in Section 1.3.2.3 ."

Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies TEV -50717 has pharmacologic activity indistinguishable from tetrabenazine, a VMAT2 inhibitor with established efficacy in treating the motor and phonic tics associated with TS. Preliminary efficacy of TEV -50717 has been evaluated in an open- label, Phase 1b pilot study in patients with troublesome motor and phonic tics associated with TS ( Study SD-809-C- 17). Twent y-three patients were enrolled in this study across 9 centers in the USA. Patients who completed the study received treatment with TEV -50717 for a total of 8 weeks and had a safet y follow-up assessment 4 weeks after treatment. The following efficacy observations were made in this study : TEV -50717 was ef fective in reducing both motor and vocal tics from baseline to week 8 (end of treatment), demonstrating a 37.60% reduction in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Score (TTS) from baseline (p<0.0001). The reduction in tic severity was assoc iated with significant improvement (from baseline to week 8) in the YGTSS I mpairment score ( -35.32%; p<0.0001), the Tourette Sy ndrome -Clinical Global Impression (TS -CGI) score ( -1.2 points; p<0.0001), and in the Patient Global I mpression of Change score. F or example, compared to baseline, 76% of patients completing the study reported that they were “much” or “very much” improved at week 8. Between week 8 (end of treatment) and week 9 (1 week post -treatment), an increase in YGTSS and TS- CGI scores w ereobser ved following discontinuation of treatment with TEV-50717 at week 8, indicating a re- emergence of s ymptoms, thus providing further evidence of efficacy . The safet y profile of TEV -50717 has been characterized to date in healthy volunteers as well as in pati ents with chorea associated with HD and TD (as detailed in the IB). Study SD-809-C-17 also evaluated the safet y of TEV -50717 in patients with TS. Results of the safet y analyses indicate that treatment with TEV- 50717 at dosages up to 36 mg dail y given in 2 divided doses is generall y safe and well tolerated for up to 8 weeks in patients with TS. No serious treatment - emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or severe TEAEs occurred in this study . The most frequentl y observed TEAEs during the entire treatment period wer e fatigue and headache, each reported in 4/23 (17.4%) patients, followed by irritability which was reported in 3/23 (13.0%) patients. There were no clinicall y meaningful trends in mean changes from baseline for an y clinical laboratory variable or any othe r observations related to safet y. 1.3.2.3. Pharmacometrics Analysis of TEV -50717 Active Metabolites to Support Dose Selection and Pharmacokinetic Characterization in a Pediatric Population Population pharmacokinetics modeling of the TEV -50717 active metabolites -HTBZ and β-HTBZ has been performed throughout the clinical development program. Based on sequential pharmacokinetics sampling data obtained in healthy volunteers in the Phase 1 program, a structural population pharmacokinetics model was developed to guide d ose selection for HD patients with chorea ( Study SD-809- CLN-076) and subsequently optimized to better describe the absorption/bioconversion profile of -HTBZ and β -HTBZ ( Study SD-809- CLN-077)."
42,page_42,"Uncontrolled Study –Toure tte Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protoc olwith Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 42Employ ing the structural model defined in Study SD-809- CLN-077, sequential and sparse pharmacokinetics sampling data obtained from Study SD-809-C-17 were combined with the Phase 1 data emplo yed in Study SD-809- CLN-077 to estimate the exposure total of ( +β)-HTBZ in adolescent patients (age 12 to 18 y ears) with TS and to simulate exposure in adolescent and pediatric patients (age 6 to 11 y ears) with and without concomitant use of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor across a range of doses ( Appendix B). Population model parameters were re -estimated for the combined Phase 1 and adolescent data obtained from patients in Study SD-809-C-17. The model was used to simulate total ( +β)-HTBZ exposures across a range of body weights corresponding to a pediatric and adolescent population according to the Centers for Disease Control growth charts. This analy sis indicated that exposure to total ( +β)-HTBZ is influenced b y body weight, and a reduction in dose for pediatric and adolescent patients weighing <40 kg is necessary in order to provide comparable exposure to doses up to 48 mg per day in adults, a level previously demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in treated patients with chor ea associated with HD. This analy sis provides the basis for the dosing recommendations in Section 5.1. 1.4. Known and Potential Benefits and Risks to Patients Additional information regarding benefits and risks to patients may be found in the current IB andinthe United States prescribing information for AUSTEDO™(deutetrabenazine) . 1.5. Selection of Investigational Medicinal Product and Doses A detailed description of IMP administration is presented in Section 5.1. 1.5.1. Justification for Dose of Active Drug The dose ranges to be evaluated in t his study , based on body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status on day 1, were selected on the basis of the safet y, preliminary efficacy, and population pharmacokinetics data generated from Study SD-809-C-17 ( Table 2). In Study SD-809-C-17, TEV -50717 up to 18mg twice dail y (bid [36mg/day ]) was well tolerated and demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit in adolescents with TS -associated tics. The dosages proposed in the present stud y aim to match the exposure achieved in adults receiving up to 48 mg/day (24mg bid), a level previously demonstrated to be efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in patients with HD-associated chorea. Similar to one of the parent stud ies (TV50717 -CNS -30046), IMPwill be titrated based on investigator, patient, and parent/guardian assessments of tic reduction and adverse event s. This dosing strategy is practical in a clinical study setting and affords sufficient time betw een dose steps for safety and efficacy to be assessed. It is also consistent with the clinical application of tetrabenazine, another VMAT2 inhibitor with accepted efficacy in this population. 1.6. Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in full accor dance with the I nternational Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Triparti te Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) E6 and any applicable national and local laws and regulations (eg, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations [21CFR] Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, 312, and 314, Directive 2001/20/EC of the Eu ropean Parliament"

General Design and Study Schema tic Diagram This is a 56-week, open -label, single -arm stud y that includes a 2 -week, double -blind, placebo-controlled, randomized drug withdrawal period followed b y a 3 -week blinded re-titration period to evaluate the safet y of TEV -50717 in children and adolescent swith tics associated with TS after they have successful ly completed any of the parent studies(SD-809-C- 17 [Phase 1b ], TV50717- CNS -30046 [ Phase 2/3] , or TV50717 -CNS -30060 [Phase 3] ).Patients rolling over from Study SD-809-C-17 will need to undergo all day 1 assessments. For patients rolling over from Study TV50717- CNS -30046 or Study TV50717- CNS -30060, the week 13 visit (Study TV50717- CNS -30046) or the week 9 visit ( Study TV50717- CNS -30060) will be the day 1 visit for Study TV50717 -CNS -30047. If the patient does not wish to enroll in Study TV50717- CNS -30047 at that visit, they can enroll up to 1 week following the week 13 or week 9 visits, respect ively. For patients rolling over from Study SD-809-C-17 , this study will consist of a 4 -week screening period (up to 31 day s) and up to 54week s oftreatment. All participating p atients are expected to participate in this study for its entire duration, wh ich is a minimum of 56 weeks . Patients will have a follow -up telephone contact to evaluate safety 1week after the end of the washout period ( 2weeks after their last dose of IMP). The end of study is defined as the date of the week 56 visit of the last pa rticipant. Informed consent/assent, depending on the child’s age , as appropriate, will be obtained before any study procedures are performed. For patients rolling over from Study TV50717- CNS -30046 or Study TV50717- CNS -30060, informed consent/assent , as appropriate, may be obtained prior to the day 1visit, up to 4 weeks in advance of open -label study participation. Any patient that turns 18 years of age during the course of Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 will need to be re-consented as an adult. Patients who ha ve successfully completed any of the parent stud iesmay be eligible to enroll in the current study after they complete a 1 -week washout period and the final evaluation (week 13 in Study TV50 717-CNS -30046 or week 9 in Study TV50717 -CNS -30060) in the parent study . To reduce patient burden, a fter obtaining informed consent/assent, depending on the child’s age , as appropriate, some data collected in Study TV50717 -CNS -30046 or Study TV50717 - CNS - 30060 will be used to provide corresponding day1data in th ecurrent open - label stud y (see Table 1). All screening procedures will be performed for patients rolling over from Study SD- 809-C-17, as they will have been off IMPfor several months at the time of enrollment into the current stud y . Site-administered scales include the YGTSS, , Mini I nternational Neurops ychiatric Interview f or Children and Adolescents ( MINI Kid, version 6.0 ), and the C -SSRS and self-administered scales include the TS -PGII, , CDI - 2,and C&A - GTS -QOL . For the YGTSS ,input from the caregiver/adult is required. For the TS- PGII , input from the caregiver/adult is permitted. For all other scales , children 13 y ears of age and under , interviews may be performed separatel y or jointly with the caregiver/adult as appropriate or as defined by the scale . For children over 13 y ears of age, caregiver/adult"

Questions sho uld be directed to the child, but the caregiver/adult should be encouraged to add relevant information. The assessments and procedures performed during each stud y visit are detailed in Table 1and Section 3.13. Up to approximately 227 patients are planned to be enrolled ( approximately 1patient is estimated to enroll from the Phase 1b Study SD -809-C-17,up to approximately 99 patients are estimated to enroll from the Phase 2/3 Study TV50717 -CNS -30046, and up to approximately 127patients are estimated to enroll from the Phase 3 Study TV50717 -CNS -30060). When approximately 100 patients have completed the 28 -week clinic visit, an interim anal ysis, including data from day 1 and up to week 28 visit only ,will be conducted to provide descriptive, long-term safet y and efficacy data to be used in regulatory submissions. To maintain data integrit y of Stud yTV50717 -CNS -30047, only a limited number of perso nnel who do not have contact with the sites will have access to this interim data in preparation for the regulatory filing. As no decisions regarding conduct of the stud y will be made based on the descriptive interim analysis, no alpha will be spent. Patients who complete all scheduled visits will have procedures and assessments performed at the final visit (week 54). Patients who withdraw from the study before completing the week 54 evaluation period will have the week 54 procedures and assessments perfor med at their final visit, and a follow -up telephone contact for safety evaluation 2 weeks after their last dose of IMP.

Patients may be rescreened 1 time if there is a change in the patient’s medical background, a modification of study entry criteria, or other relevant change. (Note: Details of a patient ’s rescreen ing must be approved and documented by the medical monitor and/or Clinical Surveillance and Training [CST]team .) For patients from Study TV50717- CNS -30046 or Study TV50717- CNS -30060 : The screening evaluation for this open label stud y occurs at the end of the treatment period in the double -blind study .

Part A: 3.1.2. Day 1 Visit (All Patients) For patients rolling over from Study TV50717- CNS -30046 or Study TV50717 -CNS -30060, the week 13 visit ( Study TV50717 -CNS -30046) or the week 9 visit (Study TV50717 -CNS -30060) will be the day 1visit for Study TV50717- CNS -30047. Patients rolling over from Study SD-809-C-17 will need to undergo all day1assessments. D ay1assessments for StudyTV50717- CNS -30047 that are identical to Study TV50717- CNS -30046 week 13 or Study TV50717- CNS -30060 week 9 assessments do not need to be repeated. Additionally , Study TV50717- CNS -30047 required evaluations will be completed at Study TV50717 - CNS -30046 week 13 visit or Study TV50717- CNS -30060 week 9 visit (seeTable 1). Forall patients, the day1 visit will occur on or as close as possible to the week 13 or week 9 visit from Study TV50717- CNS -30046 and Study TV50717- CNS -30060, respectively, but not >7 days beyond those respective visits. For patients with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at week 12 in Study TV50717 - CNS -30046 or at week 8 in Study TV50717 -CNS -30060, Study TV50717- CNS -30046 week 13 value (s)or Study TV50717 -CNS -30060 week 9 value(s) will serve as day 1laboratory values in this study . Rollover for such patients must be approved and documented by the medical monitor and may be delay ed. 3.1.3. Titration Period (7 Weeks) As patients from Study SD-809-C-17 will have been off IMP for several months at the time of enrollment, and since patients from Study TV50717 -CNS -30046 or Study TV50717- CNS -30060 will have discontinued IMP (TEV-50717 or placebo) for at least 1 week at completion of the parent stud y, all patients will undergo TEV -50717 dose titration in this study . Patients will receive 6 mg of TEV -50717 with food on the evening of day 1. Tablets should be taken with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty stomach. The titration scheme and maximum dose will be determined b y bod y weight and CYP2D6 impairment status from the parent stud y. Patients will be classified as CYP2D6 impaired if they are receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or are a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer based on blinded assessment of CYP2D6 genot ype at baseline of the parent stud y. Patients who are CYP2D6 impaired will have a dos e cap in the open -label study , as shown in Table 2. Patients and their caregiver/adult will interact weekl y with the clinical research staff, either b y telephone contact or in-clinic visits from week 1"
51,page_51,"Uncontrolled Study –Toure tte Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protoc olwith Amendment 04 Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 51through week 7 of the titration period, in order to evaluate safet y and establish a dose of TEV -50717 that optimally reduces tics and is well tolerated (optimal dose). Safety evaluations during the titratio n period include assessment of vital signs, monitoring for adverse events and concomitant medications, 12 -lead ECGs, and rating scales for depression and suicidality . In-person (in- clinic) study visits will be scheduled at weeks 2, 4, and 6, and telephone contacts will be scheduled for weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 in order to assess adverse events and tic severit y. The dose of the IMP should be increased on a weekly basis until one of the following occurs: The investigator determines that there has been a clinical ly meaningful reduction in tics. The patient experiences a protocol- defined “clinically significant” adverse event (defined as an adverse event that is related to IMP and is either moderate or severe in intensity or meets the criteria for a serious adverse event) . The maximum allowable dose is reached, based on the patient’s weight and use of strong CYP2D6 impairment status. If a stable dose is reached before the week 7 telephone call, the patient should continue on that dose (ie, the dose should not be increased further) for the remainder of the titration period. If a patient experiences depression, suicidal ideation or behavior, anxiety , akathisia, parkinsonism, somnolence, an y other adverse event that interferes with daily activit y, or adverse event that is related to IMP , the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . If the determination is made during a telephone contact that a patient requires a dose reduction or suspension, an unscheduled in-clinic visit should be conducted as soon as practicable thereafter. Dose adjustments should be made based on all available information, including the patient and caregiver/adult reports of adverse event s and tic reduction, the clinical assessment of safet y and efficacy by the invest igator, and the information from rating scales. 3.1.4. Maintenance Period At the end of the titration period, t he patient’s initial dose for the maintenance period will be established. Dose adjustments of TEV- 50717 (upward or downward) may be made during the maintenance period, if necessary , but not more often than every 5 day s and only in increments of 6mg. As during titration, dose adjustments should be made based on all available information . After dose adjustment, if the maintenance dose for a patient is 6mg, the dose should be taken once a day in the morning with food (other dose levels are taken twice daily ). During the maintenance period, in -person (in- clinic) study visits will be scheduled at weeks 8, 15, 34, 41, and 54 for assessments of safet y and e fficacy and telephone contacts will be scheduled for weeks 21 and 47 in order to assess adverse events and tic severity . The randomized drug withdrawal and re-titration period (Part B) will occur from the end of week 28 through the end of week 33 , and then the Part A maintenance period will resume , along with the ability to make dose adjustments as described above . At week 54, patients will undergo a complete evaluation, including ph ysical and neurological examination, safet y laboratory testing, 12 -lead ECG , CDI -2, and C -SSRS assessments, as well as the YGTSS, TS -CGI, TS -PGII , , and C&A- GTS -QOL ."

Washout Period and Follow -up All patients will discontinue IMP at the week 54 visit and will return 1 week later (week 55) for evaluation of safet y and tic reduction. Patients will have a follow -up telephone contact for safet y evaluation 1 week after the end of the washout period (2 weeks after their last dose of IMP) (week 56). See Table 1for study procedures and assessments . See Figure 1and Figure 2for study schema. Part B: 3.1.6. Blinded, Randomized Drug Withdrawal Period and Titration Post- Drug Withdrawal Period (5 Weeks) At the week 28 visit, the patients will be randomized 2:1 totheircurrent dose of TEV -50717 or placebo in order to check for return of s ymptoms. Because IMP is dispensed as enough doses for 2weeks (curr ent dose level and next dose level), the week 28 visit (Day 196) is considered the first day of the randomized withdrawal period, although the patient will begin taking blinded IMP on Day 197. Patients will have a follow -up telephone contact for safety evaluation 1 week after the start of the randomized drug withdrawal period. At week 30, safety and efficacy will be assessed . At the week 30 visit, patients who receive TEV -50717 during the randomized drug withdrawal period will continue at the same dose in a blinded manner from the start of week 31 to the start of week 34. Any patient who was randomized to placebo during this 2- week period will undergo blinded re-titration . Patients will have a follow -up telephone contact for safet y evaluation at weeks 31 and 33. Titration Post -Drug Withdrawal (Weeks 31, 32, and 33) Any patient who was randomized to placebo between the week 28 and week 30 visits will undergo re -titration to their previousl y established maintenance dose over the 3 weeks of treatment following the randomized drug withdrawal period (start of week 31 to thestart of week 34[Day s211 through 232] ).The titration scheme and maximum dose will be determined based on the previously established maintenance dose according to Table 3. The dose of IMP for each patient who underwent 2 weeks of place bo will be titrated back to the maintenance dose that was used by the patient up to week 28followed by continued maintenance therapy at that dose. All patients should be back at their maintenance dose on or before the start of week 34 and return to open- label treatment for the remainder of the study (note that, because IMP is dispe nsed for 2-week periods, patients will use blinded bottles through the end of week 34; however, all patients will be known to be on active treatment at the start of week 34). 3.2. Justification for Study Design and Placebo -Controlled Randomized Drug Withdrawal At the present time, effective treatment options for TS are suboptimal and limited. As a chronic condition impairing major life activities during childhood, such as occupational, social, and educational activities, TS presents an area of significant unmet medical need in the pediatric population."

Results of Study SD-809-C-17 support further developmen t of TEV -50717 as a treatment of TS. Two parent studies, TV50717 -CNS -30046 and TV50717- CNS -30060, are underway . They are randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled studies of the efficacy and safet y of TEV-50717 on the tics in patients with TS.

If the pat ient does not wish to enroll in Study TV50717- CNS -30047 at that visit, they can enroll up to 1 week following the week 13 or week 9 visits, respectively .The end of study is defined as the date of the week 56 visit of the last participant. Inclusion and ex clusion criteria have been designed to minimize the risk to patients while maintaining a consistent level of TS sy mptoms to allow detection and analysis of a drug effect. Exclusion criteria were designed to exclude patients with concomitant conditions that may increase their risk to drug treatment. The open- label study design (ie, no placebo or comparator) was selected to allow further evaluation and review long -term safety of TEV -50717 in this patient population. Patients will receive t wice daily dosing for up to 54 weeks (those on the 6- mg dose will receive once -daily dosing) , with a n initial 7-week titration period to allow for optimal dose selection. At the week28visit, patient swill begin a 2- week blinded, randomized drug withdrawal period. The randomized drug withdrawal period will rigorously assess the long- term maintenance of effect. Patient swill be randomized to the ircurrent dose of TEV-50717 or placebo for 2 weeks. After completing the 2 weeks, patient s will continue theirsame dose of TEV -50717 in a blinded manner or will be re -titrated (patients receiving placebo onl y) in a blinded manner for 3 weeks. At week 34, all patient swill resume their maintenance dose. This is a classic ABA stud y design (ie, drug, placebo, drug) that allows for a more rigorous test of the intervention. In the traditional AB design, changes in s ymptoms (particularl y in a long trial) could be attributed to other factors (eg, life changes, societal issues, and regression to the mean); however, an ac ute change demonstrated onl y in a placebo group among subjects that have been maintained for several months would reduce the likelihood of any other explanations for changes in sy mptoms. 3.3.

Exploratory Measures and Time Points Part A and Part B:        3.5. Randomization and Blinding This is an open -label study that includes a 2-week, double -blind, placebo -controlled , randomized drug withdrawal period followed by a 3-week blinded re -titration period . At the start of the randomized drug withdrawal period ( end of week 28), the patients will be randomized 2:1 to the"
56,page_56,"Uncontrolled Study –Toure tte Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protoc olwith Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 56current dose or placebo in order to check for return of sy mptoms. During the entire 5 -week period, patients randomized to TEV -50717 will stay on their established maintenance dose of blinded active IMP . Patients who receive placebo during the randomized drug withdrawal period will undergo blinded re-titration post-drug withdraw al. All patients will return to open -label dosing at w eek 34 (note that, because IMP is dispensed for 2 -week periods, patients will use blinded bottles through the end of week 34; however, all patients will be known to be on active treatment at the start of week 34) . During the blinded drug withdrawal and re-titration period, patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment. In addition, the sponsor’s and development partner’s clinical personnel and all vendors (with the exception of the Interactive Response Technology [IRT] vendor and the IMP packaging vendor ) involved in the study will be blinded to the I MP identity until the database has been locked for anal ysis and the treatment assignments are revealed. Patients will be centrally randomly assigned to the treatment groups by means of a computer -generated randomization list. The creation of the randomization list will be under the responsibility and oversight of Syneos Health. The randomized treatment and medication allocation will b e assigned to the relevant treatment groups through a qualified service provider (ie, via I RT). The management of the I RT sy stem will be done by a qualified service provider under the oversight of Nuvelution TS Pharma, Inc. (referred to hereafter as Nuvelu tion TS Pharma). The staff member at the investigational center who will dispense the I MP will not know the treatment given to each patient during the blinded drug withdrawal and re-titration period. 3.6. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding 3.6.1. Maintenance of Randomization Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a secure location within Sy neos Health. At the time of anal ysis, when treatment codes are needed, the Sy neos Health statistician assigned to the study will make a request to unblind and will receive the unblinded codes and unblinded I MP assignment according to the processes defined in the relevant Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). 3.6.2. Blinding and Unblinding In case of a serious adverse event, pregnancy , or in cases when knowledge of the IMP assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may unblind the patient’s IMP assignment as deemed necessary , mainl y in emergency situations. The patient’s randomized treatment will be made available to the investigator(s) via the IRT s ystem. If possible, the medical monitor should be notified of the event before breaking of the code. If this is not possible, the medical monitor should be notified immediately afterward, and the patient’s randomized treatment should not be communicated to the medical monitor . Breaking of the randomization code can alway s be performed by the investigational center without prior approval by the medical monitor . When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the stud y, and the event will be recorded on the case report form ( CRF ). However, if a patient is unblinded by mistake, the"
57,page_57,"Uncontrolled Study –Toure tte Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protoc olwith Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 57investigator should discuss with the medical monitor whether or not the patient should be withdrawn. The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully docu mented in the investigator’s study files and in the patient’s source documentation. Assignment of IMP should not be recorded in any study documents or source document. In studies with blinding , for an adverse event defined as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section 7.1.4 ), Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance may independentl y request tha t the blind code be broken (on a case -by-case basis) to comply with regulatory requirements. The report will be provided in an unblinded manner for regulatory submission. I f this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the investigator and for other person nel involved in the conduct of the study and anal ysis and reporting of the data. 3.7. Independent Data Monitoring Committee An IDMC will review accumulating safet y data on a regular basis to ensure the continuing safet y of the study patients and to review any study conduct issues. The IDMC will be composed of independent physicians with expertise in the relevant therapeutic field and other relevant experts, such as a statistician. The IDMC will receive safet y data periodicall y, which will be presented b y masked treatment groups. The y will have the right to recommend modification of the study for safet y reasons. IDMC sessions can be open or closed. During open sessions, representatives of the sponsor and development partner may be present, and information is provided and discussed in a blinded manner . During closed sessions, the only participants are members of the IDMC and the designated unblinded statistician (if approved to be present). If there is a request to unblind an y individual treatment assignment, a written request from the IDMC (as a committee), signed b y the IDMC chairperson, should be made to the unblinded statistician. The appropriate medical and operational personnel will be notified but will not receive the unblinded treatment information. Any use of unblinded treatment assignments should be clearly documented and reported to the sponsor at study termination. The IDMC chairperson will communicate with Nuvelution TS Pharma in regard to issues resulting from the conduct and clinical aspects of the study . Nuvelution TS Pharma and Syneos Health will work closel y with the committee to provide the necessary data for review. The conduct and specific details regarding the IDMC sessions and requests to unblind any blind ed treatment assignment are outlined in the IDMC charter. 3.8. Investigational Medicinal Product and Placebo Used in the Study The IMP is a matrix formulation and is designed as a gastro -erosional tablet to be administered with food and should not be taken on a n empty stomach. The IMP is coated with a white polymer coating to aid in swallowing. TEV -50717 tablets have been manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. During the open- labelperiod, TEV -50717 tablets are available in t he following dose strengths: 6, 9, and 12 mg. Each dose strength will have a marking of SD 6, SD 9, and SD 12 corresponding"
58,page_58,"Uncontrolled Study –Toure tte Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protoc olwith Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 58to the dose strength and a distinct color: 6 mg –purple, 9 mg –blue, and 12 mg –beige. The IMP will be supplied in 20 -or 60 -coun t tablets per dose strength per bottle. Each bottle will contain a sufficient supply of drug until the next specified visit/telephone contact, plus overage to account for potential delay s in study visits. A more detailed description of administration procedures is given in Section 5.1. During the randomized drug withdrawal and re-titration periods, TEV -50717 tablets are available in the following dose strengths: 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 mg, all of which are identical in size, shape, and color (white). The IMP will be supplied in 20 -count bottles. Patients who receive TEV -50717 during the randomized drug withdrawal period will remain on their maintenan ce dose of blinded active IMP from the start of week 31 to the start of week 34 ; those assigned to placebo during the randomized drug withdrawal period will undergo blinded re-titration from the start of week 31 to the start of week 34 back to their previo usly established maintenance dose from the end of week 28. Note that, because IMP is dispensed for 2 -week periods, patients will use blinded bottles through the end of week 34; however, all patients will be known to be on active treatment at the start of w eek 34. 3.9. Drug Supply and Accountability 3.9.1. Drug Storage and Security The IMP (TEV -50717) should be stored protected from light, at a controlled room temperature, 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); however, storage between 15°C and 20°C (59°F to 68°F) is acceptable if there is no alternative. The IMP should be stored in a dry , securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet or enclosure, with access limited to authorized staff. 3.9.2. Drug Accountability Each IMP shipment to the site will include a pack ing slip listing the contents of the shipment, drug return instructions, and an y applicable forms. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMP and other study materials from the sponsor are correctl y received, recorded, handled, and stored safel y and properl y in accordance with the local regulations, and used in accordance with this protocol. A record of IMP accountability (ie, IMP and other materials received, used, retained, returned, or destroy ed) must be prepared and signed by the principal investigator or designee, with an account given for an y discrepancies. Empty, partially used, and unused IMP will be disposed of, as agreed with the sponsor /development partner . 3.10. Duration of Patient Participation and Justification For patients rolling over from Study SD-809-C-17 , this study will consist of a 4 -week screening period (up to 31 day s) and up to 54week s oftreatment. All participating p atients are expected to participate in this study for its entire duration, which is a minimum of 56weeks (for those rolling over from Stud y SD -809-C- 17, this can be up to 60 weeks) . Patients will have a follow -up telephone contact to evaluate safety 1 week after the end of the washout period (2 weeks after their last dose of IMP)."

Stopping Rules and Discontinuation Criteria There are no formal rules for early termination of this study . During the conduct of the study , serious adverse events will be reviewed (see Section 7.1.5 ) as they are reported from the investigational center to identify safet y concerns. The study may be terminated by the sponsor at any time. A patient may discontinue participation in the study at an y time for an y reason (eg, lack of efficacy , consent withdrawn, and adverse event) ; every effort should be undertaken to find out the reason for discontinuation. The investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a patient from the study at an y time for an y reason (eg, protocol violation or deviation as defined in Section 11.1.2, noncompliance, or adverse event). 3.12. Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or equivalent, before they are transcribed onto the CRF. Data may not be recorded directl y onto the CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specify ing which data are permitted to be recorded directly onto the CRF, such as eScales. If patient data are processed from other vendors (eg, clinical laboratory , central ECG, diary data), the results will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not entere d into the CRF. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management) for direct use with the clinical database (see Section 13.1). All clinical patient data from other vendors will be available to the investigator. The CRFs are filed in the sponsor’s central file after study completion. 3.13. Study Procedures and Assessment s Study procedures and assessments with their time points are presented in Table 1. During a visit, study procedures and assessments should be performed in the order specified in the study manual. Detailed b y-visit information is provided in the sections following the table. Detailed descriptions of each assessment are provided in Section 6(efficacy assessments) and Section 7 (safet y assessments) ."

Forpatients who complete the study or withdraw prematurel y, final evaluations will be performed at an end -of-treatment visit or on the last day the patient receives the IMP, or as soon as possible thereafter . Procedures for patients who withdraw prematurel y from the study are described in Section 4.4. Patients should be treated with standard of care after termination of the study as appropriate . Patients with ongoing adverse events will be mon itored as described in Section 7.1.2 .Otherwise, the follow- up visit will be the last study visit. 3.13.5. Unscheduled Visits An unscheduled telephone contact may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. An in-clinic unscheduled visit should be performed if a patient requires a dose adjustment for adverse events reported during a telephone contact. An unscheduled visit may be performed at any time during the study at the patient ’s request and as deemed necessary by the investi gator. The date and reason for the unscheduled visit will be recorded on the CRF as well as an y other data obtained (eg, adverse events, concomitant medications and treatments, and results from procedures or tests). The following procedures/assessments wil l beperformed at all in-clinic unscheduled visits: conduct clinic visit evaluate and, if required, adjust IMPdose (see Section 5.1) measure vital signs (pulse, BP, bod y temperature, and respiratory rate) measure weight (Note: weight must be measured with shoes and outerwear off) inquire about adverse event s review concomitant medications The following procedures/assessments may beperformed at unscheduled visits per the investigator’s discretion: measure height perform ph ysical examination perform neurological examination perform 12 -lead ECG (Note: ECG will be performe d after at least 5 minutes rest in a supine or semi -supine position.)"

If a patient is unblinded by mistake, the investigator should discuss with the medical monitor whether or not the patient should be withdrawn. h. if the investigator or the sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn from the study (Section 5.4). In addition, a patient may be withdrawn from the study as described in Sections 3.11,3.6, 5.4,7.1.7 , and 3.13. Should a patient decide to withdraw after administration of IMP, or should the investigator decide to withdraw the patient, all efforts will be made to complete and report all observations up to the time of withdrawal. A complete final evaluation of the pa tient’s withdrawal should be made as soon as possible after the last dose of IMP, and an explanation should be given as to why the patient is withdrawing or being withdrawn from the study . Assessments to be conducted at the earl y termination visit are desc ribed in Section 3.13.3.2.1 . The reason for and date of withdrawal from the study must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the C RF. If a patient withdraws consent, every attempt will be made to determine the reason. If the reason for withdrawal is an adverse event or a potentiall y clinically significant abnormal laboratory test result, monitoring will be continued at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made). The specific event or test result must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. All patients who discontinue earl y will have a follow -up telephone contact for safety evaluation 2weeks after their last dose of IMP ( Section 3.13.4.2 )."

Investigational Medicinal Products Administered During the Study During the open- label period, TEV -50717 tablets are available in the following dose strengths: 6, 9, and 12 mg. Patients will receive twice dail y dosing for up to 54 weeks (those on the 6- mg dose will receive once -daily dosing) , with an initial 7 -week titr ation period to allow for optimal dose selection. During the randomized drug withdrawal and re-titration period, TEV -50717 tablets are available in the following dose strengths: 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 mg, all of which are identical in size, shape, and color (white). The IMP will be supplied in 20- count bottles. The placebo tablets and packaging will match those for TEV -50717. Patients who receive TEV -50717 during the randomized drug withdrawal period will remain on their maintenance dose of blinded active I MP from the start of week 31 to the start of week 34 ; those assigned to placebo during the randomized drug withdrawal period will undergo blinded re-titration from the start of week 31 to the start of week 34 back to their previously established maintenanc e dose from the end of week 28. Note that, because IMP is dispensed for 2 -week periods, patients will use blinded bottles through the end of week 34; however, all patients will be known to be on active treatment at the start of week 34. 5.1.1. Drug Administration IMP (see Section 3.9) will be administered as oral tablets at a starting dose of 6 mg once dail y. Titration schemes based on body weight on day1are shown in Table 2. The maximum daily dose is determined b y body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status on day1(seeTable 2). Although dose adjustments can be made up to and including the week 7 telephone call, if a stable dose is reached before then, the patient should continue taking that dose for the remainder of the titration period. If a patient experiences depression, suicidal ideation or behavior, anxiety , akathisia, parkinsonism, somnolence, an y other adverse event that interferes with daily activit y, or adverse event that is related to IMP , the investigato r will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . At the end of the titration period, the patient’s dose will be established for the maintenance period. If a patient experiences an adverse event during the maintenance period and the investig ator believes a dose reduction is warranted, the dose may be reduced. Dose adjustments of TEV -50717 (upward or downward) may be made during the maintenance period, if necessary, but not more often than every 5days and onl y in increments of 6 mg. IMP will be dispensed in the clinic. Patients should take their first dose in the evening on day 1 after their day 1 clinic visit. Patients will receive sufficient doses to last until the next visit. IMP will be administered as follows: IMP should be swallowed whole and taken with food. Tablets should be taken with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty stomach. Dosing will be based on body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status, as shown in Table 2."
83,page_83,"Uncontrolled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 83The total daily dose, as provided in Table 2, is divided into a twice dail y administration. The starting dose is 6 mg in all patients. D aily doses will be administered twice daily , approximately 8 to 10 hours apart during the day (those on the 6- mg dose will have once -daily dosing). A minimum of 6 hours should elapse between doses. If a patient misses a dose and it is within 6 hours of their next dose, themissed dose should be skipped. After week 1, dose increases may not occur more fre quentl y than once every 5 day s. Dose reductions, if required, should be in increments of 6 mg. If more than 1 dose reduction is required for an adverse event, the medical monitor should be notified . After dose adjustment, if the maintenance dose for a patient is 6 mg, the dose should be taken once a day in the morning with food. During the titration period, the dose of the IMP should be adjusted according to Table 2to identify a dose level that optimally reduce s tics ( as determined by the investigator, in consultation with the patient and caregiver/adult ) and is well tolerated. A dose cap for impaired patients isprespecified by the IRT and presented in Table 2. After week 24, patient dose should be kept stable, if possible, until beginning Part B. During the randomized drug w ithdrawal period, the patient will continue to receive theircurrent dose of TEV- 50717 or receive matching placebo until returning to the ir dose of TEV -50717 at the start of week 31 (patients who receive TEV -50717 during the randomized drug withdrawal peri od will remain on their maintenance dose of blinded active IMP from the start of week 31 to the start of week 34; those assigned to placebo during the randomized drug withdrawal period will undergo blinded re-titration from the start of week 31 to the start of week 34 back to their previously established maintenance dose from the end of week 28 ).During the re -titration period, the dose of the IMP should be adjusted according to Table 3. Following re-titration , the dose of IMP should be kept stable ,if possible, but changes can be made as described for Part A. IMP will be packaged in bottles and provided for patients to take at home (see Section 3.8).

Restrictions Medications prohibited before or during the study are described in Section 5.3. While patients receiving strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, and bupropion on day 1may be enrolled into this study , the removal of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors during treatment is discouraged as this would have an effect on exposure to active circulating drug. If the removal of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor is required from a clinical perspecti ve, the medical monitor should be contacted so an appropriate change in IMP can be made. The use of quinidine and terbinafine are prohibited (see Appendix A, Table 9). Restrictions in regard to sexual activity and required laboratory values are provided in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. As with other VMAT2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, reserpine), pa tients should be advised that the concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs with TEV -50717 may have additive effects and cause or worsen somnolence. Given the age of the study population, the use of alcohol during this study is prohibited. Patien ts should be advised not to drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until they understand how TEV -50717 affects them. Use of illicit drugs is prohibited from the time of signing of the informed consent /assent form and throughout study participation. Patients may not donate blood from the time of informed consent/assent , while taking the IMP, and for 14 day s after the last dose. 5.3. Prior and Concomitant Medication or Treatment Any prior or concomitant therapy , medication, or procedure a patient receives duri ng IMP administration and up to the end of the stud y period, including follow -up, will be recorded on the CRF. Generic or trade name, indication, and dosage will be recorded. In addition, only for patients who completed Study SD-809-C- 17, an y prior or conc omitant therapy , medication, or procedure a patient has had within 3 months before IMP administration will be recorded on the CRF. The sponsor will encode all therap y and medication according to the World Health Organization drug dictionary . At each clinic visit after the screening visit, the investigator will ask patients whether they have taken an y medications (other than IMP), including over -the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, since the previous visit. Parents/patient s will be instructed during the course of the study to notify the investigator if any new medication is prescribed /administered , including over -the-counter medications. An y prescribed/administered medication should be reviewed with the investigator. Indication, dosage, and start and end dates should be entered on the CRF. Medications that are allowed, provided that conditions outlined in the table are met, are shown in Appendix A, Table 6. The medical monitor must be contacted if a patient is receiving (or has to begin or stop receiving during the stud y) a medication that is associated with QTc prolongation or that is a known strong CYP inhibitor. Addition of a strong CYP inhibitor is prohibited."

Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance. A check of IMP compliance will be performed during each visit after the initial dispensation of IMP, and IMP accountability records will be completed. If the investigator or the sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the inv estigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn. The IEC/I RB should be notified as required by national and local regulations . 5.5. Dose Reduction and Temporary Investigational Medicinal Product Discontinuation Dose Reduction If a patient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event that is attributed to IMP, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . Dose adjustments should be made based on all available information, including the p atient and caregiver/adult reports of adverse events and tic reduction, the clinical assessment of safet y and efficacy by the investigator, and information from rating scales. If more than 1 dose reduction is required for an adverse event, the medical monitor must be notified .After dose adjustment, if the maintenance dose for a patient is 6 mg, the dose should be taken once a day in the morning with food (other dose levels are taken twice dail y). If the determination that a patient requires a dose reduction or suspension is made during a telephone contact, an unscheduled clinic visit should be conducted as soon as practicable thereafter. Dose Suspension Suspension of study medication for up to 1 week, if warranted for patient safety , is allowed. If the patient restarts stud y medication within 7 day s of suspension, the full dose of TEV-50717 may be resumed without titration. Suspensions of study medication for adverse events must be reviewed with the m edical monitor before therapy is restarted . If a s ubject’s serum potassium or magnesium were tested and found to be below the lower limit of normal and clinically significantl y, the laboratory test should be repeated at least once. If the abnormality in the repeated laboratory test is consistent with the prior laboratory test, the IMP must be suspended. The medical monitor must be contacted to determine the appropriate investigation and treatment. TEV -50717 may only be restarted once serum potassium or magnesium have normalized. The reason for a dose reduction or suspension must be clearly documented. If a dose reduction or suspension occurs before a scheduled clinic visit, the clinic visit will be postponed so that efficacy evaluations can be performed at least 5 days after the change . The patients who restart IMP treatment will follow the visit schedule as outlined in Table 1. Patients who withdraw from the study will proceed as descr ibed in Section 4.4."

The C&A -GTS -QOL is a 27 -item questionnaire specific to TS patients that asks the patient to assess the extent to which their qua lity of life is impacted by their s ymptoms. The C&A - GTS -QOL contains 4 subscales (ps ychological, phy sical, obsessional, and cognitive) and uses a 5-point L ikert scale ranging from no problem to extreme problem. Patients will also be asked how satisfied the y feel overall with their life at that moment by using a VAS scale between 0 and 100 ( Su et al 2017). A reference sample is provided in Appendix K. 6.1.6."

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY In this stud y, safety will be assessed b y qualified study personnel by evaluating reported adverse events ,clinical laboratory test results, vital si gns measurements, ECG findings, ph ysical examination findings (including bod y weight and height measurements), use of concomitant medication , neurological examination, C -SSRS, and CDI -2. 7.1. Adverse Events 7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event Any untoward medical oc currence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorable and unintended ph ysicalsign, s ymptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severit y during the course of thisstudy , or significant worsening of the disease under study , or of any concurrent disease, whether or not considered related to the IMP, TEV -50717. A new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that are present before stud y entry and do not worsen during this study will not be considered adverse events . Accordi ngly, an adverse event can include an y of the following: intercurrent illnesses physical injuries events possibly related to concomitant medication significant worsening (change in nature, severit y, or frequency) of the disease under study or other pre- existing conditions drug interactions events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during an y washout phase of this study laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient from the study , are associated with clinical signs and sy mptoms or a serious adverse event, or require medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, or are considered by the investigator to be clinically signif icant (Note: Abnormal laboratory test results at the screening visit that preclude a pa tient from entering the study or receiving IMP are not considered adverse events .) 7.1.2. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events For recording of adverse events, the study period is defined for each patient as that time period from signature of the informed consent /assent form to the end of the follow -up period. The follow -up period is defined as 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP."
92,page_92,"Uncontrolled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 92All adverse events that occur during the defined study period must be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF, regardless of the severit y of the event or judged relationship to the IMP. For serious adverse events, the serious adverse event f orm must be completed ,and the serious adverse event must be reported immediately (see Section 7.1.5.3.1 ).The investigator does not need to activel y monitor patient s for adverse events after the defined period. Serious adverse events occurring toa patient after the treatment of that patient has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Se ction 7.1.5.3.1 . At each contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must question the patient about adverse events b y asking an open- ended question such as “Have y ou had any unusual sy mptoms or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe ”. All reported or observed signs and sy mptoms will be recorded individually , except when considered manifestations of a medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded w henever possible . When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and an y test findings will be recorded collectively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the serious adverse e vent form. The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved , stabilized ,or returned to baseline ; oruntil the patient is referred for continued care to a health care professional ; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made. The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action taken regarding IMP, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be recorded both on the source documentati on and the CRF. The relationship of each adverse event to IMP and study procedures, and the severit y and seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by the investigator, must be recorded as described below. Further details are given in the Safety Monitor ing Plan. 7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event The severit y of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the following: Mild: No limitation of usual activities Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities"
93,page_93,"Uncontrolled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 937.1.4. Relation ship of an Adverse Event to the Investigational Medicinal Product The relationship of an adverse event to the IMP is characterized as follows: Term Definition Clarification No reasonable possibility (not related)This category applies to adverse events that, after careful consideration, are clearly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc) or to adverse events that, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to the IMP.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply: It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the IMP. It could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. It does not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP. It does not reappear or w orsen when the IMP is re-administered . Reasonable possibility (related)This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the administration of IMP cannot be ruled out with certainty .The relationship of an a dverse event may be considered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following apply: It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP . It cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors , or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. There are important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear after discontinuation of th e IMP, yet an IMP relationship clearly exists. It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP. 7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events For recording of serious adverse event s, the study period is defined for each patient as the time period from sign ingof the informed consent /assent form to the end of the follow -up period as defined in Section 7.1.2 . Serious adverse events occurring in a patient af ter the end of the follow - up period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Section 7.1.5.3.1. 7.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any of the following outcomes or actions:"
94,page_94,"Uncontrolled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 94results in death is life threatening (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event); it does not refer to an event which hy potheticall y might have caus ed death if it were more severe requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, which means that hospital inpatient admission or prolongation of hospital stay were required for treatment of an adverse event, or that they occurred as a consequence of the event . Hospitalizations scheduled before the patient signed the informed consent form will not be considered serious adverse ev ents, unless there was worsening of the preexisting condition during the patient’s participation in this study . results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (refers to a substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) is a congenital anomal y/birth defect is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: An y suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event. All occurrences of possible drug -induced liver injury that meet Hy ’s law criteria, defined as all of the below, must be reported by the investigator to the sponsor as a serious adverse event: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase of >3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) total bilirubin increase of >2 ×ULN absence of initial findings of cholestasis (ie, no substan tialincrease ofALP ) An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be regarded as a nonserious adverse event. 7.1.5.2. Expectedness A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of t he relevant reference safet y information (RSI ) by its specificity, severit y, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpected adverse event. The RSI for this study is the IB. A serious adverse event that is not included in the Listing of Adverse Reactions in the RSI by its specificit y, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpected adverse event. The sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance will determine the expectedness for all serious adverse events."

Reporting a Serious Adverse Event 7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events that occur during the study , regardless of judged relationship to administration of the IMP, must be reported by the investigator according to the instructions provided on the serious adverse event form . The event must be reported within 24 hours of when the investigator learns about it.Completing the serious adverse event form and reporting the event must not be delay ed, even if not all the information is available. The investigator does not need to actively monitor patient s for adverse events once this study has ended. Serious adve rse events occurring to a patient after the last administration of I MP should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them . The serious adverse e vent form should be sent to the local safet y officer (LSO )or designee (a contract rese arch organization in a country without a s ponsor L SO)(contact information is in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact I nformation section) ; the LSO will forward the report to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance.

Additional information (follow -up) about an y serious adverse event unavailable at the initial reporting should be forwarded b y the investigator within 24 hours of when it becomes known to the same address as the initial report. Forall countries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Saf ety and Pharmacovigilance will distribute the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) form/Extensible Markup Language (XML) file to the L SO/Syneos Health for submission to the competent authorities, IEC/IRBs ,and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator must ensure that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations. Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event , but using the pregnancy form (see Section 7.3). 7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility If a serious unexpected ad verse event is believed to be related to the IMP or study procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in sponsored clinical studies of TEV -50717 and the appropriate competent authorities (and I EC/IRB, as appropriate) . In addition to notify ing the investigators and competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as appropriate) , other action smay be required, including: altering existing research by modify ing the protocol discontinuing or suspending the stud y modify ingthe existing consent form and informing all study participants of new findings modify ing listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newl y identified as related to TEV -50717 7.1.6.

Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from the study or from IMP at any time at the discretion of the investigator. If a post- day1 QTcF value >500 msec or change from baseline (Study TV50717- CNS -30046 or Study TV50717 -CNS -30060) or day 1 (Study SD-809-C-17), as appropriate (see Section 9.7.2 ) >60 msec is found, the investigator should repeat the ECG assessment twice a nd compare the average of the 2 pre-treatment QTcF values (ie, the parent study baseline and screening values for patients rolling over from Study TV50717- CNS -30046 or Study TV50717 -CNS -30060 or the day 1 and screening values from the current study for patient[s] who completed Study SD-809-C-17) to the average of the 3 post -day1QTcF values. The IMP must be stopped f or an y confirmed post -day1 QTcF value >500 msec or increase from baseline (Study TV50717- CNS -30046 or Study TV50717- CNS 30060) or day 1 (Study SD-809-C- 17) >60 msec. If a patient is withdrawn wholl y or in part because of an adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time. The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care pro fessional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made). The investigator must inform the clinical project ph ysician ( CPP)/clinical leader as soon as possible of any patient swho are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse event (s). Additional reports must be provided when requested. If a patient is withdrawn from the study for multiple reasons that include adverse events, the termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an ad verse event . An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that ,in the opinion of the investigator ,is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but that requires the use of a prohibited medication, thereb y requiring discontinuation of the patient . In such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be need to take a prohibited medication, not the adverse event. 7.1.8. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency , deviation s from the protocol may be allowed on a case -by-case basis . To ensure patient safety , afterthe event has stabilized or treatment has been administered (or both) , the investigator or other phy sician in attendance must contact the physician identif ied in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section of this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study . 7.2. Psychometric Rating Scale s Site-administered safet y scales include the M INI Kid and C -SSRS ,and self -administered safet y scales include the CDI -2. 7.2.1. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents , (version 6.0) Select MINI Kid modules are administered at screening (onl y for patients who completed Study SD-809-C-17). Children 13 years of age and under may be interviewed separatel y or jointly with the caregiver/adult as appropriate or defined by the scale. For children over 13 years"

Questions should be directed to the child, but the caregiver/adult should be encouraged to add relevant information. The MINI Kid is a short questionnaire to be administered b y a trained clinic ian. The MINI Kid assesses s ymptoms of psy chiatric disorders as outlined in the I nternational Classification of Diseases -10 and the DSM in children 6 to 17 y ears of age b y self-report. For children under 13years old, the patient may be interviewed separat ely or jointly with the caregiver/adult as appropriate or defined b y the scale , and the caregiver/adult is encouraged to participate when needed. The MINI Kid (version 6.0) is composed of 24 modules overall, and questions are largel y yes-or-no questions. T he current study will focus on 8 modules: Major Depressive Episode (Module A), (Hypo) Manic Episode (Module D), OCD (Module J), Alcohol Dependence/Abuse (Module L), Substance Dependence/Abuse (Non -alcohol; Module M), ADHD (Module O), Conduct Disorder (Modu le P), and Psy chotic Disorders and Mood Disorders with Psy chotic Features (Module R). A reference sample is provided in Appendix C. 7.2.2. Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C -SSRS children’s baseline/ screening version assesses past and current suicidal ideation s and behaviors to determine suicide risk and is administer ed at screening. The C-SSRS children’s SLV scale is administered onday1 (onl y for patients who completed Study SD-809-C-17) and weeks 2, 4, 8, 15, 28, 30, 34, 41, 54, and 55. Children 13 y ears of age and under may be interviewed separately or jointly with the caregiver/adult as appropriate or defined by the scale . For children over 13 years of age, caregiver/adult involvement is strongl y encouraged. Questions should be directed to the child, but the caregiver/adult should be encouraged to add relevant information. The C -SSRS is administered through an interview b y trained study personnel. Suicidal ideation Patients with a positive C -SSRS suicidal ideation score on either items 1 or 2 or a change on the CDI -2 Parent or Self -Report Profiles consistent wit h increasing depressive symptoms must be 1) discussed with the medical monitor, 2) re -evaluated within 2 to 3 days in a clinic visit, and 3) treated according to the investigator’s medical judgment. Consultation with a child and adolescent psy chiatrist or licensed child/adolescent mental health provider is advised, followed b y close ongoing monitoring. If patients endorse or report a C- SSRS suicidal ideation level of 3, 4, or 5, patients will be evaluated immediatel y by the stud y investigator and referred f or ps ychiatric evaluation. The medical monitor will be immediately consulted. If it is determined by the investigator, after consultation with the medical monitor and the consulting psy chiatrist, that exposure to the I MP may have contributed to this change in C-SSRS and/or increased depressive s ymptoms, I MP will be immediatel y discontinued and the patient terminated from the study . In cases where it is determined that IMP did not contribute to changes in depression or suicidality , the investigator will consult with the medical monitor, the consulting psy chiatrist, and/or sponsor to determine whether the patient should continue in the study ."
99,page_99,"Uncontrolled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 99Suicidal behavior Actual attempt: If patients report an y suicidal behavior that is an actual attempt as assessed in th e C-SSRS, they will be evaluated immediately by the study investigator, referred for ps ychiatric evaluation, and terminated from the study . Interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, or Preparatory Acts or Behavior: If patients report an y suicidal behavior tha t is interrupted, aborted, or preparatory as assessed in the C -SSRS, they will be evaluated immediately by the study investigator and referred for psychiatric evaluation. I n cases where it is determined in the ps ychiatric evaluation that I MP did not contri bute to changes in suicidal behavior, the investigator will consult with the medical monitor, the consulting ps ychiatrist, and/or sponsor to determine whether the patient should continue in the study . A reference sample is provided in Appendix E. 7.2.3. Children’s Depression Inventory , Second Edition , Parent and Self -Report Profiles CDI-2 (Parent and Self- Report Profiles) is administered at screening andday1(only for patients who completed Study SD-809-C-17 )and weeks 2, 4, 8, 15, 28, 30, 34, 41, 54, and 55 .As the CDI-2 is designed for children 7 to 17 y ears of age , children 6 years of age onday1will not complete the Self-Report version; the caregiver/adult will complete the Parent version. The CDI -2 Self-Report is a 28- item,self-report questionnaire assessing depressive s ymptoms in children 7 to 17 y ears of age with basic reading and comprehension skills. In the CDI -2, children are asked to choose 1 of 3 statements that most closely aligns with their feelings in the previous 2weeks. The questionnaire covers both the major and minor sy mptoms of depression as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Text Revision ( Sun and Wang 2015 ). The CDI -2 Parent is a 17 -item questionnaire administered to parents to assess depression- related behaviors observed in their children. In the CDI-2 Parent, parents are asked to rate their child’s behaviors in the past 2 weeks on a 4 -point Likert scale from “not at all” to “much or most of the time”. The questionnaire allows for the division of depressive s ymptoms into functional problems and emotional problems ( Sun and Wang 2015 ). A reference sample is provided in Appendix D. 7.3. Pregnancy Any female patient becoming pregnant during the study will discontinue IMP. All pregnancies of female patients participating in the study that occur during the study , or within 14days after the end of the study , are to be reported immediatel y to the physician identified in the Clinical Study Personnel C ontact Information section of this protocol, and the investigator must provide the sponsor ( LSO/Syneos Health) with the completed pregnancy form ."
100,page_100,"Uncontrolled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study TV50717- CNS -30047 100The process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form (see Section 7.1.5.3 ). The investigator is not required to report patients who are found to be pregnant between screening and day 1, provided no IMP was given. All female patients who become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous , elective ,or voluntary abortion). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor . Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after withdrawal from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate. If the pregnancy in the female patient participating in the study does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: Fora spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event. Foran elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse event . Foran elective abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy form ; do not report as an adverse event. 7.4. Medication Error and Special Situation sRelated to the Investigational Medicinal Product Any administration of IMP that is not in accordance with the study protocol should be reported on the CRF either as a violation, if it meets the violation criteria specified in the protocol (Section 11.1.2) , or as a deviation, in the patients source documents, regardless of whether or not an adverse event occurs as a result . All instances of incorrect medication administration should be categorized on the CRF as “Non-Compliance with IMP”. The following are t ypes of medication errors and special situations: 2.Medicatio n error: Any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, patient ,or consumer. 3.Overdose :Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommende d dose according to the authoriz ed product information. Clinical judgment should always be applied. Any dose of IMP (whe ther the test IMP or placebo) , whether taken intentionally or unintentionally , in excess of that prescribed must be immediately reported to the sponsor. 4.Misuse :Situations where the IMP is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the author ized product information. 5.Abuse :Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of IMP which is accompanied by harmful ph ysical or ps ychological effects."

Clinical Laboratory Tests All clinical laboratory test results outside of the reference range will be judged by the investigator as belonging to one of the following categories: abnormal and not clinically signif icant abnormal and clinically signif icant The clinical significance of the lab oratory values will be evaluated by the criteria described in the study laboratory manual and b y the judgment of the investigator .A laboratory test result that is judged b y the investigator as clinicall y significant will be recorded both on the source documentation andthe CRF as an adverse event, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2 .An event may include a laboratory or diagnostic test abnormality (once confirmed by repeat ed testing) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study , the temporary or permanent cessation of administration of IMP or medical treatment , or further diagnostic work-up. Abnormal laboratory tests can be repeated without approval from the medical monitor. (Note: Abnormal laboratory or diagnostic test results at the screening visit that preclude a pat ient from entering the stud y or receiving IMP are not considered adverse events). 7.5.1.

(The same position and arm should be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient.) Forany abnormal vital sign finding, the measurement should be repeated as so on as possible . Any vital sign value that is judged by the investigator as clinicall y significant will be recorded both on the source documentation andthe CRF as an adverse event, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2 . On day1and weeks 4, 8,28, and 54, orthostatic BP and pulse will be measured after the patient is in a standing position for at least 3minutes. 7.7. Electrocardiography A 12 -lead ECG will be recorded at the time points detailed in Table 1. All ECGs will be performed after at least 5 minutes rest in a supine or semi -supine position. A qualified ph ysician at a central diagnostic center will be interpreting the ECG. All ECG results outside of the reference ranges will be judged by the investigator as belonging to one of the following categories: abnormal and not clinically signi ficant abnormal and clinically significant Any ECG finding that is judged by the investigator as clinicall y significant (except at the screening visit) will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source documentation and in the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2 .

Assessment of Suicidality TEV -50717 is considered to be central nervous sy stem (CNS) -active. In addition, there have been some reports of suicidal ideation or behavior as reported in the product label when it has been given to some patients with certain conditions. The sponsor considers it important to monitor for such events before and during this clinical study . Some CNS -active IMPs may be associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior when given to some pa tients with certain conditions. Although this I MP or other similar medicinal products in this class have not been shown to be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thinking or behavior when given to this study population, the sponsor considers it important to monitor for such events before or during this clinical study . The study population being administered TEV -50717 should be monitored appropriatel y and observed closely for suicidal ideation and behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior. Consideration should be given to discontinuing TEV-50717 in participants who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior ,and detailed recommendations are provided in Section 7.2.2 . The d ay 1assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior and treatment -emergent suicidal ideation and behavior will be assessed during the study using the Children’s C-SSRS described in Section 7.2.2 . Depression and Suicidality as an Adverse Event Families and caregivers of patients will be instructed to monitor patients for any changes in or new onset of depressive symptoms; unusual changes in mood, cognition, or behavior; or onset of and/or changes in suicidal ideation or behavior, and to report such s ymptoms immediately to the study investigator. Telephone contacts and clinic visits also allow opportunities for investigators to assess adverse events. If a relevant change in status is identified, patients will be seen immediately for an unscheduled visit by the study investigator and discussed with the medical monitor. The patient will be referred for further ps ychiatric evaluation if there is any suspected suicidal ideation with any level of intent, suicidal behavior, or clinical findings suggesting that the patient may be dangerous to self or others, and/or experiencing depression. The investigator will record these symptoms as an adverse event of depression and/or suicidality . If it is determined by the investigator, after consultation with the medical monitor and the consulting ps ychiatrist, that exposure to the I MP may have contributed to the adverse event of depression or suicidality , IMP will be immediately discontinued and the patient will be terminated from the study . Follow up with a pediatric ps ychiatrist or licensed child a nd adolescent mental health clinician will be arranged. In cases where it is determined that I MP did not contribute to the adverse event of depression or suicidality , the investigator will consult with the medical monitor and/or sponsor to determine wheth er the patient should continue in the study . A reference sample is provided in Appendix E."

Neurological Examinations Neurological examination, includ ing mental status, cranial nerves, motor sy stem (strength, tone, and posture), coordination, gait and balance, tendon reflexes, and sensation, will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 1. Any neurological examination finding that is judged b y the investigator as a potentially clinicall y significant change (worsening) compared with the screening value will be considered an adverse event , reco rded on the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2 . 7.11. Concomitant Medication or Treatment Concomitant therap y or medication usage will be monitored throughout the study. Parents/patients will be instructed during the course of the study to notify the investigator if any new medication is prescribed /administered , including over -the-counter medic ations. Any prescribed /administered medication should be reviewed with the investigator. Medications that are allowed, provided that conditions outlined in the table are met, are shown in Table 6.The tables for allowed and prohibited medications are not comprehensive and may not include all possible concomitant medications. The medical monitor must be contacted if a patient i s receiving (or has to begin or stop receiving during the stud y) a medication that is associated with QTc prolongation or that is a known strong CYP inhibitor , or if there are an y questions regarding an y medication not listed in Appendix A. Prohibited medications that are associated with QTc prolongation are listed in Table 8, while prohibited antipsy chotic drugs are listed in Table 7. 7.12.

STATISTICS This section describes the statistical anal ysis as foreseen at the time of planning the study . Changes, additions, and further details about the analy ses will be described in the statistical analysis plan. After finalization of the statistical analy sis plan, an y additional analy ses or changes to analy ses that may be required will be fully disclosed in the clinical study report (CSR). 9.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations This study is safet y-oriented in nature; therefore, no formal hy pothesis testing is planned for PartA. Based on the number of patients in the previous studies, u p to approximately 227 patients (approximately 1patient from the Phase 1b Study SD-809-C-17, up to approximately 99 patients from the Phase 2/3 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 , and up to approximately 127 patients from the Phase 3 Study TV50717- CNS -30060) are estimated to enroll. All patients who complete Study TV50717- CNS -30060 or Study TV50717- CNS -30046 are eligible to participate in Study TV50717- CNS -30047. As the number of patients to be randomized in parent Study TV50717 -CNS -30046 has increased, the number of patients anticipated to be randomized into Study TV50717- CNS -30047 has also increased. The rationale for the i ncreased sample size in Study TV50717- CNS -30046 is provided that protocol. For the randomized drug withdrawal period, 190 patients to be included in the anal ysis will provide approximately 90% power to detect a difference between TEV -50717 -treated and placebo-treated patients assuming a difference in YGTSS TTS of 4.5 with a standard deviation of 9 using a two -sided test for difference at a significance level of 0.05. 9.2. Analysis Sets 9.2.1. Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set The intent -to-treat ( ITT)analysis set will include all enroll ed patients, regardless of whether or not a patient took an y IMP. Enrolled subjects who are not randomized will be summarized separately as “Not randomized,” and randomized subjects will be anal yzed based on their rando mized treatment. A patient is considered enroll ed according to the status reported in the database .All efficacy analy ses will be based on the ITT analy sis set. 9.2.2. Safety Analysis Set The safet y analysis set will include all patients who receive at least 1 do se of IMP. The safet y analysis set will be used for all safety analy ses. 9.2.3. Randomized Withdrawal ITT Population The Randomized Withdrawal ITT (RWI TT)Population will include all patients enrolled in the randomized drug w ithdrawal period of the stud y."

Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations 11.1.1. Protocol Amendments No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the IEC/IRB and national and local competent authorities ,as applicable , except when necessary to address immediate safety concerns to the patients or when the change involves only nonsubstantial logistics or administration. The principal investigator at each investigational center, the coordinating investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment. 11.1.2. Protocol Violation s Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safet y, ph ysical,or mental integrit y of the patients of the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be considered a protocol violation. Protocol violations may include non -adherence on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol -specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, or GCP guidelines; noncompliance to the administration of IMP; use of prohibited medications. Protocol violations will be identified and recorded by investi gational center personnel in a log or as part of the CRF. All protocol violations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required. When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study , with documented approval from the medical expert . The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and preserving the integrity of the study . Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are not prospectivel y granted b y the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study , they must immediately inform the sponsor of the protocol violation . If such patient has alread y completed the study or has withdrawn earl y, no action will be taken but the violation will be recorded. 11.2. Information to Study Personnel The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study to all personnel members involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the study and during the course of the study (eg, when new personnel become involved). The investigator must ensure that all study personnel are qualified b y education, experience, and training to perform their specific task. These study personnel members must be listed on the investigational center authorization form, which includes a clear description of each personnel member’s responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study , as necessary . The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study personnel , including the investigator , and for ensuring they comply with the protocol . Additional information will be"

Data Collection Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study . The data collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management s ystem(CDMS) that meets the technical requirements described in 21CFR Part11. The CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the scientific, regulatory , and logistical requirements of the study before it is used to capture data from this study . Befor e using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study -specific training. After they are trained, users will be provided with individual system access rights. Data will be collected at the investigational center by appropriatel y designated and trained personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent /assent . Patient identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF . Data will be verified by the study monitor using the data source, and reviewed for consistency by Data Management using both automated logical checks and manual review . All data collected will be approved b y the investigator at the investigational center . This approval acknowledges the investigator’ s review and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate . If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanal ytical laboratory , central ECG center, diary data , electronic patient- reported outcome [ePRO ]Tablet ),the results will be sent to the investigational center , where they will be retained but not entered in the CRF , unless otherwise specified in the protocol . These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data manageme nt) for direct entry in the clinical database. Laboratory test results will not be entered in the CRF unless otherwise specified in the protocol . All data from other sources will be available to the investigators. Forpatients who enter a study but do not meet entry criteria, at a minimum, data for screen ing failure reason, demography , and adverse events from the time of informed consent/assent will be entered in the CRF . 13.2. Data Quality C ontrol Data Management is responsible for the accuracy , quality , complet eness, and internal consistency of the data from this study . Data handling, including data quality control, will comply with international regulatory guidelines, including ICH GCP guidelines. Data management and control processes specific to this study , along with all steps and actions taken regarding data management and data quality contr ol, will be described in a data management plan. CRF s received will be processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency , and the presence of mandatory values. Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for this study . Logical checks will be implemented to ensure data quality and accuracy . Any necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and validation procedure s will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be compared with the information available in the CDMS. Discrepancies found will be queried."

Toxicology General and Reproductive Adult Toxicology : Oral administration of TEV -50717 in rats reduced body weight gain, increased mammary hyperplasia, and produced estrous cycle changes, all of which occurred with tetrabenazine at doses that produced similar systemic exposures to test articles and metabolites. Mammary and estrus effects are likely consequences of reduced central dopam ine and subsequently increased prolactin, consistent with information in the Xenazine®(tetrabenazine) label. Oral administration of TEV -50717 in pregnant rats did not produce test article -related embryofetal toxicities, even at doses that led to reduced body weight gain in dams. Oral administration of metabolite M1 to pregnant rats from gestational days 6 to 17 produced no test article -related maternal or fetal toxicities . Genetic Toxicology : TEV -50717 and its α- HTBZ and β -HTBZ metabolites were negative in in vitro studies for mutagenicity (bacterial reverse mutation, or the Ames test) and for chromosomal structural aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Oral doses of TEV-50717 arewere negative for inducing micronuclei in the bone marrow of treated mice. Juvenile Toxicology : The effects of TEV -50717 on juvenile development was assessed in male and female rats with oral dosing from weaning (postnatal day [PND] 21) to PND 71, similar to human dosing from Year 2 through early adolescence and overlapping with TEV -50717 oral dosing in a general adult toxicology study. The effects of M1 were assessed in male and female juvenile rats from PND 25 to PND 70 with a recovery phase and postdosing reproductive assessment. TEV -50717 produced no test -article -related effects on learning and memory functions, on histopathology assessments, on reproductive capacity (male and female fertility, estrus cyclicity), or on intrauterine survival of embyros from matings during recovery from General and Reproductive Adult Toxicology : Oral administration of TEV -50717 in rats reduced body weight gain, increased mammary hyperplasia, and produced estrous cycle changes, all of which occurred with tetrabenazine at doses that produced similar systemic exposures to test articles and metabolites.

Furthermore, TEV 50717 has the same mechanism of action and indistinguishable pharmacology as tetrabenazine, an agent that is generally accepted among movement disorder experts to provide clinical benefit in this patient population (Jankovic and Kurlan 2011). Based on the nonclinical data discussed above and similar efficacy observed for tetrabenazine and TEV 50717 in studies of other indications 1.4.Known and Potential Benefits and Risks to Patients Additional information regarding benefits and risks to patients may be found in the current IB and in the United States prescribing information for AUSTEDO™ (deutetrabenazine).The section was modified to reflect accurate and consistent information regarding known and potential benefits and risks to patients."

Potential Risk s of TEV 50717 The following information is based on clinical trial experience with TEV 50717 and the United States prescribing information for Xenazine (tetrabenazine): TEV 50717 is contraindicated in patients who are actively suicidal, or in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression. TEV 50717 is contraindicated in patients with impaired hepatic function. TEV 50717 is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). TEV 50717 should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within a minimum of 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI. TEV 50717 is contraindicated in patients taking reserpine. At least 21 days should elapse after stopping reserpine before starting TEV 50717. Additional information regarding ea ch potential issue may be found in the current IB. 1.4.2. Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment for This Study There is a significant need to identify new treatments for TS that do not antagonize dopamine receptors, as these latter agents pose serious risks such as metabolic syndrome and TD, a movement disorder that is often irreversible. The results from Study SD809 C 17 demonstrated meaningful efficacy in the context of good tolerability and no signal on safety scales, vital signs, laboratory parameters, o r 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). These findings are consistent with results in other study populations, such as HD, where the rates for TEV 50717 and placebo were similar for overall adverse events, neurologic and psychiatric adverse events, as well as dose reduction or dose suspension for adverse events (see IB for details). 1.8.

Patients will receive 6 m g of TEV -50717 with food on the evening of day 1. The titration scheme and maximum dose will be determined by body weight and use of strong cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors, as shown in CYP2D6 impairment status from the parent study. Patients will be classified as CYP2D6 impaired if they are receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or are a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer based on blinded assessment of CYP2D6 genotype at baseline of the parent study. Patients who are CYP2D6 impaired will have a dose cap in the o pen label study, as shown in Table 2and Table 3, respectively .As patients from Study SD-809-C-17 will have been off IMP for several months at the time of enrollment, and since patients from Study TV50717 -CNS -30046 or Study TV50717 -CNS -30060 will have discontinued IMP (TEV -50717 or placebo) for at least 1 week at completion of the parent study, all patients will undergo TEV -50717 dose titration in this study.

Assessment of Suicidality Not applicable TEV -50717 is considered to be central nervous system (CNS)- active. In addition, there have been some reports of suicidal ideation or behavior as reported in the product label when it has been given to some patients with certain conditions. The sponsor considers it important to monitor for such events before and during this clinical study. Some CNS -active IMPs may be associated with an increased risk of suic idal ideation or behavior when given to some patients with certain conditions. Although this IMP or other similar medicinal products in this class have not been shown to be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thinking or behavior when given to th is study population, the sponsor considers it important to monitor for such events before or during this clinical study. The study population being administered TEV -50717 should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for suicidal ideation and beha vior or any other unusual changes in behavior. Consideration should be given to discontinuing TEV -50717 in participants who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior.
