Development Phase: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Efficacy objective: To assess the efficacy of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with prurigo nodularis . Safety objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in adults with prurigo nodularis . Study Design: This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with prurigo nodularis (PN). Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo for 10 weeks. After completion of the treatment period or early discontinuation of study drug treatment, all subjects will enter a 3- or 5-week follow-up period. The study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of 15 to 19 weeks: • Screening period: 2 -4 weeks • Treatment period: 10 weeks • Follow-up period: 3 or 5 weeks During the screening period, all subjects will undergo eligibility evaluation and will be assessed for chronic pruritic conditions frequently associated with PN . Subjects who present with idiopathic PN at screening may require additional assessments as deemed necessary by the investigator (e.g. endomysial antibody with reflex to titer for subjects with signs or symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, skin biopsy for subjects with signs or symptoms of bullous pemphigoid or cutaneous T -cell lymphoma , urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori, or allergy testing ). All screening procedures must be completed within 31 days before the Baseline visit. The minimum screening period for all subjects is 14 days to allow for collection of electronic diary ( eDiary) screening data. Subjects who require a screening period longer than 14 days will have a telephone contact at least 15 days prior to the scheduled Baseline visit to remind them to complete the eDiary as previously instructed at the Screening visit. Subjects will be provided an eDiary at the S creening visit. Subjects must be willing and able to complete the eDiary every day within a consistent timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies , for the duration of the study. At the Baseline visit (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (serlopitant 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period (Day 1). Starting on Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day. Study drug may be taken with or without food . 6"

Study Drug: Serlopitant 5 mg oral tablets and matching placebo. Dosage: Serlopitant: 5 mg once daily by mouth for 10 weeks, following a 3-tablet loading dose on the first day of the treatment period. Matching placebo: Once daily by mouth for 10 weeks, following a 3- tablet loading dose on the first day of the treatment period. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy en dpoint is the WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 10. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 4 • Change from baseline in WI -NRS to Day 7 • Change from baseline in WI -NRS to Day 3 • Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to Week 10 Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows : • Change from baseline in WI -NRS to other timepoints • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 2 • WI-NRS 3-point responder rate at Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Activity to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Stage to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 Safety Endpoints: Safety endpoints are as follows : • Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) • Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters following study drug exposure • Changes from baseline in vital sign and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters following study drug exposure • Changes from baseline in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) • Changes from baseline in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Decision Rule and Sample Size: This study will u se a 5% two-sided alpha level. Hierarchical testing in which statistical significance for the key secondary efficacy endpoints requires statistical significance for the primary endp oint. The target sample size of 200 randomized and dosed subjects (100 per group) has been determined based upon a 1:1 allocation of subjects to treatment groups and a 5% alpha level.

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 8 efficacy population will be the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population that will include all randomized subjects who were dispensed study drug . Analyses performed on the Per Protocol population will be considered supportive. Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment group to which they are randomized . Efficacy Analyses: The primary efficacy endpoint is a binary variable taking on values of re sponder or non-responder. Subjects will be considered a responder if they have at least a 4-point reduction in WI -NRS between baseline and Week 10. Missing data imputation will be used for subjects who fail to complete the eDiary at Week 10, unless the sub ject withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or the subject used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, in which case their responder status will be defined as non -responder. The primary endpoint will be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment group and study week. The difference in the primary efficacy outcome measure between treatment groups will be tested using a Cochran Mantel Haenszel test controlling for the stratification factors. Testing of the key secondar y efficacy endpoints will also be employed. Safety Analyses: The incidence of all adverse events ( AEs) and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated by treatment received. These AEs will be classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment -related AEs, AEs by severity, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented. Clinical safety laboratory values will be measured by a central laboratory. Summary statistics for actual values and for changes from baseline will be tabulated for laboratory resu lts by scheduled visit. Graphs of laboratory values over time will also be produced. Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at any post-baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline laboratory values will be tabulated. The overall ECG assessment (abnormal or normal) will be summarized along with a summary of how many subjects developed a post treatment abnormal result. Summary statistics for the HADS and ESS actual values and change from baseline will be presented by scheduled visit. Study Sites: Approximately 50 study sites. Expected Duration of Subject’s Participation 15-19 weeks: 2-4 weeks of screening, 10 weeks of treatment, and a follow -up period of 3 or 5 weeks. This study will be conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 10"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 16 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Pruritus in Prurigo Nodularis Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a distinctive and easily diagnosable chronic skin condition characterized b y the presence of multiple highly pruritic and often symmetrically di stributed nodul es and papules on the skin (Jorizzo 1981). The nodules and papules in PN can range in size from appr oximately 0.5 to 3.0 cm and often appear hyperkeratotic, sometimes crateriform, in appearance. Plaques are occasionally present, and the lesions of PN frequently exhibit other features secondary to prolonged a nd severe scratching behavior, such as post- inflammatory hyperpigmentation, erosion, ulceration, crusting , and bleeding (Zeidler 2016). PN, a long-term reaction to the chronic scratching and picking of patients with c hronic pruritus (Zeidler 2016), is a skin condition seen predominantly in older adults, with median prevalence age in the 50s and 60s and a slight female preponderance (Iking 2013, Tan 2014, Ständer 2013). In one patient population survey, pediatric patients accounted for <2% of the total population, with the youngest patient 11.9 years of age (Iking 2013). Although only limited epidemiology data for PN have been published, a claims-based analysis commissioned b y Menlo Therapeutics suggest that the United States (US) prevalence may b e in the range of ~ 355,000 af fected individuals. B ased on a quantitative sur vey of 73 dermatologists c onducted in pa rallel with the claims-based analy sis, approximately 23% of patients with PN ha ve an underlying atopy- related condition, w hile over 50% are considered to be idiopathic (Navigant 2017). The median duration of disease burden has be en reported to be 6-7 years (Iking 2013, Tan 2014, Schuhknecht 2011). The dominant symptom in P N is an intense and chronic pruritus that is associated w ith a high degree of patient burden and restricted quality of life (QOL) (Zeidler 2016). As measured by global scales of pruritus intensity (numeric rating scale (NRS) and visual analog scale (VAS)), median leve ls of pruritus intensity have been reported to be 7-8 points (Iking 2013, Tan 2014, Schuhknecht 2011). The pruritus experienced in P N can often prevent patients from adequately performing their daily activities (Vaidya 2008), and patients with PN have been found to suffer from greater rates of depression and anxiety than control groups in numerous studies (Jorgensen 2016, Rowland P ayne 1985, Dazzi 2011). 1.2 Conditions Associated With Prurigo Nodularis As PN is cons idered to be a disease induced by chronic pruritus and ongoing scratching activity, a variety of chronic pruritic conditions have been identified as potential underlying etiologies for the pruritus, including atopic dermatitis (AD) , other inflammatory or bullous skin diseases , chronic renal failure, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis C infection, and multifactorial disease (i.e. two or more co-existent conditions associated with chronic pruritus) (Fostini 2013, Lee 2005). The mechanisms linking chronic pruritus to the development of PN are not clear, as only a subset of patients with chronic pruritus develop PN, and over half of patients with PN have no underlying etiology identified. Even when specific underlying conditions are identified, management of these condition(s) does not usually result in resolution of PN signs or symptoms, nor can all underlying conditions be treat ed. F or example, PN has been observed i n patients with HIV adequately managed with 18"
19,page_19,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 17 highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) ( Zancanaro 2006 ), in patients with intractable c holestatic pruritus (Bergasa 2011 ), in patients with inactive hepatitis (Halvorsen 2015 ), and commonly in pa tients with renal failure de spite hemodialy sis therapy (Goeksel 2013). These data point to a high level of unmet medical need in the overall PN population, as the majority of patients with PN either have no underlying condition identified that can be treated, or treat ment of the underlying condition is inadequate to control their PN (Wallengren 2004). 1.3 Current Treatmen t Options for Prurigo Nodularis Treatment of PN remains a challenging and extremely frustrating exper ience for both patients and physicians . In the majority of ca ses, responses are limited and unsati sfactory, and once t he cycle of pruritus-excoriation-pruritus begins , it is difficult to stop. Ide ntification and treatment of underlying chronic pruritic conditions is often the first step in manag ement of PN. If this does not result in resolution of the pruritus, or if no underlying condition is identified, treatment specifically for PN and its associated pruritus is implemented. First-line pruritus therapies, inc luding topical agents such as t opical corticosteroids and c alcineurin inhibitors, often provide inadequate response (Saco 2015) and the t herapeutic ladder for PN involves systemic agents with pro gressively riski er safety profiles. The se include naltrexone, gabapentin, mirtazapine, phototherapy, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), powerful immunosuppressants such as met hotrexate and cyclosporine, and thalidomide (Ständer 2015b, Spring 2014, Feldmeyer 2012, Lim 2016). None of these therapies are indicated for the treat ment of PN, and their usage is often based on limited evidence, such as case reports or s mall open-label studi es. 1.4 Substance P and the Neurokinin-1 Receptor Repeated itching , scratching, and picking over long time periods serve as the pathophysiological basis for the development of PN. Although different underlying disease states may be responsible for the chronic pruritus, t he distinctive and easily recognizable features of PN point to a common final pathwa y resulting in this unique clinical presentation. Immunohistochemical staining studies of PN biopsies have demonstrated t hat nerve fibers immunoreactive for Substance P (SP) are found in in creased numbers in lesional skin compared to non-l esional skin or controls (Abadía Molina 1992), suggesting a role for SP signaling in PN. These findings are consistent with the robust body of evidence indicating the key role of SP signaling through its primary receptor, the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R), in the transmission of itch across multiple disease states (Santini 2012, Akiyama 2015, Crowe 1994, El-Nour 2006, Lotts 2014, Hon 2007, Ward 2004, Slattery 2011). SP is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, a group that also includes neurokinin A and neurokinin B (Hökfelt 2001). S P has been implicated in a number of biological functions, both physiological and pathophysiological, including pruritus perception, vom iting reflex, pain perception, and immunomodulatory responses (Lotts 2014, Andoh 1998, Steinhoff 2014). The biological actions of SP are mediated by tachykinin receptors, which consist of seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains coupled to G- proteins. Three tachykinin receptors have been identified: the neurokinin-1, neurokinin-2, 19"
20,page_20,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 18 and neurokinin-3 receptors (Harrison 2001). T he NK1-R in particular has been studied in great detail. NK 1-R is the primary receptor for SP in the human body, and is found on multiple cell types, include central and peripheral neurons, keratinocytes, and mast cells. NK1-R stimulation has been shown to be an important pathway for pruritus perception (Ständer 2015a). Inhi bition of this pathway res ults in decreased pr uritus and scratching ref lexes in animal models (Akiyama 2015). Preceding the development of serlopitant for pruritus-related conditions, a commercially available N K1-R antagonist (Emend USPI) has been used as a therapy t o decrease pruritus in patients with chronic pruritus due to etiologies such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Duval 2009, Torres 2012, Booken 2011) and erlotinib-induced pruritus (Santini 2012, Gerber 2010). Additionally, in a study of 20 patients with chronic pruritus of various etiologies treated with aprepitant , 16/20 patients (80%) ex perienced a considerable reduction of itch intensity (Stände r 2010). 1.5 Serlopita nt 1.5.1 Serlopitant Background and Nonclinical Summary Serlopitant is a small molecule, highly selective NK1-R antagonist that is administered orally and metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A4 ( CYP3A4), with a plasma half -life of 45-86 hours. It binds with high affinity to the human NK 1-R with a dissociation constant ( Kd) of 46 pM; displacing SP binding with a half- maximal inhibition concentration (IC 50) of 61 pM. Serlopitant is a potent functional antagonist of SP-induced inositol phosphate generation. Serlopitant has been extensively studied in animal toxicology studies, including chronic toxicology and carcinogenicity studies. In non-clinical chronic toxicology studies in rats, mice and dogs, treatment related findings of potential clinical significance included increased salivation, decreased body weight gain and food consumption, slight changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters, mild increases in liver weight and mild histomorphologic changes. The histomorphologic changes were seen only in rats (not in dogs or mice) and included: very slight ovarian interstitial cell hypertrophy, mammary gland and uterine atrophy; decreased corpora lutea; increased histiocytes in lung and mesenteric lymph nodes; slight skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration; slight increased hematopoiesis in bone marrow; and slight to moderate vacuolation in kidney tubules. These nonclinical findings occurred at systemic exposures exceeding those anticipated to provide efficacy of serlopitant for pruritus indications in humans (1 to 5 mg tablet daily). No cardiac lesions have been observed in dog toxicity studies up to 9 months in duration nor in a 3-month mouse range-finding study and 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study at exposure higher than the lowest level which caused cardiotoxicity in rats. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats for histomorphological changes in the reproductive tract, mammary gland and bone marrow provides a 2.5-fold margin for the maximum- targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily). The rat NOAEL for histomorphological changes in muscle and kidney provides a 5-fold margin for the maximum- targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily). In summary, the nonclinical toxicity noted with serlopitant provides no contraindications to the continuation of clinical trials via the oral route. Findings in the developmental toxicity 20"

Single doses up to 400 mg have been well tolerated in young adult males and single doses up to 25 mg have been well tolerated in the elderly. Multiple doses of up to 50 mg a day for 4 weeks have been well tolerated in healthy young males, and a single (loading) dose of 15 mg followed by daily doses of 5 mg for 2 weeks have been well tolerated in elderly males and females. Forty -one (41) subjects received 4 mg liquid fi lled capsule (LFC) daily (bioequivalent to 5 mg tablets) for 1 year. Plasma concentrations of serlopitant appear to increase in a dose-proportional fashion in both young males and elderly subjects (males and females). Peak plasma concentrations after a single oral dose occurred at ~2 to 4 hours in both young and elderly subjects. A single loading dose of up to 15 mg followed by 6 to 8 weeks of up to 5 mg daily doses has been well tolerated in adults with chronic pruritus and PN. Pharmacokinetic data demo nstrate good plasma exposures with oral dosing, linear dose- dependent increases in plasma concentration and systemic exposure, a plasma t1/2 appropriate for once daily dosing, and mild effects of concomitant food ingestion. Central nervous system (CNS) positron emission tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated good CNS penetrance and > 90% NK1 receptor occupancy (RO) at plasma exposures anticipated to be safe and well tolerated. Three long -lived active hydroxylated metabolites are observed in humans: M1/M 1a M2/M2a , and M3 . These metabolites were present at lower concentrations and were 2 - to 9-fold less potent in vivo than the parent compound. The integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis conclud ed that these metabolites are unlikely to contribute significantly to occupancy of the CNS NK 1-R in humans. 1.5.3 Serlopitant in Pruritus -Related Studies Serlopitant has been evaluated in two completed Phase 2 studies of subjects with chronic pruritus (TCP -101 and TCP-102). TCP-101 TCP-101 was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, multi -center study that compared serlopitant 0.25 mg, 1 mg, or 5 mg vs . placebo for the treatment of chronic pruritus. A total of 257 adult subjects 18-65 years of age with chronic pru ritus were randomized to receive one of the four dose groups in a 1:1:1:1 randomization. Subjects received a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 and thereafter received 1 tablet per day for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was itch severity as measure d on a VAS, summarized as a percentage change from baseline. Mean percent decreases from Baseline in VAS score were larger in the active- treatment groups versus placebo at every scheduled post- baseline study visit. Overall, the results were the most profound for the serlopitant 1 mg and 5 mg groups. For the percent change from Baseline in VAS pruritus scores (the primary efficacy variable), the Week 6 pairwise least 21 CCI CCI CCI"

The frequency of treatment- emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) and study drug related adverse events (AEs) was higher in the serlopitant 1 mg and 5 mg groups compared to the serlopitant 0.25 mg group, a nd the frequency in all three treatment groups were higher than in the placebo group. The frequency of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was comparable in the serlopitant 5 mg and placebo group and higher than in the serlopitant 0.25 mg and 1 mg groups. There was one serious adverse event ( SAE) reported in the serlopitant 1 mg group (spontaneous abortion, considered not related). There were no deaths. The most common AEs in the serlopitant groups were diarrhea (6.2%, 1 mg group), upper respiratory tract infection (4.7%, 0.25 mg group), somnolence (4.7%, 5 mg group), nasopharyngitis (4.6%, 1 mg group), headache (4.7%, 5 mg group), urinary tract infection (3.1%, 5 mg group), dry mouth (3.1%, 1 mg group), nausea (3.1%, 1 mg group), arthralgia (3.1%, 0.25 mg group), musculoskeletal pain (3.1%, 1 mg group) and pruritus (3.1%, 1 mg group). The most common AEs in the placebo group were headache (6.3%), nasopharyngitis (3.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.2%), urinary tract infection (3.2%) and asthma (3.2%). TCP-102 TCP-102 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled multi- center study that evaluated serlopitant 5 mg vs. placebo for the treatment of PN . A total of 128 adult subjects 18-80 years of age with PN were randomized to receive serlopi tant or placebo in a 1:1 randomization. Subjects received a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 followed by 1 tablet per day for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the average VAS score as recorded at the study visits. Results at Week 4 and Week 8 w ere the primary timepoints. Serlopitant 5 mg was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus as measured by change in average VAS from baseline. For the primary endpoint, change from baseline at Week 4 and Week 8 by repeated measures analysis, the decrease from baseline was significantly greater in the serlopitant group than the placebo group, with a mean difference (serlopitant minus placebo) of -1.0 at Week 4 and - 1.7 at Week 8. The mean difference at Week 2 was also significant, -0.9. In a post- hoc analysis of the percentage of subjects who were 4 -point responders on average VAS at Week 8, 25.0% of placebo subjects and 54.4% of serlopitant subjects were 4-point responders. TEAEs were reported for 71.9% of serlopitant- treated subjects and 61.9% of placebo- treated subjects. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the serlopitant group were nasopharyngitis (17.2% serlopitant, 3.2% placebo), diarrhea (10.9% serlopitant, 4.8% placebo), and fatigue (9.4% serlopitant, 6.3% placebo). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 48.4% of serlopitant-treated subjects and 34.9% of placebo-treated subjects. The most frequently reported treatment -related TEAEs in the serlopitant group were fatigue (7.8%) and diarrhea, peripheral edema, dizziness, and headache (each 6.3%). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate; severe TEAEs were reported for 9.4% of serlopitant-treated subjects and 4.8% of placebo-treated subjects. There were no deaths during the study. Five subjects (3 serlopitant, 2 placebo) had SAEs. The SAE s were actinic elastosis, depression, dizziness, and vertigo in 22"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 21 the serlopitant group; and bradycardia, syncope, respiratory failure, and neurodermatitis in the placebo group. Nine subjects (3 serlopitant, 6 placebo) discontinued due to TEAEs. No clinically relevant changes were observed in chemistry, hematology, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Potential Risks and Benefits: The results of the Phase 2 studies in PN and chronic pruritus, together with the extensive nonclinical and clinical sa fety data and experience with serlopitant to date and the scientific rationale for NK1-R inhibition in the treatment of pruritus, serve to support further evaluation of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in patients with PN. The potential benefits of continued clinical study outweigh the potential risks. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for further information regarding serlopitant. 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES The efficacy objective of this study is to assess the efficacy o f serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with PN . The safety objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in adults with PN. 3 STUDY DESIGN 3.1 Overall Study Design This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with PN. The study will be conducted at approximately 50 study sites. Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo for 10 weeks. After completion of the treatment period or early discontinuation of study drug treatment, all subjects will enter a 3 or 5 -week follow-up period. The required follow-up period is defined as a minimum of 3 weeks for those subjects who will enroll in the one- year open-label safety study (MTI -107) on the date of the follow-up visit, and as 5 weeks for those subjects who will not be enrolled in the one-year open-label safety study of serlopitant. Should a subject present for the follow-up visit prior to 5 weeks after the last dose of study drug and be excluded from participation in the one-year study for any reason, the subject will be required to return at 5 weeks after the last dose of study drug for a complete follow-up visit. This study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of 15-19 weeks: • Screening period: 2-4 weeks • Treatment period: 10 weeks • Follow-up period: 3 or 5 weeks 23"
24,page_24,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 22 Informed consent will occur prior to any protocol-mandated procedures, including the stopping of any excluded therapies. This may occur prior to the Screening visit. During the screening period, all subjects will undergo eligibility evaluation and will be assessed for chronic pruritic conditions frequently associated with PN. Subjects who present with idiopathic PN at screening may require additional assessments as deemed necessary by the investigator (e.g. endomysial antibody with reflex to titer for subjects with signs or symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, skin biopsy for subjects with signs or symptoms of bullous pemphigoid or cutaneous T- cell lymphoma, urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori , or allergy testing). All screening procedures must be com pleted within 31 days before the Baseline visit. The minimum screening period for all subjects is 14 days to allow for collection of electronic diary (eDiary) screening data. Subjects who require screening period longer than 14 days will have a telephone contact at least 15 days prior to the scheduled Baseline visit to remind them to complete the eDiary as previously instructed at the Screening visit. Screening procedures may be deferred following discussion with the medical monitor should more than 31 days be required (e.g. to wash out of certain excluded therapies or to treat their underlying condition). Screening procedures may be repeated (i.e., the subject may be rescreened ) following discussion with the medical monitor should the subject have had diff iculty complying with eDiary assessments, require further training in the assessments, or have other relevant needs that may delay enrollment in the study but are not expected to impact safety or efficacy assessments. Subjects will be provided an eDiary at the Screening visit. Subjects must be willing and able to complete the eDiary every day within a consistent timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies, for the duration of the study. At the Baseline visit (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (serlopitant 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period (Day 1). Starting on Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day. Study drug may be taken with or without food. The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 10 of treatment . Subjects who complete the 10-week treatment period and required follow-up period may be given the opportunity to enroll in a one- year open-label safety study (MTI -107) with daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg. 3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Selection In the TCP-102 study in patients with PN , serlopitant 5 mg taken daily f or 8 weeks was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus , in both the overall study population as well as the subgroup of subjects with an atopic diathesis. Similarly, in the TCP -101 study in 24"
25,page_25,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 23 patients with chronic pruritus , serlopitant 5 mg and 1 mg taken daily for 6 weeks were superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus , in both the overall study population and the subgroup of subjects with an atopic diathesis. In both the TCP -102 and TCP-101 studies, serlopitant was generally well -tolerated and demonstrated an overall favorable safety profile at the doses evaluated. The current MTI -106 study is d esigned to confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in patients with PN. The 5 mg dose of serlopitant was selected for this study based on the favorable efficacy, safety , and tolerability profile of serlopitant at this dose level. Over 250 subjects have been exposed to serlopitant at doses of 5 mg tablet-equivalent daily for at least 6 weeks, and ~ 40 subjects have been exposed up to one year. Human CNS PET RO data for serlopitant in healthy young males (Study P002) demonstrated that a serlopitant 5 mg LFC once daily dose is likely to achieve ~ 94 % NK1 RO at steady state. 3.3 Study Endpoints 3.3.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the Worst -Itch Numeric Rating Scale ( WI-NRS) 4-point responder rate at Week 10. 3.3.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 4 • Change from baseline in WI- NRS to Day 7 • Change from baseline in WI- NRS to Day 3 • Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to Week 10 3.3.3 Additional Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Additional secondary efficacy endpoi nts are as follows: • Change from baseline in WI- NRS to other timepoints • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 2 • WI-NRS 3-point responder rate at Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Activity (IGA PN -A) to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Stage (IGA PN -S) to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 25"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 29 •Discontinuation is deemed to be in the best interest of the subject, in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opinion, including evidence that the subject does not meetinclusion/exclusion criteria intended primarily for safety reasons, or a persistent lack ofadherence to study p rocedures The Sponsor or designee should be contacted within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of any study drug treatment discontinuati on. Investigators should make every effort to contact the Sponsor or designee before discontinuing study drug treatment, if possible. Subjects who discontinue treatment with study drug prior to completing the treatment period will enter a 5-week follow-up period following the last dose of study drug in addition to a Follow-up visit (see Section 3.1, Section 6.5.10 ). Every effort should be made for subjects to complete the Follow-up visit after a subject has discontinued from study drug. 5.7 Prior, Con comitant, and Excluded Therapies Prior therapies (including over-the-counter medications) used to treat the signs and symptoms of PN within the prior 2 years will be recorded for each subject at the Baseline visit. Concomitant therapies include any therapies (including over-the-counter medications and bland emollients ) used by a subject from initiation of study drug treatment through the follow-up perio d. A record of all medications used will be maintained for each subject throughout the study. Reported information will include a description of the type of drug, treatment period, dosing regimen, the route of administration, and drug indication. The use of any concomitant medication must relate to the subject’s medical history or to an AE, except for vitamins/nutritional supplements, emollie nt use, and routine preventative immunizations. 5.7.1 Allowed Therapies and Treatment Goals for Underlying Conditions Treatment of an underlying, treatable chronic pruritic condition is allowed, if stable for at least 6 weeks prior to the Baseline visit, and continued throughout the treatment period . Treatment of the underlying systemic pruritic condition should be optimized per standard of care and treatment goals must be tailored based on age, sex, and concurrent health status and drug tolerance. While resolution of metabolic or endocrine disorders or eradication of an underlying infection may not always be feasible, every effort should be made to ensure the condition is well controlled , to prevent or reduce exacerbations and to prevent limitation on the activities of daily living . When applicable, laboratory evidence of control should be obtained. For example, if renal insufficiency is implicated as causal for pruritus, treatment would be expected to have meaningfully reduced the creatinine (compared to that at the time of diagnosis) and to maintain the creatinine at < 2.5 the ULN; control of diabetes is supported by a hemoglobin -A1c of < 7.5%; control of thyroid disease is supported by normalization of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or by a TSH within 1.5 times the ULN in elderly patients; iron deficiency is corrected with a serum iron within 0.8 times the lower limit of normal; eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection generally requires a negative urea breath 31"

Any previously active skin disease is considered to be well controlled if it is globally considered clear or almost clear (permissible to have post -inflammatory pigmentation, fine scale, faint pink erythema, barely perceptible induration/papulation, and no oozing or crusting). Use of gentle cleansers and bland emollients (including those with urea) is encouraged for all subjects. If bland emollient use is elected, it must be initiated at least 2 weeks (14 days) prior to Baseline visit, and continued throughout the treatment period . Treatment with non -systemic corticosteroids or antihistamines that do not involve skin application (e.g. inhaled, intranasal, ophthalmic, or intra- articular) is allowed. Leukotriene inhibitors will be permitted for treatment of conditions other than PN (e.g. asthma). 5.7.2 Excluded Therapies Initiation or use of topical therapy with corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, calcipotriene, PDE-4 inhibitors is not permitted within 4 weeks prior to the Baseline visit or throughout the treatment period, but such therapy may be initiated during the follow-up period if needed. Initiation of bland emollient is not permitted within 2 weeks (14 days) prior to Baseline visit or throughout the treatment period, but such therapy may be initiated during the follow-up period if needed. The following therapies and activities are excluded from the Screening visit through the treatment period, and through the follow-up period: • NK1-R antagonists (other than study drug) • Systemic immunosuppressive/ immunomodulatory therapies (including but not limited to systemic corticosteroids, PDE -4 inhibitors, cyclosporine, mycophenolate- mofetil, methotrexate, azathioprine, thalidomide, interferon-gamma, or phototherapy) • Biologic therapies (other than therapies such as insulins, vaccines) • Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (See App endix B) • Use of an indoor tanning facility, or natural sun exposure resulting in significant tanning or sunburn • Any investigational therapy The following therapies and activities are excluded from the Screening visit through the treatment period, and use is discouraged, though permitted, through the follow-up period: 32"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 31 • Topical therapies or emollients with anti-pruritic properties (including but not limited to anti-histamines, menthol or menthol derivatives, polidocanol, camphor, pramoxine, and capsaicin) • Systemic therapies with recognized anti -pruritic properties (including but not limited to H1 antihistamines, doxepin, gabapentin, pregabalin, cannabinoids, kappa-opioid receptor agonists, and mu-opioid receptor antagonists) Use of any excluded therapies (in cluding those for the treatment of pruritus or PN lesions, or as rescue therapy) should be reported as soon as possible, and will be recorded as protocol deviations for subjects who receive them. 5.7.3 Rescue Therapies The initiation of non- study drug therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN lesions, or flare of previously inactive skin disease, is strongly discouraged throughout the treatment period. However, should rescue therapy be required for the safety and well-being of the subject, such use will be recorded and analyzed (see Section 8.2). The subject may remain on study drug, unless the rescue therapy is an NK 1-R antagonist, a systemic biologic therapy, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, an investigational therapy, or a ny therapy that may jeopardize the subject’s safety if study drug is continued, in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opinion. 5.8 Assignment to Treatment 5.8.1 Randomization Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive serlopitant 5 mg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio . Stratified permuted block randomization will be used. Randomization will be stratified by the subject’s reported WI -NRS score for the 1- week period prior to the Baseline visit (6.5 to < 9, 9 to 10). An IWRS will be used to perform the randomization. 5.8.2 Blinding This study will be conducted as a double- blind study with the treatment assignment concealed from the subjects, the investigators and their staff, the Sponsor, and any designees of the Sponsor as required . The placebo will be formulated to be indistinguishable from the active study product. Study materials will be packaged and issued in a manner designed to maintain the blind for subjects and all study personnel involved in the direction and execution of study procedures, study assessments, and collection of data. The randomization code for each subject will be available to the sites for use only in an emergency situation. For details of the procedure for unblinding of individual subjects in cases of emergency see Section 7.6. 33"

Subjects will record in the eDiary the doses administered, as well as whether a dose was taken within 2 hours of eating a meal. Subjects will be asked to return all partially used and empty bottles to the study site at each visit. The site staff will count and record the number of remaining tablets in each returned bottle . The site staff will review the subject’s eDiary to help evaluate compliance with dosing at each study visit. Discrepancies between compliance as assessed by tablet counts and doses recorded in the eDiary will be reconciled and documented. Dosing dates and times will be recorded. A subject who has deviated significantly from the once-daily dosing regimen will be counseled. 6 STUDY SCHEDULE AND ASSESSM ENTS When applicable, efficacy and safety instruments will be provided with instructions for administration, in study-specific manuals for site reference. 6.1 Efficacy Parameters 6.1.1 Itch Numeric Rating Scale The Itch NRS is a validated, self -reported instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It uses a 24-hour recall period and asks subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable). Higher scores indicate greater itch intensity. In this study, the subject is asked to rate the intensity of their worst itch (WI-NRS) during a 24-hour recall period ; the questionnaire is provided in Appendix C . Initial WI-NRS score collected during Screening visit will be collected on paper . All subsequent WI -NRS assessments will be reported by subject via eDiary. Subjects will record their WI-NRS scores once daily via eDiary at approximately the same time each day (+/- 3 hours) throughout the screening, treatment, and follow-up periods, as outlined in Appendix A. Subjects may be allowed to adjust the timing of eDiary completion within the first week of Screening as needed. Standardized training and instructions will be provided to all subjects prior to eDiary use. 6.1.2 Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Activity The IGA PN-A is an instrument used to assess the overall activity of PN lesions at a given time point, as determined by the investigator. It consists of a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), as provided in Appendix D . The IGA PN- A uses clinical characteristics of excoriations, crusting, and/or bleeding as guidelines for the overall activity assessment. The n umber of pruriginous lesions should not be considered for this assessment. IGA PN-A scores will be captured as outlined in Appendix A . Each assessment during the study must be done by the Principal Investigator ( PI) or designee. Every effort should be made to ensure that all assessments for a given subject are done by the same indiv idual throughout the study. However, a change in assessor for a given subject, though not ideal, will not be considered a protocol deviation. 34"

It consists of a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), as provided in Appendix D . The IGA-PN-S uses clinical characteristics of number of nodules and their thickness as guidelines for the overall severity assessment. IGA -PN-S scores will be captured as outlined in Appendix A . Each assessment during the study must be done by the PI or designee. Every effort should be made to ensure that all assessments for a given subject are done by the same individual throughout the study. However, a change in assessor for a given subject, though not ideal, will not be considered a protocol deviation. 6.1.4 Dermatology Life Quality Index Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI) is a dermatology specific QOL instrument designed to assess the impact of the skin disease on a subject’s QOL over the prior week. It is a ten- item questionnaire that assesses overall QOL and six aspects that may affect QOL (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment), and is provided in Appendix E . The DLQI questionnaire will be collected as outlined in Appendix A . 6.1.5 PN Photographs At selected investigative sites, optional photographs of representative areas with PN involvement will be taken at multiple time points, as outlined in Appendix A . These areas may include the extensor surfaces of both arms and both legs (overview of both legs, detail of lower legs), and the abdomen and back. The central photography vendor will provide photographic equipment to the sites for use during the study. The PI and designees will be trained on the use of the camera and the appropriate lighting and positioning of the representative area with PN involvement. Detailed instructions will be provided in the Photography manual. 6.2 Safety Parameters Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording protocol-defined AEs and SAEs; vital signs; physical examinations; clinical laboratory assessments; ECGs ; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of th e study drug as outlined in Appendix A . 6.2.1 Vital Signs Vital signs will include measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and temperature after the subject has been calmly resting ( seated or supine) for a minimum of 5 minutes. Vital signs will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A and at unscheduled study visits when clinically indicated.

An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is not “life-threatening”) • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • Congenital anomaly/ birth defect • Important medical event (i.e. an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but which may be considered serious by the investigator or Sponsor, as it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The following are not considered SAEs: a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event), an elective surgery planned prior to signing consent, admission as per protocol for planned medical/surgical procedure, and/or routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g. routine colonoscopy). The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE (e.g. mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of minor medical significance (e.g. s evere back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. Seriousness (not severity) serves as the basis for defining regulatory reporting obligations. Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on the eCRF. 47"

New or worsening clinically significant abnormal phy sical exam findings identified after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. Only abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that are considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g. require active management or are associated with accompanying symptoms/signs) will be recorded as medical history or AEs on the eCRF. Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history, and abnormal findings that occur after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. If the clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG abnormality is a sign associated with a confirmed disease or condition (e.g. elevated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with chronic kidney disease), only the diagnosis (chronic kidney disease) needs to be recorded on the AE eCRF (rather than listing individual test findings as AEs) . Separate instances of the same clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG abnormality across visits should not be recorded as separate AEs or SAEs. 7.1.4 Deaths Any deaths that occur from the time of informed consent to the follow-up visit, regardless of attribution, must be reported within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of the death. See Safety Form Completion Instructions for complete instructions. The Sponsor should be provided a copy of any post- mortem findings and/or relevant medical reports, including histopathology. 7.1.5 Pregnancies and Contraception Requir ements for Females For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is defined as an y female who has experienced menarche and is pre-menopausal, unl ess permanently surgically s terile (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy). A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause in a previously menstruating female. For the purposes of this study, acceptable contraception is defined below based on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals: ICH M3(R2) dated January 2010, and other available guidelines (“U .S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use” 2010; “Recommenda ti ons related to contraception and pregnancy tes ting in clinical trials” 2014; “M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals” 2010): 48"
49,page_49,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 47 All female subjects of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception, which includes the use of one or more of the following acceptable methods: 1. Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation , hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) 2. Total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, only if planned for the entire duration of the study period and consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle for the subject 3. Hormonal contraception associated with consistent inhibitio n of ovulation; these may include (but are not necessarily limited to) oral, intravaginal, implantable, injectable, or transdermal delivery methods 4. Intrauterine device/system 5. Exclusive (sole) monogamous intercourse with a sterilized (i.e., vasectomized) or otherwise non- fertile (e.g., castrated) male partner; the male partner must have received medical assessment of the surgical success Progesterone- only oral contraceptives are excluded as a highly effective method of contraception, as they do not consistently inhibit ovulation. Male or female condoms with or without spermicide, and female caps, diaphragms, and sponges with spermicide, or combinations (double barrier) are also excluded as highly effective contraceptive methods. Any pregnancy occurring in a female subject or the female partner of a male subject, from the first study drug administration through the required follow-up visit must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. See Safety Form Completion Instructions for complete instructions. The investigator will follow the pregnancy to delivery or other pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy in a female clinical trial subject or female partner of a male clinical trial subject is not an SAE per se. Complications of such pr egnancies (for example, spontaneous abortion) may qualify as SAE s and should be reported as such even if they occur after the Follow -up visit. Any congenital anomalies/birth defects must be recorded and reported as SAEs. See Safety Form Completion Instructions for complete instructions. 7.1.6 Worsening of P ruritus or PN Pruritus or PN should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if considered by the investigator to have worsened in severity beyond the subject ’s typical fluctuations . It is important to include a description of the nature of the unexpected worsening when recording the AE or SAE (e.g. new PN lesions in previously uninvolved skin). 49"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 48 7.2 Methods and Timing for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 7.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Per iod Any AE occurrence during the study must be recorded on source documentation and eCRF at the site, in accordance with protocol instructions. AEs and SAEs will be recorded from the first study drug administration through the follow-up visit. After the required follow-up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug- related should be reported. After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by the investigator to be caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure- related SAEs should only be reported on the source documents and SAE form, not on the AE eCRF. Subjects who undergo screening procedures but are not randomized int o the study will not have SAEs recorded in the clinical database. 7.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs at each subject contact through the follow-up visit. All AEs and SAEs, whether reported by the subject or noted by authorized study personnel, will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF page, and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causal ity. 7.2.3 Assessment of Severity All AEs entered into the eCRF will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 (“Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)” 2010) to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event. If the AE cannot be found in the event-s pecific NCI CTCAE grading criteria, the investigator should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Table 1. 50"

A semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within the altern ate description of the grade. b Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. c Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. Source: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 Note that severity, a measure of intensity, is not equivalent to seriousness, a regulatory definition of outcome. Regardless of severity, some AEs may meet the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for the definitio n of an SAE. If an adverse event changes in severity during the same study period (e.g., treatment period), only the highest severity grade will be recorded on the eCRF. 7.2.4 Assessment of Causality The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious). An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. Causality of an AE will be assessed by the investigator using the following terms: • Likely Related: A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug; and for which other potential etiologies are considered less likely factors than the study drug. • Likely Unrelated: A reaction that, considering all potential etiologies, is most likely due to factors other than the study dr ug. 51"
52,page_52,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 50 7.3 Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The investigator must make every effort to follow all AEs and SAEs regardless of attribution until judged resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that study drug treatment or participation in the study is not the cause of the AE or SAE. 7.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor and Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee The Sponsor or designee is under obligation to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities related to investigational drugs in clinical trials. The Sponsor or designee must be notified within 24 hours of an AE when the investigator determines that an AE meets the protocol definition of an SAE, regardless of the cause or relationship to study drug. An SAE related to study participation occurring before study drug administration and after informed consent should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. If the investigator le arns of any SAE at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the SAE is considered likely related to study drug, the SAE should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. Please see the Safety Form Report Completion Instructions for sa fety reporting instructions. The investigator must also comply with applicable requirements concerning reporting of SAEs to the IRB or Ethics Committee ( EC). This may include initial or follow -up notification of an SAE or other safety information. 7.5 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and Study Investigators The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for submitting reports of serious, unexpected related adverse events to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis, according to the ICH E2A Guideline and to other regulatory authorities according to national and local regulations as required. The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for prompt submission to the IRB or EC of any expedited SAE reports submitted to regulatory authorit ies. All investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies with serlopitant will receive copies of the SAE reports submitted on an expedited basis to regulatory authorities. 7.6 Emergency Unblinding Emergency unblinding is available 24 hours per day/7 days per week and will be performed via IVRS. An investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only when knowledge of the investigational product is essential for the welfare of a subject. There is no specific antidote for serlopitant and usual supportive medical management is recommended in the case of a medical emergency. 52"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 51 8 STATISTICAL METHODS All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. No interim analyses are planned. Endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment group and visit. For continuous variables, the following information will be presented: n (number of subjects), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. For categorical variables counts and percentages will be used. Summary statistics for imputed efficacy data will be reported based upon imputed data. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Subjects who withdrew from the stud y due to a lack of efficacy, or used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, will be defined as non-responder. As one sensitivity analysis, the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) will be used (i.e., the last available on -therapy observation for a subject will be used to estimate subsequent missing data points). As a second sensitivity analysis, a repeated measures model will be used on observed data. Additionally, a tipping point analysis will be done as a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint. Baseline for measures other than the eDiary daily measures will be the last recorded value prior to the start of treatment. For daily measures including the WI- NRS, baseline will be the average result measured over the week prior to treatment. A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 8.1 Decision Rule and Sample S ize T his study will use a 5% two-sided alpha level. While the alpha level is tw o-sided, clinically relevant results require a serlopitant benefit. Statis tical significance for the key secondary efficacy endpoints requires statistical significance for the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e. stepdown te sting from primary to key secondary endpoints). The key secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested in order starting with the Week 4 WI-NRS 4-poi nt responder rate, then change from baseline to Day 7, and the n Day 3, and finally the change f rom baseline to Week 10 in DLQI. The target sample size of 200 randomized and dosed subjects (100 per group) has been determined based upon a 1:1 allocation of subjects to treatment groups and a 5% alpha level. A sampl e size of two hundred subjects results in 90% power assuming a placebo responder rate of % and serlopitant rate of %. The sample size calculations have been performed in PASS 13 (“PASS 13 Power Analysis and Sample Size Software” 2014) and use a Chi-Squared test . The primary analysis will control for the stratification factors. It is expected that this unstratified power estimate will under-estimat e the true power as i t does not take the variance reduction resulting from s tratification into account (Matts 1988). 53 CCI CCI"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 52 8.2 Handling of Missing Data Should a determination of treatment period (on treatment, pre- treatment, follow-up) be required for adverse events or concomitant medication but the corresponding date is missing, or is a partial date, the event/medication will be considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are available indicate this is not possible. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation. Subjects who withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, will be defined as non-responder. I mputation will be conducted within each treatment group independently, so the pattern of missing observations in one treatmen t group cannot influence missing value estimations in another. For each imputation process, 25 imputations will be performed. If a subject fails to complete their eDiary for the week prior to Week 10, the primary endpoint (WI-NRS) data will be missing , unless the subject withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy , or the subject used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, in which case their responder status will be defined as non-responder. If the Week 10 value is missing for any other reason, the change from baseline value will be based on imputed data. Missing Week 10 WI -NRS values from which the 4-point responder status is derived will be estimated by MCMC. Missing WI-NRS data will be derived for the analysis using the metho d of MCMC multiple imputation. Since both primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints require WI-NRS, the following steps will be followed: 1. Using the daily eDiary data, calculate Baseline and Week 2 through Week 10 values by averaging available values. If any values are available, these will be used i.e. a minimum of 1 observation is required to compute a week’s average. 2. From step 1, create a dataset for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and those needing estimation by MCMC. The missing WI -NRS values in each dataset will be filled in using the MCMC method to generate 25 datasets. The resulting datasets for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete dataset. Syntax: proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. Nimpute=25 <options>; where trtpn=(TRT); /* Note TRT = [1, 2]; depending on treatment group */; mcmc chain=single; var baseline d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 week2 week3 week4 week5 week6 week7 week8 week9 week10 ; run; 3.

Those random seeds have been pre-specified by using a random number generator: 8.3 Analysis Population s The primary efficacy population will be the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and will include all randomized subjects who were dispensed study drug. Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment group to which they are randomi zed. The primary safety population will be all treated subjects with at least one post- baseline assessment.

Analyses performed on the Per Protocol population will be considered supportive. The PP population will include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria: • Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria; • Receives a strong CYP3A4 inhibi tor (See Appendix B ); • Receives an excluded medication for treatment of pruritus or PN; • Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e. subjects must comply with 80−120% of the expected dosage of study medication during pa rticipation in the study); • Out of visit window at the Week 10 visit by ±7 days Subjects that discontinue from the study drug due to an adverse event related to study treatment or documented lack of treatment effect will be included in the PP population. Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. 8.4 Subject Disposition An accounting of all randomiz ed subjects by disposition will be presented. Subjects who discontinue study drug prematurely or withdraw from the study will be summarized and listed, with a description of the reason for early termination/withdrawal. 8.5 Subject Characteristics Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summari zed. 8.6 Prior and Concomitant M edications Prior and concomitant medications will be coded by the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary to Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) and prefer red drug name. Prior therapies (including over-the-counter medications) used to treat the signs and symptoms of PN within the prior 2 years will be reported.

Summaries of treatment exposure will also be produced. 8.8 Efficacy Analyses All efficacy endpoints will be s ummarized within the ITT and PP populations using descriptive statistics by time point and treatment. Results including averaged imputed values will be summarized at Baseline, Week 2 (if available), 4, 10 and Follow -up, and the change from baseline for these measures will be summarized at Week 2, 4, 10 and Follow -up. The WI-NRS and change from baseline will also be presented for each study day. 8.8.1 Primary Efficacy The difference in the pr imary efficacy outc ome measure (WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 10) will be tested using a CMH test controlling for the ‘as randomized’ stratification factors. Conceptually t he hypotheses being tested are: H0:PPlacebo ≥ PSerlopitant H a: PPlacebo < PSerlopitant where P Placebo is the percent of placebo responders and P Serlopitant is the similar percent for serlopitant. The primary endpoint will utilize the missing data rules as outlined in Section 8.2. 8.8.2 Key Secondar y Efficacy The differences between treatment groups for the key secondary efficacy endpoint, Week 4 WI-NRS 4-point responder rate , will be the CMH test identical to the one use d for the primary endpoint. The remaining key secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group and stratification factor as fixed effects and the respective baseline values as a covariate. Both least squares means and observed means will be presented. To confirm the assumptions for the ANCOVA model (i.e., that the errors are normally distributed with equal variances), residuals will be examined using the Shapiro- Wilk test. If there is overwh elmingly strong evidence that the assumptions are not satisfied, the data will be rank-transformed prior to submitting to the ANCOVA. Results of the rank- transformed analysis then will be considered the primary analysis; however, results of the non- rank- transformed analysis will also be presented. The preceding tests are to be conducted for the ITT population and the PP populations. 57"

Additional secondary efficacy endpoints otherwise will be analyzed using available data. P-values will be included for descriptive purposes only. 8.9 Sensitivity Analyses 8.9.1 Last Observation Carried Forward In the first set of sensitivity analysis, missing values will be imputed using LOCF. D ata will be imputed using LOCF unless the subject withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or the subject used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, in which case their responder status will be defined as non-responder.

Other study- related documents that may contain confidential participant information (e.g. signed ICFs) will be kept in strict confidence by the investigator and be stored in a secure location with access restricted to the study staff. 9.8 Records and Electronic Case Report Forms All study data except central laboratory, PK, eDiary, photography and ECG data will be recorded in an eCRF system. Data will be entered at the site by the appropriately designated and trained site personnel. All source documents from which eCRF entries are derived should be placed in the subject’s medical records. eCRFs will be completed for every subject screened in the study. 61"
62,page_62,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 2.1 02 July 2018 Page 60 The study monitor will review all eCRFs in detail and will have access to participant medical records, laboratory data, and other source documentation to allow required eCRF fields to be verified by source data. Data consistency and plausibility checks against data entered into the eCRF will be included in the eCRF system. Data corrections can be performed in the eCRFs by the site. For each instance of data modification, the system requires a reason for change. The system keeps a full audit trail of the data values, the date and time of modification, and the electronic signature of the user who performed the change. After a full review of the eCRFs by the study monitor and resolution of any data clarifications, the investigator will review, sign, and approve the subject’s e CRF. All essential documents, source data, clinical records, and laboratory data will be retained by the site in accordance with the ICH E6 guideline and the site’s data retention policies. These records must be available for inspection by the Sponsor, monitor, and regulatory authorities. Further detail regarding data management and eCRFs is included in the Data Management Plan. 9.9 Good Clinical Practices and E thical Study Conduct The study procedures outlined in this protocol will be conducted in accordance with applicable ICH Guidelines, including ICH E6: Good Clinical Practices. As this study is conducted under a US IND, the investigator will also ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice”, as outlined in 21 CFR 312, subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators”, 21 CFR, part 50 and 21 CFR, part 56 are adhered to. The study procedures outlined in this protocol will also be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. 9.10 End of Study Notification The Sponsor will notify appropriate regulatory authorities and the IRB or EC within 90 days from the end of the clinical study. The end of the clinical study is defined as the last study visit for the last subject. 9.11 Publication of R esults All publications (e.g. manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) based on this study or relying on data from this study must be submitted to the Sponsor for review and release before submission for publication. The Sponsor is responsible for final approval of all publications. 9.12 Final Report A clinical trial summary report will be provided to the appropriate regulatory authorities within one year of the end of the clinical study. 62"

Development Phase: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Efficacy object ive: To assess the efficacy of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with prurigo nodularis. Safety objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of repe ated oral doses of serlopitant in adults with prurigo nodularis. Study Design: This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treat ment of pruritus in adults with prurigo nodularis (PN). Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses o f serlopitant 5 mg or placebo for 10 weeks. After completion of the treatment peri od or early discontinuation of study drug treatment, all subjects will ente r a 3- or 5-week follow-up period. The study will consist of three p eriods, for a total study peri od of 15 to 19 weeks:  Screening period: 2-4 weeks  Treatment period: 10 weeks  Follow-up period: 3 or 5 weeks During the screening period, all subjects will undergo eligibil ity evaluation and will be assessed for chronic pr uritic conditions frequently ass ociated with PN. Subjects who present with idiopa thic PN at screening may requir e additional assessments as deemed necessary b y the investigator (e.g. endom ysial antibody with reflex to titer for subjects with signs or symptoms of der matitis herpetiformis, skin biopsy for subjects with signs or symptoms of bullous pemphigoid or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori , or allergy testing). All screening procedures must be completed within 31 days befor e the Baseline visit. The minimum screening period for all subjects is 14 days to allow for collection of electronic diary (e Diary) screening data. Subject s who require a screening period longer than 14 days will have a telephone cont act at least 15 days prior to the scheduled Baseline visit to remind them to co mplete the eDiary as previously instructed at the Screening visit. Subjects will be provided an eDi ary at the Screening visit. Sub jects must be willing and able to complete the e Diary every day within a consistent timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitan t therapies, for the duration of the study. At the Baseline visit (Day 1), e ligible subjects will be random ly assigned to receive study drug (serlopitant 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period (Day 1). Starting on Day 2, subj ects will take one tablet per d ay. Study drug may be taken with or without food. 80"

Subjects who complete the 10-week treatment period and required follow-up period may be given the opportunity to enroll in a one-year ope n-label safety study with daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg. Safety Review: An internal safety monitoring team consisting of representatives from Menlo Therapeutics Inc. and its desi gnees will monitor blinded safety data on a regular basis throughout the study. Planned Sample Size: Approximately 280 subjects will be randomized. Study Population: The study will consist of adult subjects with pruritus associ ated with PN. Inclusion Criteria (Subjects must meet the following criteria t o be randomized into the study): 1. Male or female, age 18 years or older at consent. 2. A diagnosis of PN, defined by the presence of at least ten prur iginous nodules secondary to chronic pruritus present on at least two d ifferent body surface areas (e.g. both arms, one arm and one leg, one arm and the anterior trunk, or anterior and posterior trunk). 3. The worst pruritus is identified to be within the areas of the PN lesions. 4. Subject has idiopathic PN OR the subject has an identified prur itic condition associated with the PN and has persistent pruritus despite at least 6 weeks of optimized a nd stable treatment o f the underlying con dition prior to the Baseline visit, and is willing to continue the treatment during the study. 5. Worst-Itch Numeric Ra ting Scale (WI-NRS) sco re ≥ 7 in the 24-ho ur period prior to the Screening visit. 6. Average weekly WI-NRS score ≥ 6.5 in each o f the 2 weeks (14 da ys) immediately prior to Baseline vi sit, as recorded in the eDiary. 7. All female subjects who are of c hildbearing potential must be w illing to practice highly effective contr aception (i.e., pregnancy prevention method with a failure rate of < 1% per year) from the time of the Screening visit until 5 weeks after last dose of study drug. 8. Willing and able (as demonstrated by a ≥ 70% eDiary completion rate in the two weeks prior to Baseline visit) to complete daily eDiary entries within a consistent timeframe for the duration of the study. 9. Willing and able (has adequate c ognitive ability, in the invest igator’s opinion) to comply with study visits and study related requirem ents including providing written informed consent. Exclusion Criteria (Subjects who meet any of the following crit eria are not eligible for participation in the study): 1. Prior treatment with serlopitant. 2. Active pruritic skin disease, other than PN, within 6 months pr ior to randomization (with the exception of acute dermatoses such as c ontact dermatitis, sunburn, viral exanthem, which have been resolved f or longer than 4 weeks). 3.

Study Drug: Serlopitant 5 mg oral tablets and matching placebo. Dosage: Serlopitant: 5 mg once daily by mouth for 10 weeks, fo llowing a 3-tablet loading dose on the first day of the treatment period. Matching placebo: Once daily by mouth for 10 weeks, following a 3-tablet loading dose on the first day of the treatment period. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy end point is the WI-NRS 4-point responder r ate at Week 10. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The key secondary efficacy e ndpoints are as follows:  WI-NRS 4-point respo nder rate at Week 4  Change from baseline in Dermato logy Life Quality Index (DLQI) t o Week 10 Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  Change from baseline in WI-NRS to other timepoints  WI-NRS 4-point respo nder rate at Week 2  WI-NRS 3-point responder rate at Weeks 2, 4 and 10  Change from baseline in Investig ator’s Global Assessment of PN Activity to Weeks 2, 4 and 10  Change from baseline in Investig ator’s Global Assessment of PN Stage to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 Safety Endpoints: Safety e ndpoints are as follows:  Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adve rse events (SAEs)  Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters followi ng study drug exposure  Changes from baseline in vital si gn and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters following study drug exposure  Changes from baseline in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Sc ale (HADS)  Changes from baseline in the E pworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Decision Rule and Sample Size: This study will use a 5% two-sid ed alpha level.

Efficacy Analyses: The primary efficacy end point is a binary variable taking on va lues of responder or non-responder. Subjects will be considered a responder if th ey have at least a 4-point reduction in WI-NRS betwe en baseline and Week 10. Missi ng data imputation will be used for subj ects who fail to complete the eDiary at Week 10, unless the subject with drew from the study d ue to a lack of eff icacy, or the subject used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, in which case their responder status will be defined as non-responder. T he primary endpoint will be summarized with d escriptive statistics by trea tment group and study week. The difference in the primary e fficacy outcome measure between treatment groups will be tested using a Cochran Mantel Haenszel test cont rolling for the stratification factor s. Testing of the key secondary efficacy e ndpoints will also be employed. Safety Analyses: The incidence of all adverse events (AEs) and treatment-related AEs will be tabulated by treatment received. These AEs will be classified b y system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regul atory Activities. For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class o r preferred term, the subject w ill be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An overview of AEs, which includes subject inc idence of AEs, tr eatment-related AEs, AEs by severity, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, wil l be presented.

Confidential Protocol MTI-106 Version 3.0/21 March 2019 Page 16 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Pruritus in Prurigo Nodularis Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a dist inctive and easily diagnosable chronic skin condition characterized by the presence of m ultiple highly pruritic and o ften symmetrically distributed nodules and papules on the skin ( Jorizzo 1981 ). The nodules and papules in PN can range in size from approximately 0.5 to 3.0 cm and often appear hyperker atotic, sometimes crateriform, in appearance. Pla ques are occasionally present, and the lesions of PN frequently exhibit other features secondary to prolonged and severe scratc hing behavior, such as post- inflammatory hyperpigmentation, erosion, ulceration, crusting, and bleeding (Zeidler 2016). PN, a long-term reaction to the chronic scratching and picking of patients with chronic pruritus ( Zeidler 2016 ), is a skin condition seen pre dominantly in older adults, with median prevalence age in the 50s and 60s and a slight female preponderance (Iking 2013, Tan 2014 , Ständer 2013) . In one patient population survey, pediatric patients accounte d for <2% of the total population, with the younge st patient 11.9 years of age ( Iking 2013). Although only limited epidemiology data for PN have been published, a claims- based analysis commissioned by Menlo Therapeutic s suggest that the United States (US) prevalence may be in the range of ~ 355,000 affect ed individuals. Based on a quan titative survey of 73 dermatologists conducted in par allel with the claims-based analysis, approximately 23% of patients with PN have an und erlying atopy-related condit ion, while over 50% are considered to be idiopathic (Navigant 2017 ). The median duration of di sease burden has been reported to be 6-7 years ( Iking 2013, Tan 2014 , Schuhknecht 2011 ). The dominant symptom in PN is an intense and chronic pruritus t hat is associated with a high degree of patient burden and restr icted quality of life (QOL) ( Zeidler 2016 ). As measured by global scales of pruritus intensity (numeric rating scale (NRS) and visual analog scale (VAS)), median levels of pruritus intensity have been reported to be 7-8 points ( Iking 2013, Tan 2014 , Schuhknecht 2011 ). The pruritus experienced i n PN can often prevent patients from adequately performing t heir daily activities ( Vaidya 2008), and patients with PN have been found to suffer from greater rates of depression and anxie ty than control groups in numerous studies ( Jorgensen 2016, Rowland Payne 1985, Dazzi 2011 ). 1.2 Conditions Associated With Prurigo Nodularis As PN is considered to be a di sease induced by chronic pruritus and ongoing scratching activity, a variety of chronic pruritic conditions have been identified as potent ial underlying etiologies for the pr uritus, including atopi c dermatitis (AD), other inflammatory or bullous skin diseases, chronic renal fa ilure, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis C infection, and multifactorial di sease (i.e. two or more co-ex istent conditions associated with chronic pruritus) ( Fostini 2013, Lee 2005 ). The mechanism s linking chronic pruritus to the development of PN are not clear, as only a subset of patien ts with chronic pruritus develop PN, and over half of patie nts with PN have no underlyin g etiology identified. Even when specific underlying conditions are identifie d, management of these condition(s) does not usually result in resolution of PN signs or symptoms, nor can all underlying conditions be treated. For example, PN has been observed in patients with HIV adequately managed with 92"
93,page_93,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI-106 Version 3.0/21 March 2019 Page 17 highly active antiretrovi ral therapy (HAART) (Zancanaro 2006 ), in patients wit h intractable cholestatic pruritus (Bergasa 2011), in patients with inactive hepatitis ( Halvorsen 2015), and commonly in patients with renal fa ilure despite hemodialysis th erapy ( Goeksel 2013). These data point to a high level of unme t medical need in the overall PN population, as the majority of patients with PN either have no underlying condition identif ied that can be treated, or treatment of the underlying conditi on is inadequate to control their PN ( Wallengren 2004 ). 1.3 Current Treatment Options for Prurigo Nodularis Treatment of PN remains a chal lenging and extremely frustrating experience for both patients and physicians. In the majority of cases, responses are limited and unsatisfactory, and once the cycle of pruritus-excoriati on-pruritus begins, it is diffic ult to stop. Identification and treatment of underlying chronic pruritic conditions is often th e first step in management of PN. If this does not result in r esolution of the pruritus, or i f no underlying condition is identified, treatment specifical ly for PN and its associated pr uritus is implemented. First-line pruritus therapies, including topical agents such as topical cortico steroids and calcineurin inhibitors, often provide inadequate response ( Saco 2015) and the therapeutic ladder for PN involves systemic agents with progressively riski er safety profiles. These include naltrexone, gabapentin, m irtazapine, phototherapy, intr avenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), powerful immunosuppressants such as methotrexate and cyclosporine, and thalidomide ( Ständer 2015b, Spring 2014, Feldmeyer 2012 , Lim 2016 ). None of these therapies are indicated for the treatment of PN, and their usage is often based on limited evidence, such as case reports or small open-label studies. 1.4 Substance P and the Neurokinin-1 Receptor Repeated itching, scratching, and picking over long time period s serve as the pathophysiological basis for th e development of PN. Although different underlying disease states may be responsible for t he chronic pruritus, the distinctive and easily recognizable features of PN point to a common f inal pathway resulting in this unique clinical presentation. Immunohistochemical staining st udies of PN biopsies have demons trated that nerve fibers immunoreactive for Substance P (SP) are found in increased numb ers in lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin or controls (Abadía Molina 1992 ), suggesting a role for SP signaling in PN. These findings are consistent with the robust body of evidence indicating the key role of SP signaling through i ts primary receptor, the neur okinin-1 receptor (NK 1-R), in the transmission of itch across multiple disease states ( Santini 2012, Akiyama 2015 , Crowe 1994, El-Nour 2006, Lotts 2014, Hon 2007, Ward 2004 , Slattery 2011 ). SP is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, a group that also includes neuroki nin A and neurokinin B ( Hökfelt 2001). SP has been implicated in a number of biological functions , both physiological and pathophy siological, including pruritus perception, vomiting reflex, pai n perception, and immunomodulat ory responses ( Lotts 2014, Andoh 1998, Steinhoff 2014 ). The biological actions of SP are mediated by tachykinin receptors, which consist of seven hydrophobic transmembrane dom ains coupled to G- proteins. Three tachykinin recepto rs have been identified: the neurokinin-1, neurokinin-2, 93"
94,page_94,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI-106 Version 3.0/21 March 2019 Page 18 and neurokinin-3 receptors ( Harrison 2001). The NK 1-R in particular has been studied in great detail. NK 1-R is the primary receptor for SP in the human body, and is fou nd on multiple cell types, include central and peripheral neurons, ke ratinocytes, and mast cells. NK 1-R stimulation has been shown t o be an important pathway for pr uritus perception (Ständer 2015a ). Inhibition of this pathway res ults in decreased pruritus and scratching reflexes in animal models (Akiyama 2015 ). Preceding the development of serlopitant for pruritus-related conditions, a commercially available NK 1-R antagonist ( Emend USPI ) has been used as a therapy to decrea se pruritus in patients with ch ronic pruritus due to etiologies such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( Duval 2009, Torres 2012 , Booken 2011) and erlotinib-induced pruritus ( Santini 2012, Gerber 2010). Additionally, in a study of 20 patients with chronic pruritus of various e tiologies treat ed with aprepi tant, 16/20 patients (80%) experienced a considerable reduction of itch intensity (Ständer 2010). 1.5 Serlopitant 1.5.1 Serlopitant Background and Nonclinical Summary Serlopitant is a small molecule, highly selective NK 1-R antagonist that is administered orally and metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with a plasma half-life of 45-86 hours. It binds with high affinity to the human NK 1-R with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 46 pM; displacing SP binding with a half-maximal inhibition con centration (IC 50) of 61 pM. Serlopitant is a potent functi onal antagonist of SP-induced ino sitol phosphate generation. Serlopitant has been extensivel y studied in animal toxicology studies, including chronic toxicology and carcinogenicity s tudies. In non-clinical chronic toxicology studies in rats, mice and dogs, treatment related findings of potential clinical significance inc luded increased salivation, decrease d body weight gain and food consumption, sl ight changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters , mild increases in liver weig ht and mild histomorphologic changes. The hi stomorphologic changes were see n only in rats (not in dogs or mice) and included: very sli ght ovarian inte rstitial cell hy pertrophy, mammary gland and uterine atrophy; decreased corpor a lutea; increased histiocytes in lung and mesenteric lymph nodes; slight skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration; slight increased hematopoiesis in bone marrow; and slight to modera te vacuolation in kidney tubul es. These nonclinical findings occurred at systemic e xposures exceeding those anticip ated to provide efficacy of serlopitant for pruritus indications in humans (1 to 5 mg table t daily). No cardiac lesions have been observed in dog toxicity studies up to 9 months in duratio n nor in a 3-month mouse range-finding study and 2-year m ouse carcinogenicity study at e xposure higher than the lowest level which caused car diotoxicity in rats. The no observ ed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats for histomorphol ogical changes in the reproductive tract, mammary gland and bone marrow provides a 2.5-fold margin for the maximum-targ eted exposure (5 mg tablet daily). The rat NOAEL for histomorphological changes in muscle and kidney provides a 5-fold margin for the maximum -targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily).

Single doses up to 400 mg have been well tolerated in young adult males and single doses up to 25 mg have been well tolerated in the elderly. Multiple doses of up to 50 mg a day for 4 weeks have been well tolerated in heal thy young males, and a single (loading) d ose of 15 mg followed by daily doses of 5 mg for 2 weeks have been well tolerated in elderly m ales and females. Forty-one (41) subjects received 4 mg liquid filled capsule (LFC) daily ( bioequivalent to 5 mg tablets) for 1 year. Plasma concentrations of serlop itant appear to increase in a do se-proportional fashion in both young males and elderly subjects (males and fem ales). Peak plasma concentrations after a single oral dose occurr ed at ~2 to 4 hou rs in both young and elderly subjects. A single loading dose of up to 15 mg followed by 6 to 8 weeks of up to 5 mg daily doses has been well tolerated in adults with chronic pruritus a nd PN. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrate good plasma exposures with ora l dosing, linear dose- dependent increases in plasma c oncentration and systemic exposu re, a plasma t1/2 appropriate for once daily dosing, and mild effects of concomit ant food ingestion. Central nervous system (CNS) positron emission tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated good CNS penetrance and > 90% NK1 receptor occupancy (RO) at plasma exposures anticipated to be safe and well tolerated. Three long-lived active hydroxyl ated metabolites are observed in humans: M1/M1a , M2/M2a , and M3 . These metabolites were present at lower concentrations and were 2- to 9-fold less potent in vivo than the parent compound. The integrated pharmacokinetic/p harmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis concluded that these metabolites are unlikely to contr ibute significantly to occupancy of the CNS NK 1-R in humans. 1.5.3 Serlopitant in Pruritus-Related Studies Serlopitant has been evaluated i n two completed Phase 2 studies of subjects with chronic pruritus (TCP-101 and TCP-102). TCP-101 TCP-101 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center st udy that compared serlopitant 0.25 mg, 1 mg, or 5 mg v s. placebo for the treatmen t of chronic pruritus. A total of 257 adult subjects 18-65 years of age with chronic pruritus were randomized to receive one of the four dose groups in a 1:1:1:1 randomization. Subject s received a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 and thereafter received 1 tablet per day for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was itch severity as measured on a VAS, summarized as a percentage change from baseline. Mean percent decreases from Base line in VAS score were larger i n the active-treatment groups versus placebo at every sch eduled post-baseline study vi sit. Overall, the results were the most profound for the serlopitant 1 mg and 5 mg groups. For the percent change from Baseline in VAS pruritus scores (the primary efficacy variable), the Week 6 pairwise least 95 CCI CCI CCI"

The frequency of treatment-emerg ent adverse events (TEAEs) and study drug related adverse events (AEs) was higher in the serlopitant 1 mg and 5 mg groups compared to the serlopitant 0.25 mg group, and the frequency in all three treatment groups were higher than in the placebo group. The frequency of A Es leading to study drug disco ntinuation was comparable in the serlopitant 5 mg and placebo group and higher than in th e serlopitant 0.25 mg and 1 mg groups. There was one serious adverse event (SAE) reported in the serlopitant 1 mg group (spontaneous abortion, consid ered not related). There wer e no deaths. The most common AEs in the serlopitant gr oups were diarrhea (6.2%, 1 mg group), upper respiratory tract infection (4.7%, 0.25 mg group), somnolence (4.7%, 5 mg g roup), nasopharyngitis (4.6%, 1 mg group), headache (4.7 %, 5 mg group), urinary tract infection (3.1%, 5 mg group), dry mouth (3.1%, 1 mg group), nausea (3.1%, 1 mg group) , arthralgia (3.1%, 0.25 mg group), musculoskeletal pain (3.1%, 1 mg group) and pruritus (3.1%, 1 mg group). The most common AEs in the pl acebo group were h eadache (6.3%), nasopharyngitis (3.2%), upper respiratory trac t infection (3.2%), urinary tract infecti on (3.2%) and asthma (3.2%). TCP-102 TCP-102 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled mult i-center study that evaluated serlopitant 5 mg vs. pl acebo for the treatment of PN. A total of 128 adult subjects 18-80 years of age with PN were randomized to receive serlopita nt or placebo in a 1:1 randomization. Subjects receive d a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 followed by 1 tablet per day for 8 weeks. The primar y efficacy endpoint was the average VAS score as recorded at the study visits. Results at Week 4 and Week 8 were the prim ary timepoints. Serlopitant 5 mg was superior t o placebo for the reduction of p ruritus as measured by change in average VAS from baseline. For the primary endpoint, change from baseline at Week 4 and Week 8 by repeated measures ana lysis, the decrease from baseline was significantly greater in the serlopitant group than the placebo group, with a mean difference (serlopitant minus placebo) of -1.0 at Week 4 and -1.7 at Week 8. The mean d ifference at Week 2 was also significant, -0.9. In a post- hoc analysis of the percentag e of subjects who were 4-point responders on average VAS at Week 8, 25.0% of placebo subjects and 54.4% of serlopitant subjects were 4-point responders. TEAEs were reported for 71.9% of ser lopitant-treated subjects a nd 61.9% of placebo-treated subjects. The most frequently r eported TEAEs in the serlopitant group were nasopharyngitis (17.2% serlopitant, 3.2% placebo), diarrhea (10.9% serlopitant, 4.8% placebo), and fatigue (9.4% serlopitant, 6.3% placebo). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 48.4% of serlopitant-treated subjects and 34.9% of placebo-treated subje cts. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in the serlopitant group were fatigue (7.8%) and diarrhea, peripheral edema, dizziness, a nd headache (each 6.3%). Most TEA Es were mild or moderate; severe TEAEs were reported for 9.4% of serlopitant-treated subj ects and 4.8% of placebo-treated subjects. There were no deaths during the study . Five subjects (3 serlopitant, 2 placebo) had SAEs. The SAEs were actinic elastosis, depressio n, dizziness, and vertigo in 96"

Nine subjects (3 serlopitant, 6 placebo) dis continued due to TEAEs. No clinically relevant change s were observed in chemistry, hematology, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Potential Risks and Benefits: Th e results of the Phase 2 studie s in PN and chronic pruritus, together with the extensive nonc linical and clinic al safety data and experience with serlopitant to date and the sc ientific rationale for NK 1-R inhibition in the treatment of pruritus, serve to support furthe r evaluation of serlopitant fo r the treatment of pruritus in patients with PN. The potential benefits of continued clinical study outweigh the potential risks. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for further in formation regarding serlopitant. 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES The efficacy objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with PN. The safety objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in adults with PN. 3 STUDY DESIGN 3.1 Overall Study Design This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant f or the treatment of pruritus in adults with PN. The study will be conducted at approximately 50 study sites. Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to r eceive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo for 10 weeks. After completion of the treatment period or early dis continuation of study drug treatment, all subjects will en ter a 3 or 5-week follow-up peri od. The required follow-up period is defined as a minimum of 3 weeks for those subjects wh o will enroll in the one-year open-label safety study (MTI-107) on the date of the follow-up visit, and as 5 weeks for those subjects who will not be enrolled in the one-year open-la bel safety study of serlopitant. Should a subject present for the follow-up visit prior to 5 wee ks after the last dose of study drug and be excluded from particip ation in the one-year study f or any reason, the subject will be required to return at 5 week s after the last dose of study drug for a complete follow-up visit. This study will consist of three periods, for a total study per iod of 15-19 weeks: • Screening period: 2-4 weeks • Treatment period: 10 weeks • Follow-up period: 3 or 5 weeks 97"
98,page_98,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI-106 Version 3.0/21 March 2019 Page 22 Informed consent will occur prior to any protocol-mandated proc edures, including the stopping of any excluded therapies. This may occur prior to the Screening visit. During the screening period, all subjects will undergo eligibil ity evaluation and will be assessed for chronic pruritic c onditions frequently associated with PN. Subjects who present with idiopathic PN at screeni ng may require additional assessme nts as deemed necessary by the investigator (e.g. endomy sial antibody with reflex to titer for subjects with signs or symptoms of dermatitis herpet iformis, skin biopsy for subjects with signs or symptoms of bullous pemphigoid or cutaneous T -cell lymphoma, urea breath te st for Helicobacter pylori , or allergy testing). All screening procedures must be completed within 31 days befor e the Baseline visit. The minimum screening period for a ll subjects is 14 days to allow f or collection of electronic diary (eDiary) screening data . Subjects who require screening p eriod longer than 14 days will have a telephone contact at least 15 days prior to the schedule d Baseline visit to remind them to complete the eDiary as previ ously instructed at the Screenin g visit. Screening procedures may be deferred following discussion with the medical monitor should more than 31 days be required ( e.g. to wash out of certain excluded therapies or to treat their underlying condition). Screening procedures may be repea ted (i.e., the subject may be rescreened) following discussion with the medical mon itor should the subject have had difficulty complying with eDiary assessments, require fur ther training in the assessments , or have other relevant needs that may delay enrollment in t he study but are not expected to impact safety or efficacy assessments. Subjects will be provided an eDi ary at the Screening visit. Sub jects must be willing and able to complete the eDiary every da y within a consistent timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapi es, for the duration of the stu dy. At the Baseline visit (Day 1), e ligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (serlopitant 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loadin g dose (3 tablets taken orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period (Day 1). S tarting on Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day. Study dr ug may be taken with or withou t food. The primary efficacy endpoint wil l be assessed at Week 10 of tr eatment. Subjects who complete the 10-week treatment period and required follow-up period may be given the opportunity to enroll i n a one-year open-label safety study (MTI-107) with daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg. 3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Selection In the TCP-102 study in patients with PN, serlopitant 5 mg taken daily for 8 weeks was superior to placebo for the re duction of pruritus, in both the overall study population as well as the subgroup of subjects with a n atopic diathesis. Similarly , in the TCP-101 study in 98"
99,page_99,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI-106 Version 3.0/21 March 2019 Page 23 patients with chronic pruritus, serlopitant 5 mg and 1 mg taken daily for 6 weeks were superior to placebo for the re duction of pruritus, in both the overall study population and the subgroup of subjects with a n atopic diathesis. In both the TCP-102 and TCP-101 studi es, serlopitant was genera lly well-tolerated and demonstrated an overall favorable safety profile at the doses e valuated. The current MTI-106 study is designed to confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in patients with PN. The 5 mg dose of serlopitant was selected for this study based on the favorable efficacy, safety , and tolerability profile of serlopitant at this dose level. O ver 250 subjects have been exp osed to serlopitant at doses of 5 mg tablet-equivalent dail y for at least 6 weeks, and ~ 40 subjects have been exposed up to one year. Human CNS PET RO data for serlopitant in healthy youn g males (Study P002) demonstrated that a serlopita nt 5 mg LFC once daily dose is lik ely to achieve ~ 94% NK 1 RO at steady state. 3.3 Study Endpoints 3.3.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is th e Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) 4-point responder rate at Week 10. 3.3.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  WI-NRS 4-point respon der rate at Week 4  Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) t o Week 10 3.3.3 Additional Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: • Change from baseline in W I-NRS to other timepoints • WI-NRS 4-point respon der rate at Week 2 • WI-NRS 3-point responder rate at Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Investig ator’s Global Assessment of PN Activity (IGA PN-A) to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Investig ator’s Global Assessment of PN Stage (IGA PN-S) to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 3.3.4 Safety Endpoints Safety endpoints are as follows: 99"

Investigators should make every effort to contact the Sponsor or designee befo re discontinuing study drug treatme nt, if possible. Subjects who discontinue treatment with study drug prior to com pleting the treatment period will enter a 5-week follow-up period following the last dose of study drug in addition to a Follow-up visit (see Section 3.1, Section 6.5.10). Every effort should be made for subjects to complete the Follow-up visit afte r a subject has discontinued f rom study drug. 5.7 Prior, Concomitant, and Excluded Therapies Prior therapies (including over-the-counter medications) used t o treat the signs and symptoms of PN within the prior 2 years will be recorded for ea ch subject at the Baseline visit. Concomitant therapies include a ny therapies (including over-the -counter medications and bland emollients) used by a subject from initiation of study drug treatment through the follow-up period. A record of all medications used will be maintained for each subject throughout the study. Reported information will include a descr iption of the type of drug, treatment period, dosing regimen, t he route of administration, and drug indication. The use of any concomitant medication must re late to the subject’s medical history or to an AE, except for vitamins/nutritional supplements, emollient use, and routin e preventative immunizations. 5.7.1 Allowed Therapies and Treatment Goals for Underlying Conditions Treatment of an underlying, treatab le chronic pruritic conditio n is allowed, if stable for at least 6 weeks prior t o the Baseline visit, and continued throug hout the treatment period. Treatment of the underlying systemic pruritic condition should be optimized per standard of care and treatment goals must be tailored based on age, sex, and concurrent health status and drug tolerance. While resoluti on of metabolic or endocrine diso rders or eradication of an underlying infection may not alway s be feasible, every effort s hould be made to ensure the condition is well controlled, to prevent or reduce exacerbation s and to prevent limitation on the activities of daily living. Wh en applicable, laboratory evi dence of control should be obtained. For example, if renal in sufficiency is implicated as causal for pruritus, treatment would be expected to have meaningfu lly reduced the creatinine ( compared to that at the time of diagnosis) and to maintain th e creatinine at < 2.5 the ULN; control of diabetes is supported by a hemoglobin-A1c of < 7.5%; control of thyroid disease is su pported by normalization of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or by a TSH within 1.5 ti mes the ULN in elderly patients; iron deficiency is corr ected with a serum iron within 0.8 times the lower limit of normal; eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection generally require s a negative urea breath 104"

Any previously active skin disease is considered to be well controlled if it is globally considered clear or almost clear (permissi ble to have post-inflammatory pigmentation, fine scale, faint pink erythema, barely perceptible induration/papulation, and no oozing or crusting). Use of gentle cleansers and bla nd emollients (including those w ith urea) is encouraged for all subjects. If bland emollient use is elected, it must be initiated at least 2 weeks (14 days) prior to Baseline visit, and continue d throughout the treatment period. Treatment with non-systemic corticosteroids or antihistamines t hat do not involve skin application (e.g. inhaled, intranasal, ophthalmic, or intra-art icular) is allowed. Leukotriene inhibitors will be permitted for treatment of condi tions other than PN (e.g. asthma). 5.7.2 Excluded Therapies Initiation or use of topical therapy with corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, calcipotriene, PDE-4 inhibitors is not permitted within 4 weeks prior to the B aseline visit or throughout the treatment period, but such thera py may be initiated during the follow-up period if needed. Initiation of bland emollient is not permitted within 2 weeks ( 14 days) prior to Baseline visit or throughout the treatment pe riod, but such therapy may be initiated during the follow-up period if needed. The following therapies and activit ies are excluded from the Screening visit through the treatment period, and through the follow-up period: • NK 1-R antagonists (oth er than study drug) • Systemic immunosuppressive/ immuno modulatory therapies (includi ng but not limited to systemic corticosteroids, PDE-4 inhibitors, cyclosporine, mycop henolate-mofetil, methotrexate, azathioprine, thali domide, interferon-gamma, or p hototherapy) • Biologic therapies (other than t herapies such a s insulins, vaccines) • Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (See Appendix B ) • Use of an indoor tanning facility, or natural sun exposure resu lting in significant tanning or sunburn • Any investigational therapy The following therapies and activit ies are excluded from the Screening visit through the treatment period, and use is discouraged, though permitted, thr ough the follow-up period: 105"

However, should rescue therapy be required for the safety and w ell-being of the subject, such use will be recorded and analyzed (see Section 8.2 ). The subject may remain on study drug, unless the rescue therapy is an NK 1-R antagonist, a systemic biologic therapy, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, an investigatio nal therapy, or any therapy th at may jeopardize the subject’s safety if study drug i s continued, in the investigato r’s and/or Sponsor’s opinion. 5.8 Assignment to Treatment 5.8.1 Randomization Eligible subjects will be randomi zed to receive serlopitant 5 m g or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Stratified permuted block randomization will be used. Randomiza tion will be stratified by the subject’s reported WI-NRS score for the 1-week period prior to the Baseline visit (6.5 to < 9, 9 to 10). An IWRS will be used to perform the randomization. 5.8.2 Blinding This study will be conducted as a double-blind study with the t reatment assignment concealed from the subjects, the investigators and their staff, the Sponsor, and any designees of the Sponsor as required. The placebo will be formulated to b e indistinguishable from the active study product. Study materials will be packaged and issu ed in a manner designed to maintain the blind for subjects and all study personnel involve d in the direction and execution of study procedures, study assessments, and collectio n of data. The randomization code for each subject will be ava ilable to the sites for use on ly in an emergency situation.

Subjects will record in the eDiary the doses administered, as well as whether a dose was taken with in 2 hours of eating a meal. Subje cts will be asked to return all partially used and empty bottles to the study site at each visi t. The site staff will count and record the number of remaining tablets in each returned bottle. The site staff will review the subject’s eDiary to help evalu ate compliance with dosing at eac h study visit. Discrepancies between compliance as assessed by tablet counts and doses recor ded in the eDiary will be reconciled and documented. Dosing dates and times will be recor ded. A subject who has deviated significantly from the once-daily dosing regimen will be counseled. 6 STUDY SCHEDULE AND ASSESSMENTS When applicable, efficacy and safety instruments will be provid ed with instructions for administration, in study-specific manuals for site reference. 6.1 Efficacy Parameters 6.1.1 Itch Numeric Rating Scale The Itch NRS is a validated, self -reported instrument for measu rement of itch intensity. It uses a 24-hour recall period and ask s subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) t o 10 (worst itch imaginable). H igher scores indicate greater itch intensity. In this study, the subject is asked to rate the intensity of their worst itch (WI-NRS) during a 24-hour recall period; the questionnaire is p rovided in Appendix C . Initial WI-NRS score collecte d during Screening visit will be c ollected on paper. All subsequent WI-NRS assessments w ill be reported by subject via e Diary. Subjects will record their WI-NRS scores once daily v ia eDiary at approximately the same time each day (+/- 3 hours) throughout the screen ing, treatment, and follow-u p periods, as outlined in Appendix A . Subjects may be allowed to adjus t the timing of eDiary comple tion within the first week of Screening as need ed. Standardized training and in structions will be provided to all subjects prior to eDiary use. 6.1.2 Investigator’s Global Asse ssment of PN Activity The IGA PN-A is an instrument used to assess the overall activity of PN lesions at a given time point, as determined by the i nvestigator. It consists of a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), as provided in Appendix D . The IGA PN-A uses clinical characteristics of excoriations , crusting, and/or bleeding as g uidelines for the overall activity assessment. The number of prurig inous lesions should not be considered for this assessment. IGA PN-A scores will be captured as outlined in Appendix A . Each assessment during the study must be done by the Principal Investigator (PI) or design ee. Every effort should be made to ensure that all assessm ents for a given subject are don e by the same individual throughout the study. However, a change in assessor for a given subject, though not ideal, will not be considered a protocol deviation. 107"

It consists of a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), as provided in Appendix D . The IGA-PN-S uses clinical characteristics of number of nodul es and their thickness as guidelines for the overall severity assessment. IGA-PN-S scores will be captured as outlined in Appendix A . Each assessment during the study must be done by the PI or designee. Every effo rt should be made to ensure that all assessments for a given subject are done by the same i ndividual throughout the study. However, a change in assesso r for a given subject, though not i deal, will not be considered a protocol deviation. 6.1.4 Dermatology Life Quality Index Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a dermatology specific QOL instrument designed to assess the impact of the s kin disease on a subject’s QOL ove r the prior week. It is a ten- item questionnaire that assesses overall QOL and six aspects that may affect QOL (symptoms and feelings, daily ac tivities, leisure , work or scho ol performance, personal relationships, and treatment), and is provided in Appendix E . The DLQI questionnaire will be collected as outlined in Appendix A. 6.1.5 PN Photographs At selected investiga tive sites, optional phot ographs of repres entative areas with PN involvement will be taken at multiple time points, as outlined in Appendix A . These areas may include the extensor surfaces of both arms and both legs (o verview of both legs, detail of lower legs), and the abdomen and back. The central photograp hy vendor will provide photographic equipment to the s ites for use during the study. T he PI and designees will be trained on the use of the camera and the appropriate lighting a nd positioning of the representative area with PN i nvolvement. Detailed instructions will be provided in the Photography manual. 6.2 Safety Parameters Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording pro tocol-defined AEs and SAEs; vital signs; physical examinati ons; clinical laboratory assessm ents; ECGs; and other protocol-specified tests that ar e deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug as outlined in Appendix A . 6.2.1 Vital Signs Vital signs will include measurements of heart rate, blood pres sure, respiration rate, and temperature after the subject h as been calmly resting (seated or supine) for a minimum of 5 minutes.

An AE can be any unfavo rable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temp orally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 119"
120,page_120,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI-106 Version 3.0/21 March 2019 Page 44 AEs include treatment emergent exacerbations of pre-existing il lnesses and AEs t hat occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions. 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event An AE is considered “serious” if it results in any of the follo wing outcomes: • Death • Life-threatening AE (i.e. the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is not “life-threatening”) • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Persistent or significant incap acity or substant ial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • Congenital anomaly/ birth defect • Important medical event (i.e. an event that may not result in d eath, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization, b ut which may be considered serious by the investigator or Sponsor, as it may jeopardize th e subject and may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emerg ency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions t hat do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The following are not considered SAEs: a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours that does no t result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event ), an elective surgery planned prior to signing consent, admission as per protocol for pla nned medical/surgical procedur e, and/or routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g. routine colonoscopy). The terms “severe” and “serious ” are not synonymous. Severity r efers to the intensity of an AE (e.g. mild, moderate, or sever e pain); the event itself may be of minor medical significance (e.g. severe back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. Seriousness (not severity) serve s as the basis for defining reg ulatory reporting obligations. Severity and seriousness shoul d be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on the eCRF. 120"
121,page_121,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI-106 Version 3.0/21 March 2019 Page 45 7.1.3 Abnormal Physical Exam, Laboratory, Vital Sign, and Electrocardiogram Findings Abnormal physical exam findings tha t are clinically significant and are identified prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history. New or worsening clinically significant abnormal physical exa m findings identified after th e first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. Only abnormal laboratory, vital si gn, and ECG findings that are considered clinically significant by the investigator ( e.g. require active management or are associated with accompanying symptoms/signs) will be recorded as medical histor y or AEs on the eCRF. Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur pr ior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medi cal history, and abnormal findin gs that occur af ter the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. If the clinically significant l aboratory, vital sign, or ECG ab normality is a sign associated with a confirmed disease or condi tion (e.g. elevated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with chronic kidney disease), only t he diagnosis (chronic kidney dis ease) needs to be recorded on the AE eCRF (rather than listing individual test findings as AE s). Separate instances of the same c linically significant laboratory, vital sign, or ECG abnormality across visits should not be recorded as separate AE s or SAEs. 7.1.4 Deaths Any deaths that occur from the time of informed consent to the follow-up visit, regardless of attribution, must be reported w ithin 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of the death. See Safety Form Completion Instructi ons for complete instructions. The Sponsor should be provided a copy of any post-mortem findings and/or relevant medical reports, including histopathology. 7.1.5 Pregnancies and Contraception Requirements for Females For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potent ial is defined as any female who has experienced menarche a nd is pre-menopausal, unless perm anently surgically sterile (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral sa lpingectomy, bilateral oophore ctomy). A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses fo r 12 months without an alternative medical cause in a previously menstruating female. For the purposes of this study, acceptable contraception is def ined below based on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals: ICH M3(R2) dated January 2010, and other available guidelines ( “U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use” 2010; “Recommendations related to contra ception and pregnancy testing in clinical t rials” 2014; “M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals” 2010 ): 121"

Hormonal contraception associat ed with consistent inhibition of ovulation; these may include (but are not necessarily l imited to) oral, intravaginal, implantable, injectable, or transdermal delivery methods 4. Intrauterine device/system 5. Exclusive (sole) monogamous intercourse with a sterilized (i.e. , vasectomized) or otherwise non-fertile (e.g., cas trated) male partner; the male partner must have received medical assessment of the surgical success Progesterone-only oral contraceptiv es are excluded as a highly effective method of contraception, as they do not cons istently inhib it ovulation. M ale or female condoms with or without spermicide, and female caps, diaphragms, and sponges wi th spermicide, or combinations (double barrier) ar e also excluded as highly effec tive contraceptive methods. Any pregnancy occurring in a female subject or the female partn er of a male subject, from the first study drug administrat ion through the required follow -up visit must be reported within 24 hours of the investigat or’s awareness of the pregnanc y. See Safety Form Completion Instructions for complete instructions. The investigator will follow t he pregnancy to delivery or other pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy in a female clinical t rial subject or female partner of a male clinical trial subject is not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies (for examp le, spontaneous abortion) may qualify as SAEs and should be r eported as such even if they occur after the Follow-up visit. Any congenital anomalies/ birth defects must be recorded and reported as SAEs. See Safety Form Completion Instructi ons for complete instructions. 7.1.6 Worsening of Pruritus or PN Pruritus or PN should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if consi dered by the investigator to have worsened in severity beyond the subject’s typical fluctuat ions. It is important to include a description of the nature of the unexpected worsening when re cording the AE or SAE (e.g. new PN lesions in previously uninvolved skin). 122"

AEs and SAEs will be recorded from the first study drug adminis tration through the follow-up visit. After the re quired follow-up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug- related should be reported. After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by the investigator to be caused by a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure-related SAEs should only be reported on the source documents and SAE form, not on the AE eCRF. Subjects who undergo screening pro cedures but are not randomize d into the study will not have SAEs recorded in t he clinical database. 7.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events Investigators will seek infor mation on AEs and SAEs at each subject contact through the follow-up visit. All AEs and SAEs, whether reported by the subj ect or noted by authorized study personnel, will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF page, and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality. 7.2.3 Assessment of Severity All AEs entered into the eCRF w ill be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for A dverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 (“Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)” 2010 ) to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event. If the AE cannot be found in the eve nt-specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria, the investigator should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Table 1 . 123"

Confidential Protocol MTI-106 Version 3.0/21 March 2019 Page 48 Table 1 Adverse Event Grading Grade Severity Alternate Descriptiona 1 Mild (apply event-specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 2 Moderate (apply event-specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL b) 3 Severe (apply event-specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL c 4 Very severe, life threatening, or disabling (apply event-specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 5 Death related to AE a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 even ts when the observed or reported AE is not in the NCI CTCAE listing. A semi- colon indicates ‘or’ within the alternate description of the grade. b Instrumental ADL refer to prepar ing meals, shopping for groceri es or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. c Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feedin g self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. Source: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria f or Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 Note that severity, a measure of intensity, is not equivalent t o seriousness, a regulatory definition of outcome. Regardless of severity, some AEs may mee t the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for the definition of an SAE. If an adverse event changes in severity during the same study p eriod (e.g., treatment period), only the highest severity grade will be recorded on the eCRF. 7.2.4 Assessment of Causality The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious). An investigator’s cau sality assessment is the det ermination of whether there exists a reasonable possibilit y that the investigational produc t caused or contributed to an AE. Causality of an AE will be assessed by the investigator using the following terms: • Likely Related: A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal s equence from administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug; and for which other potential etiologies are considered less likely factors than the study drug. • Likely Unrelated: A reaction that, considering all potential et iologies, is most likely due to factors other than the study drug. 124"

The Sponso r or designee must be notified within 24 hours of an AE when the i nvestigator determines that an AE meets the protocol definition of an SAE, regardless of the cause or relationship t o study drug. An SAE related to study particip ation occurri ng before study dr ug administration and after informed consent should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. If the investigator learns of any SAE at any time after a part icipant has been discharged from the study, and the SAE is considered likely related t o study drug, the SAE should be prom ptly reported to the Sponsor. Please see the Safety Form Report Completion Instructions for s afety reporting in structions. The investigator must also comply with applicable requirements concerning reporting of SAEs to the IRB or Ethics Committ ee (EC). This may include init ial or follow-up notification of an SAE or other safety information. 7.5 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and Study Investigators The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for submitting rep orts of serious, unexpected related adverse events to regul atory authorities on an expedite d basis, according to the ICH E2A Guideline and to other regulatory authorities according to national and local regulations as required. The Sponsor, or its d esignee, is responsible for prompt submission to the IRB or EC of any expedited SAE reports submitted to regulatory authori ties. All investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies with serlopitant will receive copies of the SAE reports submitted on an expedited basis to regulatory authoriti es. 7.6 Emergency Unblinding Emergency unblinding is availab le 24 hours per day/7 days per week and will be performed via IVRS. An investigator may unb lind a subject’s treatment ass ignment only when knowledge of the investigational pr oduct is essential for the w elfare of a subject. There is no specific antidote for serlopita nt and usual supportive medical management is recommended in the case of a medical emergency. 125"

Confidential Protocol MTI-106 Version 3.0/21 March 2019 Page 50 8 STATISTICAL METHODS All statistical pro cessing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise state d. One interim analysis may be performed. Endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment group and visit. For cont inuous variables, the follow ing information will be presented: n (number of subject s), mean, standard deviation, me dian, minimum and maximum. For categorical variables counts and percentages will be used. Summary statistics for imputed efficacy data will be reported based upon imputed d ata. The primary method of handling m issing efficacy data will be th e method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Subjects who withdrew f rom the study due to a lack of efficacy, or used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, will be defined as non-responder. As one sensitivity analysis, the l ast observation carried forwa rd method (LOCF) will be used (i.e., the last ava ilable on-therapy observation for a subject will be used to estimate subsequent missing data points). As a second sensitivity analys is, a repeated measures model will be used on observed data. A dditionally, a tipping point analysis will be done as a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint. Baseline for measures other th an the eDiary daily measures will be the last recorded value prior to the start of treatme nt. For daily measures including the WI-NRS, baseline will be the average result measured over the week prior to treatment. A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical a nalyses will be provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblindin g of the study treatments. 8.1 Decision Rule and Sample Size This study will use a 5% two-sided alpha level. While the alpha level is two-sided, clinically relevant results require a serlo pitant benefit. Statistical sig nificance for the key secondary efficacy endpoints requires statis tical significance for the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e. stepdown testing from primary t o key secondary endpoints). The key secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested in order starting with the Week 4 WI-N RS 4-point responder rate, and then the change from baseline to Week 10 in DLQI. The target sample size of 280 randomized and dosed subjects (14 0 per group) has been determined based upon a 1:1 allocat ion of subjects to treatment groups and a 5% alpha level. Completed Phase 2 studies indicat e that placebo responder rates vary between % and % and serlopitant rates betwee n % and %. A sample size of 280 subjects provides >90% power assuming a placebo responder rate of % and a serlopitan t rate of %. The sample size calculations have been performed in PASS 13 ( “PASS 13 Power Analysis and Sample Size Software” 2014 ) and use a Chi-Squared test. The primary analysis will control for the stratification factors. It is expected that thi s unstratified power estimate will under-estimate the true power as it does not take the variance reduction resulting from stratification into account ( Matts 1988). 126 CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI"

The primary method of handling m issing efficacy data will be MC MC multiple imputation. Subjects who withdrew from th e study due to a lack of efficacy, or used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, will be defined as non-re sponder. Imputation will be conducted within each treatment group independently, so the pat tern of missing observations in one treatment group cannot inf luence missing value estimatio ns in another. For each imputation process, 25 imputations will be performed. If a subject fails to complete th eir eDiary for the week prior to Week 10, the primary endpoint (WI-NRS) data will be missing, unless the subject withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or the subject use d an excluded therapy to tr eat worsening of pruritus or PN, in which case their responder status will be defined as non-res ponder. If the Week 10 value is missing for any other reason, the c hange from baseline value wi ll be based on imputed data. Missing Week 10 WI-NRS values fro m which the 4-point responder status is derived will be estimated by MCMC. Missing WI-NRS data will be derived for the analysis using the method of MCMC multiple imputation. Since both primary and key secondary efficacy endpo ints require WI-NRS, the following steps will be followed: 1. Using the daily eDiary data, c alculate Baseline and Week 2 through Week 10 values by averaging available values. If any values are available, these will be used i.e. a minimum of 1 observation is required to compute a week’s average. 2. From step 1, create a datase t for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and those needing estima tion by MCMC. The missing WI-NRS values in each dataset will be filled in using the MCMC method to generate 25 datasets. The resulting datasets for each treat ment arm will be combined into one complete dataset. Syntax: proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. Nimpute=25 <options >; where trtpn=(TRT); /* No te TRT = [1, 2]; depending on treat ment group */; mcmc chain=single; var baseline week1 week2 wee k3 week4 week5 week6 week7 week8 week9 week10; run; 3.

Analyses performed on the Per Protocol population will be considered sup portive. The PP population will include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria: • Violated the inclusion/ exclusion criteria; • Receives a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (See Appendix B ); • Receives an excluded medication for treatment of pruritus or PN ; • Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e. subjects must comply with 80120% of the expected dosage of s tudy medication during particip ation in the study); • Out of visit window at th e Week 10 visit by ±7 days Subjects that discontinue fro m the study drug due to an adverse event related to study treatment or documented lack of treatment effect will be includ ed in the PP population.

Conceptually the hypotheses being tested are: H0:PPlacebo ≥ PSerlopitant H a: PPlacebo < PSerlopitant where P Placebo is the percent of placebo responders and P Serlopitant is the similar percent for serlopitant. The primary endpoint will utilize the missing data rules as outlined in Section 8.2 . 8.8.2 Key Secondary Efficacy The differences between treatment groups for the key sec ondary efficacy endpoint, Wee k 4 WI-NRS 4-point responder rate, will be the CMH test identical t o the one used for the primary endpoint.

Both least squares means and observed mea ns will be presented. To confirm the assumptions for the ANCOVA model (i.e., that the errors are normally distributed with equal variances), residuals will be examined u sing the Shapiro-Wilk test. If there is overwhelmingly strong evi dence that the assumptions ar e not satisfied, the data will be rank-transformed prior to subm itting to the ANCOVA. Results of the rank-transformed analysis then will be considered the primary analysis; however, results of the non-rank- transformed analysis will also be presented.

KEY CHANGES: Section(s) Summary of Change Reason for Change Protocol Synopsis Updated consistent with changes to the protocol body. Ensure consistency between synopsis and protocol body. 3.3.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Removed ‘Change from Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to Week 10’ Added ‘WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 2’ As a mixed tool consisting of 10 questions , not all of which are specific to subjects with pruritus, the DLQI may have limited utility in the subject population. It is therefore removed from the multiplicity testing strategy as a Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint, however is still retained as an Additional Secondary Efficacy Endpoint to enable an evaluation of the potential improvement in quality of life (see below). An improvement in pruritus ( >4-point reduction in WI - NRS) may be realized as early as Week 2 of treatment and therefore is added as a Key S econdary Efficacy Endpoint and included in the multiplicity testing strategy. 3.3.3 Additional Secondary Efficacy Endpoints’ Removed ‘WI -NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 2’ Added ‘Change from Baseline in DLQI to Week 10’ Added ‘Change from Baseline in DLQI Question 1 to Week 10’ Aligns with changes made to Section 3.3.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints, and retain s ability to evaluate DLQI as an Additional Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Update due to prior change in SAP to analyze most relevant DLQI question as an additional secondary efficacy endpoint 8.1 Decision Rule and Sample Size Removed ‘Change from Baseline in DLQI t o Week 10’ Added ‘WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 2’ Aligns with changes made to Section 3.3.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints . 8.2 Handling of Missing Data Changed the minimum number of observations needed to compute a week’s average of WI -NRS from 1 observation to 4 observations.

Development Phase: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Efficacy objective: To assess the efficacy of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with prurigo nodularis . Safety objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in adults with prurigo nodularis . Study Design: This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for th e treatment of pruritus in adults with prurigo nodularis (PN). Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo for 10 weeks. After completion of the treatment period or early discontinuation of study drug treatment, all subjects will enter a 3- or 5-week follow-up period. The study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of 15 to 19 weeks: • Screening period: 2 -4 weeks • Treatment period: 10 weeks • Follow-up period: 3 or 5 weeks During the screening period, all subjects will undergo eligibility evaluation and will be assessed for chronic pruritic conditions frequently associated with PN. Subjects who present with idiopathic PN at screening may require additional assessments as deemed necessary by the investigator (e.g. endomysial antibody with reflex to titer for subjects with signs or symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, skin biopsy for subjects with signs or symptoms of bullous pemphigoid or cutaneous T -cell lymphoma , urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori, or allergy testing ). All screening procedures must be completed within 31 days before the Baseline visit. The minimum screening period for all subjects is 14 days to allow for collection of electronic diary ( eDiary) screening data. Subjects who require a screening period longer than 14 days will have a telephone contact at least 15 days prior to the scheduled Baseline visit to remind them to complete the eDiary as previously instructed at the Screening visit. Subjects will be provided an eDiary at the S creening visit. Subjects must be willing and able to complete the eDiary every day within a consistent timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies , for the duration of the study. At the Baseline visit (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (serlopitant 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period (Day 1). Starting on Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day. Study drug may be taken with or without food . 154"

Subjects who complete the 10- week treatment period and required follow-up period may be given the opportunity to enroll in a one-year open-label safety study with daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg. Safety Review: An internal safety monitoring team consisting of representatives from Menlo Therapeutics Inc. and its designees will monitor blinded safety data on a regular basis throughout the study. Planned Sample Size: Approximately 2 80 subjects will be randomized. Study Population: The study will consist of adult subjects with pruritus associated with PN . Inclusion Criteria (Subjects must meet the following criteria to be randomized into the study): 1. Male or female, age 18 years or older at consent. 2. A diagnosis of PN, defined by the presence of at least ten pruriginous nodules secondary to chronic pruritus present on at least two different body surface areas (e.g. both arms, one arm and one leg, one arm and the anterior trunk, or anterior and posterior trunk). 3. The worst pruritus is identified to be within the areas of the PN lesions. 4. Subject has idiopathic PN OR the subject has an identified pruritic condition associated with the PN and has persistent pruritus despite at least 6 weeks of optimized and stable treatment of the underlying conditio n prior to the Baseline visit, and is willing to continue the treatment during the study. 5. Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale ( WI-NRS) score ≥ 7 in the 24 -hour period prior to the Screening visit. 6. Average weekly WI -NRS score ≥ 6.5 in each of the 2 weeks (14 days) immediately prior to Baseline visit, as recorded in the eDiary. 7. All female subjects who are of childbearing potential must be willing to practice highly effective contraception (i.e., pregnancy prevention method with a failure rate of < 1% per year) from the time of the Screening visit until 5 weeks after last dose of study drug. 8. Willing and able (as demonstrated by a ≥ 70% eDiary completion rate in the two weeks prior to Baseline visit) to complete daily eDiary entries within a consistent timeframe for the duration of the study. 9. Willing and able ( has adequate cognitive ability, in the investigator ’s opinion) to comply with study visits and study related requirements including providing written informed consent. Exclusion Criteria (Subjects who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for participation in the study ): 1. Prior treatment with serlopitant. 2.

Study Drug: Serlopitant 5 mg oral tablets and matching placebo. Dosage: Serlopitant: 5 mg once daily by mouth for 10 weeks, following a 3 -tablet loading dose on the first day of the treatment period. Matching placebo: Once daily by mouth for 10 weeks, following a 3 -tablet loading dose on the first day of the treatment period. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is the WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 10. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 4 • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Wee k 2 Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows : • Change from baseline in WI -NRS to other timepoints • WI-NRS 3-point responder rate at Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to Week 10 • Change from baseline in DLQI Question 1 to Week 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Activity to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Stage to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 Safety Endpoints: Safety endpoint s are as follows : • Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) • Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters following study drug exposure • Changes from baseline in vital sign and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters following study drug exposure • Changes from baseline in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) • Changes from baseline in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Decision Rule and Sample Size: This study will u se a 5% two-sided alpha level.

Analyses performed on the Per Protocol populati on will be considered supportive. Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment group to which they are randomized . Efficacy Analyses: The primary efficacy endpoint is a binary variable taking on values of responder or non-responder. Subjects will be considered a responder if they have at least a 4-point reduction in WI -NRS between baseline and Week 10. Missing data imputation will be used for subjects who fail to complete the eDiary at Week 10, unless the subject withdrew from the stu dy due to a lack of efficacy, or the subject used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, in which case their responder status will be defined as non -responder. The primary endpoint will be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatm ent group and study week. The difference in the primary efficacy outcome measure between treatment groups will be tested using a Cochran Mantel Haenszel test controlling for the stratification factors. Testing of the key secondary efficacy endpoints will also be employed. Safety Analyses: The incidence of all adverse events ( AEs) and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated by treatment received. These AEs will be classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment- related AEs, AEs by severity, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented. Clinical safety laboratory values will be measured by a central laboratory. Summary statistics for actual values and for changes from baseline will be tabulated for laboratory resu lts by scheduled visit. Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at any post-baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline laboratory values will be tabulated. The overall ECG assessment (abnormal or no rmal) will be summarized along with a summary of how many subjects developed a post treatment abnormal result. Summary statistics for t he HADS and ESS actual values and change from baseline will be presented by scheduled visit. Study Sites: Approximately 50 study sites. Expected Duration of Subject’s Participation 15-19 weeks: 2-4 weeks of screening, 10 weeks of treatment, and a follow -up period of 3 or 5 weeks. This study will be conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) . 158"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 16 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Pruritus in Prurigo Nodularis Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a distinctive and easily diagnosable chronic skin condition characterized by the presence of multiple highly pruritic and often symmetrically distributed nodules and papules on the skin (Jorizzo 1981) . The nodules and papules in PN can range in size from approximately 0.5 to 3.0 cm and often appear hyperkeratotic , sometimes crateriform, in appearance. Plaques are occasionally present, and the lesions of PN frequently exhibit other features secondary to prolonged and severe scratching behavior, such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, erosion, ulceration, crusting, and bleeding ( Zeidler 2016). PN, a long-term reaction to the chronic scratching and picking of patients with chronic pruritus (Zeidler 2016) , is a skin condition seen predominantly in older adults, with median prevalence age in the 50s and 60s and a slight female preponderance (Iking 2013, Tan 2014, Ständer 2013) . In one patient population survey, pediatric patients accounted for <2% of the total population, with the youngest patient 11.9 years of age (Iking 2013) . Although only limited epidemiology data for PN have been published, a claims -based analysis commissioned by Menlo Therapeutics suggest that the United States (US) prevalence may be in the range of ~ 355,000 affected individuals. Based on a quantitative su rvey of 73 dermatologists conducted in parallel with the claims -based analysis, approximately 23% of patients with PN have an underlying atopy- related condition , while over 50% are considered to be idiopathic (Navigant 2017) . The median duration of disease burden has been reported to be 6-7 years (Iking 2013, Tan 2014, Schuhknecht 2011). The dominant symptom in PN is an intense and chronic pruritus that is associated with a high degree of patient burden and restricted quality of life (QOL) (Zeidler 2016). As measured by global scales of pruritus intensity (numeric rating scale ( NRS) and visual analog scale (VAS)), median levels of pruritus intensity have been reported to be 7-8 points ( Iking 2013, Tan 2014, Schuhknecht 2011). The pruritus experienced in PN can often prevent patients from adequately performing their daily activities (Vaidya 2008) , and patients with PN have been found to suffer from greater rates of depression and anxiety than cont rol groups in numerous studies (Jorgensen 2016, Rowland Payne 1985, Dazzi 2011). 1.2 Conditions Associated With Prurigo Nodularis As PN is considered to be a disease induced by chronic pruritus and ongoing scratching activity, a variety of chronic pruritic conditions have been identified as potential underlying etiologies for the pruritus, including atopic dermatitis (AD), other inflammatory or bullous skin diseases, chronic renal failure, human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) infection, hepatitis C infection, and multifactorial disease (i.e. two or more co- existent conditions associated with chronic pruritus) (Fostini 2013, Lee 2005). The mechanism s linking chronic pruritus to the development of PN are not clear, as only a subset of patients with chronic pruritus develop PN, and over half of patients with PN have no underlying etiology identified. Even when specific underlying conditions are identified, management of these condition(s) does not usually result in resolution of PN signs or symptoms, nor can all underlying conditions be treated. For example, PN has been observed in patients with HIV adequately managed with 166"
167,page_167,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 17 highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (Zancanaro 2006), in patients with intractable cholestatic pruritus (Bergasa 201 1), in patients with inactive hepatitis (Halvorsen 2015) , and commonly in patients with renal failure despite hemodialysis therapy (Goeksel 2013) . These data point to a high level of unmet medical need in the overall PN population, as the majority of patients with PN either have no underlying condition identified that can be treated, or treatment of the underlying condition is inadequate to control their PN ( Wallengren 2004). 1.3 Current Treatment Options for Prurigo Nodularis Treatment of PN remains a challenging and extremely frustrating experience for both patients and physicians. I n the majority of cases, responses are limited and unsatisfactory , and once the cycle of pruritus- excoriation-pruritus begins, it is difficult to stop . Identification and treatment of underlying chronic pruritic conditions is often the first step in management of PN. If this does not result in resolution of the pruritus, or if no underlying condition is identified, treatment specifically for PN and its associated pruritus is implemented. First-line pruritus therapies, including topical agents such as topical corticoster oids and calcineurin inhibitors , often provide inadequate response (Saco 2015) and the therapeutic ladder for PN involves systemic agents with progressively riskier safety profiles . These include naltrexone, gabapentin, mirtazapine, phototherapy, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), powerful immunosuppressants such as methotrexate and cyclosporine, and thalidomide (Ständer 2015b, Spring 2014, Feldmeyer 2012, Lim 2016). None of these therapies are indicated for the treatment of PN , and their usage is often based on limited evidence, such as case reports or small open-label studies. 1.4 Substance P and the Neurokinin- 1 Receptor Repeated itching, scratching , and picking over long time periods serve as the pathophysiological basis for the development of PN. Although different underlying disease states may be responsible for the chronic pruritus , the distinctive and easily recognizable features of PN point to a common final pathway r esulting in this unique clinical presentation . Immunohistochemical staining studies of PN biopsies have demonstrated that nerve fibers immunoreactive for Substance P (SP) are found in increased numbers in lesional skin compared to non- lesional skin or controls (Abadía Molina 1992), suggesting a role for SP signaling in PN. These findings are consistent with the robust body of evidence indicating the key role of SP signaling through its primary receptor, the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK 1-R), in the transmission of itch across m ultiple disease states (Santini 2012, Akiyama 2015, Crowe 1994, El-Nour 2006, Lotts 2014, Hon 2007, Ward 2004, Slattery 2011). SP is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, a group that also includes neurokinin A and neurokinin B (Hökfelt 2001) . SP has been implicated in a number of biological functions, both physiological and pathophysiological, including pruritus perception, vomiting reflex, pain perception, and immunomodulatory responses (Lotts 2014, Andoh 1998, Steinhoff 2014). The biological actions of SP are mediated by tachykinin receptors, which consist of seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains coupled to G-proteins. Three tachykinin receptors have been identified: the neurokinin-1, neurokinin-2, 167"
168,page_168,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 18 and neurokinin-3 receptors (Harrison 2001) . The NK1-R in particular has been studied in great detail. NK1-R is the primary receptor for SP in the human body, and is found on multiple cell types, include central and peripheral neurons, keratinocytes, and mast cells. NK1-R stimulation has been shown to be an important pathway for pruritus perception (Ständer 2015a) . Inhibition of this pathway results in decreased pruritus and scratching reflexes in animal models ( Akiyama 2015). Preceding the development of serlopitant for pruritus-related conditions, a commercially available NK 1-R antagonist ( Emend USPI) has been used as a therapy to decrease pruritus in patients with chronic pruritus due to etiologies such as cutaneous T -cell lymphoma (Duval 2009, Torres 2012, Booken 2011) and erlotinib-induced pruritus (Santini 2012, Gerber 2010). Additionally, in a study of 20 patients with chronic pruritus of various etiologies treated with aprepitant , 16/20 patients (80%) experienced a considerable reduction of itch intensity (Ständer 2010) . 1.5 Serlopitant 1.5.1 Serlopitant Background and Nonclinical Summary Serlopitant is a small molecule, highly selective NK1-R antagonist that is administered orally and metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with a plasma half -life of 45-86 hours. It binds with high affinity to the human NK1-R with a dissociation constant ( Kd) of 46 pM; displacing SP binding with a half- maximal inhibition concentration (IC 50) of 61 pM. Serlopitant is a potent functional antagonist of SP-induced inositol phosphate generation. Serlopitant has been extensively studied in animal toxicology studies, including chronic toxicology and carcinogenicity studies. In non-clinical chronic toxicology studies in rats, mice and dogs, treatment related findings of potential clinical significance included increased salivation, decreased body weight gain and food consumption, slight changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters, mild increases in liver weight and mild histomorphologic changes. The histomorphologic changes were seen only in rats (not in dogs or mice) and included: very slight ovarian intersti tial cell hypertrophy, mammary gland and uterine atrophy; decreased corpora lutea; increased histiocytes in lung and mesenteric lymph nodes; slight skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration; slight increased hematopoiesis in bone marrow; and slight to moderate vacuolation in kidney tubules. These nonclinical findings occurred at systemic exposures exceeding those anticipated to provide efficacy of serlopitant for pruritus indications in humans (1 to 5 mg tablet daily). No cardiac lesions have been observed in dog toxicity studies up to 9 months in duration nor in a 3- month mouse range-finding study and 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study at exposure higher than the lowest level which caused cardiotoxicity in rats. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats for histomorphological changes in the reproductive tract, mammary gland and bone marrow provides a 2.5-fold margin for the maximum-targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily). The rat NOAEL for histomorphological changes in muscle and kidney provides a 5-fold margin for the maximum- targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily). In summary, the nonclinical toxicity noted with serlopitant provides no contraindications to the continuation of clinical trials via the oral route. Findings in the developmental toxicity 168"

Single doses up to 400 mg have been well tolerated in young adult males and single doses up to 25 mg have been well tolerated in the elderly. Multiple doses of up to 50 mg a day for 4 weeks have been well tolerated in healthy young males, and a single (loading) dose of 15 mg followed by daily doses of 5 mg for 2 weeks have been well tolerated in elderly males and females. Forty -one (41) subjects received 4 mg liquid filled capsule (LFC) daily (bioequivalent to 5 mg tablets) for 1 year. Plasma concentrations of serlopitant appear to increase in a dose-proportional fashion in both young males and elderly subjects (males and females). Peak plasma concentrations after a single oral dose occurred at ~2 to 4 hours in both young and elderly subjects. A single loading dose of up to 15 mg followed by 6 to 8 weeks of up to 5 mg daily doses has been well tolerated in adults with chronic pruritus and PN. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrate good plasma exposures with oral dosing, linear dose-dependent increases in plasma concentration and systemic exposure, a plasma t1/2 appropriate for once daily dosing, and mild effects of concomitant food ingestion. Central nervous system (CNS) positron emission tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated good CNS penetrance and > 90% NK1 receptor occupancy (RO) at plasma exposures anticipated to be safe and well tolerated. Three long -lived active hydroxylated metabolites are observed in humans: M1/M1a , M2/M2a , and M3 . These metabolites were present at lower concentrations and were 2 - to 9-fold less potent in vivo than the parent compound. The integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis concluded that these metabolites are unlikely to contribute significantly to occupancy of the CNS NK 1-R in humans. 1.5.3 Serlopitant in Pruritus -Related Studies Serlopitant has been evaluated in two completed Phase 2 studies of subjects with chronic pruritus (TCP -101 and TCP-102). TCP-101 TCP-101 was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, multi-center study that compared serlopitant 0.25 mg, 1 mg, or 5 mg vs . placebo for the treatment of chronic pruritus. A total of 257 adult subjects 18-65 years of age with chronic pruritus were randomized to receive one of the four dose groups in a 1:1:1:1 randomization. Subjects received a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 and thereafter received 1 tablet per day for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was itch severity as measured on a VAS, summarized as a percentage change from baseline. Mean percent decreases from Baseline in VAS score were larger in the active -treatment groups versus placebo at every scheduled post- baseline study visit. Overall, the results were the most profound for the serlopitant 1 mg and 5 mg groups. For the percent change from Baseline in VAS pruritus scores (the primary efficacy variable), the Week 6 pairwise least 169 CCI CCI CCI"

The frequency of treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) and study drug related adverse events (AEs) was higher in the serlopitant 1 mg and 5 mg groups compared to the serlopitant 0.25 mg group, and the frequency in all three treatment groups were higher than in the placebo group. The frequency of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was comparable in the serlopitant 5 mg and placebo group and higher than in the serlopitant 0.25 mg and 1 mg groups. There was one serious adverse ev ent (SAE) reported in the serlopitant 1 mg group (spontaneous abortion, considered not related). There were no deaths. The most common AEs in the serlopitant groups were diarrhea (6.2%, 1 mg group), upper respiratory tract infection (4.7%, 0.25 mg group), somnolence (4.7%, 5 mg group), nasopharyngitis (4.6%, 1 mg group), headache (4.7%, 5 mg group), urinary tract infection (3.1%, 5 mg group), dry mouth (3.1%, 1 mg group), nausea (3.1%, 1 mg group), arthralgia (3.1%, 0.25 mg group), musculoskeletal pain (3.1%, 1 mg group) and pruritus (3.1%, 1 mg group). The most common AEs in the placebo group were headache (6.3%), nasopharyngitis (3.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.2%), urinary tract infection (3.2%) and asthma (3.2%). TCP-102 TCP-102 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled multi- center study that evaluated serlopitant 5 mg vs. placebo for the treatment of PN . A total of 128 adult subjects 18-80 years of age with PN were randomized to receive serlopitant or placebo in a 1:1 randomization. Subjects received a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 followed by 1 tablet per day for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the average VAS score as recorded at the study visits. Results at Week 4 and Week 8 were the primary timepoints. Serlopitant 5 mg was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus as measured by change in average VAS from baseline. For the primary endpoint, change from baseline at Week 4 and Week 8 by repeated measures analysis, the decrease from baseline was sig nificantly greater in the serlopitant group than the placebo group, with a mean difference (serlopitant minus placebo) of -1.0 at Week 4 and - 1.7 at Week 8. The mean difference at Week 2 was also significant, -0.9. In a post -hoc analysis of the percentage of subjects who were 4-point responders on average VAS at Week 8, 25.0% of placebo subjects and 54.4% of serlopitant subjects were 4 -point responders. TEAEs were reported for 71.9% of serlopitant- treated subjects and 61.9% of placebo -treated subjects. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the serlopitant group were nasopharyngitis (17.2% serlopitant, 3.2% placebo), diarrhea (10.9% serlopitant, 4.8% placebo), and fatigue (9.4% serlopitant, 6.3% pla cebo). Treatment -related TEAEs were reported for 48.4% of serlopitant-treated subjects and 34.9% of placebo- treated subjects. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in the serlopitant group were fatigue (7.8%) and diarrhea, peripheral edema, dizziness, and headache (each 6.3%). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate; severe TEAEs were reported for 9.4% of serlopitant -treated subjects and 4.8% of placebo-treated subjects. There were no deaths during the study. Five subjects (3 serlopitant, 2 placebo) had SAEs. The SAE s were actinic elastosis, depression, dizziness, and vertigo in 170"

Nine subjects (3 serlopitant, 6 placebo) discontinued due to T EAEs. No clinically relevant changes were observed in chemistry, hematology, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Potential Risks and Benefits: The results of the Phase 2 studies in PN and chronic pruritus , together with the extensive nonclinic al and clinical safety data and experience with serlopitant to date and the scientific rationale for NK 1-R inhibition in the treatment of pruritus, serve to support further evaluation of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in patients with PN. The potential benefits of continued clinical study outweigh the potential risks. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for further information regarding serlopitant. 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES The efficacy objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with PN . The safety objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in adults with PN. 3 STUDY DESIGN 3.1 Overall Study Design This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in adults with PN. The study will be conducted at approximately 50 study sites. Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo for 10 weeks. After completion of the treatment period or early discontinuation of study drug treatment, all subjects will enter a 3 or 5 -week follow-up period. The required follow-up period is defined as a minimum of 3 weeks for those subjects who will enroll in the one- year open-label safety study (MTI -107) on the date of the follow-up visit, and as 5 weeks for those subjects who will not be enrolled in the one-year open- label safety study of serlopitant. Should a subject present for the follow-up visit prior to 5 weeks after the last dose of study drug and be excluded from participation in the one-year study for any reason, the subject will be required to return at 5 weeks after the last dose of study drug for a complete follow-up visit. This study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of 15-19 weeks: • Screening period: 2-4 weeks • Treatment period: 10 weeks • Follow-up period: 3 or 5 weeks 171"
172,page_172,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 22 Informed consent will occur prior to any protocol-mandated procedures, including the stopping of any excluded therapies. This may occur prior to the Screening visit. During the screening period, all subjects will undergo eligibility evaluation and will be assessed for chronic pruritic conditions frequently associated with PN. Subjects who present with idiopathic PN at screening may require additional assessments as deemed necessary by the investigator (e.g. endomysial antibody with reflex to titer for subje cts with signs or symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, skin biopsy for subjects with signs or symptoms of bullous pemphigoid or cutaneous T- cell lymphoma, urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori , or allergy testing). All screening procedures must be completed within 31 days before the Baseline visit. The minimum screening period for all subjects is 14 days to allow for collection of electronic diary (eDiary) screening data. Subjects who require screening period longer than 14 days will have a telephone c ontact at least 15 days prior to the scheduled Baseline visit to remind them to complete the eDiary as previously instructed at the Screening visit. Screening procedures may be deferred following discussion with the medical monitor should more than 31 days be required (e.g. to wash out of certain excluded therapies or to treat their underlying condition). Screening procedures may be repeated (i.e ., the subject may be rescreened ) following discussion with the medical monitor should the subject have had difficulty complying with eDiary assessments, require further training in the assessments, or have other relevant needs that may delay enrollment in the study but are not expected to impact safety or efficacy assessments. Subjects will be provided an eDiary at the Screening visit. Subjects must be willing and able to complete the eDiary every day within a consistent timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies, for the duration of the study. At the Baseline visit (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (serlopitant 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period (Day 1). Starting on Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day. Study drug may be taken with or without food. The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 10 of treatment. Subjects who complete the 10-week treatment period and required follow-up period may be given the opportunity to enroll in a one-year open- label safety study (MTI -107) with daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg. 3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Selection In the TCP-102 study in patients with PN , serlopitant 5 mg taken daily for 8 weeks was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus , in both the overall study population as well as the subgroup of subjects with an atopic diathesis. Similarly, in the TCP -101 study in patients with chronic pruritus , serlopitant 5 mg and 1 mg taken daily for 6 weeks were 172"
173,page_173,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 23 superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus , in both the overall study population and the subgroup of subjects with an atopic diathesis. In both the TCP-102 and TCP -101 studies, serlopitant was generally well -tolerated and demonstrated an overall favorable safety profile at the doses evaluated. The current MTI -106 study is designed to confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus in patients with PN. The 5 mg dose of serlopitant was selected for this study based on the favorable efficacy, safety , and tolerability profile of serlopitant at this dose level. Over 250 subjects have been exposed to serlopitant at doses of 5 mg tablet-equivalent daily for at least 6 weeks, and ~ 40 subjects have been exposed up to one year. Human CNS PET RO data for serlopitant in healthy young males (Study P002) demonstrated that a serlopitant 5 mg LFC once daily dose is likely to achieve ~ 94 % NK1 RO at steady state. 3.3 Study Endpoints 3.3.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale ( WI-NRS) 4-point responder rate at Week 10. 3.3.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The key secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 4 • WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 2 3.3.3 Additional Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: • Change from baseline in WI-NRS to other timepoints • WI-NRS 3-point responder rate at Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to Week 10 • Change from baseline in DLQI Question 1 to Week 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Activity (IGA PN -A) to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 • Change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Stage (IGA PN -S) to Weeks 2, 4 and 10 173"

Investigators should make every effort to contact the Sponsor or designee before discontinuing study drug treatment, if possible. Subjects who discontinue treatment with study drug prior to completing the treatment period will enter a 5-week follow-up period following the last dose of study drug in addition to a Follow-up visit (see Section 3.1, Section 6.5.10). Every effort should be made for subjects to complete the Follow-up visit after a subject has discontinued from study drug. 5.7 Prior, Concomitant, and Excluded Therapies Prior therapies (including over- the-counter medications) used to treat the signs and symptoms of PN within the prior 2 years will be recorded for each subject at the Baseline visit. Concomitant therapies include any therapies (including over-the- counter medications and bland emollients ) used by a subject from initiation of study drug treatmen t through the follow-up perio d. A record of all medications used will be maintained for each subject throughout the study. Reported information will include a description of the type of drug, treatment period, dosing regimen, the route of administration, a nd drug indication. The use of any concomitant medication must relate to the subject’s medical history or to an AE, except for vitamins/nutritional supplements, emollient use, and routine preventative immunizations. 5.7.1 Allowed Therapies and Treatment Goals for Underlying Conditions Treatment of an underlying, treatable chronic pruritic condition is allowed, if stable for at least 6 weeks prior to the Baseline visit, and continued throughout the treatment period . Treatment of the underlying systemic pruritic condition should be optimized per standard of care and treatment goals must be tailored based on age, sex, and concurrent health status and drug tolerance. While resolution of metabolic or endocrine disorders or eradication of an underlying infection may not always be feasible, every effort should be made to ensure the condition is well controlled, to prevent or reduce exacerbations and to prevent limitation on the activities of daily living . When applicable, laboratory evidence of control should be obtained. For example, if renal insufficiency is implicated as causal for pruritus, treatment 178"

Any previously active skin disease is considered to be well controlled if it is globally considered clear or almost clear (permissible to have post -inflammatory pigmentation, fine scale, faint pink erythema, barely perceptible induration/papulation, and no oozing or crusting). Use of gentle cleansers and bland emollients ( including those with urea) is encouraged for all subjects. If bland emollient use is elected, it must be initiated at least 2 weeks (14 days) prior to Baseline visit , and continued throughout the treatment period . Treatment with non -systemic corticosteroids or antihistamines that do not involve skin application (e.g. inhaled, intranasal, ophthalmic, or intra- articular) is allowed. Leukotriene inhibitors will be permitted for treatment of conditions other than PN (e.g. asthma). 5.7.2 Excluded Therapies Initiation or use of topical therapy with corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, calcipotriene, PDE-4 inhibitors is not permitted within 4 weeks prior to the Baseline visit or throughout the treatment period, but such therapy may be initiated during the follow- up period if needed. Initiation of bland emollient is not permitted within 2 weeks (14 days) prior to Baseline visit or throughout the treatment period, but such therapy may be initiated during the follow-up period if needed. The following therapies and activities are excluded from the Screening visit through the treatment period, and through the follow-up period: • NK1-R antagonists (other than study drug) • Systemic immunosuppressive/ immunomodulatory therapies (including but not limited to systemic corticosteroids, PDE -4 inhibitors, cyclosporine, mycophenolate- mofetil, methotrexate, azathioprine, thalidomide, interferon-gamma, or phototherapy) • Biologic therapies (other than therapies such as insulins, vaccines) • Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (See Appendix B ) • Use of an indoor tanning facility, or natural sun exposure resulting in significant tanning or sunburn • Any investigational therapy 179"

However, should rescue therapy be required for the safety and well-being of the subject, such use will be recorded and analyzed (see Section 8.2) . The subject may remain on study drug, unless the rescue therapy is an NK 1-R antagonist, a systemic biologic therapy, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, an investigational therapy, or any therapy that may jeopardize the subject’s safety if study drug is continued, in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opinion. 5.8 Assignment to Treatment 5.8.1 Randomization Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive serlopitant 5 mg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Stratified permuted block randomization will be used. Randomization will be stratified by the subject’s reported WI -NRS score for the 1- week period prior to the Baseline visit (6.5 to < 9, 9 to 10). An IWRS will be used to perform the randomization. 5.8.2 Blinding This study will be conducted as a double-blind study with the treatment assignment concealed from the subjects, the investigators and their staff, the Sponsor, and any designees of the Sponsor as required . The placebo will be formulated to be indistinguishable from the active study product. Study materials will be packaged and issued in a manner designed to maintain the blind for subjects and all study personnel involved in the direction and execution of study procedures, study assessments, and collection of data.

It uses a 24-hour recall period and asks subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11 -point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable). Higher scores indicate greater itch intensity. In this study, the subject is asked to rate the intensity of their worst itch (WI-NRS) during a 24- hour recall period ; the questionnaire is provided in Appendix C. Initial WI-NRS score collected during Screening visit will be collected on paper. All subsequent WI-NRS assessments will be reported by subject via eDiary. Subjects will record their WI-NRS scores once daily via eDiary at approximately the same time each d ay (+/- 3 hours) throughout the screening, treatment, and follow-up periods, as outlined in Appendix A. Subjects may be allowed to adjust the timing of eDiary completion within the first week of Screening as needed. Standardized training and instructions will be provided to all subjects prior to eDiary use. 6.1.2 Investigator’s Global Assessment of PN Activity The IGA PN-A is an instrument used to assess the overall activity of PN lesions at a given time point, as determined by the investigator. It consists of a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), as provided in Appendix D. The IGA PN- A uses clinical characteristics of excoriations, crusting, and/or bleeding as guidelines for the overall activity assessment. The n umber of pruriginous lesions should not be considered for this assessment. IGA PN-A scores will be captured as outlined in Appendix A. Each assessment during the study must be done by the Principal Investigator ( PI) or designee. Every effort should be made to ensure that all assessments for a given subject are done by the same indiv idual throughout the study. However, a change in assessor for a given subject, though not ideal, will not be considered a protocol deviation. 181"

It consists of a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) , as provided in Appendix D. The IGA- PN-S uses clinical characteristics of number of nodules and their thickness as guidelines for the overall severity assessment. IGA -PN-S scores will be captured as outlined in Appendix A. Each assessment during the study must be done by the PI or designee. Every effort should be made to ensure that all assessments for a given subject are done by the same individual throughout the study. However, a change in assessor for a given subject, though not ideal, will not be considered a protocol deviation. 6.1.4 Dermatology Life Quality Index Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI) is a dermatology specific QOL instrument designed to assess the impact of the skin disease on a subject’s QOL over the prior week. It is a ten - item questionnaire that assesses overall QOL and six aspects that may affect QOL (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment), and is provided in Appendix E. The DLQI questionnaire will be collected as outlined in Appendix A. 6.1.5 PN Photographs At selected investigative sites, optional photographs of representative areas with PN involvement will be taken at multiple time points, as outlined in Appendix A. These areas may include the extensor surfaces of both arms and both legs (overview of both legs, detail of lower legs) , and the abdomen and back. The central photography vendor will provide photographic equipment to the sites for use during the study. The PI and designees will be trained on the use of the camera and the appropriate lighting and positioning of the representative area with PN involvement. Detailed instructi ons will be provided in the Photography manual . 6.2 Safety Parameters Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording protocol-defined AEs and SAEs; vital signs; physical examinations; clinical laboratory assessments; ECGs ; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug as outlined in Appendix A. 6.2.1 Vital Signs Vital signs will include measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and temperature after the subject has been calmly resting (s eated or supine) for a minimum of 5 minutes. Vital signs will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A and at unscheduled study visits when clinically indicated. On study visits when clinical laboratory tests are performed, assessment of vital signs should precede blo od draw. 182"

An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 193"
194,page_194,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 44 AEs include treatment emergent exacerbation s of pre-existing illness es and AEs that occur as a result of protocol- mandated interventions. 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event An AE is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following outcomes: • Death • Life-threatening AE (i.e. the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is not “life-threatening”) • Inpatient hospitalizatio n or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • Congenital anomaly/ birth defect • Important medical event (i.e. an event that may not result in dea th, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization, but which may be considered serious by the investigator or Sponsor, as it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The following are not considered SAEs: a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event), an elective surgery planned prior to signing consent, admission as per protocol for planned medical/surgical procedure, and/or routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g. routine colonoscopy). The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE (e.g. mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of minor medical significance (e.g. se vere back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. Seriousness (not severity) serves as the basis for defining regulatory reporting obligations. Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on the eCRF. 194"
195,page_195,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 45 7.1.3 Abnormal Physical Exam, Laboratory, Vital Sign, and Electrocardiogram Findings Abnormal physical exam findings that are clinically significant and are identified prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history. New or worsening clinically significant abnormal physical exam findings identified after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. Only abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that are considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g. require active management or are associated with accompanying symptoms/signs) wil l be recorded as medical history or AEs on the eCRF. Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history, and abnormal findings that occur after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. If the clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG abnormality is a sign associated with a confirmed disease or condition (e.g. elevated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with chronic kidney disease), only the diagnosis (chronic kidney disease) needs to be recorded on the AE eCRF (rather than listing individual test findings as AEs). Separate instances of the same clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG abnormality across visits should not be recorded a s separate AEs or SAEs. 7.1.4 Deaths Any deaths that occur from the time of informed consent to the follow-up visit, regardless of attribution, must be reported within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of the death. See Safety Form Completion Instructions for complete instructions. The Sponsor should be provided a copy of any post-mortem findings and/or relevant medical reports, including histopathology. 7.1.5 Pregnancies and Contraception Requir ements for Females For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and is pre -menopausal, unless permanently surgically sterile (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) . A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause in a previously menstruating female. For the purposes of this study, acceptable contraception is defined below based on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals: ICH M3(R2) dated January 2010, and other available guidelines (“U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use” 2010; “Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials” 2014; “M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals” 2010) : 195"
196,page_196,"Menlo Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 46 All female subjects of childbearing potential must use highly effective contrac eption, which includes the use of one or more of the following acceptable methods: 1. Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) 2. Total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, only if planned for the entire duration of the study period and consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle for the subject 3. Hormonal contraception associated with consistent inhibition of ovulation; these ma y include (but are not necessarily limited to) oral, intravaginal, implantable, injectable, or transdermal delivery methods 4. Intrauterine device/system 5. Exclusive (sole) monogamous intercourse with a sterilized (i.e., vasectomized) or otherwise non- fertile (e.g., castrated) male partner; the male partner must have received medical assessment of the surgical success Progesterone-only oral contraceptives are excluded as a highly effective method of contraception, as they do not consistently inhibit ovulation. Male or female condoms with or without spermicide, and female caps, diaphragms, and sponges with spermicide, or combinations (double barrier) are also excluded as highly effective contraceptive methods. Any pregnancy occurring in a female subject or the f emale partner of a male subject, from the first study drug administration through the required follow -up visit must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. See Safety Form Completion Instructions for complete instructions. The investigator will follow the pregnancy to delivery or other pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy in a female clinical trial subject or female partner of a male clinical trial subject is not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies ( for example, spontaneous abortion) may qualify as SAEs and should be reported as such even if they occur after the Follow -up visit. Any congenital anomalies/birth defects must be recorded and reported as SAEs. See Safety Form Completion Instructions for complete instructions. 7.1.6 Worsening of Pruritus or PN Pruritus or PN should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if considered by the inve stigator to have worsened in severity beyond the subject ’s typical fluctuations . It is important to include a description of the nature of the unexpected worsening when recording the AE or SAE (e.g. new PN lesions in previously uninvolved skin). 196"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 47 7.2 Methods and Timing for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 7.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period Any AE occurrence during the study must be recorded on source documentation and eCRF at the site, in accordance with protocol instructions. AEs and SAEs will be recorded from the first study drug administration through the follow-up visit . After the required follow -up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug- related should be reported. After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by the investigator to be caused by a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure- related SAEs should only be reported on the source documents and SAE form, not on the AE eCRF. Subjects who undergo screening procedures but are not randomized into the study will not have SAEs recorded in the clinical database. 7.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs at each subject contact through the follow-up visit. All AEs and SAEs, whether reported by the subject or noted by authorized study personnel, will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF page, and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality. 7.2.3 Assessment of Severity All AEs entered into the eCRF will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 (“Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)” 2010 ) to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event. If the AE cannot be found in the event- specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria, the investigator should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Table 1 . 197"

A semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within the altern ate description of the grade. b Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. c Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. Source: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 Note that severity, a measure of intensity, is not equivalent to seriousness, a regulat ory definition of outcome. Regardless of severity, some AEs may meet the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for the definition of an SAE. If an adverse event changes in severity during the same study period (e.g., treatment period), only the highest severity grade will be recorded on the eCRF. 7.2.4 Assessment of Causality The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious). An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contr ibuted to an AE. Causality of an AE will be assessed by the investigator using the following terms: • Likely Related: A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response patt ern to the suspected study drug; and for which other potential etiologies are considered less likely factors than the study drug. • Likely Unrelated: A reaction that, considering all potential etiologies, is most likely due to factors other than the study drug. 198"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 49 7.3 Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The investigator must make every effort to follow all AEs and SAEs regardless of attribution until judged resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that study drug treatment or participation in the study is not the cause of the AE or SAE. 7.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor and Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee The Sponsor or designee is under obligation to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities related to investigational drugs in clinical trials. The Sponsor or designee must be notified within 24 hours of an AE when the investigator determines that an AE meets the protocol definition of an SAE, regardless of the cause or relationship to study drug. An SAE related to study participation occurring before study drug administration and after informed consent should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. If the investigator learns of any SAE at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the SAE is considered likely related to study drug, the SAE should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. Please see the Safety Form Report Completion Instructions for safety reporting instructions. The investigator must also comply with applicable requirements concerning reporting of SAEs to the IRB or Ethics Committee (EC ). This may include initial or follow -up notification of an SAE or other safety information. 7.5 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorit ies and Study Investigators The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for submitting reports of serious, unexpected related adverse events to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis, according to the ICH E2A Guideline and to other regulatory authorities according to national and local regulations as required. The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for prompt submission to the IRB or EC of any expedited SAE reports submitted to regulatory authorities. All investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies with serlopitant will receive copies of the SAE reports submitted on an expedited basis to regulatory authorities. 7.6 Emergency Unblinding Emergency unblinding is available 24 hours per day/7 days per week and will be performed via IVRS. An investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only when knowledge of the investigational product is essential for the welfare of a subject. There is no specific antidote for serlopitant and usual suppor tive medical management is recommended in the case of a medical emergency. 199"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 50 8 STATISTICAL METHODS All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. One interim analysis may be performed. Endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment group and visit. For continuous variables, the following information will be presented: n (number of subjects), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. For categorical variables counts and percentages will be us ed. Summary statistics for imputed efficacy data will be reported based upon imputed data. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Subjects who withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, will be defined as non-responder. As one sensitivity analysis, the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) will be used (i.e., the last available on- therapy observation for a subject will be used to estimate subsequent missing data points). As a second sensitivity analysis, a repeated measures model will be used on observed data. Additionally, a tipping point analysis will be done as a sensitivity analysis f or the primary endpoint. Baseline for measures other than the eDiary daily measures will be the last recorded value prior to the start of treatment. For daily measures including the WI- NRS, baseline will be the average result measured over the week prior t o treatment. A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 8.1 Decision Rule and Sample S ize This study will use a 5% two -sided alpha level. While the alpha level is two -sided, clinically relevant result s require a serlopitant benefit. Statistical significance for the key secondary efficacy endpoints requires statistical significance for the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e. stepdown testing from primary to key secondary endpoints). The key secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested in order starting with the Week 4 WI-NRS 4-point responder rate , and then the Week 2 WI-NRS 4-point responder rate. The target sample size of 2 80 randomized and dosed subjects (140 per group) has been determined based upon a 1:1 allocation of subjects to treatment groups and a 5% alpha level. Completed Phase 2 studies indicate that placebo responder rate s vary between % and % and serlopitant rates between % and %. A sample size of 280 subjects provides > 90% power assuming a placebo responder rate of % and a serlopitant rate of %. The sample size calculations have been performed in PASS 13 (“PASS 13 Powe r Analysis and Sample Size Software” 2014 ) and use a Chi-Squared test. The primary analysis will control for the stratification factors. It is expected that this unstratified power estimate will under-estimate the true power as it does not take the variance reduction resulting from stratification into account (Matts 1988) . 200 CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI"

Confidential Protocol MTI -106 Version 4.0/16 December 2019 Page 51 8.2 Handling of Missing Data Should a determination of treatment period (on treatment, pre- treatment, follow-up) be required for adverse events or concomitant medication but the corresponding date is missing, or is a partial date, the event/medication will be considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are available indicate this is not possible. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation. Subjects who withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, will be defined as non-responder. Imputation will be conducted within each treatment group independently, so the pattern of missing observations in one treatment group cannot influence missing value estimations in another. For each imputation process, 25 imputations will be performed. If a subject fails to complete their eDiary for the week prior to Week 10, the primary endpoint (WI-NRS) data will be missing , unless the subject withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy , or the subject used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, in which case their responder status will be defined as non-responder. If the Week 10 value is missing for any other reason, the change from baseline value will be based on imputed data. Missing Week 10 WI-NRS values from which the 4-point responder status is derived w ill be estimated by MCMC. Missing WI-NRS data will be derived for the analysis using the method of MCMC multiple imputation. Since both primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints require WI-NRS, the following steps will be followed: 1. Using the daily eDiary data, calculate Baseline and Week 2 through Week 10 values by averaging available values. In order to compute a week’s average, a minimum of 4 values must be available for that week. The weekly average will be imputed when there are fewer than 4 values available. 2. From step 1, create a dataset for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and those needing estimation by MCMC. The missing WI- NRS values in each dataset will be filled in using the MCMC method to generate 25 datasets. The resulting datasets for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete dataset. Syntax: proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed.

The results from the analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS® PROC MIANALYZE . In the case of the primary analysis and the secondary responder analyses, the Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) statistics computed in the analyses of WI-NRS responder rates will be normalized using the Wilson -Hilferty transformation prior to combining them using SAS® PROC MIANALYZE A total of 2 random seeds wil l be needed to impute missing data. Those random seeds have been pre-specified by using a random number generator: 8.3 Analysis Population s The primary efficacy population will be the I ntent-to-Treat (ITT) and will include all randomized subjects who were dispensed study drug. Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment group to which they are randomized. The primary safety population will be all treated subjects with at least one post -baseline assessment. For safety analyses, subjects will be classified based upon the treatment received. The Per Protocol ( PP) population will include all subjects in the safety population who complete the Week 10 evaluations witho ut any significant protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). Analyses performed on the Per Protocol population will be considered supportive. The PP population will include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria: • Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria; • Receives a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (See Appendix B); • Receives an excluded medication for treatment of pruritus or PN; • Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e. subjects must comply with 80−120% of the expected dosage of study medication during participation in the study); • Out of visit window at the Week 10 visit by ±7 days Subjects that discontinue from the study drug due to an adverse event related to study treatment or documented lack of treatment effect will be included in the PP population. Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. 202 CCI"

Prior therapies (including over- the-counter medications) used to treat the signs and symptoms of PN within the prior 2 years will be reported. Prior medications will be summarized by ATC level and preferred drug name and listed. Concomitant medications will be summarized by ATC level and preferred drug name and listed. Concomitant medication use will be quantified and analyzed. 8.7 Treatment Compliance and Extent of Exposure Compliance with study drug dosing will be determined based on tablet counts recorded on the eCRF. Compliance will be calculated by analyzing expected number of tablets returned versus actual number of tablets returned. Summaries of treatment exposure will also be produced. 8.8 Efficacy Analyses All efficacy endpoints will be summarized within the ITT and PP populations using descriptive statistics by time point and treatment. Results including averaged imputed values will be summarized at Baseline, Week 2 (if available), 4, 10 and Follow- up, and the change from baseline for these measures will be summarized at Week 2, 4, 10 and Follow-up. The WI-NRS and change from baseline will also be presented for each study day. 8.8.1 Primary Efficacy The difference in the primary efficacy ou tcome measure ( WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 10) will be tested using a CMH test controlling for the ‘as randomized’ stratification factors. Conceptually the hypotheses being tested are: H0:PPlacebo ≥ PSerlopitant H a: PPlacebo < PSerlopitant where P Placebo is the percent of placebo responders and P Serlopitant is the similar percent for serlopitant. The primary endpoint will utilize the missing data rules as outlined in Section 8.2. 203"

The preceding tests are to be conducted for the ITT population and the PP populations. 8.8.3 Additional Secondary Efficacy Additional secondary efficacy endpoints which may be drawn from the primary and key secondary imputations (including all WI -NRS endpoints) will be analyzed using the imputed data. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints otherwise will be analyzed using available data. P-values will be included for descriptive purpose s only. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints which are dichotomous (responder) will include analyses analogous to the primary and key secondary efficacy analyses. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints based on change from baseline will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group and stratification factor as fixed effects and the baseline value as a covariate. Both least squares means and observed means will be presented. To confirm the assumptions for the ANCOVA model (i.e., that the errors are normally distributed with equal variances), residuals will be examined using the Shapiro- Wilk test. If there is overwhelmingly strong evidence that the assumptions are not satisfied, the data will be rank-transformed prior to submitting to the ANCOVA. Results of the rank- transformed analysis then will be considered the primary analysis; however, results of the non- rank- transformed analysis will also be presented. 8.9 Sensitivity Analyses 8.9.1 Last Observation Carried Forward In the first set of sensitivity analysis, missing values will be imputed using LOCF. Data will be imputed using LOCF unless the subject withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or the subject used an excluded therapy to treat worsening of pruritus or PN, in which case their responder status will be defined as non -responder. Each primary and key secondary endpoint will be analyzed as it was using the multiply imputed data. 8.9.2 Repeated Measures Analysis The second set of sensitivity analyses wi ll be performed on observed data.
