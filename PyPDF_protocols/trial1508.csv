Lasmiditan in Japan is currently being developed for patients with migraine based on the bridging strategy described in the Guidance on Ethnic Factors in the Acceptabilit y of Forei gn Clinical Data (ICH -E5).Influences of ethnic factors on lasmiditan were evaluated in the Phase 1 Study H8H -JE-LAIE (Study LAIE ), whi ch expl ored the safety , tolerabili ty and pharmacokinet ics (PK) of lasmidi tan in heal thy Japanese and Caucasian subjects. The s afety and PK resul ts from this study , as well as the resul ts from previ ous global clinical pharmaco logy studi es, suggest that lasmiditan is unlikely to be affected by intrinsic ethnic f actors and support the bridging strategy. Study H8H -JE-LAIH (LAIH) will be conducted as the bridging trial to the Phase 3 Study 302/LAHK , withdose-response in efficacy of lasmidi tan in the range of 50- 200 m g. Study LAIH will assess the efficacy and safet y of lasmiditan in acute treatment o f amigraine attack in Japanese adult pati ents with or wi thout aura .

This guarantees that the overall t ype 1 error across the set of primary and key secondary hypothesis tests is 0.05. Other assessments will not be part of the gatekeeping procedure. [T1] Primary : placebo vs .lasmiditan 200 mg (pain free at 2 hours) will be based on logistic regressio n. [T2] Key secondary: dose response of placebo, lasmiditan 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg (pain free at 2 hours) will be based on the Cochran -Armitage trend t est. [T3] Key secondary: pl acebo vs .lasmiditan 100 mg (pain relief at 2 hours) will be based on l ogistic regressio n. The a nalysis popul ation for [T1], [T2], and [T3] under the gatekeeping procedure is the modified intent-to-treat ( mITT) popul ation. This set includes all rando mized pat ients who took at least 1 dose of st udy drug wi thin 4 hours of onset of the migraine attack andhave any postdose efficacy assessments . For [T1], [T2], or [T3], if an analysis ([T1] or [T2] or [T3]) is not statistically significant, then all subsequent analyses will be conducted but will bedesignated as exploratory rather than confirmatory .

Study Rationale In 2 Phase 3 , randomized, double -blind, single migraine attack studies (Study COL MIG - 301/H8H -CD-LAHJ [Study 301/LAHJ, SAMURAI] and Study COL MIG -302/ H8H -CD-LAHK [Study 302/LAHK, SPARTAN]) , lasmidi tan (Study 301/LAHJ: 100 m g and 200 m g, Study 302/LAHK: 50 mg, 100 mg ,and 200 mg) demonstrated stati stically significant superiorit y versus placebo in the proporti on of patients who were headache pain free at 2 hours postdose as well as the proporti on of patients who were free of their migraine -associ ated MBS (as identified by the patient fro m the associ ated symptom s of nausea, phonophobia or ph otophobi a) at 2 hours postdose . Lasmiditan in Japan is currently being developed for patients with migraine based on the bridging strategy described in the Guidance on Ethnic Factors in the Acceptabilit y of Forei gn Clinical Data (ICH -E5). Influences of ethnic factors on lasmiditan were evaluated in the Phase 1 Study H8H -JE-LAIE (Study LAIE ), in which a randomized, 3 -period, subject -and invest igator - blind ,crossover design was implemented to expl ore the s afety,tolerabilit y, and PK of lasmiditan in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects. The study had 3 cohorts ,2 of which included only Japanese subjects (Cohorts 1 and 2) and 1 (Cohort 3) which included only Caucasian subjects. Subjects were enrolled into 1 of 3 cohorts. Within each cohort, subjects were rando mized to a specific treatm ent sequence . Rando mization wasstratified by sexto ensure approximately an equal number of m ale and female subjects in each cohort and treatment sequence . Subjects received single oral doses of 400 mg, 2 × 200 mg (repeated single doses, 2 hours apart), 200 mg, 100 m g, 50 m g lasmidi tan, placebo, or 2 × placebo (repeated single doses, 2 hours apart) (Japanese subjects , Cohorts 1 and 2 ), or 200 mg, 100 mg, 50 m g, or pl acebo (Caucasian subjects , Cohort 3 ) on Day 1 of each peri od, according to their assigned treatment sequence. There was a washout period of approximately 72 hours between dose administrations across periods. Overall, a total o f 27 healt hy subjects, consist ing of 16 Japanese subjects (8 male and 8 female), and 11 Caucasian subjects (6 male and 5 female), between the ages of 29 and 63 y ears, and 24 and 64 y ears, respectively, participated in StudyLAIE . Of the 27 subjects who entered the study , 27 were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least 1 dose of study drug. Twent y six subjects completed the study , and 1 di d not com plete the study (withdrew due to a family emergency ). Safety data in Japanese and Caucasian subjects from Study LAI Eshowed that n odeaths, or serious or severe adverse events ( AEs)occurred during the study . There were no discontinuat ions due to AE s. The m ost frequent treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAE s)(all causalit ies) reported during the study were so mnolence, dizziness, and hypoaesthesia in decreasing order in the overall population of Japanese and Caucasian subjects combined . Inthe Integrated Safet y Summary (ISS), a summary of TEAEs in non-Japanese healthy subjects (556 healthy subjects, non -elderly, 79% White) who were administered with single doses of lasmidi tan over a range of 0.1 mg to 400 mg, the most frequent TEAEs reported were dizziness, somno lence, fatigue, headache, paraesthesia, and nausea in decreasing order.

Taken together, these data suggest that there are no major difference sin safety and tolerabilit y in Japanese and non -Japanese healt hy subjects. The frequency of TEAEs in Study LAIE did not differ between sexes in Japanese subje cts, whereas a higher frequency of TEAEs were observed in Caucasian females. No clinically significa nt effect of lasmiditan on systolic blood pressure ,diastolic blood pressure , or QTc interval was observed during Study LAIE across the doses investigated . The PK data fro m Study LAI Eappeared to be similar in Japanese and Caucasian subjects with median maximum concentration between 1.50 and 2.50 hours , and mean t 1/2value approximately 4 hours for all dose l evels and across popul ations.No consistent difference in the PK of lasmiditan and its metabo lites was noted between male and female subjects within Japanese and Caucasian populat ions. Overall, the safe ty and PKresul ts in Japanese and Caucasian healt hy subjects in Study LAIE and the ISS , indicate that lasmidi tan is unlikely to be affected by intrinsic ethnic factors , thus supporting the concl usion that the bridging strategy can be em ployed for the development of lasmiditan in Japan . The current study (H8H -JE-LAIH [LAIH ])will be conducted as the bridging trial to the Phase 3 Study 302/LAHK with dose response inefficacy in the range of 50 -200 m g. Study LAIH will assess the efficacy and safet y of lasmidi tan in acute treatment o f a single migraine attack in Japanese adult pati ents with or wi thout aura . 3.2. Background Migraine is a seri ous, chronic, di sabling neurological disease characterized by attacks of moderate to severe headache pain associated with other symptoms such as nausea, vomit ing, photoph obia, and phonophobia. According to an epidemio logical study conducted in Japan using the Japanese versio n of the International Classification o f Headache Disorders ( ICHD ), the overall prevalence of migraine in Japan was 8.4% with a gender ratio (women/me n) of approximately 3.6 (Sakai and Igarashi 1997). The prevalence o f migraine was as high as 17.6% and 18.4% forwomen in their 30s and 40s, respectively (Takeshima et al. 2004). The World Health Organizat ion (WHO) reports migraine on its own to be the sixth highest cause worldwide of years l ost due to di sabili ty, and h eadache di sorders collect ively to be third highest , with a large social loss due to the high proporti on of sufferers at labor-productivit y age ( WHO , 2016). In Japan, 25.8% of patients wit h aura of migraine and19.5% of patients with out aura of migraine answ ered, ""Ihave experience of being absent from work due to headache"" ( Takeshima et al. 2004). Pharmaco logic approaches to the treatment of migraine include drugs to treat migraine attacks as they arise (acute treatm ent), and drugs to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks (prevent ive treatm ent). Acute treatment is primarily based on the fo llowing five opti ons: acetaminophen, nonsteroi dal ant i-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs ), ergotamine, tr iptans, and ant iemetics. Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are ty pically used f or mild attacks while triptans are ty pically used for moderate to severe attacks. Antiemetics are used if pat ients experience nausea during"
19,page_19,"H8H-JE-LAIH(a) Clinical Protocol Page 19 LY573144attacks. If migraine attacks are frequent o r refractory , opioids, barbi turates, anal gesic anesthet ics,or corti costeroi ds are used ,although they are off -label. These treatment options follow the International Headache Societ y (IHS) gui delines both in Japan and the United States/European Unio n (US/EU ), and th ereare current lyno major difference sin the use of acute or prevent ive treatments among these regions despite differences in insurance coverage and approval status (JHS 2013) . An analysis o f the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention study found that 40.7% of patients wi th migraine had ≥1 si gnificant unmet need s. Am ong the pati ents wi th unmet needs, 47.0% had moderate or severe headache -related disabilit y, 37.4% were dissat isfied wit h their acute migraine treatment, 32.0% had excessi ve opioi d or barbi turate use and/or probable dependence, 26.2% had a history of cardi ovascular events (a group which should not take triptans or ergotamines), and 5.7% reported ≥2 visits in the preceding year to the emergency or emergent care for headache (Lipton et al . 2013). Collectively this informat ion further highlights a need for new approaches for the acute treatment of migraine attacks that may improve the management of some patients with migraine leading to improved outcomes. Lasmiditan, chemical name: 2,4,6 -trifluoro -N-[6-(1-methylpiperidine -4 carbonyl)py ridine-2- yl]benzamide hemisuccinate, is a high affinit y, highly select ive 5 -HT 1Freceptor agonist that has a >470 fo ld select ivity for the human 5 -HT 1Freceptor relat ive to the 5 -HT 1Breceptor. It has a chemical structure and pharmaco logic profile that is di stinct fro m the triptans, the current standard of care for acute treatment of migraine attacks. Lasmiditan does not contain the indo le group observed in all triptan s and instead has a py ridinoyl piperidine scaffo ld, which is unique among ant imigraine medicat ions. Evidence suggests that l asmidi tan exerts i ts therapeuti c effects in the treatment of migraine by decreasing neuropeptide release and inhibit ing pain pathwa ys including the trigeminal nerve ( Labast ida-Ramírez et al . 2017) without causing vasoconstriction in human coronary arteri es (Ramadan et al. 2003). Two Phase 3 multic enter ,double -blind , placebo -controlled lasmiditan studies ,including LAHJ with 100 mg and 200 mg dose arms and LAHK with 50 mg, 100 mg,and 200 mg dose arms to treat a single migraine attack have been completed . The primary endpo int in each study was the proporti on of patients who were headache pain free at 2 hours postdose (defined as mild, moderate, or severe headache pain at baseline reduced to none). In both studies, this endpoint was signifi cant f or all doses of lasmiditan versus placebo. The key second ary endpoint was the proportion of pat ients who were free of their migraine -associ ated MBS at 2 hours postdose (defined as the associated symptom present and identified as MBS prior to dosing and then absent at 2 hours). In both studies, this endpo int was si gnificant for all doses of lasmiditan versus placebo. Study LAHL (an open -label, l ong-term safety study of lasmidi tan (100 mg and 200 mg) in the acute treatment of migraine) is a Phase 3, prospective, rando mized study in adults wit h migraine . Patients who com pleted ei ther Study LAHJ or Study LAHK were to have been given the opportunit y to enroll in Study LAHL, which is design ed to assess the safet y and tol erabilit y of long-term intermittent use of lasmiditan 100 mg and lasmiditan 200 mg for the acute treatment of migraine. CCI"
20,page_20,"H8H-JE-LAIH(a) Clinical Protocol Page 20 LY573144Lasmiditan is generally well tolerated . In the Phase 3 studies, a TEAE was defined as an event that first occurred or worsened in severit y after baseline and wi thin 48 hours of a first or second dose (if applicable) of study drug. The most co mmo n TEAEs reported in Study LAHJ/301 and Study LAHK/302 for the 100mg and 200 mg treatment groups were: d izziness ( 15.4% to 17.2%); paresthesia ( 5.8% to 7.2%); somno lence (5 .1% to 6.0%);fatigue (4.1% to 4.0%)and nausea (3.2 % to 3.9%). The m ajority ofthe TEAEs were mild or moderate in severit yand self- limit ing wit h a short duration . 3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment Lasmiditan has been shown to be effect ive for the treatm ent of acute migraine wit h or wi thout aura in adults. In P hase 3 trials, lasmiditan showed statist ically significant superiorit y over placebo forthe primary endpoints including pain freedom and M BSfreedo m at 2 hours after taking study drug. Lasmiditan was generally well tolerated with TEAEs >2% in any lasmiditan group including dizziness, paresthesia, somno lence, fat igue andnausea. Generally , these TEAEs were mild or moderate in severit y and self-limit ing with a short duration. All doses of lasmiditan were associated with driving impair ment in a study of healt hy vo lunteers based on a computer - based driving simulator. Patients should restrict their driving, operation of heavy machinery, or other similar act ivities after taking study drug as described in the informed consent form (ICF) . Based on the statistically significant and clinically relevant effects of lasmiditan for the treatm ent of acute migraine in adults with ident ified safet y issues only including generally mild -to- moderate tol erabili ty issues which are self-limit ing with a short duration , the posi tive benefit to risk profile of lasmiditan supports the conduct of this study to further evaluate and understand the efficacy and safet y of lasmidi tan across a single migraine attack . More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) and reasonably ant icipated AEs of lasmidi tanare to be found in the Investigator’s Brochur e (IB)."

The patient will receive detailed instructio n son the use of the eDiary and on dosing their migraine attack with study drug. 5.1.3. Treatment Period During the treatm ent peri od, pati ents will treat theirmigraine attack with study drug. Patients who completethe assessment for the irmigraine attack treated by study drugwill mo ve to their EoS vi sit. Patie nts will be instructed to treat their migraine attack within 4 hours of pain onset provi ding that the headache severit y is at l east m oderate or severe at the time, is not improving, and no other migraine treatment has b een taken. Patients will be required to record their response to the dose over the next 48 hours using the eDiary starting from prior to taking the drug (pre -dose), and at specific postdose time points of0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 , 24, and 48 hours.

Scientific Rationale for Study Design Study LAIH is conducted as the bridging trial to Study 302/LAHK wit h dose response efficacy in the range of lasmiditan 50 to 200 m g. The primary endpoint i s the superiori ty of lasmidi tan 200mg co mpared with placebo on pain freedom at 2hours postdose. The ke y secondary endpo ints are 1) to assess for dose-dependent efficacy of lasmidi tan 50 to 200 m g on pain free at 2 hours postdose and 2) to eval uate the efficacy of lasmiditan 100 m g compared with placebo on pain relief at 2hours postdose . Pain relief is an indicator of efficacy confirmed by a statist ically significant difference between placebo and lasmiditan 100 mg in Study 302/LAHK and Study 301/LAHJ. Pain relief has been widely used as the primary endpoint in randomized clinical studi es of acute treatment of migraine, including triptans, and has also been established as the primary endpoint in Study COL MIG - 202/H8H- CD-LAHO (Study 202/LAHO). Accordingly , a sample size as l arge as Study 302/LAHK is not required for Study LAIH. For Study LAIH, a sam ple size of approximately 880rando mized patients is sufficient ,as described in Section 10.1.1 . 5.4. Justification for Dose Three doses (lasmiditan 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg) used in the Study 302/LAHK (study for bridging reference ), have been selected in th is Study LAIH in Japanese pat ients with migraine. Two single -attack Phase 3 studies (Study 301/LAHJ and Study 302/LAHK) of lasmiditan have been co mpleted, and these studies show dose- dependent efficacy of lasmidi tan versus pl acebo to increase freedo m from headache pain wit h lasmiditan. All doses (50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg) showed stati stically significant superiorit y versus placebo on pain freedo m, MBS freedo m, and pain relief. In general, the efficacy of lasmiditan was dose dependent, with lasmiditan 50 mg showing the least efficacy and lasmidi tan 200 m g showing the m ost efficacy . Saf ety analysis showed TEAEs were increas ed wi th lasmidi tan compared to pl acebo, with the most comm on AEs being dizziness, paresthesia, somnolence, fat igue, and nausea. In general, these TEAEs were observed to increase in a dose -dependent manner ( i.e., they were l owest wi th lasmidi tan 50 mg and highest with lasmiditan 200 mg). These TEAEs were usually mild to moderate in severit y with a median durati on of 1to 5 hours . CCI"

Method of Treatment Assignment Patients who meet all criteria for enrollment will be randomized at Vi sit 2. The rando mizat ion rati owill be 7:3:7:6 to placebo, lasmiditan 50mg, lasmiditan 100 mg, and lasmiditan 200mg. Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a co mputer -generated random sequence using an interactive web -response system (IWRS) . The IWRS will be used to assign double - blind invest igational product to each patient. To achie ve between -group com parabilit y, the randomizat ion will be stratified (y es or no) for current use of conco mitant m edicat ion(s) that reduce the frequency of migraine episodes. At Visit 2, patients will be provided with study drug to treat asingle migraine attack. Si te personnel will confirm that they have l ocated the correct investigational product by entering a confirmat ion number found on the investigational product into the IWRS before patients leave the site at Visi t 2. 7.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses The actual time of dose administration will be recorded in the patient’s eDiary . Pati ents will be instructed to take 3 tablets as the treatment for a new migraine attack , along wit h the fo llowing instructi ons: Themigraine must beat least of m oderate or severe severit y . The migraine must be treated within 4 hours of pain onset . No pri or analgesic or acute migraine treatment within 24 hours of study drug administration has been taken to treat the current migraine attack. 7.2.1.1.

Informat ion regarding treatment arms will not be disclosed to investigators or patients unt il the fina l database lock. Emergency unblinding for A Es may be perform ed through the IWRS. This option may be used ONLY if the pat ient’s we ll-being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment. All unblinding events are recorded and reported by the IWRS. If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, the patient must be discont inued fro m the study. In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient remain in the study , the investigator must obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly CRP or CRS for the pati ent to conti nue in the study . In case of an emergency, the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a patient’s treatment assignment is warranted for medical management of the event . Patient safet y must al ways be the first considerat ion in making such a determinat ion. If a patient’s treatm ent assi gnment i s unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately .

Primary Efficacy Assessments Patient Diary Patients will be introduced to the eDiary at Visit 1 and trained on the use of the eDiaryat Vi sit 2. Efficacy data will be co llected in theeDiary . Patients will record the date and time at which their migraine headache starts. They will also record severit y andthe date and time o f taking the study drug. Patients will be asked to assess their head ache severit y at specified time points : 0 (pre dose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 24 ,and 48 hours postdose using the IHS 4-point headache severit y rating scale (0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 =moderate pain, and 3 = severe pain) .The eDiary assessments are listed in Appendix 5 . 9.1.2.

The 24- hour MQoLQ is a 15 -item, self -administered questionnaire . The i tems cover 5domains (work functioning , soci alfunct ioning, energy and vitality, feelings and concerns, and migraine symptom s)(Hartm aier et al. 1995; Santanello et al. 1995, 1997) . Each domain consists of 3 questions answered on a 7 -point scale where 1 indicates maximum impairment and 7 indicat ing no impairment. A domain score is calculated by summing the responses to the 3 questions and the domain score ranges fro m 3 to 21. The questionnaire will be administered 24 hours after the study drug. MIDAS : The MIDAS is a pat ient-rated scale which was designed to quantify headache -related disabili ty over a 3 -month peri od. This instrum ent consists of 5 items that reflect the number of days reported as missed, or with reduced productivit y at work or hom e and soci al events. Each question is answered as the number of days during the past 3months of assessment, ranging from 0 to 90, wi th the total score being the summatio n of the 5 numeric responses. A higher value is indicat ive of more disabilit y (Stewart et al . 1999, 2001). This instrument is considered reliable and valid, and is corre lated wi th clinical judgm ent regarding the need for medical care (Stewart et al. 1999, 2001). For clinical interpretabilit y, 4 categori cal grades were developed based on the total score: Grade I (0 to 5) is for litt le or no disabilit y, Grade II (6 to 10) is for mild di sabili ty, Grade III (11 to 20) i s for moderate di sabili ty, and Grade IV (21+) is for severe disabili ty(Stewart et al. 2001) . Two addit ional questions (A and B) collect informat ion on the frequency of headaches and the intensit y of the head ache pain . These are not part of the total MIDAS score but are included to provide clinically relevant informat ion that m ay aid in treatm ent and m anagement decisions . The MIDAS will be captured at screening as part of the inclusio n criteria. Migraine Treatment Optimization Questionnaire-6 ( mTOQ -6): The m TOQ is a validated, self-administered questionnaire that assesses the efficacy of current acute migraine treatment (Lipton et al . 2009 ;Lipton et al . 2015). The items assess the domains o f quick return tofunction, 2-hour pain free , sustained 24-hour pain relief , tolerabili ty, comfortable to make plans , perceived control (Serrano et al 2015). This study will use the 6 -itemversio n (mTOQ -6) wi th Likert ty pe response options of Never ( 1); Rarely (2); Less than half thet ime (3); Half the time or more (4) , producing a range of scores from 1 to 24 . This questionnaire will be administered at Visit 2. EuroQol 5 -Dimension 5- Level (EQ-5D-5L) : EQ-5D- 5L questionnaire is a widely used, generic quest ionnaire that a ssesses health status (The EuroQol Group 1990; Herdman et al. 2011). Thi s is a pati ent-rated scale. The questionnaire consists of 2 parts. The first part assesses 5dimensio ns (mobilit y, self-care, usual act ivities, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on) that have 5 possible levels of response ( no probl ems, slight probl ems, m oderate problems, severe probl ems, extrem e probl ems). This part of the EQ -5D can be used to generate a health state index score, which is used to compute qualit y-adjusted life yea rs for utilizat ion in healt h economic analyses. The healt h state index score is cal culated based on the responses to the 5dimensio ns, providing a single value on a scale from less than 0 (where 0 is a healt h state"
41,page_41,"H8H-JE-LAIH(a) Clinical Protocol Page 41 LY573144equivalent to death; negat ive values are valued as worse than death ) to 1 (perfect healt h), with higher scores indicat ing better healt h utilit y. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analog scale on which the patient rates their perceived healt h state from 0 ( the worst heal th you can imagine ) to 100 ( the best healt h you can imagine ). The EQ -5D- 5L will be captured at Visit 2 and at 0 and 24 hours postdose of study drug . Disability: Disabilit y will be measured by determining the l evel of interference wi th norm al activit ies wit h 4 response options including not at all; mild interference, marked interference; and need co mplete bed rest. This will be evaluated at 0 (pre dose), 0.5, 1, 2 , and 24 hours postdose of study drug . PGI-C: Patient global impression o f change will be measured at 2 and 24 hou rs post dose of study drug with a 7-point scale ranging fro m very much better to very much worse . Treatment Satisfaction : Treatment satisfac tion will be evaluated at 48 hours postdose of the study drug by determining the patient’s level o f satisfact ion (ranging fro m extremely dissatisfied to extremely satisfied ); their willingness to take this treatment again (ranging from s trongly disagree tostrongly agree ) ;if they w ould they recommend this treatm ent to another patient (ranging fro m strongly disagree to strongly agree )andtheirpreference when com paring thi s treatm ent to the previous treatment (“prefer this treatment in co mpar ison to my previ ous treatm ent” to “prefer my previ ous treatm ent in comparison to this treatment” ). 9.1.3. Appropriateness of Assessments The assessments collected during this study are standard and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and rel evant. The study has one primary endpoint. P ain freedo m at 2hours postdose is a recommended primary endpoint to assess efficacy of a migraine treatment (Tfelt-Hansen 2012). Based on regulatory guidance for this bridging study , the other assessments are also consistent with regulatory guidance and are commonly used in studi es of medicat ions for acute treatm ent of migraine. Pain relief has been the primary endpoint in previous migraine rando mized clinical trials of acute treatment of migraine, including triptans, and has also been established as the primary endpoint in Study 202/LAHO . 9.2. Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patientswho have entered this study and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of patientsduring the study. Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused the patient to discontinue the invest igational product before"

The patientshoul d be f ollowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. The frequency o f follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to t he discret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via electroni c case report form (eCRF ) the occurrence and nature of each pat ient’s preexisting condit ions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study . In addit ion, site personnel will record any change in the condit ion(s) and any new c onditions as AEs . Invest igators should record the following via eCRF for each AE: time of onset, time of terminat ion, severit y, and their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure and investigational product. The invest igator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent or a study procedure, taking into account the disease, concomitant treatment or pathologies. A “reasonable p ossibilit y” means that there is a cause and effect relat ionship between the investigat ional product, study device and/or study procedure and the AE. The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient ’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study si te personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF , clarifying if possible, the circumstances leading to discontinuations of treatment. 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that results in one of the fo llowing outcom es: Death. Initial or prolonged inpat ient hospi talizat ion. Alife-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying). Persistent or si gnificant disabilit y/incapacit y. Congeni tal anom aly/bi rth defect ."

Examples of such m edical even ts include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at hom e, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AEs occurring after si gning the ICF are recorded in the eCRF and assessed for serious criteria. The SAE reporting to the sponsor begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the SAE should be reported to the sponsor as per SAE reporting requirements and t imelines (see Sect ion 9.2) if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. Once the SAE eCRF form is init iated, an email is autom atically triggered to the sponsor’s global pat ient safet y departm ent. Invest igators can contact the sponsor via telephone at any t ime using the qualified medical personnel or Lilly affiliate medical contact details which are provided in the site study file. If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immedi ately fo llowed wi th official notification via completion of the SAE eCRF. If the eCRF is unavailable (for example, for sy stem maintenance) for a peri od of time that would compro mise the si tes’ abilit y to report an event within 24-h ours of awareness, a paper version of the form should be downloaded from the Invest igatorSpace portal , com pleted by the invest igator, and submitted via fax to the sponsor’s global pat ient safet y departm ent. Thi s form includes a fax cover page that is pre -popul ated wi th the appropri ate fax number. Serious adverse events submitted via the paper method are entered into the eCRF once the database is available . The 24- hour notification requirement refers to t he initial SAE inform ation and all fo llow-up SAE information .If alerts are i ssued via tel ephone, they are to be immediately followed wi th official notificat ion on study -specific SAE forms. This 24 -hour notification requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up SAE inform ation.Patients with a seri ous hepat ic AEshoul d have addi tional data collected using the eCRF . Pregnancy ( during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in patientsonce they have discont inued and/or completed the study (the patientdisposit ion CRF has been completed). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly ."
44,page_44,"H8H-JE-LAIH(a) Clinical Protocol Page 44 LY5731449.2.1.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or procedure. United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the associ ated detailed guidances or nat ional regulatory requirements in participat ing countries requi re the reporting of SUSARs. Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the ident ificat ion, recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regul ations and the associated detailed guidances. 9.2.2. Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study participants, monitor qualit y, and to facilitate process and product improvements. Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product so that the situation can be assessed. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose Refer to the IB. 9.4. Safety The safet y assessments are described below. 9.4.1. Electrocardiograms For each patient,a single 12 -lead di gital ECG willbe co llected locally according to the Schedule of Activities (Secti on2). There will be no central reading of ECGs. Electrocardiograms should be co llected prior to blood draws. Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collect ion and remain supine but awake during ECG collect ion. Invest igators may repeat an ECG collect ion as medi cally neede d. Any clinically significant findings fro m ECGs that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the patient receives the dose of the invest igational treatment should be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF. 9.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs will include body temperature, bl ood pressure, and pulse. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured in the sitting posit ion prior to bl ood draw s, according to the Schedule of Activities (Secti o n2)and fo llowing the study -specific reco mmendat ions included in the Manual of Operati ons for the study . Any clinically significant findings from vital signs measurement that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the patientreceives the dose of study drug shoul d be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE viaeCRF ."
45,page_45,"H8H-JE-LAIH(a) Clinical Protocol Page 45 LY5731449.4.3. Laboratory Tests For each patient, laboratory tests detailed in ( Appendix 2 ) shoul d be conducted according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2). Lilly or its designee will provi de the invest igator with the results of laboratory tests analyzed by a central vendor, if a central vendor is used for the clinical trial. Any clinically significant findings from laboratory tests that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the pati ent receives the dose of invest igational product should be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF . 9.4.4. Other Tests C -SSRS: A scale that captures the occurrence, severit y,and frequency of suicide -related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period (Posner et al. 2011). The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the ty pe of information neede d to determine if a suicide -related thought or behavior occurred. The C -SSRS i s administered by an appropri ately trained healt hcare professio nal wit h at l east 1 y ear of patient care/clinical experience according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2). Thetool was devel oped by the National Inst itute of Mental Health (NIMH) trial group (T reatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters Study ) for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algorithm o f Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) categori zation of suicidal events . Two versions of the C- SSRS will be used: The screening version will be ad ministered at Screening/Visit 1 . The “since last visit” versio n will be a dministered at Vi sit 2 and Visi t 3 (EoS). If present, suicide ideation will be classified in 5 classes (1- 5), the intensit y of suicidal i deati on will be classified in 5 dimensions, and any suicidal behavi or will be classified in 6 classes (actual attem pt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts towards and attempt, suicidal behavior, suicide). The nonleading AE collect ion shoul d occur pri or to the collect ion of the C -SSRS. If a suicide-related event is discovered during the C -SSRS but was not captured during the nonleading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form. If an event is serious or leads to discontinuat ion, thi s is an except ion where the SAE and/or AE leading to discont inuat ion should be included on the AE form a nd the process for reporti ng SAEs shoul d be fo llowed. Assessment of driving accidents/violations: In order to further evaluate the impact of lasmiditan on driving, patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire about motor vehicle accidents and m oving violations according to the Schedule o f Activities (Section 2). 9.4.5. Safety Mon itoring Lilly will periodically review ev olving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate methods."

Sample Size Determination Approximately 1157 patients will be screened to achieve approximately 880 patients rando mized, and approximately 624patients with data for a migraine attack. 10.1.1. Sample Size Rationale Table LAIH. 5illustrates the power calculat ion. The power calculat ion is based on the results of the Study 302/LAHK study .The primary endpo int (headache pain free at 2 hours postdose) results inStudy 302/LAHK were 21.3%, 28.6%, 31. 4%, and 38.8% for placebo, lasmiditan 50 mg, lasmiditan 100 mg, and lasmiditan 200 mg, respectively, and the rates of headache pain relief at 2 hours postdose were 47.7%, 59.0%, 64.8%, and 65.0% for placebo, l asmidi tan 50 m g, lasmiditan 100 mg, and lasmiditan 200 mg, respectively . To ensure sufficient total statist ical power for the primary and two key secondary analyses, the number of rando mized pat ients will be set at 880. This sample size has85.6% power. More specifically , the study will include : Number of screened patients = 1157. Number of rando mized pat ients = 880(=1157 *0.76, approximately 24% screen failure based on assumpt ions from LAIJ ), with [placebo:l asmidi tan 50 mg:lasmiditan 100mg:lasmiditan 200mg] =268:114:268:230 (7:3:7:6 ratio) fortheattack. Number of patients who have anattack = 624(=880*0.71, approximately 29% of patients woul dnot dose to treat a migraine attack during the 8 week periodbased on Study 302/LAHK /Study 301/LAHJ ), with [placebo :lasmidi tan 50 m g:lasmiditan 100 mg:lasmiditan 200 mg ] = 190:81:190:163 (7:3:7:6 ratio) .
