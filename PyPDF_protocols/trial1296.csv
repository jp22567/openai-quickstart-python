ABSTRACT TitleObservational, real-world study of INFLECTRA in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the United States and Canada; Version 3.0; 25 January 2018; , MD. MSc. MPH, , Pfizer, Inc. Rationale and Background In September 2013 CT-P13 (infliximab-dyyb), the first biosimilar in the class of TNF- α therapies, was approved in Europe, and marketed as REMSIMA ®and INFLECTRA.®The biosimilar was approved for use based on clinical trials conducted in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis. This European approval was extended to all of the other indications for which the originator product, REMICADE ®(infliximab) was approved, based on the concept of extrapolation.1The European Medicines Agency concluded that extrapolation of clinical efficacy and safety profile data to other indications of the originator product, not specifically studied during the clinical development of the biosimilar waspossible based on the overall evidence of comparability provided from the comparability exercise and included adequate justification that the products did not differ in a clinically meaningful manner. In response to concern from gastroenterologists on the lack of clinical data supporting the utilization of INFLECTRA in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]), 2researchers in Europe and Asia initiated prospective and retrospective studies to collect real world data on the use of INFLECTRA in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 3-9The published results of these studies showed that there was no difference in the safety and efficacy between the originator and the biosimilar. In April 2016, INFLECTRA, was approved by the FDA for the following indications: 10 •adult patients and pediatric patients (ages six years and older) with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy; •adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy; •patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate; •patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (arthritis of the spine); •patients with active psoriatic arthritis; •adult patients with chronic severe plaque psoriasis. To date, there has been no real world data published on the use of INFLECTRA in the US population. PPD PPD"

It was initially approved in the United States in August 1998 for the treatment of Crohn’s disease (CD),11in November 1999 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA),12and September 2005 for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC).13In 2011, Remicade was approved for use in pediatric forms of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative co litis. I t is also approved for treatment of anky losing spondy litis, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis.13 In September 2013 CT-P13(inflixi mab- dyyb), t he first biosimilar in the class of TNF- α therapies, was approved in Europe, a nd marketed as REMSI MA®and INFLECTRA.®The biosimilar was approved for use based on clinical trials conducted in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ank ylosing Spondy litis. Th is approval was extended to all of the other indications for which the originator product, REMI CADE®(infliximab) was approved, based on the concept of extrapolation1The European Medicines Agency concluded that e xtrapolation of clinical efficacy and safet y profile data to other indications of the o riginator product, not specificall y studied during the clinical development of the biosimilar was poss ible based on the overall evidence of comparability provided from the compara bility exercise and included adequate justification that the products did not differ in a clinically meaningful manner.. In response to concern from gastroenterologists on the la ck of clinical da ta supporting the utilization of INFLECTRA in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]) ,2researchers in Europe and Asia initiated prospective and retrospective studies to collect real world data on the use of INFLECTRA i n patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).3-9The published results of these studies reported no significant difference in t he safet y and efficacy between the originator and the biosimilar. In Hungary , Gecse et al4conducted a prospective, nationwide, multicenter observational cohort study of 210 consecutivel y enrolled patients with IBD (n=126 UC, n=84 UC) initiatin g treatment with INFLECTRA. At week 14, 81.4% of CD and 77.6% of UC patients showed a clinical response and 53.6% of CD and 58.6% of UC patients were in clinical remission. Clinical remission rates at week 14 were significantl y higher in CD and UC patients who were infliximab naïve, compared with those with previous exposure to the Remicade [p < 0.05]. Adverse events wer e reported in 17.1% of all patients through week30. Infusion reactions and infectious adverse events occurred in 6.7% and 5.7% of all patients, re spectivel y."
12,page_12,"INFLECTRA C1231006 NON-INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOLAmendment 3, 09 September 2020 Pfizer Confidential Page 13 of 58In the Netherlands, Smits et al8conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 83 patients with IBD (57 CD, 24 UC, 2 IBD-Undefined). The median change in disease activity (Harvey-Bradshaw Index) was 0 for CD and 0 for UC/IBD-U. Median CRP and FCP levels did not change significantly during follow-up. The median infliximab trough level increased from 3.5 ­g/ml [range 0–18] to 4.2 ­g/ml [range 0–21] at week 16 [p = 0.010]. Two patients developed a new detectable anti-drug antibody (ADA) response during follow-up and 5 patients discontinued INFLECTRA. No serious adverse events occurred. In Norway, Jorgensen et al. 14conducted randomized, non-inferiority, double-blind phase 4 trial with 52 weeks of follow up (NOR-SWITCH). Patients who enrolled in the study were randomized to remain on infliximab or switch CT-P13. A total of 482 patients enrolled (241 to infliximab, 241 to CT-P13). Patients had a mix of autoimmune diseases(32% Crohn’s disease, 19% ulcerative colitis, 16% ankylosing spondylitis, 16% rheumatoid arthritis, 7% chronic plaque psoriasis 6% psoriatic arthritis). Disease worsening occurred in 26% of the infliximab group, and 30% in the CT-P13 group (per-protocol set; adjusted treatment difference −4·4%, 95% CI −12·7 to 3·9). The frequency of adverse events was similar between groups (for serious adverse events, 24 (10%) for infliximab originator vs 21 [9%] for CT-P13. The NOR-SWITCH trial showed that switching from infliximab to CT-P13 was not inferior to continued treatment with infliximab. In April 2016, INFLECTRA, was approved by the FDA for the following indications: 10 •adult patients and pediatric patients (ages six years and older) with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy; •adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy; •patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate; •patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (arthritis of the spine); •patients with active psoriatic arthritis; •adult patients with chronic severe plaque psoriasis. To date, there has been no real world data published on the use of INFLECTRA in the US population. This non-interventional study is designated as a Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) and is conducted voluntarily by Pfizer."

Recrui tedphysicians and/or their assigned staff will be responsible for patient identification, qualification and selection, patient interview, exam taking, data abstraction, and completion of the patient CRF. Physicians and /or site staff will be instructed to assign a unique identifier for each patient enrolled in the study to facilitate follow -up on data queries and for data validation. Patient data will be de - identified and will be reported in aggregate. Patient clinical data should be abstracted from the patient’s medical chart, or in the case of the patient reported outcome measures, from the assessment tools themselves, which will serve as the source document. No other source documents will be prov ided. Clinical data will be collected in electronic for m by the participating phy sician or in collaboration with the designated site personnel. Physicians will be provided with written handouts/instructions and will be periodicall y contacted, at least mo nthly until completi on and submission of all the forms. Completed forms will be thoroughl y reviewed and coded after entry into the database. At least 30% of the completed forms will be randomly selected for validations against the source document on key CRF data points such as informed consent date, diagnosis, safety events, and clinical outcomes etc. b y clinical research associates (CRAs). In addition, data validation will include frequency counts, array s, and distributions, running descriptive statistic s on continuous vari ables, and 100% computer logic check s. Any outliers and/or missing data will be directly resolved with the participating phy sicians. 8.5.Study Size The primary objective for this study is descriptive in nature. As such, precision estimate s (PEs) have been pr ovided at the 95% confidence level, in lieu of power calculations. Table 10. Sample Size for Different Precision Levels (Assuming 95% Confidence Level) Sample Size for Precision of: Percent of patients with a given risk factor ±1% ±2.5% ±5% ±10% 90% 3458 554 139 35 70% 8068 1291 323 81 50% 9604 1537 385 97 The enrollment of new patients was stopped before reaching the minimum sample size (N = 139) determined to be necessary . The primary reason for discont inuing recruitment was lack of formulary availability /insurance coverage of infliximab -dyyb during patient enrollment . Due to the lack of uptake of biosimilars/I nflectra in the US, fewer study sites than planned were able to identify and recruit patients because infliximab -dyyb was not on their formulary or pat ient insurance would not cover infliximab -dyyb. To resolve this issue,"
23,page_23,"INFLECTRA C1231006 NON -INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL Amend ment 3, 09September 2020 Pfize r Confidential Page 24of 58the patient enrollment timeframe was extended one y ear bey ond the planned enrollment time, and even with this extension, the study only reached 118 pat ients. The final analy tical sample included 115 patients after excluding 1 patient due to not meeting inclusion criteria and 2 additional patients because they did not receive infliximab -dyyb due to being given RP infliximab at thei r infusion center/pharma cy. 8.6.Data Management As used in th is protocol, the term case report form (CRF) should be understood to ref er to an electronic data record . Patient completed questionnaires will provided in paper form to the patients and the data wi ll be transcribed into t he CRF. Site staff will be requir ed to archive all original paper questionnaires in the local site file. A CRF is required and should be completed for each enrolled patient . The completed original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfi zer and should not be ma de available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the accuracy ,authenticit y, and timel y collection and reporting of all clinical, safety , laboratory data entered on the CRFs and an y other data collection forms. The CRFs must be signed b y the investigator to attest that the data contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries mad e in the CRFs, source documents mu st be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the original entry . In most cases, the source documents are the patient’s chart. In these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the d ata in those charts. In some cases, the C RF,or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearl y identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand a s the source document. Upon completion of final anal yses, a clean, de -identified database will be delivered to Pfizer in the Pfizer preferred format, ty picall y SAS. Data cleaning, validations, and d atabase lock will be con ducted prior to the statistical analyses. Data validations include 30% of completed CRFs being randomly selected to have predetermined key data points validated directly with participating phy sicians against the source document, and 100% machine checks, reporting of the proportion of missi ng data at the item/individual variable level, examina tion of frequencies and distributions, as well as the generation of descriptive statistics. Missing data for information documented within the m edical record will be rare because of the rigorous data co llection and validation procedures that will be emplo yed. Any missing or illegible data on an y CRF will result in contacting the ph ysician directl y and submitting the form for validation of the missing data against the patient’s medical chart.

Con tinuous endpoints will be summarized in the form of means, standard deviation (SD), median, interquartile ranges (IQR) and range; a 95% confiden ce interval (CI ) for the mean will also be computed. Pearson ’s chi -squared tests will be used for bivariate sta tistical testing of categorical and ordinal outcomes. Student’s t -tests or 1- way ANOVA will be used for comparisons of continuous outcomes.

Limitations of the R esearch M ethods Treatment patterns, and o utcomes measured within this study represent only th e pra ctices of physicians who have agreed to participate in this study , and may vary from non -responding physicians, ie, those who refused study participation, or failed to complete the study requirements on time and were excluded from the study , or who we re un responsive to the screening invitation. Though efforts are made to en sure ph ysician/patient inclusion /exclusion criteria are based on random selection, there are, neverth eless, risks of selection bi as. By abstracting patient lab results done prior to the infusion visit it may not reflect their current lab test results accur ately. Test done in different ways that are not standardized may also vary the qualit y of lab test. Not all patient characteristics will be included in the data collection (eg, inc ome a nd other variables which may influence ph ysician -prescribing behavior or treatment decisions) and cannot be accounted for in the descriptive or multivariate anal yses. Information collected on the physician survey will include best estimates of patien ts’ treatment patterns but doesnot equate with a complete, detailed examin ation and anal ysis of all potential at -risk or diagnosed patient records at each phy sician’s site/practice. Although physicians seek to r ecord all patient experiences through exami nation and review of the medical charts, there may be some undercounting of events that are unknown to phy sicians, which may have occurred outside the office and are therefore under- represented. This may also refer to AEs. It has to be expected that not all non-serious AEs will be documented in patient charts. Furthermore, inf ormation regarding hospitalizations, ER visits, or any associated healthcare resource utilization may or may not be documented wi thin the chart. Given this, healthcare resource uti lization in particular is likely to be underestimated particularl y in ph ysicians who practice in a full y outpatient setting. Because of the nature of this observational study , all clinical outcomes could be influenced by measurement error. 8.10.

The investigator must ensure that eac h study patient is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the stud y and possible risks associated with participation. The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will o btain written informe d consent from each patient before an y stud y-specific activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each patient's signed consent form. 9.2.Patient Withdrawal Patients may withdraw from the study at an y time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at an y time a t the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety , behavioral, or administrative reasons. In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investig atorshould inquire a bout the reason for withdrawal and fo llow-up with the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events. If the patient withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, an d no additional data should be collec ted. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 9.3. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospec tive approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, and info rmed consent forms, and other relevant documents, ( eg,recruitment advertisements), if applicable, from the I RB/IEC. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retai ned in the Investigat or File.

The review er is obligated to report adverse events (AE) with explicit attribution to any Pfizer drug that appear in the reviewed information (defined per the patient population and study period specified in the pro tocol). Explicit attribution is not inferred by a tempora l relationship between drug administration and an AE, but must be based on a definite statement of causality by a healthcare provider linking drug administration to the AE . The requirements for repo rting safety events on the non -interventional study (NIS) adverse event monitoring (AEM) Report Form to Pfizer Safet y are as follows: All serious and non- serious AEs with explicit att ribution to any Pfizer drug that appear in the reviewed information by the investigator must be recorded on the case report f orm (C RF) and reported, within 24 hours of awareness, to Pfizer Safety using the NI S AEM Report Form . Scenarios involving drug expo sure, including exposure during pregnancy, exposure during breast feeding, medication error, overdose, misuse, extravasation, lack of efficacy and occupational exposure associated with the use of a Pfi zer product must be reported, within 24 hours of awaren ess, to Pfizer Safet y using the NI S AEM Report Form. For these safet y events with an explicit attribution to or associated wi th use of, respectively , a Pfizer product, the data captured in the medical record will constitute all clinical information known r egarding these adverse events. No follow - up on related adverse events wi ll be conducted. All research staff members will complete the Pfizer requirements regard ing training on the following: “Your Reporting Responsibilities: Monitoring the Safety, Performance and Quality of Pfizer Products (Multiple Languages)” and an y releva nt Your Reporting Responsibilities supplemental trai ning. This training will be provided to all research staff members prior to study start. All trainings include a “Confirmation of Training Certificate” (for signature b y the trainee) as a record of comp letion of the training, which must be kept in a retr ievabl e format. Copies of all signed training certificates must be provided to Pfizer."

In addition, an investigator may be requested b y Pfizer to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion. T his in formation is more detailed than that recorded on the case report form . In general, this will include a description of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assess ment of the case and independent determination of poss ible c ausalit y. Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be s ubmitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its designated rep resentati ve. Reporting Period For each patient, the safety event reporting period begins at the time of the patient’s informed consent if s/he is alread y exposed to INFLECTRA , and lasts through t he end of the observation period of the study , which m ust in clude at least 28 calendar day s following the last administration of a drug under stud y; a report must be submitted to Pfizer Safet y (or its designated representative) for an y of the t ypes of safe ty events listed in the table above occurring during t his pe riod. Ifa patient was administered a drug under study on the last day of the observation period, then the reporting period should be extended for 28 calendar day s following the end of observatio n. Most often, the date of informed consent is the sa me as the date of enrollment. In some situations, there may be a lag between the dates of informed consent and enrollment. In these instances, if a patient provides informed consent but is never enrol led in the study (eg, patient changes his/her mind abo ut par ticipatio n, failed screening criteria, the reporting period ends on the date of the decision to not enroll the patient. If the investigator becomes aware of a S AE occurring at an y time after comp letion of the study and s/heconsiders the SAE to be r elated to INFLE CTRA , theSAE also must be reported to Pfizer Safet y. Causality A ssessment The investigator is required to assess and record the causal relationship . For all AEs , sufficient information should be obtained by the investigator to determine the cau sality of each adverse event. For AEs with a causal relationship to INFLECTRA , follow -up by the investigator is required until the event and/or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level accept able to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that asses sment. An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that INFLECTRA caused or contributed to an adverse event. If the investigator’ s final determination of causality is “unknown” and s/ he cannot dete rmine whether INFLECTRA caused the event, the safet y event must be reported within 24 hours. If the investigator cannot determine the etiology of the event but s/he determines that INFLEC TRA did not cause the event, this should be clearly document ed on th e case report form and the NI S AEM Report Form."

The eve nt need not necessarily have a causal relationship wit h the product treatment or usage. Examples of adverse events include but are not limited to: Abnormal test findings (see below for circumstances in which an abnormal test finding constitutes an adver se event); Clinically significant symptoms and signs ; Change s in phy sical examination findings ; Hypersensitivity ; Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ; Lack of efficacy ; Drug abuse; Drug dependency . Additionally , for medicinal products , they may include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from: Drug ove rdose ; Drug withdrawal ; Drug misuse; Off-label use; Drug interactions; Extravasation; Exposure during pregnancy ; Exposure during breast feeding ; Medication error; Occupational exposure."
34,page_34,"INFLECTRA C1231006 NON -INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL Amend ment 3, 09September 2020 Pfize r Confidential Page 35of 58Abnormal Test F indings The criteria for determining whether an abnor mal ob jective test finding should be reported as an adverse event are as follows: Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or , Test result requires additional diagnostic testing o r med ical/surg ical intervention; and/or , Test result leads to a c hange in study dosing or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant d rug treatment, or other therap y;and/or , Test result is considered to be an adverse event b y the investigator or sponsor. Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not constitute an adverse event. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse event. Serious A dverse E vents A serious adverse event is any untoward medica l occurrence in a patient administered a medicinal or nutritional product (including pediatric formulas) at an y dose that: Results in death; Is life -threatening ; Requires inpatient hospitalizatio nor prolongation of hospitalization (see below for circumsta nces that do not constitute adverse events); Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); Results in congen ital anomaly /birth defect . Medical and scientific judgm ent is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, i f it is determined that the event may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above , the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive t reatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronch ospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse."
35,page_35,"INFLECTRA C1231006 NON -INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL Amend ment 3, 09September 2020 Pfize r Confidential Page 36of 58Additionally , any suspected t ransmission via a Pfizer product of an infectious agent, pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is con sidere d serious. The event may be suspected from clinical sy mptoms or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a Pfizer product. The t erms “suspected transmission” and “tran smission” are considered synony mous. These cases are considered unexpected and handled as serious expedited cases by PV personnel. Such cases are also considered for reporting as product defects, if appropriate. Hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a hospital or equivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation to an existing admission . Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/in tensive care unit ( eg, from the psy chiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coron ary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessaril y constitute a hospitalization; however, an event leading to an emergency room visit should be asse ssed for medical importance. Hospitalization in the a bsence of a medical AE is not in itself an AE and is not reportable. For example, the following reports of hospitalization without a medical AE are not to be reported. Social admission (eg, patient ha s no place to sleep); Administrative admission (eg, fo r yearly exam); Optional admission not associated with a precipitating medical AE (eg, for elective cosmetic surgery ); Hospitalization for observation without a me dical AE; Admission for treatment of a pre-existing condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the pre -existing condition (eg, for work -up of persistent pre- treatment lab abnormality); Protocol -specified admission duri ng clinical stud y (eg, for a procedure required by the study protocol). Scenarios Necessitati ng Rep orting to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours Scenarios involving exposure during pregnancy , exposure during breastfeeding, medication error, overdose, misuse, ex travasation , lack of efficacy , and occupational exposure are described below."

A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed to(eg, enviro nmental) INFLECTRA , or the female becom es, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to INFLECTRA (maternal exposure) . An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman ( eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic produc ts). 2. A male has been exposed , either due to treatment or environmental exposure to INFLECTRA prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during the partner pregnancy (paternal exposure) . As a general rule, prospective and retrospectiv e expo sure during pregnancy reports from an y source are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE and the procedures for SAE reporting shoul d be followed. If a stud y participant or stu dy participant ’s partner becomes, or is found to be, p regnan t during the stud y participant ’s treatment with INFLECTRA , this information must be submit tedto Pfizer, irrespective of whether an adverse event has oc curred using the NIS AEM Report Form and the EDP Supplemental Form . In addition, the information regard ing environmental exposure to INFLECTRA in a pregnant woman ( eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by inhalation or spillage) must be submitted usi ng the NIS AEM Report Form and the EDP supplemental fo rm. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred. Information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for infor mation related to termination of pregnancy ). Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy ; in addition, follow -up is conducted to obtain information on EDP outcome for all EDP reports with pregnancy outcome unknown . Apregnancy isfollowed until completion or until pregnanc y termination ( eg, induced abortion) and Pfizer is not ified of the outcome. This information is provided as a follow up to the initial EDP report. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for term inatio n should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gros s visual inspection (unl ess pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reporte d)."

Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion; Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality , as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possib ly related to exposure to investigational product . Additiona l information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested. Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis ( eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure , the study participant will be provided with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. Itmust be document edthat the study participant was given this letter to provi de to his partner . Exposure During B reastfeeding Scena rios o f exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated AE. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not cr eated when a Pfizer drug specificall y approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is admi nister ed in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an AE associated with such a drug’s administration, the AE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. Medica tion E rror A medication error is an y unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing or administration of a medicinal product that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while in t he control of the health care professional, pa tient, or consumer. Such events may be related to pro fessional practice, health care products, procedures, and s ystems including: prescribing; order communication; product labeling, packaging, and nomenclature ; compounding; dispensing; distribution; admin istration; education; monitoring; and use. Medication error s include: Near misses, involving or not involving a patient directly (eg, inadvertent/erroneous administration, which is the accidental use of a product outside of labeling or prescription on the part of the healthcare provider or the patient/consumer); Confusion with regard to invented name ( eg, trade name, brand name) ."
