EFFICACY PARAMETERS Patient’s assessments: • Major Symptom Score (MSS): MSS will be assessed by the patient at screening ( Visit 1) and immediately before randomization ( Visit 2; this will constitute the baseline value). Both MSS assessments will be transcribed from the Trial Specific Source Form (TSSF) in to the CRF. Thereafter , the patient will document the MSS in the patient diary once a day before the intake of the morning dose, starting with Day 2 until Day 14 (end of treatment or earlier in case of drop- out). The last MSS will be will be assessed by the patient during Visit 6 and transcribed into the CRF . • Sino -Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT -22) questionnaire : SNOT -22 will be assessed by the patient in the patient diary on Day 1, Day 7 and Day 14. Investigator’s assessments: • Investigator’s assessment of the overall response to treatment: The investigator will assess the overall response to treatment at each visit after baseline: on D ay 4 (Visit 3), Day 7 (Visit 4) , Day 10 (Visit 5), and Day 15 (Visit 6). SAFETY PARAMETERS • Adverse events (AEs): AEs will be recorded by the investigator at each visit until the follow -up phone call (within 7 days after Visit 6 or earlier in case of premature termination) . AEs will be assessed for seriousness, severity and drug- event relationship. • Vital signs: Blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature will be recorded at each visit: at screening (Visit 1), immediately before randomi zation (Visit 2; this will constitute the baseline value), and on Day 4 (Visit 3), Day 7 (Visit 4) , Day 10 (Visit 5), and Day 15 (Visit 6). • Safety laboratory: Hematology and blood chemistry at screening (Visit 1) and at Visit 6 . In all female patients a serum pregnancy test for measurement of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) will be performed at screening (Visit 1 ) and at Visit 6 . • Overall assessment of tolerability by the patient and by the investigator on Day 7 (Visit 4) and Day 15 (Visit 6).

DATASETS FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS • Safety Set: all randomi zed patients who receive d at least one dose of the trial medication. • Full-Analysis Set (FAS): all randomi zed patients who received at least one dose of the trial medication and who have at least one post-baseline assessment of MSS during the double- blind treatment period. • Per-Protocol Set (PPS): all FAS -evaluable patients who completed the double- blind treatment period without major protocol violations that could affect the efficacy evaluation. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Efficacy: Efficacy of the test product will be shown by testing superiority of the three different doses in a hierarchical test procedure starting from the highest to the low est dose compared to placebo. Hierarchical ordered hypotheses will be tested at the type I error rate of α=0.05 (two- sided) until the first non- rejection. No error rate adjustment is required. For the primary efficacy an endpoint analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be carried out using treatment and center as factors and baseline MSS as a covariate. The trial will be powered to demonstrate superiority of the test product over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint. The confirmatory analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed in the FAS. In addition, the analyses used for the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed in the PPS. This analysis is intended to provide supportive evidence and will be considere d descriptive."

All safety data obtained in this trial will be tabulated descriptively with descriptive group statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, number of valid cases) where appropriate. This will include also the overall assessment of tolerability by the patient and by the investigator on Day 7 (Visit 4) and Day 15 (Visit 6). AEs will be summari zed by primary system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). Severity and drug- event relationship of treatment emergent AEs are summari zed separately. All adverse events will be listed. Vital signs, including changes from baseline will be summari zed. A frequency table will be presented for abnormal values of laboratory parameters. CALCULATION OF SAMPLE SIZE The sample size is calculated in respect of the primary endpoint. For the calculation of sample size, the following parameters were taken into consideration based on data published by Jund et al. (2015)1: α = 0.05 (two- sided) ß = 0.20 (power = 80%) mean MSS change (test) = 5.4 mean MSS change (placebo) = 4.5 Standard deviation = 3.4 Randomi zation ratio = 1 (1:1:1:1, 3 doses of test vs. placebo) Sample size per group: = 225 subjects The numbers above refer to the FAS.

Prevalence rates vary from 6 -15% depending on the study parameters, although studies specifying ARS report 6 -12%, with a prevalence of recurrent ARS estimated at 0.035%. The primary causes of ARS are viruses with 0.5 -2.0% of patients developing acute bacterial rhinosinusitis secondary to a viral infection. Prevalence of ARS varies with season (higher in the winter months) and climatic variations, and increasing with a damp environment and air pollution (European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps; Fokkens et al., 201212). ARS in adults is defined as: Sudden onset of two or more symptoms :  nasal blockage/ obstruction/ congestion  or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip)  ± facial pain/pressure  ± reduction or loss of smell for <12 weeks . ARS can be sub- divided into “acute viral rhinosinusitis (synonymous with “common cold”), in which the duration of symptoms is less than 10 days, usually a self -limiting condition that frequently does not present to clinicians, and “acute post-viral rhinosinusitis”, defined by an increase in symptoms after 5 days or persistence beyond 10 days. Typical symptoms of spontaneous rhinovirus infections peak at days 2 to 3 and wane thereafter but may persist 14 days or longer. Symptoms of viral rhinosinusitis may persist for longer than 10 days, but they gradually decrease in severity (see figure below taken from Rosenfeld et al., 2015 13; US Clinical Practice Guideline on Adult Sinus itis)."
30,page_30,"HEXAL AG Trial Protocol Acetylcysteine 600 mg effervescent tablet Study No.: 2018-08 -EFT-1 / C1018001 EudraCT No.: 2019-000060-20 Study Protocol Version Final 5.0, 14-Aug -2020 CONFIDENTIAL page 30 of 82 According to the German Society of General Practice/Family Medicine (DEGAM, 201714), viral rhinosinusitis episodes are clinically cured after a maximum of three weeks. A clinician should diagnose acute “bacterial” rhinosinusitis (ABRS) when sympto ms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms. Fever is present in some patients with viral rhinosinusitis in the first few days of illness but does not predict bacterial infection as an isolated diagnostic criterion. Fever has a sensitivity and specificity of only about 50% for ABRS. Adjunctive treatments for rhinosinusitis that may aid in symptomatic relief include analgesics, decongestants (α- adrenergic), corticosteroids, saline irrigation, and mucolytics. None of these products has been specifically approved by the FDA for use in ARS (as of March 2014), and only some have data from controlled clinical studies supporting this use. Moreover, existing trials often include co- interventions and a heterogeneous population of patients with viral, recurrent bacterial, chronic, and allergic rhinosinusitis. With regard to mucolytics the “European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 12” states: “Mucolytics are used as adjuncts to antibiotic and/or decongestant treatment in ARS in order to reduce the viscosity of sinus secretion. Although some drugs have been shown to have mucolytic effect and were recommended as adjunct treatment for ARS, the benefit of such treatment is not clear due to the lack of standardization in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs, and also double- blinded, placebo- controlled (DBPC) randomized studies to prove their efficacy. In future, more standardization of mucolytics and larger scale DBPC randomized studies still need to be done in order to fully assess the efficacy of mucolytics in the treatment of ARS.” This position is also transparent in the current guideline on rhinosinusitis of the “German Society of General Practice/Family Medicine” (DEGAM, 2017), stating that mucolytics like acetylcysteine or ambroxol are commonly used as adjunctive therapies, although the benefit of these medications lacks clinical evidence. 6.2 Mode of Action of Acetylcysteine Acetylcysteine (NAC) is the N -acetyl derivative of the amino acid L -cysteine and a precursor in the formation of the antioxidant glutathione in the body. The thiol (sulfhydryl) group confers antioxidant effects and is able to reduce free radicals. The mucolytic activity of NAC is considered to be dual in origin: (1) its sulfhydryl group breaks the disulfide bonds between the mucopolysaccharide fibers, and (2) disrupts polymerization bonds of DNA fibers (in purulent mucus). These mechanisms are thought to decrease the viscosity of the mucus. Oral preparations containing up to 600 mg of NAC as a single dose have been marketed by pharmaceutical companies within the EU to a large extent for many decades, with recognized efficacy and proven safety in the mucolytic treatment of lower respiratory pathologies such as acute and chronic bronchitis and related diseases."

There is parallelism in the pathologies of upper and lower airways: Thus we find comparable symptoms of cellular inflammation with a predominance of eosinophilia in bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis. Likewise, there are analogies between acute and chronic bronchitis and rhinosinusitis, in which the neutrophilic inflammation is predominant. Given the well -established use of acetylcysteine in bronchitis, it makes sense to pursue this therapeutic approach in rhinosinusitis as well. Indeed the first clinical investigations were reported more than 50 years ago. In a study of 32 sinusitis patients treated with a NAC solution administered by sinus irrigations, the authors concluded that NAC is an effective mucolytic agent (Komet et al. 16, 1965). About 20 years later Boner et al . (1984)17 conducted a study in children for the treatment of sinusitis with NAC administered intramuscularly in combination with an antibiotic. In a publication by Zeiger (1992)18 on “Prospects for ancillary treatment of sinusitis in the 1990s” the author stated that based on the apparent efficacy and relative safety of oral NAC in chronic bronchitis, “controlled” trials investigating its use in the treatment of chronic sinusitis should be encouraged. However also a more recently published phase 3 study in the indication of recurrent acute sinusitis did not meet the expectations for a recommendation of mucolytics in the current treatment guidelines for rhinosinusitis. This study, reported by Macchi et al. (2012)19, employed only a single- blind design and NAC or the c omparator substance were given in addition to the basic therapy of a nasal corticosteroid. Besides a very small sample size, a study reported by Bahtouee et al. (2017) 20 revealed even more weaknesses by adding NAC to amoxicillin -clavulanic acid, pseudoephedrine, and intranasal normal saline. Hence to the best of our knowledge the proposed randomized controlled trial represents the first investigation to assess the efficacy and safety of NAC in rhinosinusitis according to current regulatory requirements."

The efficacy of acetylcysteine is secretolytic and secretomotoric in the area of the respiratory tract. It is discussed that it splits off the interconnecting disulphide bonds between the mycopolysaccharide chains and that it has a depolymerizing effect on DNA - chains (in purulent mucus). Due to these mechanisms, the viscosity of mucus should be reduced. An alternative mechanism of acetylcysteine is meant to be based on the capacity of its reactive SH group to bind chemical radicals and to detoxify them in this way. Furthermore, acetylcysteine contributes to an increase in glutathione synthesis, which is important for the detoxification of noxae. This provides the explanation for its antid otal effect in paracetamol intoxication. A protective effect on the frequency and severity of bacterial exacerbations – when acetylcysteine is administered prophylactically - is described in patients with chronic bronchitis/mucoviscidosis. 6.4.2 Pharmacokinetics Absorption15 Following oral administration, acetylcysteine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and metabolized in the liver to cysteine, the pharmacologically active metabolite, as well as to diacetylcystine, cystine and further mixed disulphides. Distribution 15 Due to the high first -pass effect, the bioavailability of orally administered acetylcysteine is very low (approx. 10%). In humans, maximum plasma concentrations are achieved after 1- 3 hours with the maximum plasma concentration of the metabolite cysteine in the range of approx. 2 μmol/l. The protein binding of acetylcysteine was dete rmined to be about 50%. Biotransformation 15 Acetylcysteine and its metabolites occur in three different forms in the organism: partially in free form, partially bound to proteins via labile disulphide bonds and partially as incorporated amino acid. Acetylcysteine is excreted almost exclusively in the form of inactive metabolites (inorganic sulphates, diacetylcystine) via the kidneys. The plasma half -life of acetylcysteine is approximately 1 hour and is mainly determined by the rapid hepatic biotransformation. Impaired hepatic function therefore leads to prolonged plasma half-lives of up to 8 hours."

The elimination half- life after intravenous administration is 30 -40 minutes while excretion follows three- phase kinetics (alpha, beta, and terminal gamma phase). Acetylcysteine crosses the placenta and is detected in cord blood. No information is available regarding excretion into breast milk. No knowledge is available concerning the behaviour of acetylcysteine at the blood- brain barrier in humans."

Approximately 900 patients with acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis will be randomized . 8.2 Discussion of the Trial Design and Rationale The test product (Acetylcysteine 600 mg effervescent tablet ) is registered in many EU as well as non-EU countries for the secretolytic therapy in acute and chronic bronchopulmonary diseases . The primary aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy of three different total daily doses of the investigational product containing 600 mg acetylcysteine per effervescent tablet compared to placebo for the treatment of acute uncomplicated rhinosinusitis . The trial design was chosen according to the recommendation of the current guidelines EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/19953 and CPMP/ICH/291/954. Choice of a double-b lind design : Such design has been selected as the blinding of the study personnel and patients is important to reduce any risk of the bias in trial wher e the outcome efficacy and safety assessments of investigator/ patient can be affected by the type of the IMP administered. Male and female subjects (patients) with the diagnose of acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis defined by the investigator at screening (Visit 1) as a) major symptom score (MSS) assessed by the patient ≥8 and ≤12 points21, 22 for the following: rhinorrhea/ anterior discharge, postnasal drip, nasal congestion, headache, and facial pain/pressure, whereupon the nasal congestion is mandatory and no more than 3 of the 5 symptoms are rated as severe; b) individual score for facial pain/pressure ≥1 (mild) and ≤2 (moderate), and c) presence of symptoms ≤3 days prior to inclusion will be enrolled in the present trial. Choice of duration of treatment : Taking into consideration that a randomized, placebo- controlled trial investigating the clinical efficacy of a dry extract of five herbal drugs (BNO 1060) in acute viral rhinosinusitis (Jund et al., 2015) 1 showed statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in symptoms by end of treatment (1 4 days) compared to p lacebo, a 2 weeks treatment phase was chosen for the current trial . The assessment of efficacy and safety of the treatments will be performed before the first dose and after 3, 6, 9, and 14 days of treatment. Choice of endpoints: For evaluation of efficacy, the disease activity will be assessed by the defined Major Symptom Score (MSS) and Sino- Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT -22) questionnaire and based on the clinical evaluation of patient - reported relief of symptoms before and during the treatment ."

Safety will be based on all information available on patient’s reports of AEs , vital signs, clinical findings and ENT examination, and overall assessment of tolerability . Adverse events will be recorded by the investigator at each visit until the follow- up phone call ( within 7 days after Visit 6 , or earlier in case of premature termination ). Safety of higher doses of N -acetylcysteine (NAC) : Not only the NAC doses proposed in this study (up to 1200 mg per intake and up to 2400 mg as total daily dose), but also higher single and/or daily doses have been used in a number of controlled studies in patients w ith chronic bronchitis and for numerous other indications . These indications, for example, include other pathologies involving the pulmonary system, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Meyer et al. 1994 23, Demedts et al. 200524) or fibrosing alveolitis (Behr et al. 199725), from which a similar safety profile can be derived as with lower oral daily doses . As an outcome of a meta- analysis reported by Cazzola et al. (2015)26 the authors concluded that in COPD with an objective confirmation of airway obstruction, NAC should be administered at a dose of ≥1200 mg per day to prevent exacerbations. Further evidence for the safety of doses of 1200 mg twice daily can be derived from the use of NAC in the treatment of other non- airway -related pathologies :  Paracetamol poisoning In paracetamol poisoning, NAC has been regularly administered in doses far beyond 2400 mg per day. The standard antidote for acetaminophen toxicity has been oral NAC with a loading dose of 140 mg/kg, followed by 17 doses of 70 mg/k g every 4 hours (Smilkstein et al. 1988 27). This corresponds to a daily dose of 39200 mg for 70 kg of body weight.  Contrast -induced nephropathy (CIN) Richter et a l.28 recently presented an overview of 17 clinical studies on the use of NAC for CIN in more than 2000 patients. The study medication ranged mostly from 600 mg b.i.d. to 1500 mg b.i.d orally administered. The authors concluded that the low incidence of adverse events associated with NAC forms the basis of its recommendation in the guidelines (Richter and Crannage 201528). This conclusion is likewise supported by a similar systematic review and meta- analysis by Kang et al. (2015)29, who analyzed 20 randomized controlled studies involving 3466 subjects (1756 assigned to NAC). Subjects received either 2400 mg/d p.o. or 2400 ± 2000 mg while in one of the studies the dose was even 10000 mg. In CIN the cumulative NAC doses and routes of ad ministration may also reach 6000 mg p.o. as reviewed by Trivedi et al. (2009) 30. These authors suggested that in patients at risk of CIN, it is prudent to prescribe NAC 1200 mg orally twice per day for 48 hours without raising any safety concerns.  Neuropsychiatric disorders In a comprehensive review, Deepmala et al. (2015) 31 analyzed the state of scientific knowledge for the use of NAC in treating psychiatric and neurological disorders. A total of 65 publications met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic review."

Most of the studies used the dose around 2000– 2400 mg per day, which appeared to be effective and well tolerated, with no significant between- group differences observed in most of the controlled trials. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common adverse events, including mild abdominal pain, mild abdominal discomfort, heartburn, flatulence, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea . These results have been confirmed in a recent review by Ooi et al. (2018) 32 concluding that oral NAC is safe and well tolerated without any considerable adverse effects. Current evidence supports its use as an adjunctive therapy for psychiatric conditions, administered concomitantly with existing medications, with a recommended dosage between 2000 and 2400 mg per day .  Cardioprotection A meta -analysi s investigating whether NAC can prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac surgery examined 10 randomized controlled trials enrolling a total of 1026 patients. The dose regimen included, among others, 1200 mg b.i.d. p.o. In one of the trials the total dose of NAC administered intravenously over a period of 24 hours was 300 mg/kg, corresponding to 21000 mg for a person with 70 kg body weight. In this meta- analysis, NAC had a generally good safety profile, with no statistical difference being found when compared with control groups (Liu et al., 2014) 33.  Systemic lupus erythematosus In a randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled study, a total of 36 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus received either daily placebo or 1200, 2400 or 4800 mg of NAC p.o. for 3 months. NAC dosages up to 2400 mg daily were well tolerated by all pa tients (Lai et al. 2012)34. Summarizing this body of evidence, it can be stated that the intake of 1200 mg acetylcysteine given as 2 tablets of 600 mg twice daily (for a total of 2400 mg daily) over a short period of 14 days appears to pose no safety risk . This conclusion holds true for adults as well as for adolescents, based on recently published studies. A randomized controlled trial of pharmacotherapy for cannabis dependence in 116 adolescents revealed that the NAC dose of 1200 mg twice daily over 8 weeks was well tolerated, with minimal adverse events (Gray et al. 2012) 35. Similarly, Ghanizadeh et al. (2017)36 demonstrated NAC to be an effective add -on to citalopram in improving resistance/ control to compulsions in children and adolescents with obsessive- compulsive disorder in a double- blind, placebo- controlled trial with 34 pediatric patients. Significant reduction in the score of resistance/control to obsessions was detected in the intervention group after supplementing with NAC (titrated up to 2400 mg/day) for 10 weeks. NAC was well tolerated and the rates of adverse effects were not different between NAC and placebo groups."

In most of these cases reported at least one other drug was administered at the same time, which may have possibly enhanced the described mucocutaneous effects. In case of recurrence skin and mucosal lesions, medical advice should be sought at once and the use of acetylcysteine terminated immediately . In addition, the occurrence of hemorrhages in association with the administration of acetylcysteine has very rarely been reported, partially with hypersensitivity reactions. A decreased blood platelet aggregation in the presence of acetylcysteine has been confirmed by various studies. The clinical relevance has not yet been clarified to date."

The act of randomization is equivalent to assigning a randomization number to a patient during the Visit 2 and the administration of the first dose of IMP . 8.5.5 Blinding The present trial will have a double- blind design for the whole duration of the trial (see section 10.6). At Visit 1 the patients will receive a “Trial Identity Card” which needs to be carried along for any case of emergency. The Test IMP and the Placebo will be identical in their appearance and the labels will not contain any information about the identity of the product. The investigator will be held blind and will receive one set of sealed emergency envelopes for each patient. Another set will be stored at the sponsor’s responsible pharmacovigilance function. The emergency envelopes contain information about the IMP identity according to the randomization schedule for each subject. The emergency envelope may only be opened in the case of necessary identification of the study medication. The emergency envelopes of all treated patients will be kept in the ITF during the study. The state of all emergency envelopes will be checked by the CRAs at each regular monitoring visit. Emergency unblinding of treatment assignment In an emer gency , the code for each separate subject can be opened to identify the treatment given to that subject. The code is not to be opened for any reason, other than an emergency where unblinding is required for the medical management of the patient. Where possible, the clinical research manager ( Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d. ) and the project manager(s) at have to be contacted before breaking the blind for any patient. When the investigator opens any individual code, he/ she must record the date and reason for breaking the code in the CRF. The investigator must also immediately inform the responsible persons , clinical research manager (Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d. ) and the project manager(s) at (see section 9.3.6 ). Decoding by opening the emergency envelope leads to an immediate cessation of the trial for this patient but the subject should be followed until resolution of the (serious) adverse event . After completion of the clinical part, sealed emergency envelopes will be returned to central depot(s) along with the unused trial medication."

Shipments from the central depot to study centers and transfers back to the central depot will be documented on shipment forms including shipment date, patient number, visit number, batch number, quantity of study medication or demonstration samples, date received and method of shipment and will be confirmed by the investigator with his/her signature (or by signature of designated personnel). A copy of this receipt form must be kept by the investigator and another copy will be stored in the TMF at . The investigator will be responsible for proper storage of the investigational medicinal products (IMPs) according to the temperature conditions printed on the medication labels, until the IMP dispensation to the patient . The IMPs have to be stored in the clinical center (s) according to the sponsor’s instruction printed on the labels . All IMPs must be stored separately from all other hospital/ practice stocks, locked and only accessible for authoriz ed study personnel. Temperature monitoring has to be performed by means of electronic device in the clinical center and the temperature records must be monitored by the local CRAs . The trial medication will be provided by the sponsor in a sufficient quantity for the needs of the whole trial. The sponsor is responsible for keeping an appropriate amount of each trial medication to allow repeated pharmaceutical analysis. The patients will receive the trial medication for the IMP intake at home and will be informed to store the medication according to the sponsor’s instruction printed on the labels . The patients have to bring back on each visit the empty IMP packaging of used medication and the unused trial medication on Visit 6 . All IMPs must be accounted for at the end of the trial. It is not allowed to use the trial medication for any other purpose. The receipt, dispensation to the patient and return of trial medication is to be documented by the investigator in an IMP accountability form and is to be monitored by the local CRAs in the respective countries. IMP destruction at the central depots or by a subcontracted company will be authorized by HEXAL/its representative . After completion of the destruction procedure the respective document(s) will be sent to the responsible Clinical Research Manager at Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d. for archiving in the TMF."

Assessment of symptom severity. The patient will rate the severity of each of the five symptoms of the MSS using a four -point rating scale of increasing severity ( = none/not present,  = mild,  = moderate,  = severe). The MSS will be assessed by the patient at screening (Visit 1) and immediately before randomization (Visit 2; this will constitute the baseline value). The investigator will transcribe both patient ’s MSS assessments into the CRF . Thereafter , the patient will document the MSS in the patient diary once a day before intake of the morning dose, starting with Day 2 until Day 14 ( last day of treatment or earlier in case of drop -out).

The patient must complete the first SNOT -22 in the patient diary during Visit 2, after the investigator explained unclear terms and answered all patient’s questions. The following trial specific efficacy assessments will be performed and documented by the INVESTIGATOR :  Investigator’s assessment of the overall response to treatment The investigator will assess the overall response to treatment at each visit after baseline: on days 4 (Visit 3), 7 (Visit 4) , 10 (Visit 5), and 15 (Visit 6). The investigator will rate the response to treatment using a five- point rating scale:  = major d eterioration,  = minor deterioration,  = no change,  = minor improvement,  = major improvement. 9.2 Trial Specific Safety Assessments Overall assessment of tolerability by the patient and by the investigator on days 7 (Visit 4) and Day 15 (Visit 6).  Patient’s assessment of the overall tolerability The patient will assess the overall tolerability during the visit on days 7 (Visit 4) and 15 (Visit 6). The patient will rate the tolerability using a five- point rating scale:  = very poor,  = poor,  = medium,  = good,  = very good.

An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  results in death  is life -threatening  requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing inpatient hospitalization  results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity  is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect  is medically significant: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be imm ediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject (patient) or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. These should also usually be considered serious. These characteristics/consequences have to be considered at the time of the event.

A (Serious) Unexpected Adverse Reactions is defined as a (serious) adverse drug reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the Reference Safety Information (SmPC). The term ‘severity’ is used here to describe the intensity of a specific event. This has to be distinguished from the term ‘serious’ . Reports which add significant information on the specificity, increase of occurrence, or severity of a known, already documented serious adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. Information about common side effects already known about the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) can be found in the Reference Safety Information (SmPC) or will be comm unicated in the form of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the subject information and should be discussed with the subject. For further details , please refer to the Quick Reference Guide for completing the Serious Adverse Event Form. 9.3.2 Severity of Adverse Events The term ‘severity’ is used here to describe the intensity of a specific event. This has to be distinguished from the term ‘serious’. In the course of the trial , the investigator will determine whether any AE have occurred and will grade their severity as follows: − Mild Usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities − Moderate Sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities − Severe Prevents normal activities 9.3.3 Relationship to the IMP The investigator should evaluate all AEs considering all accessible data, at any time new information becomes available. The definition of IMP includes the test product under evaluation or the placebo that is given during any phase of the trial. The investigator should assess whether or not, in his/her expert opinion, the AE is suspected to the drug. Suspected means that a causal relationship between the drug and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e . the relationship cannot be ruled out. Causality assessments are critical and must be provided for each unique AE in relation to each IMP, non -investigational medicinal product (NIMP) or other concomitant medication, if applicable. Missing causality asses sments will be handled as suspected to IMP by the sponsor. AEs with a suspected relationship to NIMP or other concomitant medication (for both Sandoz and non -Sandoz products), even if non- serious, need to be reported by the investigator to the respective Country Patient Safety Head (see section 9.3.5 for contact details)."

The occurrence of AEs should be sought by non- directive questioning of the subject at each visit during the study. AEs also may be identified when they are volunteered by the subject during or between visits or during physical examination, laboratory test or other assessments. All AEs should be given appropriate medical care. Treatment may include one or more of the following: no action taken (i.e. further observation only); IMP dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; IMP permanently discontinued due to this AE; concomitant medication given; non -drug therapy given, patient hospitalized / patient’s hospitalization prolonged. The treatment of the AE should be documented in the CRF. In addition, the action taken with the IMP should be documented, and should be assigned to one of the following categories: not changed, withdrawn, reduced, increased, interrupted, unknown and not applicable. Concomitant medication, other treatments or changes in the administration of the IMP should be specified and documented. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting IMP are only considered AEs if they worsen after enrolment. Abnormal laboratory values or test res ults constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically relevant , or require therapy. Once an AE is identified, the investigator should follow -up as specified below. Each time, the outcome should be documented and assigned to one of the following categories: not recovered/unchanged, condition deteriorating, recovered/resolved, improving/recovering, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal or unknown. The assessment of an AE should be made at each planned visit (or more frequently, if necessary). The investigator should document in the CRF any changes in seriousness, severity, the suspected relationship with the IMP, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Adverse events occurring between informed consent and the last visit The investigator should follow up on all AEs which occurred from signature of study -specific informed consent until the last visit of the subject, at which point the outcome assessment is documented in the CRF. Ongoing serious adverse events at the time of last visit For any SAEs still ongoing at the time of last visit, the investigator should continue to follow- up until the SAE has resolved or has stabilized / is judged permanent for SAEs considered to be related to IMP (SADRs), and for up to 30 days after the last visit of subject for non -related SAEs. The investigator should send SAE follow -up reports to recipients as per the ‘SAE Reporting’ section 9.3.5 below. Serious adverse events occurring after the last visit Any SAEs experienced after the last visit should only be reported to sponsor if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. The investigator must report the SADR to recipients as per the ‘SAE Reporting’ section 9.3.5 below."

The investigator should send SAE reports on the “Serious Adverse Event Report Form”, as initial or follow -up reports, via fax or email to the Country Patient Safety Head, and in copy to the project management (Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d. ), to the addresses provided on the next page. The investigator should also send all updates / new information on a new SAE Report Form as a follow -up to the previously reported SAE. The follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if a diagnosis is available, if and how it was treated, and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow- up to the original episode, regardless of when the event occurs. Any new SAE (that is considered completely independent of a previously reported SAE) should be reported as a new and separate initial SAE report. Any queries from the Country Patient Safety Head, Contract Research Organization (CRO) or sponsor /its representative regarding SAE reports should be answered by the investigator within 24 hours. For more detailed information refer to the “Quick Reference Guide for Completing the SAE Form” .

Efficacy: Efficacy of the test product will be shown by testing superiority of the three different doses in a hierarchical test procedure from the highest to the lowest dose compared to placebo. Hierar chical ordered hypotheses will be tested at the type I error rate of α=0.05 (two-sided) until the first non- rejection. No error rate adjustment is required. The set of hypotheses is as follows : H01: µ2400 = µ PL H11: µ2400 ≠ µPL H02: µ1200 = µ PL H12: µ1200 ≠ µPL H03: µ600 = µ PL H13: µ600 ≠ µPL Where µ notes “mean change from baseline in the daily MSS over the entire treatment period” for the respective strength. Superiority of the Test treatment over placebo (PL) is confirmed if the p -value is < 0.05 and a positive treatment effect is shown. For the primary efficacy an endpoint , analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be carried out using treatment and center as factors and baseline MSS as a covariate. The trial will be powered to demonstrate superiority of the test product over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint. The confirmatory analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed in the FAS.

All safety data obtained in this trial will be tabulated descriptively with descriptive group statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, number of valid cases) where appropriate. AEs will be summarized by primary system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). Severity and drug -event relationship of treatment emergent AEs are summarized separately. All adverse even ts will be listed. Vitals signs, including changes from baseline will be summarized. A frequency table will be presented for abnormal values of laboratory parameters. 10.5 Calculation of Sample Size The sample size is calculated in respect of the primary endpoi nt. For the calculation of sample size following parameters were taken into consideration based on data published by Jund et al. (2015)1: α = 0.05 (two -sided) ß = 0.20 (power = 80%) mean MSS change (test) = 5.4 mean MSS change (placebo) = 4.5 Standard deviation = 3.4 Randomization ratio = 1 (1:1:1:1, 3 doses of test vs. placebo) Sample size per group: = 225 subjects The numbers above refer to the FAS. The resulting number of patients to be randomized in each of the groups is approximately 225. The total number of patients to be randomized is thus equal to 900 . 10.6 Coding and Randomization The randomization code will be generated by a company subcontracted by the sponsor and otherwise not involved in the present trial ( , using the program The randomization code will be kept confidential at the sponsor, in a sealed envelope with no access for personnel involved in the study conduct. The Blind Data Review Meeting (BDRM) will be held after closure of the database and before unblinding the trial. The decisions taken at this meeting will be documented in a respective protocol. Only after the BDRM protocol is signed by the parties involved and all database activities are completed, the unblinding will be possible. The sponsor /its representative will be asked t o give an approval for the study unblinding. The randomization code will be included in the Trial Master File (TMF) along with correspondence concerning the study unblinding."

More details about the statistical analyses and the exact type of data presentation will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to database lock. Any deviation from the original statistical plan will be described and justified in the final report, as appropriate. There will be a clear accounting for all patients who entered the trial, using figures and tables in the text of the report. The numbers of patients who were randomi zed, and who completed the trial will be provided, as well as the reasons for all discontinuations, grouped by treatment and by major reason (lost to follow - up, adverse event, poor compliance etc.). All important deviations related to trial inclusion or exclusion criteria, conduct of the trial, patient management or patient assessment will be described. Protoc ol deviations will be appropriately summarized and grouped into different categories, e.g.: • patients who entered the trial even though they did not satisfy the entry criteria • patients who developed withdrawal criteria during the trial but were not withdraw n • patients who received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose • patients who received an excluded concomitant treatment . All patients planned for inclusion in the statistical analysis will be allocated to the respective patient population, e.g., all patients receiving any investigational products, all patients with any efficacy observation, all patients completing the trial with a specified degree of compliance, etc. The statistical analysis used will be described in the text of the report, with detailed documentation of statistical methods presented in appendix 16.1.9 of the study report. Important features of the analysis including the particular methods used, handling of drop- outs and missing data, adjustments for multiple comparisons, etc. will be discussed. Any changes in the analysis made after unblinding will be identified. 10.8 Interim Evaluation No interim evaluation is planned for the trial."

All other data that cannot be derived from images/print -outs and are collected in the individual patient health medical record file in the clinical center will serve also as source data and will be transferred into the CRF as far as requested for the trial purposes . Should the investigator enter any data first into any other kind of a document before transferring the data into the CRF, this other document becomes the source for the respective type of data . A Trial Specific Source Form ( TSSF ) will be generated for the needs of t he present trial and this document will be presented to the IEC/IRB and RA for approval. All TSSF s will be filed in the ITF and must be archived for at least 25 years after the trial has been completed. According to Chapter 1.51 of ICH Topic E6 (R2)3 - source data must be original records or certified copies of original records. “Certified copy is a copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the original record that has been verified (i.e., by a dated signature or by generation through a validated process) to have the same information, including data that describe the context, content, and structure, as the original. 3” As the 2nd page of CRFs and patient diaries is a duplex of the original (top) page of no- carbon copy paper signed and dated by the investigator, the 2nd page is considered as a certified copy. In addition, the following data, which is obtained on the patient ’s infor med consent form, is considered source data:  date of birth of patient ,  screening number,  participation in present clinical trial with identification of sponsor, trial number, and trial medication,  date of signing informed consent. The original patient ’s informed consent form (see also section 5.4) will be filed in the ITF and will remain at the investigational center for at least 25 years after the trial has been completed . Additionally, the investigator must record the patient’s trial participation in the subject medical health record /file."
