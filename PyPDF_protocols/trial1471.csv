2,page_2,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 3/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION 7: RATIONA LE Protocol WO39392 has primarily been amended to update risks and management guidelines for atezolizumab to align with the latest Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure (Version 15). Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are summarized below : To align with the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure, Version 15, ""immune -related"" has been changed to ""immune -mediated"" when describing events associated with atezolizumab (Section s1.4, 4.4.2, 5.1.1,and Appendix 13). To address a request by the , systemic immune activation has been replaced by hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage activation sy ndrome in the list of potential risks for atezolizumab (Section 5.1. 1) and the management guidelines for systemic immune activation have been replaced with management guidelines for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome ( Appendix 13). In addition, systemic immune activation has been removed from the list of adverse events of special interest (Section 5.2.3 ). To align with the nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®)prescribing information ( Summary of Product Characteristics ), the risk oftumo r lysis syndrome has been included (Section 5.1.2). The Medical Monitor name and associated contact information has been updated (Section 5.4.1). A new section has been added to describe the implementation of a system to manage the quality of the study (Section 9.3). The Appendix 9 (Anaphylaxis Precautions) has been modified to remove the requirement for use of a tourniquet. The application of a tourniquet is no longer recommended due to the limited therapeutic benefit and risk of losing time for more important measures (Ring J, Beyer K, Biedermann T, et al. Allergo J Int. 2014;23:96 112). To address a request by the , the atezolizumab adverse event management guidelines have been revised to add laboratory (e.g., B -type natriuretic pepti de) and cardiac imaging abnormalities as signs or symptoms that are suggestive of myocarditis (Appendix 13). The management guidelines for infusion -related reactions associated with atezolizumab have been updated to include guidelines for cytokine -release syndrome (CRS) to align with the definition, grading, and management of CRS reflected in a recent publication (Lee et al. 2019) (Appendix 13). Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency. Substantive new i nformation appears in italics. This amendment represents cumulative changes to the original protocol."

14,page_14,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 15/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status will be used to define TNBC. HER2 negativity will be defined by central laborator y assessment using in situ hybridization (ISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays per American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) criteria, and ER/P gR negativity will be defined by using IHC per ASCO/CAP criteria. Central laboratory assessm ent will occur prior to randomization. Patients whose tumors are not confirmed to be triple negative will not be eligible. Patients whose tumor tissue is not evaluable for PD -L1 will not be eligible. Patients who do not initially meet all eligibility cri teria, other than TNBC status, may be rescreened once. This study has an adaptive design consisting of two stages. Stage 1 is the randomization and treatment of approximately 204 patients. At the end of Stage 1, an interim analysis for efficacy will be done by an iDMC. Then, a recommendation will be made to either continue the study unchanged or to expand the patient population (Stage 2; approximately 120 additional patients). If the recommendation is to expand the patient population into Stage 2, the Sponsor will remain blinded to the results of the interim analy sis performed at the end of Stage 1. Patients who have consented and are eligible will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of the following treatment groups : Arm A : atezolizumab (840 mg) administered via intravenous (IV) infusion Q2W in combination with nab -paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) administered via IV infusion QW for 12 weeks followed by atezolizumab (840 mg) administered Q2W in combination with doxorubicin (60mg/m2)cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) adm inistered Q2W via IV infusions with filgrastim/pegfilgrastim support for 4 cycles. Patients randomized to the atezolizumab arm will continue to receive unblinded atezolizumab post -surgery at a fixed dose of 1200 mg by IV infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 11 cy cles, for a total of approximately 12 months of atezolizumab therapy. Arm B : placebo administered Q2W via IV infusion in combi nation with nab -paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) adm inistered QWvia IV infusion for 12 weeks fol lowed by placebo administered Q2W in combination with doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) adm inistered Q2 W via IV infusions with filgrastim/pegfilgrastim support for 4cycles. Patients randomized to the placebo arm will be unblinded post-surger y and will continue to be followed. For patients in Stage 1 of the study, randomization will be stratified by the following factors: American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage at diagnosis (II vs. III; see below for evaluation and classifi cation of ly mph nodes) Tumor PD-L1 status (tumor -infiltrating immune cell [IC] IC0 [<1% PD -L1 expressing IC per tumor area] vs. IC1/2/3 [ 1% PD -L1 expressing IC per tumor area]) Depending on the iDMC recommendation, Stage 2 could follow either an all -come r or PD -L1 enrichment design. If an all -comer design is recommended, the patients enrolled in Stage 2 will be stratified the same as patients enrolled in Stage 1. If an enrichment design is recommended, only PD -L1positive patients will be enrolled, and the AJCC stage at diagnosis will be used as the sole randomization stratification factor. Patients who discontinue neoadjuvant therapy early as a result of disease progression must bediscontinued from all study treatment, will be managed as per loca l prac tice, and will be followed for survival only . Patients who discontinue prematurely from the study will not bereplaced. Any patient who receives non- protocol therapy prior to surgery will be discontinued from study treatment and will be managed as per loc al practice; these patients will remain on study for survival follow -up. The primary efficacy endpoint (pathologic complete response [pCR]; ypT0/is ypN0) will be established via local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery. Patholo gists who review study specimens must utilize the evaluations and assessments outlined in the Pathology Manual. Investigator/individual patient unblinding will occur after pCR assessment. Surgery should be performed at least 14 days after the last dose o f neoadjuvant"
15,page_15,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 16/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7therapy but no later than 6 weeks after the last infusion. Platelet counts should be checked prior to surgery and should be  75,000 cells/ L. Patients with clinically positive axillary nodes by physical examination or by any radiographic imaging at baseline should undergo fine- needle aspiration or c ore-needle biops y prior to randomization followed by axillary ly mph node dissection (ALND) at time of definitive surger y. The results of the baseline fine -needle aspiration or core -needle biopsy will determine the nodal staging, so that patients with a positive biops y result should be staged as ly mph-node- positive (N1-N3c) whereas patients with a negative or equivocal biops y result should be staged as lymph-node -negative (N0) regardless of any ot her clinical measurements. Baseline fine -needle aspiration (FNA) or core -needle biops y is not mandator y for clinically/radiologically enlarged/suspicious internal mammary , subpectoral, infraclavicular, or supraclavicular ly mph nodes. Investigators are adv ised to follow local practice guidelines regarding assessment of internal mammary , subpectoral, infraclavicular, or supraclavicular lymph nodes. Management of internal mammary , subpectoral, infraclavicular, or supraclavicular ly mph nodes at the time of de finitive surgery will be based on local practice guidelines. Patients with baseline axillar y lymph nodes involvement who may also have clinically/radiologically enlarged internal mammary , subpectoral, infraclavicular, or supraclavicular ly mph nodes must s till undergo ALND as described earlier . For patients with baseline clinically/radiologically enlarged/suspicious internal mammary , subpectoral, infraclavicular, or supraclavicular ly mph nodes, pCR may be reported only if all the following conditions are met: 1.Presurgical imaging assessment of internal mammary , subpectoral, infraclavicular, or supraclavicular ly mph nodes does not show any enlarged/suspicious ly mph node(s) after neoadjuvant study treatment. AND 2.Pathological evaluation of the breast and all resected ly mph node(s) shows no residual invasive disease (i.e., pCR ;ypT0/is ypN0). Postoperative radiotherapy may be administered based on local practice guidelines and after approval from the Medical Monitor has been obtained. In patients with clinicall y or fine -needle biopsy (FNA)/core needle biopsy -proven negative axillary nodes at baseline, axillary surgical management after completion of neoadjuvant therapy should include sentinel ly mph node biops y (SLNB) or ALND . If SLNB is conducted, it is strongl y recommended that more than one ly mph node ( two to three minimum) be removed and all patients with positive macrometastases in sentinel nodes should undergo ALND regardless of the number of positive nodes. All patients with T4 tumors should undergo ALND or current standard of care as described in international or national guidelines. Postoperative patient management for those i n either treatment arm should include radiotherapy as clinically indicated, and management of patients who do not achieve a pCR should follow current standard- of-care guidelines. For those randomized to receive atezolizumab, pat ients may receive this therapy simultaneously with atezolizumab. For those randomized to receive atezolizumab, the first dose of postoperative atezolizumab should be administered within 45 day s of surgery. Efficacy , safety, laboratory measurements, patient- reported outcomes (PROs), and pharmacokinetics will be assessed throughout the study. The first 26 patients enrolled (approximately 13 patients in the control arm and approximately 13 patients in the atezolizumab containing arm) will undergo additional cardiac safety monitoring as part of a cardiac safety cohort. Following completion of study treatment and sur gery, all patients will continue to be followed for efficacy , safety, and PRO objectives until the end of the study. No interim efficacy analyses for early stopp ing are planned. Safety assessments will include the occurrence and severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities graded per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0. Laborator y safety assessments will include the regular monitoring of hematology a nd blood chemistry. Serum samples will be collected to monitor chemotherapy and atezolizumab pharmacokinetics and to detect the presence of antibodies to"

Patient samples, including tumor tissues, as well as plasma and blood, will be collected for expl orator y biomarker assess ments. An iDMC will evaluate the primary efficacy endpoint of pCR in the intent- to-treat (ITT) population (defined as all randomized patients) and in the PD -L1positive subpopulation based on an interim analysis of efficacy data from the Stage 1 patients ( approximately 204 enrolled patients). The iDMC will make a recommendation either to continue the study unchanged or to enroll an additional 120 patients (Stage 2). The decision rules to be applied at the interim analysis will be clearly expressed to the iDMC and documented in the iDMC charter so that the study can be conducted with the Sponsor remaining completely blinded to all results at this stage. The iDMC will evaluate safety data and study conduct on a regular basis during the study until the primar y analy sis of pCR, which is performed at Stage 1 (approximately 204 patients) or Stage 2 (approximately 324 patients), if the iDMC recommends extending the target population. After which, iDMC review of the study data will be discontinued. Sponsor affilia tes will be excluded from iDMC membership. The iDMC will follow a charter that outlines the iDMC roles and responsibilities. Number of Patients Approximately 204 patients will be enrolled in this study during Stage 1 and approximately 120additional patie nts will be enrolled if the iDMC recommends to expand to Stage 2.

Nab-Paclitaxel Nab-paclitaxel will be administered as background treatment along with the non -IMPs doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and filgrastim/pegfilgrastim as specified below. Non-Investigational Medicinal Products Patien ts will receive nab -paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) adm inistered via I V infusion given over 30minutes weekly for 12 weeks followed by doxorubicin (60 mg/m2)cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) adm inistered via IV infusion Q2W with filgrastim/pegfilgrastim support for 4 cycles (i.e., a total of 4 doses of doxorubicin and c yclophosphamide ). The dose of cy clophosp hamide should be capped at 1200 mg. Statistical Methods Primary A nalysis The primary efficacy objective for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant atezolizumab nab-pacAC compared with placebo nab-pacAC in patients with T2 -4d TNBC , as measured by pCR defined as eradication of tumor from both breast and ly mph nodes (ypT0/is ypN0). The primary efficacy endpoint will be established following comp letion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery. The ITT as well as PD -L1positive population swill be used for the primary analysis of pCR. Inthe primary analysis, patients whose pCR assessment was missing will be counted as not achieving a pCR. An estimate of the pCR rate and its 95% CI (Clopper and Pearson 1934) will be calculated for each treatment arm. The difference in pCR rates will be p rovided with 95% CI, using the normal approximation to the binomial distribu tion. For the ITT population, t he Cochran -Mant el-Haenszel 2test stratified according to tumor PD -L1 status (IC0 vs. IC1/2/3) and clinical stage at presentation (Stage II vs. III ) will be used to test pCR rates between treatment groups at a two -sided significance level of 5%. For the PD- L1positive population, similar test will be used with stratification only for clinical stage at presentation. An unstratified 2 versions of the se tests will also be provided as a sensitivity analysis. Determination of Sample Size The study will first randomize approximately N1 204 patients in Stage 1 (1:1 randomization ratio). Based on information from these patients and a pre -specified adaptive rule, the decision will be made regarding whether or not to randomize approximately N2 120 patients in Stage 2 (1:1 randomization ratio). The pre-defined one-sided type I error for the interim analysis at Stage 1 is α 0.0125 (i.e., 50% of the total type I error). The co -primary endpoints in the ITT and PD-L1-positive populations at Stage 1 will be tested using a closed testing procedure using Simes’ test for the intersection hypothesis. Test statistics in ITT and PD-L1-positive populations are alway s positively correlated, hence type I error rate control of the Simes test can be guaranteed in general. Importantly, the p -value p based on Stage 1 data only and the combination p -value p     have the same joint distribution under the null hypo thesis as the p -values from a group -sequential test with two stages at information times t = w andt = 1. Thus standard statistical software for group sequential designs can be used for the determination of critical values for the adaptive design. As the study design uses a critical value of α  0.0125 (i.e., 50% of the total type I error) for Stage 1, this implies that a critical value of α    0.0184 can be applied to the combination p-values."

BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND ON BREA ST CA NCER Globally, breast cancer is the second most common invasive malignancy and the most common cause of cancer -related mortality in women. The majority of breast cancers in the Western world are diagnosed when the cancer is still confined to the breast, with or without locoregional lymph node spread ( Sant et al .2003 ; Jemal et al. 2011 ; Ferlay et al. 2013 ; Howlader et al. 2016 ). At these early stages ( IIII, early breast cancer [EBC]), the largely asymptomatic disease is usually operable and can be treated with curative intent. Triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC) isdefined by the absence of immunostaining for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (P gR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 ). Overall, approximately 15% –20% of allbreast cancers are classified as TNBC. Large -scale comprehensive genomic analyses have characterized the heterogeneous nature of TNBCs and their diverse gene expression patterns and underlying genomic changes, but these insights have not yet provided clear guidance for the identification of clinically effective targeted therapies currently under laboratory an d clinical investigation. Unfortunately, TNBCs are more likely to have aggressive features, such as a high proliferative rate, and exhibit an invasive phenotype. Patients with TNBCs exhibit a poor clinical outcome, generally with rapid progression and a shorter time to local and distant relapse ( Dent etal. 2007 ). Early -stage TNBC comprises 10% 20% of all new diagnoses of EBC defined as Stage s IIII (Lehmann et al. 2011 ; Howlader et al. 2016 ). Three -year e vent-free survival (EFS) rates between 74 %and 76% have been reported for patients with TNBC who have received neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane therapy ( Sikov et al. 2015 ). Upon relapse, patients with metastatic TNBC have poor outcomes, with rapid progression and decreased overall survival (OS) ( Kassam et al. 2009 ). 1.2 TREA TMENT FOR EARLY TRIPLE -NEG ATIVE BREA ST CANCER Multi-agent chemotherapy regimens have proven benefit as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy for early -stage TNBC, improving both disease- specific and OS outcomes (Berry et al. 2006; Senkus et al. 2015 ; NCCN 2016 ). Chemotherapy intended to reduce the risk of relapse may be given preoperatively (neoadjuvant) or postoperatively (adjuvant) to patients with EBC and is currently recommended for TNBC patients with Stage IIII disease. Globally, chemotherapy is most often administered as adjuvant therapy ;however ,rates of neoadjuvant treatment use are increasing. The most effective chemotherapy combinations used for early -stage TNBC include anthracyclines, topoisomerase II inhibitors, platinum agents, cy clophosphamide, and/or taxanes ( Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group 2005; Peto et al. 2012 ). Studies looking at optimizing the dose and schedule of EBC chemotherapy regimens (Citron et al. 2003 ; Sparano et al. 2008 ;Budd et al .2015 ) have established one of the"
26,page_26,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 27/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7optimal regimens with respect to maximizing efficacy as doxorubicin 60 mg/m2and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 4cycles, followed by weekly (QW) paclitaxel 80 mg/m2for 12 weeks ; the regimen is included as a preferred option in international guidelines ( Senkus et al. 201 5; NCCN 2016 ). However, despite having receiv edstandard anthracycline -taxane based therapy, approximately 30% 40% of patients with clinically localized disease at diagnosis develop metastatic disease and die of the cancer ( Haffty et al. 2006 ; Tan et al. 2008 ; Budd et al. 2015 ). Thus, there is a substantial need to improve long -term treatment outcomes for patients with early -stage TNBC. 1.3 BACKGROUND ON ATEZOLIZUMA B Atezolizumab is a hu manized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that targets programmed death ligand 1 (PD -L1)and inhibits theinteraction between PD -L1 and its receptors, programmed death 1(PD-1)and B7 .1 (also known as CD80), both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells. Therapeutic blockade of PD-L1binding by atezolizumab has been shown to enhance the magnitude and quality of tumor -specific T -cell respon ses, resulting in improved anti -tumor activity (Fehrenbacher et al. 2016 ; Rosenberg et al. 2016 ). Atezolizumab has minimal binding to Fc receptors, thus eliminating d etectable F c-effector function and associated antibody - mediated cl earance of activated effector T cells. Atezolizumab shows anti -tumor activity in both nonclin ical models and cancer patients and is being investigated as a potential therapy in a wide variety of malignancies. Atezolizumab is being studied as a single agent as well as in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and cancer immunotherapy. Refe r to the Atezo lizumab Investigator's Brochure for additional details on nonclinical and clinical studie s. Clinical Experience with A tezolizumab in T riple - Negative Breast Cancer Atezolizumab is currently being tested in multiple Phase I, II, and III studies, both as monotherapy and in combination with several anti- cancer therapies in multiple indications (see the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for full study descriptions and available data ). Much of the available safety and efficacy data in TNBC are from twostudies: Study PCD4989g, a Phase Ia, multicenter ,first-in-human, open -label, dose- escalation trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, exploratory pharmacodynamics, and preliminary evidence of biologic activity of atezolizumab monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies or hematolog ic malignancies . Data from the TNBC cohort have been reported and demonstrate promising safety and efficacy results mainly in 1L and PD-L1positive patients (Emens et al .2018 )."
27,page_27,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 28/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7Study GP28328, a Phase Ibmulti -cohort trial of the safety and pharmacology of atezolizumab administered with bevacizumab and/or chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. Arm F of the trial is evaluating atezolizumab administered in combination with weekly nab -paclitaxel in patients with TNBC. Data from Arm F have been reported and support the use of atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in TNBC patients. Conf irmed r esponses were se en in 46% (95% CI:19%, 75%) of patients with first-linemetastatic TNBC and 38% (95% CI:21%, 56%) of patients regardless of line of therapy and PD -L1 expression. No new safety signals were seen (Adams et al .2016 ). Results from Study GP28328 support the hypothesis that tumor -cell killing by cytotoxic chemotherapy may expose the immune system to high levels of tumor antigens. Boosting tumor -specific T -cell immunity in this setting by blocking the PD -L1 pathway may result in deeper and more durable res ponses than those observed with standard chemotherapy alone ( Merritt et al. 2003 ; Apetoh et al. 2007 ), and these responses may reasonably occur in tumors regardless of PD -L1 expression. The inclusion of patients with all levels of PD -L1 expression in this study will enable a robust assessment of this hypothesis. A thir d study (WO29522, IMpassion130) has read out for progression -free survival (Schmid et al.2018 ).This is aglobal, multicenter, double -blind, two -arm, randomized, placebo -controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab administered with nab- paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced TNBC who have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Refer to the Atezoliz umab Investigator's Brochure for details on the clinical studies involving atezolizumab as well as updated detailed safety and efficacy results. 1.4 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT -RISK A SSESSMENT Encouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunother apy have demonstrated that therapies focused on enhancing T -cell responses against cancer can result in a significant survival benefit in patients with Stage IV cancer ( Hodi etal.2010 ; Kantoff et al. 2010 ; Chen et al. 2012 ). The PD -L1 pathway serves as a n immune checkpoint to temporarily dampen immune responses in states of chronic antigen stimulation ,such as chronic infection or cancer . PD-L1 is an extracellular protein that downregulates immune responses through binding toits two receptors, PD -1 and B7.1. PD -1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells following T -cell activation, and expression is sustained in states of chronic stimulation (Blank etal.2005 ; Keir et al. 2008 ). B7.1 is a molecule expressed on antigen -presenting cells and activated T cells. Binding of PD -L1 to PD -1 and B7. 1 inhibits T -cell proliferation and activation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity, leading to the functional inactiv ation or exhaustion of T cells (Butte et al. 2007 ; Yang etal.2011 ). Overexpression of PD -L1 on tumor and tumor -infiltrating immune cells has been reported to impede anti -tumor immunity, resulting in immune evasion ( Blank and"
28,page_28,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 29/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7Mackensen 2007 ). Therefore, interruption of the PD -L1 pathway represents an attractive strategy fo r restoring tumor -specific T -cell immunity. Targeting the PD-L1 pathway with atezolizumab has demonstrated activity in patients with advanced malignancies. Objective responses have been observed across a broad range of malignancies, including nonsmall -cell lung cancer , urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma , melanoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma. In particular, available data from the TNBC cohorts in Studies PCD4989g and GP28328 have demonstrated activity and durable responses in patients receiving atezolizumab as monotherapy or in combination with nab -paclitaxel (see the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for detailed efficacy results ). Atezolizumab has bee n generally well tolerated. Immune -mediated adverse events are consistent with the role of the PD -L1/PD -1 pathway in regulating peripheral tolerance. Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, events associated with inflammation and/or immune -mediate dadverse events are closely monitored in the atezolizumab clinical program. Immune -mediated adverse events associated with atezolizumab include dermatologic, hepatic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and neurological events. To date, the majori ty of these events have been manageable without requiring treatment discontinuation. Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for additional details regarding immune -mediated adverse events observed in patients treated with atezolizumab. Atezoliz umab in combination with taxanes (including paclitaxel and nab -paclitaxel) has also been investigated or is currently being investigated as part of several studies including Studies GP28328, GO29436 (IMpower150), GO29537 (IMpower130), GO30140 ,and WO29522 (IMpassion130) . Atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapeutic regimens including anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide is currently being investigated as part of Studies BO29563 and GO29831. Thus far, r eported adverse events observed were similar to those experienced with the individual components of the study treatment and have generally been manageable. According to data available from the TNBC cohort in Study GP28328 (atezolizumab in combination with nab -paclitaxel ), the most commonly occurring adve rse events (30% incidence ) were fatigue (65.6%) ;diarrhea (50%) ;nausea, constipation, and alopecia (40.6% each) ; peripheral sensory neuropathy (37.5%) ;pyrexia, cough, and decreased neutrophil count (34.4% each) ;and peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia (31.3% each). Three TNBC patients (9.4%) had serious adverse events assessed as related to study treatment; these serious adverse events were pyrexia, anemia, and mycoplasmal pneumonia. Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for additional details. The risk of overlapping toxicities between at ezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide is thought to be minimal based on the mechanism of action of each product. Known serious risks associated with nab- paclitaxel include bone marrow suppression (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocy topenia), elevation of liver enzymes,"
29,page_29,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 30/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, infection ,and pneumonitis. Known serious risks of doxorubicin include bone marr ow suppression (neutropenia, anemia ,and thrombocytopenia), alopecia, nausea and vomiting, skin reactions, and cardiotoxicity. Known serious risks associated with cyclophosphamide include bone marrow suppression (neutropenia, anemia ,and thrombocytopenia) , infection, renal toxicity, cystitis, cardiotoxicity, and pneumonitis . In order to mitigate any potential risks associated with this combination regimen, patients with cardiopulmonary dysfunction will be excluded from the study (see Section 4.1.2 ),and an independent Data Monitoring Committee ( iDMC )will regularly review unblinded safety data (see Section 3.1.2 ). Cardiac function will also be closely monitored, including regular measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF )throughout the study. This study will enroll patients with cT2cT4d TNBC tumors who will receive neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery . Given the relatively poor prognosis for these patients (see Section 3.3.2 ), the limited availability of targeted agents ,and the ability to assess the benefit riskprofile in the neoadjuvant setting (see Section 3.3.4 ), this population andsetting are considered appropriate for trials of novel therapeutic candidates. Thebenefit -risk ratio for atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel followed by cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin is expected to be acceptable in this setting. 2.

STUDY DESIGN 3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 3.1.1 Overview of Study Design This is a global Phase III, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant treatment with atezolizumab nab-pac-AC, or placebo nab-pacAC in patients eligible for surgery with initial clinically assessed T2 -4d TNBC. Female and male patients aged 18 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG )performance status of0 or 1 who have histologically confirmed invasive TNBC with a primary tumor size of 2cm are eligible (see Appendix 10). HER2 and ER/P gR status will be used to define TNBC. HER2 negativity will be defined by central laboratory assessment using in situ hybridization (ISH) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays per American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) criteria (Wolff et al. 2013 ),and ER/P gR negativity will be defined by using IHC per ASCO/CAP criteria ( Hammond et al .2010 ). Central laboratory assessment will occur prior to randomization. Patients whose tumors are not confirmed to be triple negative will not be eligible. Patients whose tumor t issue is not evaluable for PD -L1will not be eligible. Patients who do not initially meet all eligibility criteria, other than TNBC status, may be rescreened once . This study has an adaptive design consisting of two stages. Stage 1 is the randomization and treatment of approximately 204 patients. At the end of Stage 1, an interim analysis for efficacy will be done by an iDMC .Then, a recommendation will be made to either continue the study unchanged or to expand the patient population (Stage 2;approximately 120 additional patients). If the recommendation isto expand the patient population into Stage 2, the Sponsor will remain blinded to the results of the interim analysis performed at the end of Stage 1. Patients who have consented and are eligible will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either of the following treatment groups : Arm A: atezolizumab (840 mg) administered via intravenous (IV) infusion Q2Win combination with nab- paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) administered via IV infusion QWfor 12 weeks followed by atezolizumab (840 mg) administered Q2Win combination with doxorubicin (60 mg/m2)cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) administered Q2W via IV infusions with filgrastim/pegfilgrastim support for 4 cycles. Patients randomized to the atezolizumab arm will continue to receive unblinded atezolizumab post -surgery at a fixed dose of 1200 mg by IV i nfusion every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 11 cycles , for a total of approximately 12 months of atezolizumab therapy."
33,page_33,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 34/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7Arm B: placebo administered Q2Wvia IV infusion in combination with nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) administered QWvia IV infusion for 12 weeks followed by placebo administered Q2Win combination with doxorubicin (60mg/m2)cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) administered Q2Wvia IV infusions with filgrastim/pegfilgrastim support for 4 cycles. Patients randomized to the placebo arm will be unblinded p ost-surgery and will continue to be followed. The study schema is presented in Figure 1."
34,page_34,
35,page_35,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 36/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7For patients in S tage 1 of the study, randomization will be stratified by the following factors: American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage at diagnosis (II vs. III; seebelow for evaluation and classification of lymph nodes) Tumor PD -L1 status (tumor -infiltrating immune cell [IC] IC0 [<1% PD-L1 expressing IC per tumor area] vs. IC1/2/3 [1% PD -L1 expressing IC per tumor area] ) Depending on the iDMC recommendation, Stage 2 could follow either an all -comer or PD-L1 enrichment design. If an all -comer design is recommended, the patients enrolled in Stage 2 will be stratified the same as patients enrolled in Stage 1. If an enrichment design is recommended, only PD -L1 positive patients will be enrolled, and the AJCC stage at diagnosis will be used as the sole randomization stratification factor. Patients who disco ntinue neoadjuvant therapy early as a result of disease progression must be discontinued from all study treatment ,will be managed as per local practice , and will be followed for survival only . Patients who discontinue prematurely from the study will not be replaced. Any patient who receives non- protocol therapy prior to surgery will be discontinued from study treatment and will be managed as per local practice; these patients will remain on study for survival follow-up. The primary efficacy endpoint (pathologic complete response [pCR]; ypT0/is ypN0) will be established via local review following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery. Pathologists who review study specimens must utilize the evaluations and assessm ents outlined in the Pathology Manual. Investigator/ individual p atient and Sponsor unblinding will occur after pCR assessment as detailed in Section 4.2. Surgery should be performed at least 14 days after the last dose of neoadjuvant therapy but no later than 6weeks after the last infusion. Platelet counts should be checked prior to surgery and should be 75,000 cells/ L. Patients with clinically positive axillary nodes by physical examination or by any radiographic imaging at baseline should undergo fine-needle aspiration or core-needle biopsy prior to randomization followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) at time of definitive surgery. The results of the baseline fine -needle aspiration or core- needle biopsy will determine the nodal staging, so that patients with a positive biopsy result should be staged as lymph- node -positive (N1- N3c) whereas patients with a negative or equivocal biopsy result should be staged as lymph -node -negative (N0) regardless of any other clinical measurements (see Appendix 12). Baseline f ine-needl e aspiration (FNA) or core- needle biopsy is not mandatory for clinically /radiologically enlarged /suspicious internal mammary, subpectoral, infraclavicular ,or supraclavicular lymph nodes. Investigators are advised to follow local practice guidelines regarding assessment of internal mammary, subpectoral,"
36,page_36,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 37/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7infraclavicular ,or supraclavicular lymph nodes. Management of internal mammary, subpectoral, infraclavicular ,or supraclavicular lymph node sat the time of definitive surgery will be based on local practice guidelines. Patients with baseline axillary lymph nodes involvement who may also have clinically/ radiologically enlarged internal mammary, subpectoral, infraclavicular ,or supraclavicular lymph nodes must still undergo ALND as described earlier and in Appendix 11and12. For patients with baseline clinically /radiologically enlarged /suspicious internal mammary, subpectoral, infraclavicular, or supraclavicular lymph nodes ,pCR may be reported only ifall the following conditions are met: 1.Presurgical imaging assessment of internal mammary, subpectoral, infraclavicular, or supraclavicular lymph nodes does not show any enlarged/ suspicious lymph node(s) after neoadjuvant study treatment. AND 2.Pathological evaluation of the breast and allresected lymph node (s) shows no residual invasive disease ( i.e., pCR;ypT0 /is ypN0) . Postoperative radiotherapy may be administered based on local practice guidelines and after approval from the Medical Monitor has been obtained. In patients with clinically or fine-needle biopsy ( FNA)/core needle biopsy -proven negative axillary nodes at baseline, axillary surgical management after completion of neoadjuvant therapy should include sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or ALND. IfSLNB is conducted, it is strongly recommended that more than one lymph node ( two to three minimum) be removed and all patient s with positive macrometastases in sentinel nodes should undergo ALND regardless of the number of positive nodes. All patients with T4 tumors should undergo ALND or cur rent standard of care as described in international or national guidelines (seeAppendix 11). Postoperative patient management for those in either treatment arm may include radiotherapy as clinically indicated, and mana gement of patients w ho do not achieve a pCR should follow current standard -of-care guidelines. For those randomized to receive atezolizumab, patients may receive this therapy simultaneously with atezolizumab . For those randomized to receive atezolizumab, the first dose of postoperative atezolizumab should be administered within 45 days of surgery . Efficacy, safety, laboratory measure ments, patient -reported outcomes (PRO s), and pharmacokinetics will be assessed throughout the study. The first 26patients enrolled (approxima tely 13patients in the control arm and approximately 13patients in the atezolizumab containing arm) will undergo additional cardiac safety monitoring as part of a cardiac safety cohort. Following completion of study treatment and surgery, all"
37,page_37,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 38/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7patients w ill continue to be followed for eff icacy, safety, and PRO objectives until the end of the study. No interim efficacy analyses for early stopping are planned . Safety assessments will include the occurrence and severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities graded per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0. Laboratory safety assessments will include the regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry. Serum samples will be collected to monitor chemotherapy and atezolizumab pharmacokinetics and to detect the presence of antibodies to atezolizumab. Patient samples, including tumor tissues, as well as plasma and blood, will be collected for exploratory biomarker assessments. 3.1.2 Independe nt Data Monitoring Committee An iDMC will eva luate the primary efficacy endpoint of pCR in the intent -to-treat ( ITT) population (defined as all randomized patients) and in the PD-L1positive subpopulation based on an interim analysis of efficacy data from theStage 1 patients ( approximately 204 enrolled patients ).The iDMC will make a recommendation either to continue the study unchanged or to enroll an additional 120 patient s(Stage 2 ). The decision rules to be applied at the interim analysis will be cle arly expressed to the iDMC and documented in the iDMC charter so that the study can be conducted with the Sponsor remaining completely blinded to all results at this stage. The iDMC will evaluate safety data and study conduct on a regular basis during the study until the primary analysis of pCR, which is performed at Stage 1 (approximately 204 patients) or Stage 2 (approximately 324 patients), if the iDMC recommends extending the target population. After which , iDMC review of the study data will be discont inued. Sponsor affiliates will be excluded from iDMC membership. The iDMC will follow a charter that outlines the iDMC roles and responsibilities. Unblinded safety data will be reviewed on a regular basis by the iDMC . To assess the potential cardiac toxicity of the combination of anthracyclines and atezolizumab, t he iDMC will review data from a cardiac safetycohort involving additional cardiac monitoring in the first 26patients enrolled ( approximately 13 patients in the control arm and approximately 13patients in the atezolizumab containing arm) after all 26 patient s have completed or have discontinued the n eoadjuvant portion of the study. A safety data review will also occur when at least 50 patients have received at least 2cycles ofatezolizumab/placebo and doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (approximately 25patients in each treatment arm) . Subsequent safety reviews will occur approximately once every 6 months during the study until ana lysis of the primary endpoint. All summaries and analyses for the iDMC review will be prepared by an independent Data Coordinating Center."
38,page_38,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 39/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7After reviewing the data, the iDMC will provide a recommendation to the Sponsor as described in the iDMC Charter. Final decisions will rest with the Sponsor. Any o utcomes of these data reviews that affect study conduct will be communicated in a timely manner to the investigators for notification of their respective Institutional Review Boards/Ethics Committees (IRBs/ECs). 3.2 END OF STUDY AND LENGTH OF STUDY The end of the study is defined as the date when the last patient, last visit (LPLV) occurs for evaluation of secondary endpoints. Thirty- six months after randomization of the last patient, all patients will be contacted for final evaluation of the secondary endpoin ts of EFS, DFS, OS, and PRO s. LPLV for Stage 1 is expected to occur approximately 51 months after the first patient is randomized . If the study expands to Stage 2, LPLV may occur at approximately 74 months after the first patient is randomized. Recruitment for Stage 1 has stopped and was approximately 15 months . The recruitment period may increase to approximately 38 months if the iDMC recommends to expand to Stage 2. The primary efficacy endpoint, pCR, will be analyzed at the interim analysis once approximately 204 patients enrolled in Stage 1 have received surgery, approximately 6months after the last of these patient shas been randomized. This interim analysis isexpected to take place approximately 21months after the first patient is randomized. If the iDMC recommends to expand to Stage 2, a second (final) pCR analysis will be performed at approximately 44 months after the first patient has been randomized, depending on the selected patient population. Secondary efficacy endpoints of EFS, DFS ,and OS will be analyzed approximately 36months after randomization of the last patient. The total duration of the study for Stage 1 is expected to be approximately 51 months . If the iDMC recommend s to expand enrollment (Stage 2), the duration of the study may increase to approximately 74months . The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study, including l ong-term follow -up, at any time (e.g., if emerging safety signals indicate a potential health hazard to patients). 3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN 3.3.1 Rationale for Atezolizumab Dose and Schedule Atezolizumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 840 mg Q2 W by IV infusion in combination with nab- pacAC chemotherapy to align with the chemotherapy schedule (Weeks 120). For patients randomized to receive atezolizumab, the atezolizumab dosing regimen will be switched to 1200 mg Q3W for 11 doses after the completion of chemotherapy and surgery ; the total duration of atezolizumab treatment will be approximately 12 mont hs."
39,page_39,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 40/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7The average atezolizumab exposure following the 840 mg Q2 W dosage is expected to be similar to that of 1200 mg Q3 W, the approved dosage for atezolizumab ( Tecentriq™ U.S. Package Insert ). Anti -tumor activity has been observed across doses ranging fro m 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg Q3W . In Study PCD4989g, the maximum tolerated dose of atezolizumab was not reached and no dose- limiting toxicities were observed at any dose. The fixed dose of 1200 mg Q3 W (equivalent to an average body weight based dose of 15 mg/kg Q3W) was selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies ( Deng et al. 2016 ) and available clinical pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data (refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for details). Based on the understanding of population phar macokinetic variability and atezolizumab concentration tumor dynamic relationship, 840 mg Q2W and 1200 mg Q3 W are expected to have comparable efficacy and safety profiles. 3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population and A nalysis Groups Stage 1 of this study will enroll patients with cT2cT4d operable TNBC , regardless of PD-L1expression (Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 ). TNBC will be defined by prospective central laboratory as sessment using ISH or IHC assays for HER2 assessment and IHC assays for ER/PgR assessment per ASCO -CAP guidelines (Hammond et al. 2010; Wolff et al. 2013). Patients with cT2cT4d TNBC were selected for this study because increased primary tumor size ha sbeen identified as poor prognostic variables and ha sbeen associated with decreased disease- free survival (DFS)and increased likelihood of early metastatic disease in patients with TNBC ( Pistelli et al. 2013; Rosa Mendoza et al. 2013). Not-yet-published internal analyses from the California Cancer Registry found survival rates in patients with Stage II or III disease to be significantly lower than those of patients diagnosed with Stage I disease (3 -year OSrateof 94.2% [95% CI: 93.3 , 95.0] for Stage I ;86.2% [95%CI :85.1, 87.2]for Stage II ;and 58.8% [95%CI :56.3, 61.2]for Stage III; data on file) . By selecting a patient population that has an increased rate of disease recurrence (larger tumor size) andpoorer clinical outcomes and by further enrichi ng this with patients with node -positive disease ,the study will enroll patients with TNBC who have the highest unmet medical need. 3.3.3 Rationale for Comparator of Nab-Paclitaxel followed by Doxorubicin and Cy clophosphamide Multi-agent chemother apy regimens h ave proven beneficial as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy for early stage breast cancer, improving both disease -specific and OS outcomes (Berry et al. 2006; NCCN 2016 ). The most effective combination regimens include anthracyclines, topoisomerase II inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, and taxanes ( Peto et al. 2012 ; Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group 2005 ). Studies looking at optimizing the dose and schedule of early breast cancer chemotherapy regimens (Citron et al. 2003 ; Sparano et al. 2008 ) have established one of the optimal adjuvant regimens as doxorubicin 60mg/m2and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2administered"

Specifically, in the neoadjuvant setting, anthracycline/taxane chemotherapy -based regimens have routinely been used inTNBC, result ing in reported pCR rates of 41%48% (Sparano et al. 2008 ; Sikov et al. 2015; Untch et al. 2016). Three -year EFS rates of 74%76% have been reported for patients with TNBC who have received neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane therapy ( von Minckwitz et al. 20 14; Sikov et al. 2015 ),leaving room for improvement in outcomes. The safety of atezolizumab in combination with anthracyclines , cyclophosphamide ,and other chemotherapeutic agents is being explored in Study BO29563, a Phase Ib/II study evaluating atezolizumab in combination with either obinutuzumab (G) + bendamustine or obinutuzumab (G) + cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) in patients with follicular lymphoma or rituximab + CHOP in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The CHOP regimen consists of cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2on Day 1, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2onDay 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2(max. 2 mg) on Day 1, and prednisone 40 mg/m2onDays 1 5.During the safety run -in phase, patients received 6cycles of induction treatment with either Atezo -G-benda or Atezo -G-CHOP. As of 19 July 2016, preliminary data from 7 patients who completed at least 3 cycles of induction treatment indicated that the combination of atezolizumab wi th G-CHOP was well tolerated. None of the stopping criteria defined for the safety run -in phase of the study were met. Two events of Grade 1 palpitation (1 related, 1 unrelated) were reported; no other cardiac events were reported. There were no treatment -related Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events during Cycles 2 and 3 (i.e., the safety observation window). No treatment delays or treatment discontinuations due to adverse events were observed. For additional information on the safety of atezolizumab in c ombination with other agents, please refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure. Nab-Paclitaxel as Neoadjuvant Treatment of Early TNBC Nab-paclitaxel represents the preferred chemotherapy for combination with immunomodulatory drugs such as atezolizumab because of both 1) the opportunity to avoid immunosuppressive effects from the concurrent steroid use required with other taxanes (Gradishar et al. 2005) and 2) the high rate of tumor cell death achieved by nab-paclitaxel, which can be expected to expose the immune system to high levels of tumor antigens, thereby enhancing the degree and duration of cancer -specific T -cell immunity by inhibition of PD -L1mediated immune suppression by atezolizumab. Nab-paclitaxel appears to be at least as activ e as the commonly used paclitaxel in early breast cancer (Untch et al. 2016; Gianni et al. 2016) , and data from Study GP28328 suggests that the combination of nab -paclitaxel and atezolizumab is safe and efficacious (Section 1.3and Adams et al. 2016) . Identical chemotherapy backbone treatments were"
41,page_41,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 42/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7selected for both the investigational and control arms of the study in order to isolate the effect of at ezolizumab upon study endpoints. The use of nab -paclitaxel in the neoad juvant setting is supported by two randomized Phase III trials . The Phase III GeparSepto s tudy (n1206) compared the efficacy of a regimen of weekly nab-paclitaxel versus paclitaxel followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide as neoadjuvant therapy for EBC (Untch et al. 2016 ). The pCR rate among the cohort of patients with TNBC (n 276) who received nab -paclitaxel was twice that of the women who received paclitaxel (48% vs. 26%; p 0.00027 ). In the overall patient population, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 anemia (2% nab- paclitaxel vs. 1% paclitaxel; p 0.048) and peripheral sensory neuropathy Grade 3 or 4 (10% nab -paclitaxel [8% in those receiving 125 mg/m2dose] vs. 3% paclitaxe l, p0.001) was significantly higher for nab-paclitaxel. Overall, 26% of patients had 1 or more serious adverse events in the nab-paclitaxel group compared with 21% of patients in the paclitaxel group (p 0.057). The taxane dose was reduced in 30% of patients in the nab- paclitaxel group versus 12% in the paclitaxel group (p 0.0001). Results were also reported from a separate Phase III study comparing the efficacy of neoadjuvant nab- paclitaxel versus paclitaxel ,both followed by anthracycline regimens in695 women with HER2 -negative high -risk breast cancer ( Gianni et al. 2016). IntheTNBC cohort (n 219), 41.3% (95% CI:31.9, 51.1) of patients who received thenab-paclitaxel containing regimen achieved a pCR compared with 35% (95% CI:26.6, 45.1) of patients who received the paclitaxel- containing regimen (p0.376; Gianni et al. 2016 ). The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 62.6% in the nab-paclitaxel arm versus 53.7% in the paclitaxel arm. Neutrophil count decrease was 41.8% in the nab- paclitaxel arm versus 36.4% in the paclitaxel arm. When combined, these studies suggest that nab -paclitaxel is at least as effective as paclitaxel; however, long term outcomes from these studies have not yet been reported. Sequence of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy In Study WO39392, neoadjuvant nab -paclitaxel will be administered prior to doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( AC) chemotherapy. This sequence of chemotherapy agents was selected in order to maximize the potential for a robust, initial immune -response as there are less reports of neutropenia and lower usage of steroids with a nab -paclitaxel compared to AC. In addition, biomarker analyses from Phase I atezolizumab studies have demonstrated activated CD8+ T cell proliferation and thepresence of IL -18 peaks three weeks after the first -dose of atezolizumab (Herbst etal.2014). The combination with nab- paclitaxel, as assessed in Study GP28328 ( Adams etal. 2016 ) has a similar effect, suggesting nab -paclitaxel does not hamper atezolizumab activity and, theref ore, may not negatively impact efficacy. The combination of AC and atezolizumab following atezolizumab -nab-paclitaxel has not"
42,page_42,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 43/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7yetbeen investigated and the net impact on immune -response is unknown . Data supporting the chemotherapy sequence come from seve ral small prospective and retrospective studies that have evaluated the impact of changing the sequence of administration for anthracyclines and taxanes in the neoadjuvant setting for TNBC. While the endpoints measured have varied, the sestudies demonstrated that reversing the sequence of neoadjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy by starting with the taxane , followed by an anthracycline -containing regimen ,is at least as effective as the conventional sequence, with the majority of studies de monstrating no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes between the two sequences (Sledge etal.2003 ; Bines et al. 2014 ; Earl et al. 2014). Dose and Schedule of Nab -Paclitaxel The dose and schedule of nab -paclitaxel (125mg/m2QW12 cyc les) was selected based upon the dosing regimen used in the P hase III GeparSepto s tudy where weekly nab-paclitaxel was found to be superior to weekly paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting (described above; Untch et al. 2016) 3.3.4 Rationale for Pathologic Complete Response as Primary Endpoint The primary objective of Study W O3939 2is to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment with atezolizumab nab-p acAC compared with placebo nab-pacAC in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC as measured by pCR. pCR was selected as the primary efficacy endpoint ; it isa validated ,meaningful measure of response to therapy ,and on the basis of data from several analyses and clinical trials and meta -analyses ,there is an association between the pCR status of a patient and long-term outcomes (Cortazar et al. 2014 ; Liedtke et al. 2008 ; von Minckwitz et al. 2012 ). This association was especially strong in patients with TNBC (EFS hazard ratio [HR]0.24 [95% CI :0.18, 0.33 ]; OS HR 0.16 [95% CI :0.11, 0.25]) (Cortazar et al. 2014). pCR will be defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic the rapy (NAST) ,in line with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)and European Medicines Agency guidance for industry on pCR endpoints (i.e., ypT0/Tis ypN0 in the current AJCC staging system). 3.3.5 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments Published results suggest that the expression of PD -L1 in tumors correlates with response to anti PD-1 and antiPD-L1 therapy ( Topalian et al. 2012; Herbst et al. 2014 ; Borghaei et al. 2015 ; Fehrenbacher et al. 2016 ; Herbst et al. 2016 ; Rosenberg etal. 2016 ). In the current study, baseline tumor specimens will be collected from patients and tested for PD -L1 expression by a central laboratory during the screening period. Randomization for patients enrolled in Stage 1, ( as well as Stage 2 only if all-comer"
43,page_43,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 44/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7patients are enrolled ),will be stratified by PD -L1 expression as assessed by IHC. Inaddition to the assessment of PD -L1 status, other exploratory biomarkers potentially related to clinical benefit of atezolizumab , tumor immunobiology, mechanisms of resistance, or tumor type, may be analyzed. Certain chemotherapies ha ve been shown to be immunomodulatory ( Pfirschke et al. 2016 ). To evaluate the impact of nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab in the tumor immune microenvironment, optional on-treatment biopsies will be coll ected 2weeks after treatment initiation ( Day 15) .The pharmacodyna mic changes in the tumor microenvironment will be evaluated by immunostaining, hematoxylin and eosin evaluation (tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes) ,and gene expression. To evaluate mechanis ms of resistance to the combination, the residual tumor tissue post-surgery will be evaluated for biomarkers related to tumor and immune biology by gene expression as well as by immunostaining methodologies. Patients will undergo mandatory tumor biopsy sample collection, if deemed clinically feasible by the investigator , at the ti me of first evidence of radiographic disease recurrence to evaluate tumor tissue biomarkers related to resistance, disease recurrence , and clinical benefit of atez olizumab. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and during the study to evaluate changes in biomarkers. Changes in biomarkers such as cytokines associated with T- cell activation , circulating tumor DNA concentration, and T -cell subpopulations may pro vide evidence of biologic activity of atezolizumab in humans. Correlations between these biomarkers and safety and efficacy endpoints may be explored to identify blood- based biomarkers that might predict which patients are more likely to benef it from atezolizumab . Tumor and blood samples collected at baseline and, if deemed clinically feasible by the investigator , tumor tissue collected at the time of disease recurrence will be analyzed through use of whole genome sequencing ( WGS)and/or next-generat ion sequencing (NGS) to identify somatic mutations that are predictive of response to study treatment, are associated with recurrence to a more severe disease state, are associated with acquired resistance to study treatment, or can increase the knowledge and understanding of disease biology. Genomics is in creasingly informing researcher s’understanding of disease pathobiology. WGS provides a comprehensive characterization of the genome and, along with clinical data collected in this study, may increase th e opportunity for developing new therapeutic approaches. Data will be analyzed in the context of this study but will also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies. The availability of a larger dataset will assist in identification of importa nt pathways, guiding the development of new targeted agents."
44,page_44,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 45/Protocol WO39392 , Version 73.3.6 Rationale for Patient -Reported Outcome A ssessments EBC is largely asymptomatic ,with the majority of newly diagnosed patients exhibiting no disease- specific, discernable symptoms ( Barret tet al. 2009 ; Ryerson et al. 2015 ). Therefore, toxicities ,thecorresponding treatment -related symptoms ,and their impact define the patient experience (i.e., how patients feel and function) . These are important aspects to consider to help inform on the overall clinical benefit of a novel drug for this potentially curable indication .Treatment -related symptoms associated with EBC regimens can have significant impact on patient’s lives ,including their ability to conduct activities of daily living; on phy sical functioning , and on emotional and social aspects (Petersen etal.2015 ). It is therefore critical to document the burden associated with EBC treatment and understand the experience of treatment -related symptoms and their impact directly from patients to further inform the benefit -risk assessment and treatment decision -makin g (Montazeri 2008 ; Au et al. 2010 ; FDA 2013; PDUFA Breast Cancer Workshop 2015 ;EMA 2016 ). Acomprehensive assessment of treatment burden from the patient’s perspective in this study will be conducted and will include a global assessment of the impact of treatment on patient s’functioning (role, physical ) and health -related quality of life (HRQoL) as secondary endpoints ,as well as the experience of treatment -related symptoms and their associated level of bother and the impact on emotional and s ocial functioning as exploratory endpoints .The GHS/HRQoL, functional ,and disease/treatment -related symptom items and scales of the European Organi sation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ -C30; seeAppendix 5), and the treatment bother item GP5 from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -General (FACT -G; see Appendix 6) Quality of Life Instrument will all be used to assess patients’ treatment burden (see Figure 2)."

52,page_52,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 53/Protocol WO39392 , Version 74.2 METHOD OF TREA TMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING This is a double -blind , randomized, placebo -controlled study. After written informed consent has been obtained, all screening procedures and assessments have been completed, and eligibility has been established, the study sitewill enter demographic and baseline characteristics in the interactive voice or web-based response system (IxRS). For those patients who are eligible for enrollment, the study site will obtain the pati ent’s identification number and treatment assignment from the IxRS. Randomization will occur in a 1:1 ratio using a permuted -block randomization method. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms: atezolizumab nab -pacACor placebo nab-pacAC. The randomization scheme is designed to ensure that an approximately equal number of patients will be enrolled in each treatment arm within the categories defined for the following stratification factors at baseline: AJCC stage at diagnosis (II vs. III) Tumor PD -L1 status ( IC0 vs. IC1/2/3 )for patients enrolled in Stage 1 and S tage 2 (only if the study continues to enroll all -comer patients ) Patients should receive their first dose of study treatment on the day of randomization if possible. If treatment is not possible, the first dose should occur no l ater than 14days after randomization.

The Sponsor and its agents (with the exception of the PD -L1 assay provider and the iDMC members); the study site personnel, including the investigators; and the patients will be blinded to PD -L1 status until all data have been cleaned and verified ,and the database has been locked for the primary analysis for pCR or the interim analysis for pCR at the end of Stage 1. If the iDMC recommends to progress to Stage 2 in all -comer population, the Sponsor and its agents, the study site personnel, including the investigators, and the patients will remain blinded to PD -L1 status until all data have been cleaned and verified ,and the database has been locked for the primary analysis of pCR at the end of Stage 2."
53,page_53,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 54/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7If the iDMC recommends to progress to Stage 2 in PD -L1positive population, the Sponsor and its agents, the study site personnel, including the investigators, and the patients will be aware of the PD -L1 status of patients in screening for Stage 2, so that a patient's eligibility for enrollment can be assessed. If the iDMC recommends to progress to Stage 2 in PD-L1positive population , the Sponsor and its agents , the study site personnel, including the investigators, and the patients enrolled in Sta ge 1 may be informed about their PD -L1 status upon request by the investigator. While PK samples must be collected from patients assigned to the control arm to maintain the blinding of treatment assignment, PK assay results for these patients are generall y not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of this study. Personnel who are responsible for performing PK assays and sample data reconciliation will be unblinded to patients’ treatment assignments to identify appropriate PK samples to be a nalyzed and cleaned. Samples from patients assigned to the control arm will not be analyzed except by request (i.e., to evaluate a possible error in dosing). Unblinding ofTreatment A ssignment A patient's treatment assignment will be unblinded to the sit e personnel (including the investigator) after assessment of the patient's pCR status ,in order to informfurther treatment. Otherwise, unblinding should occur only in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment is absolutely essential for further management of clinically significant adverse events experienced by the patient (i.e., emergency unblinding for safety reasons ). Per he alth authority reporting requirements, treatment assignment will be unblinded for serious, unexpected study drug -related toxicity (as part of the Investigational New Drug [IND] safety reporting process). In these instances, investigators will not be notif ied of individual patient’s treatment assignment as a matter of course. Emergency unblinding by the investigator should be a last resort performed only in cases when knowledge of treatment assignment will affect the management of a patient who experiences a treatment -emergent adverse event. Investigators are encouraged to consult with the Medical Monitor prior to performing emergency unblinding. If unblinding is necessary for patient safety management, the investigator is credentialed to break the treatm entcode within the IxRS autonomously by means of a pin code ,which is issued to them at the start of the study. All such occurrences should be documented in the study file. Unblinding should not result in the withdrawal of apatient from the study. Everyeffort should be made to retain unblinded patients and continue data collection per protocol."

59,page_59,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 60/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7G-CSF (i.e., filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) treatment is permitted for patients receiving chemotherapy and is required during the doxor ubicin/ cyclophosphamide portion of chemotherapy .The primary prophylaxis should be administered per the ASCO, EORTC, orESMO guidelines or per local standard practice; namely, in patients who are 60 years of age and/or with comorbidities ( Smith et al. 2006 ; Crawf ord et al. 2009; Aapro et al. 2011 ). Evidence supporting the use of long -acting (pegylated) forms of G -CSF in patients receiving weekly nab-paclitaxel is limited and investigators should consider giving preference to conventional formulations of G -CSF. In general, investigators should manage a patient’s care with supportive therapies as clinically indicated per local standard practice . Patients who experience infusion- associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H 2-receptor antagoni sts (e.g., famotidine, cimetidine) , or equivalent medications per local standard practice. Serious infusion- associated events manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g., supplemental oxygen and 2-adrenergic a gonists; see Appendix 9). 4.4.2 Cautionary Therapy Systemic corticosteroids and TNF -inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab. Therefore, in situations in which systemic corticosteroids or TNF -inhibitors would be routinely administered, alternatives, including antihistamines, should be considered. If the alternatives are not feasible, systemic corticosteroids and TNF -inhibitors may be administered at the discretion of the investigator . Systemic corticosteroids are recommended, at the discretion of the investigator , for the treatment of specific immune -mediated adverse events when assoc iated with atezolizumab or placebo therapy (refer to Appendix 13for details). Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug- drug interactions are generally unknown. However, herbal therapies may be used during the study at the discretion of the investigator. 4.4.3 Potential Drug Interactions with Chemotherapy The chemotherapeutic agents used in this study are associated with potential drug interactions. The metabolism of nab-paclitaxe l is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Doxorubicin is a major substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and P -glycoprotein (P -gp). Cyclophosphamide is also activated by CYP."
60,page_60,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 61/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7Caution should be exercised when nab- paclitaxel is concomit antly administered with known inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin); inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John’s Wort and ca rbamazepine); and substrates (e.g., midazolam, buspirone, felodipine, lovastatin, eletriptan, sildenafil, simvastatin , and triazolam) of CYP3A4. Caution should also be exercised when nab- paclitaxel is concomitantly administered with known inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil), inducers (e.g.,rifampin), and substrates (e.g., repaglinide and rosiglitazone) of CYP2C8. Clinical lysignificant interactions have been reported with inhibitors of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P -gp (e.g., verapamil). Caution should be exercised and concurrent use of doxorubicin with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or P -gp should beavoided. Similar cautions should be exercised with cyclophosphamide. There is a moderate to high potential for drug -drug interactions with any medicat ion thatis metabolized by or strongly inhibits or induces these enzymes. Therefore, the medications listed above should be avoided when chemotherapy is being administered. If use of one of these medications is necessary, the risks and benefits should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to concomitant administration with chemotherapy. The lists of medications shown above are not necessarily comprehensive. Thus, the investigator should consult the prescribing information for any concomitant medica tion as well as the Internet references provided below when determining whether a certain medication is metabolized by or strongly inhibits or induces CYP enzymes. In addition, the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor if questions arise regardi ng medications not listed above. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ Guidances/UCM292362.pdf http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx 4.4.4 Prohibited Therapy Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below : Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal therapy) , whether health authority approved or experimental , is prohibited for various time periods prior to starting study treatment, depending on the agent (see Section 4.1.2 ), and during study treatment until disease recurrence is documented and the patient has discontinued study treatment , except as outlined below or as described elsewhere in the protocol. Inves tigational therapy is prohibited during the study."

The schedule of activities to be performed during the study is provided in Appendix 1. All activities must be performed and documented for each patient. Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. Patients should be assessed for toxi city prior to each dose; dosing will occur only if the clinical assessment and local laboratory test values are acceptable. If the timing of a protocol -mandated study visit coincides with a holiday and/or weekend that would preclude the visit, the visit sh ould be scheduled on the nearest following feasible date .Any delay visits should be reverted to the original schedule within the next few subsequent visits. For example, no study drug infusion should be skipped due to a visit delay. Assessments schedul ed on the day of study drug administration should be performed prior to study drug infusion, unless otherwise noted. Test results or examinations that are performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and appropriately within 30 days prior to randomization may be used to satisfy screening requirements rather than repeating required tests ; such tests do not need to be repeated for screening. 4.5.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study -related procedures (including screening evaluations) . Informed Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. A separate o ptional informed consent required for collection of optional research samples (see Section 4.5.15.5 )."
62,page_62,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 63/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria before enrollment . The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Please see Appendix 1for the schedule of screening assessments. 4.5.2 Medical History , Concomitant Medication, and Demographic Data Medical history, including clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking history, and use of alcohol and drugs of abuse , will be recorded at baseline . TNBC history will include surgery and radiation therapy. In addition, all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 30days prior to initiation of study treatment will be recorde d. At the time of each follow -up physical examination, an interval medical history should be obtained and any changes in medications and allergies should be recorded. Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity. 4.5.3 Physical Exami nations A complete physical examination, performed at screening, should include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Bilateral breast examination ,including evaluation of locor egional lymphatics ,should be conducted (see Section 4.5.5 ). Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. Limited, symptom -directed physical examinations should be performed at post -baseline visits and as clinically indicated. Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes. New orworsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 4.5.4 Vital Signs Vital signs will include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, and temperature. At every clinic visit where study treatment is administered, v ital signs should be measured within 60 minutes prior to the first infusion and, if clinically indicated, during or after the infusion. In addition, vital signs should be measured at other specified timepoints as outlined in the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1).Vital signs are not"
63,page_63,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 64/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7required to be entered into the eCRF unless abnormal and clinically significant, in which case they are to be reported as adverse events. 4.5.5 Locoregional Tumor Status Physical Examination Assessment of primary tumor and regional lymph nodes must be done by physical examination during the baseline evaluation ,within 3 days prior to each 4-week cycle of study treatment during the neoadjuvant phase ,and within 14 days prior to surgery. Thetumor site must be marked with a radiopaque marker via radiographic guidance (e.g., ultrasound) prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical assessment of tumor measurement in the brea st and/or lymph nodes should be conducted in a consistent manner at each evaluation. Clinical measurements of tumor in the breast should be performed , preferentially using calipers or a ruler/tape measure. The tumor should be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) with conventional techniques (positron emission tomography [PET]scan , CT scan , magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, or X-ray). Ifpossible, these measurements should be conducted by the same as sessor at baseline and throughout the neoadjuvant phase. Tumor measurements at baseline and within 14 days prior to surgery are to be recorded in the eCRF. The main purpose of performing physical examination prior to each cycle is for patient safety and to rule out progressive disease that would lead to study treatment discontinuation. Ultrasound of Breast and A xilla Ultrasound of breast and axilla is mandated at baseline within 28 days prior randomization and within 14 days prior to surgery. If on ult rasound examination there is evidence of suspicious axillary lymph nodes at the baseline examination, then fine-needle aspiration or core -needle biopsy is required. It is strongly recommended that the abnormal lymph node be marked by metallic indicator or other standard approach prior to neoadjuvant therapy. Sonographic tumor measurements are to be recorded ineCRF. Additional Lymph Node A ssessment Patients with clinically negative axilla (by physical examination and radiographic imaging) may undergo a nSLNB procedure prior to NAST if in keeping with local practice. For patients who undergo SLNB, it is strongly recommended that more than one lymph node (two to three minimum) be removed. If the SLNB procedure conducted prior to NAST reveals a lymph node involved with cancer, the patient is not a candidate for the study and should not be enrolled. Mammogram Bilateral mammogram must be obtained at baseline. The unaffected breast should have been imaged within 60 days prior to randomization. The affected breast should be imaged within 28 days prior to randomization. Subsequent mammograms are optional"
64,page_64,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 65/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7during neoadjuvant treatment and prior to surgery and should be performed per investigator’s discretion. Optional procedure mammograms are not required to be entered into the eCRF. Bilateral mammogram is mandated at study completion/early termination visit and every 12 months ( 4 weeks) during the follow -up period. Patients who have undergone mastectomy do not require mammograms of reconstructed breast(s) . Additional Breast Imaging Additional breast imaging such as MRI are per investigator discretion. MRI examination is not mandated by the protocol and should be per local practice. If MRI is conducted, suggested timelines for MRI are within 28 days pri or to protocol therapy, after Cycle 3, and 14 days prior to surgery. Surgical Treatment Plan A surgeon with experience of breast cancer surgery should evaluate patients. The proposed surgical treatment plan at baseline should be documented and reported i n the eCRF. Patients should be reassessed after completion of neoadjuvant therapy/prior to surgery. The patient should be evaluated for the surgical treatment the surgeon feels is technically a candidate to undergo after completion of NAST as well as forthe planned surgical treatment. These treatments should be documented and reported in the eCRF. 4.5.6 Distant Sites Tumor A ssessment Baseline distant sites tumor staging procedures should be performed in alignment with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN )or national guidelines, within 28 days prior to randomization. As a reference, as per NCCN guidelines, staging procedures are based on clinical stage: For Stage II and Stage IIIA: Bone scan is to be performed in presence of bone pain and/or elevat ed alkaline phosphatase; abdominal/pelvic CT scan in case of elevated alkaline phosphatase, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal symptoms or abnormal physical examination; and chest CT scan . For Stage IIIB and Stage IIIC: Bone scan and CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be conducted for all patients. In addition, liver function tests, bone scans, chest X -ray/diagnostic CT scan , liver imaging, and/or other radiographic modalities may be considered when clinically indicated to exclude metastatic disease. 4.5.7 Disease Follow -Up and Confirmation of Disease Progression or Recurrence During the neoadjuvant treatment ,diagnosis of disease progression or second primary breast cancer should be supported by clinical, laboratory, radiological ,and/or hi stological findings. Post-operatively , allpatients must be followed to assess disease recurrence, second primary cancer, and survival. The designation of disease recurrence ,whether"
65,page_65,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 66/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7local, regional or distant ,or a diagnosis of a second primary cancer can be made only when clinical, laboratory, radiological and/or histological f indings support the diagnosis. During the post -operative portion of this study , disease status should be clinically evaluated and documented every 3 months for up to 3years and at interva ls of every 6months thereafter. The diagnosis of a breast cancer progression, recurrence ,or second primary tumor should be confirmed histologically whenever clinically possible. Given the mechanism bywhich immune -modulating therapies work, patients with radiographic lesions suspicious for disease recurrence are strongly recommended to undergo biopsy for histologic confirmation of cancer versus immune -mediated inflammatory process. Some patients may experience a suspicious recurrence that leads to death relatively quickly ,without the possibility of confirming relapse of disease. Efforts should be made to obtain an autopsy report in such cases. The earliest date of diagnosis of disease progression, recurrent disease, or a diagnosis of a seco nd primary cancer should be used and recorded. This date should be based on objective clinical, radiological, histological ,or cytological evidence. Recurrent disease includes local, regional, or distant recurrence and contralateral breast cancer. Whileipsilateral or contralateral in situ disease and second primary non -breast cancers (including in situ carcinomas and non -melanoma skin cancers) will not be counted as progressive disease or recurrent disease, these events should be recorded. Patients who have a diagnosis of in situ breast disease or second (non -breast) malignancies should be maintained on a regular follow -up schedule whenever possible in order to fully capture any subsequent recurrent disease events. The definitions of and procedures for confirming disease recurrence, death, and other noteworthy events on follow -up are provided in Table 2."

Baseline pulmonary function evaluatio ns will include assessments of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory v olume 1 (FEV1) , and forced expiratory f low 25 %75% (FEF25 -75). 4.5.13 Patient -Reported Outcomes To more fully characterize the clinical profile of atezolizumab, PRO data will be obtained through use of the following instruments: EORTC QLQ -C30;item GP5 of the FACT -G,Quality of Life instrument ;and the EuroQoL 5 -Dimension, 5 -Level ( EQ-5D-5L). The PRO instruments, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by the investigator staff and completed on paper in their entirety by the patient at the investigational site. To ensure instrument validity and that data standards meet health authority requirements, questionnaires must be completed by the patient at the start of the clinic visit before discussion of the patient’s health state, lab oratory results ,or health record ;before administration of study treatment ;and/or prior to the performance of any other study assessments that could bias thepatient ’sresponses .If the patient is unable to complete the measure on her or his own, i nterviewer assessment is allowed but may only be conducted by a member of the clinic staff who reads the questionnaire items to the patient verbatim; no interpretat ion, rephrasing, or rewording of the questions is allowed during interview -assisted completion. Study personnel should review all questionnaires for completeness before the patient leaves the investigational site, and the hard copy originals of the questio nnaires must be maintained as part of the patient’s medical record at the site for source data verification. These originals should have the respondent’s initials , study patient number and date and time of completion recorded in compliance with good clini cal practice. Sites will enter patient responses to the PRO questionnaires into the electronic data capture (EDC) system. All patients will begin complet ion of thequestionnaires with the EORTC QLQ -C30, followed by the FACT-G single item GP5, and then the EQ-5D-5Lat timepoints corresponding with in -clinic visits ;both while rec eiving study treatment and after treatment discontinuation . Refer to Appendix 1for the frequency and timing of PRO assessments. 4.5.13.1 EORTC QLQ -C30 The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a validated ,reliable self -report measure (Aaronson et al. 1993 ; seeAppendix 5).Itconsists of 30 questions that assess 5aspects of patient functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), 3symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), global he althstatus (GHS), HRQoL, and 6single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) with a recall"

TheEORTC QLQ -C30 module takes approxi mately 10 minutes to complete. 4.5.13.2 FACT-G Single Item GP5 The FACT -G instrument Version 4 (see Appendix 6) is a validated and reliable 27 -item questionnaire comprised of 4subscales that measure physical (7 items), social/family (7items), emotional (6 items) and functional well -being (7 items), and is considered appropriate for use with patients with any form of cancer ( Cella et al. 1993 ; Webster etal.1999 ). In this study , the single item GP5 (“I am bothered by side effects of treatment”) from the physical well -being subscale of the FACT -G has been selected for individual item analysis to document the level of bother of symptoms on patient’s lives.Patients will assess how true the statement “I am bothered by side effects of treatment” has been for them in the previous 7 days on a 5-point scale (0, not at all; 1,alittle bit; 2, somewhat; 3, quite a bit; 4, very much). The single item GP5 from the FACT -G takes less than a minute to complete. 4.5.13.3 EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D-5L, is a validated self-report health status questionnaire that isused to calculate a health status utility score fo r use in health economic analyses (EuroQol Group 1990 ; Brooks 1996; Herdman et al. 2011 ; Janssen et al. 2013 ; seeAppendix 7). There are two components to the EQ-5D-5L: a five- item health state profile that assesses mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analogue scale that measures health state. Published weighting systems allow for creation of a single composite score of the patient’s health utility. Utility scores will be used in this study for informing pharmacoeconomic evaluations. As such, the u tility results will not be included in the CSR. The EQ -5D-5L takes approx imately 3 minutes to complete. 4.5.14 Mandatory Samples for Whole Genome Sequencing At participating sites, blood samples will be collected for DNA extraction to enable WGSto identify germline mutations that are predictive of response to study drug, are associated with progression to a more severe disease state, are associated with susceptibility to developing adverse events, or can increase the knowledge and understanding o f disease biology. The blood samples may be sent to one or more laboratories for analysis. Collection and submission of W GS samples is contingent upon the review and approval of the exploratory research by each site's IRB/EC and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body.

Patients who are discontinued because of investigator decision will be followed for disease recurrence, new anti -cancer therapy, an d survival (see Section 4.6.2 for further detail s). 4.6.2 Patient Discontinuation from Study Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time. Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: Patient w ithdrawal of consent From study treatment and/or procedures only ( i.e., survival follow -up permitted) , and or From survival follow -up (patient does not want to be contacted) Study termination (see S ection 4.6.3 )or site closure (see Section 4.6.4 ) Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient Patient non -compliance, defined as failure to comply with protocol requirements as determined by the investigator or Sponsor Every effort should be made to obtain information on patients who withdraw from the study. The primary r eason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 4.6.3 Study Discontinuation The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to patients. Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory."
79,page_79,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 80/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7The Sponsor will notify the investigator if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study. Patients who are withdrawn or withdraw from study participation (and not just study treatment) will not be followed up for any reason after consent has been withdrawn. 4.6.4 Site Discontinuation The Sponsor has the right to close a site at any time. Reasons for closing a site may include, but are not limited to, the following: Excessively slow recruitment Poor protocol adherence Inaccurate or incomplete data recording Non-compliance with the International CouncilforHarmonisation (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice No study activity (i.e., all patients have completed the study and all obligations have been fulfilled) 5. ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY 5.1 SAFETY PLA N The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel, doxorubicin ,and cyclophosphamide in completed andongoing studies. The anticipated important safety risks are outlined below (see Section s5.1.15.1.4 ). Guidelines for management of patients who experience specific adverse events are provided in Table 4 (see Section 5.1.5 ). Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study, including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section 4.1) and close monitoring of patients during the study as indicated below . Administration of atezolizumab will be performed in a mon itored setting in which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate equipment and medicine to manage potentially serious reactions. Adverse events will be reported as described in Sections 5.25.6. An iDMC (see Section 3.1.2 ) has also been incorporated into the trial design to periodically review aggregate safety data. The potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, as well as measures intended to avoid or minimize such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections. 5.1.1 Risks A ssociated with A tezolizumab Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as the following: IRRs and immune -mediated hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreat itis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficienc y, hypophysitis, Guillain -Barré"

Immune -mediated reactions may invo lve any organ system and may lead to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome (considered to be potential risks for atezolizumab). Adverse events observed with atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy and/or targeted therapies are consistent with the known risks of each component of the combination treatment. Refer to Appendix 13of the protocol and Section 6 of the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks for atezolizumab. 5.1.2 Risks A ssociated with Nab-Paclitaxel In clinical studies and post -marketing experience, nab -paclitaxel has been associated with alopecia, myelosuppression (primarily neutropenia [including febrile neutropenia] , anemia, thrombocytopenia), neuropathy, cranial nerve palsies, hypersensitivity reactions, pneumonitis, gastrointestinal events (i.e., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), myalgia, arthralgia, cardiotoxicity (myocardial disorders, cardiac failure, angina, tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmia), cystoid macular edema, Stevens -Johnson syndrome/toxi c epidermal necrolysis, infections including sepsis, depression , infusion site reactions/extravasation, hepatic toxicity (drug- induced liver injury), acute renal failure, hemolytic -uremic syndrome, drug- induced lupus erythematous and tumor lysis syndrome . Patients will be monitored for nab -paclitaxel related adverse events, including hematologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic toxicities, and peripheral neuropathy . For more details regarding the safety profile of nab -paclitaxel, refer to the local prescribing information. Other specific instructions can be found in Section s4.4.3 and 5.1.5 for nab -paclitaxel. 5.1.3 Risks A ssociated with Doxorubicin Doxorubicin is known to cause serious cardiomyopathy; arrhythmias, including life-threatening arrhythmias; congestive cardiac failure; i ncreased incidence of secondary acute my elogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome; extravasation and tissue necrosis; severe myelosuppression resulting in serious infection, septic shock, need for transfusions, hospitalization ,and death; tumor lysis syndrom e; radiation sensitization and radiation recall; embryofetal toxicity; alopecia; and vomiting, nausea, and other gastrointestinal effects. Refer to the doxorubicin Summary of Product Characteristics (package insert) for more details regarding the full safety profile of doxorubicin , including boxed warnings and contraindications. 5.1.3.1 Cardio myopathy Patients treated with doxorubicin are at risk of developing cumulative dose -related myocardial damage.

81,page_81,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 82/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7of 40%, have been observed in clinical trials of doxorubicin. Cardiomyopathy may develop during treatment or up to several years after completion of treatment. There is an additive or potentially synergistic increase in the risk of cardiomyopathy in patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinum or concomitant therapy with other known cardiotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide. Patients must meet specified LVEF requirements to be included in this study (see Section 4.1.1 ). Left ventricular function will be monitored by measurement of ejection fraction using ECHO or MUGA scans as described in Section 4.5.10 and the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1). 5.1.4 Risks A ssociated with Cy clophosphamide Cyclophosphamide has been associated with myelosuppression sometimes leading to severe immunosuppression and infections that can be serious and someti mes fatal; hemorrhagic cystitis, pyelitis, ureteritis ,and hematuria; myocarditis, myopericarditis, pericardial effusion, arrhythmias ,and congestive heart failure; pulmonary toxicity including pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary veno -occlusive disease leading to respiratory failure ; impairment of spermatogenesis ;secondary malignancies; veno -occlusive liver disease; embryo -fetal toxicity; alopecia; andnausea, vomiting , anddiarrhea . Refer to the cyclophosphamide Summary of Product Characteristics (package insert) for more details regarding the full safety profile of cyclophosphamide , including boxed warnings and contraindications. 5.1.5 Management of Patients Who Experience Specific A dverse Events There will be no dose modifications for a tezolizumab or placebo in this study. For guidelines regarding the management of atezolizumab -specific adverse events , please refer to Appendix 13of the protocol and Section 6 of the Atezolizumab Investigator ’sBrochure. Study treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing toxicity considered to be related to study treatment . If atezolizumab/placebo is withheld for 12weeks after the event onset , the patient will be discontinued from atezolizumab/p lacebo. If the investigator believes the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit and the Medical Monitor is in agreement, atezolizumab /placebo treatment can be resumed after being withheld for 12 weeks . If a patient needs to be tapered off corticosteroids that were used to treat adverse events, the study treatment may be withheld for 12 weeks . The investigator and the Medical Monitor will determine the acceptable length of treatment interruption."

84,page_84,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 85/Protocol WO39392 , Version 75.2.1 Adverse Events According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in Section 5.3.5.9 Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitan t treatment or discontinuation from study treatment Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria: Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in t he view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death) This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalizatio n (see Section 5.3.5.11) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study treatment Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize th e patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above)"
85,page_85,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 86/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7The terms ""severe ""and ""serious ""are notsynonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event ( e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE; see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the eCRF. Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Spon sor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 5.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy's Law (see Section 5.3.5.7 )and based on the following observations: Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN (or baseline value if baseline value was above the ULN) in combination with total bilirubin 2ULN (of which 35% is direct bilirubin) Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN (or baseline value if baseline value was above the ULN) in combination with clinical jaundice Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study treatment , as defined below : Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only when a contamination of study treatment is suspected. Pneumonitis Colitis Endocrinopathies: diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency, hyperthyroidis m, and hypophysitis Hepatitis, including AST or ALT 10ULN Systemic lupus erythematosus"

If the diagnosis is heart failure, it should be reported as such and not in terms of the individual signs and symptoms thereof. Heart failure should be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0 for “heart failur e” (Grade 2, 3, 4, or 5) and in addition according to the NYHA classification. Heart failure occurring during the study and post -study ( see Section 5.6) must be reported, irrespective of causal relationship, and followed until one of the following occurs: resolution or improvement to baseline status, no further improvement can be expected, or death. 5.2.4.2 Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Sy stolic Dysfunction Asymptomatic declines in LVEF should generally not be reported as adverse event s because LVEF data are collected separately in the eCRF. Exceptions to this rule are as follows: Anasymptomatic d ecline in LVEF 10 percentage points from baseline to an LVEF 50% must be reported as an adverse event with the term “ asymptomatic ejection fraction decreased” as per NCI CTCAE v4.0. An asymptomatic decline in LVEF requiring treatment delay or leading to discontinuation of atezolizumab, nab-paclitaxel, doxorubicin ,or cyclophosphamide must also be reported."

For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ). 5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact. Alladverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section 5.4.2for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). After initiation of study treatment , alladverse events will be reported until 30days after the last dose of study treatment or un til initiation of new anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first, and serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will continue to be reported until 90days after the last dose of study treatment or until initiation of new anti -cancer th erapy, whichever occurs first. Study drug related SAEs will be recorded indefinitely (even if the study has been closed). Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting period are provided in Section 5.6. 5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting advers e event information at all patient evaluation timepoints. Examples of non -directive questions include the following: ""How have you felt since your last clinic visit? "" ""Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here? "" 5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of A dverse Events The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v 4.0) will be used for assessing adverse event severity. Table 5 will be used for assessing severity for adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE."

The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 6 ): Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study treatment Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of study treatment , or reintroduction of study treatment (as applicable) Known association of the event with study treatment or with similar treatments Known associ ation of the event with the disease under study Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the occurrence of the event"
89,page_89,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 90/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7Table 6Causal A ttribution Guidance Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by study treatment on the basis of facts, evidence, science -based rationales, and clinical judgment? YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and administration of study treatment , and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by the patient's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the adverse event follows a known pattern of response to study treatment ; and/or the adverse event ab ates or resolves upon discontinuation of study treatment or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge. NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below : Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than study treatment (e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, orconcomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of study treatme nt(e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after firstdose of study treatment ). For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each protocol -mandated therapy. 5.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.1 Infusion -Related Reactions Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study treatment administration and are judged to be related to study treatment infusion should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., ""infusion -related reaction"") on the Adverse Event eCRF. If possib le, avoid ambiguous terms such as ""systemic reaction."" Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF. If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study treatment , each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF. 5.3.5.2 Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms For adverse events other than IRRs (see Section 5.3.5.1 ), a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only li ver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each"
90,page_90,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 91/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 5.3.5.3 Adverse Events That A reSecondary to Other Events In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: If vomiti ng results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separ ately on the eCRF. If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If neutropenia is ac companied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated. 5.3.5.4 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF. The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the e vent will be recorded at the time the event is first reported. If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Spon sor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instruction s). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated bychanging the event from ""non -serious"" to ""serious,"" providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. A recurrent adverse event is one that r esolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF."
91,page_91,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 92/Protocol WO39392 , Version 75.3.5.5 Abnormal Laboratory Values Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an advers e event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accom panied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment Note: For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse events. It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with chole stasis ), only the diagnosis (i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a cli nically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., ""elevated potassium, ""as opposed to ""abnormal potassium ""). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as ""hyperkalemia. "" Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.6 Abnormal Vital Sign Values Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a chan ge in study treatment (e.g., dosage mo dification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medic al intervention or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significa nt in the investigator’s judgment"
92,page_92,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 93/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g.,high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.7 Abnormal Liver Function Tests The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN)in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (asdefined by Hy's Law ). Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN (or baseline value if baseline value was above the ULN) in combination with total bilirubin 2ULN (of which 35% is direct bilirubin) Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN (or baseline value if baseline value was above the ULN) in combination with clinical jaundice The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laborator y values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.2) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more tha n 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse event or a nadverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.3.5.8 Deaths For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint. Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed by the investigator solely to recurrence and progression of breast cancer should be recorded on the Death Attributed to Progressive Disease eCRF. All other on -study deaths, regardless of relationship to study treatment , must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ). An independent monitoring committee will monitor the frequency of deaths from all causes. Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported . If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, ""unexplained death ""should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the"
93,page_93,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 94/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death ""should be replaced by the established cause of death. The term ""sudden death"" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., ""sudden cardiac deat h""). Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6. 5.3.5.9 Preexisting Medical Conditions A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. W hen recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including app licable descriptors (e.g., ""more frequent headaches ""). 5.3.5.10 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of TNBC Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only. Instances of disease recurrence w ill be verified by pathologic confirmation if clinically feasible . In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration. However, every effort should be made to document progression through use of objective criteria. If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event. 5.3.5.11 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalizati on Any adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined below. An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event: Hospitalization for respite care Planned h ospitaliza tion required by the protocol (e.g., for study treatment administration or performance of an efficacy measurement for the study )"
94,page_94,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 95/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria are met: The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected normal progression of the disease . The pati ent has not experienced an adverse event . Hospitalization due solely to recurrence/ progr ession of the underlying cancer An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not considered to be a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event instead: Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours 5.3.5.12 Cases of A ccidental Overdose or Medication Error Accidental overdose and medication error (hereafter collectively referred to as ""special situations""), are defined as follows: Accidental overdose: accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher than the assigned dose Medication error: accidental deviation in the administration of a drug In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of the drug. Special situations are not in themselves adverse events but may result in adverse events. Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Sectio n5.4.2 ). Foratezolizumab and nab -paclitaxel, adverse events associated with special situations should be recorded as described bel ow for each situation: Accidental overdose: Enter the adverse event term. Check the ""Accidental overdose"" and ""Medication error"" boxes. Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose: Enter the adverse event term. Check the ""Medication error"" bo x. Medication error that qualifies as an overdose: Enter the adverse event term. Check the ""Accidental overdose"" and ""Medication error"" boxes. In addition, all special situations associated with atezolizumab and nab -paclitaxel, regardless of whether they result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as described below: Accidental overdose: Enter the drug name and ""accidental overdose"" as the event term. Check the ""Accidental overdose"" and ""Medication error"" boxes."
95,page_95,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 96/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7Medicati on error that does not qualify as an overdose: Enter the name of the drug administered and a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expired drug administered) as the event term. Check the ""Medication error"" box. Medication error that qualifies as an overdose: Enter the drug name and ""accidental overdose"" as the event term. Check the ""Accidental overdose"" and ""Medication error"" boxes. Enter a description of the error in the additional case details. Intercepted medication error: Enter the drug name and ""intercepted medication error"" as the event term. Check the ""Medication error"" box. Enter a description of the error in the additional case details. As an example, a n accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require the completion of two Adverse Event eCRF pages, one to report the accidental overdose and one to report the headache. The ""Accidental overdose"" and ""Medication error"" boxes would need to be c hecked on both eCRF pages. 5.3.5.13 Patient -Reported Outcome Data Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data by the Sponsor, and safety analyses will not be performed using PRO data. However, if any PRO responses suggestive of a possible adverse even t are identified during site review of the PRO data, the investigator will determine whether the criteria for an adverse event have been met and, if so, will report the event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.4 IMMEDIA TE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM INVESTIGA TOR TO SPONSOR Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial. The investigator must report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should rep orting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event. The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study treatment : Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) Adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for further details) For serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, t he investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).

A report will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management by the EDC system. In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, theSerious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitte d to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators . Once the EDC system is available , all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system. Instructions for reporting serious adverse events that occur 90 days after the last dose of study treatment are provided in Section 5.6. 5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies 5.4.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab, 1 month after the last dose of nab -paclitaxel, 6 months after the last dose of doxorubicin, or 12 months after the last dose of cyclophosphamide, whichever is lat er. A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to th e Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax n umber or email address provided to investigators. Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. The investigator should discontinue study treatment and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on t he fetus. Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/bi rth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of th e pregnancy becomes available. 5.4.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 6months after the last dose of nab -paclitaxel, cyclo phosphamide, or doxorubicin . AClinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators. Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study treatm ent. When permitted by the site, the pregnant partner would need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health"

If the authorization has been signed, the investigator should submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available. An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide information on the risks of the pregna ncy and the possible effects on the fetus, to support an informed decision in cooperation with the investigator and/or obstetrician. 5.4.3.3 Abortions Aspontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.1 ). A therapeutic or elective aborti on performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal or embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event. All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form. 5.4.3.4 Congenital A nomalies /Birth D efects Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study treatment or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study treatment should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PA TIENT S AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 5.5.1 Investigator Follow -Up The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent. Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study treatment or trial -related procedures until a fi nal outcome can be reported. During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification. All pregnancies reported during the s tudy should be followed until pregnancy outcome."
99,page_99,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 100/Protocol WO39392 , Version 75.5.2 Sponsor Follow -Up For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up with the investigator by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a m onitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THA T OCCUR AFTER THE A DVERSE EVENT REPORTING PERI OD After the end of the reporting period for all serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest (defined as 90 days after the last dose of study treatment ), all deaths, regardless of cause, should be repo rted through use of the Long -Term Survival Follow -Up eCRF. In addition, if the investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior exposure to study treatment, the event should be reported through use of the Adverse Event eCRF. However, if the EDC system is not available, the investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators. 5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEA LTH AUTHORITIE S, INVESTIGA TORS, INSTI TUTIONA L REVIEW BOA RDS, A ND ETHICS COMMITTEES The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and a dverse events of special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. To determine repo rting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference document s: Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure Local prescribing information (e.g., Section 4.8 of E.U. Summary of Product Characteristics for nab -paclitaxel) The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed."

Anaggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the test product will be submitted to health authorities. 6. STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLA N The primary anal ysis population for efficacy is the ITT population, defined as all randomized patients , and the PD -L1positive subpopulation, defined as patients in the ITT population whose PD -L1 status is IC1/2/3 at the time of randomization. Patients will be assigned to the treatment group to which they were ran domized. The PRO -evaluable population is defined as patients in the ITT population with baseline PRO assessment. The primary analysis population for safety is the safety -evaluable population ,defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. Patients will be assigned to treatment groups as treated, and all patients who received any dose of atezolizumab will be included in the atezolizumab treatment arm. 6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE The study will first randomize approximately N1204 patients in S tage 1 (1:1randomization ratio). Based on information from these patients and a pre- specified adaptive rule, the decision will be made regarding whether or not to randomize approximately N2120 patients in S tage 2 (1:1 randomization ratio). Details of the adaptive design as well as th e statistical procedures to control the overall one-sided type I error at 0.025 are described in the sections below. Additional details are provided in Appendix 14andAppendix 15. 6.1.1 Adaptive Design The design is a two- stage adaptive enrichment design for the co -primary endpoints of pCR in the ITT (F) and PD -L1postive (S) population at the overall one -sided significance level  0.025. The design closely follows the general statistical principles for adaptive enrichment designs described in Wassmer et al. 2016 . The study will first randomize approximately   204patients in S tage 1 (1:1randomization ratio). Based on information from these patients and a pre- specified adaptive rule, one of the following decisions will be taken: 1.Not initiate S tage 2 due to efficacy in F, S, or both populations. 2.Not initiate Stage 2 due to lack of efficacy in both F and S . 3.Continue the trial to Stage 2. In Stage 2, another approxi mately   120 patients will be randomized (1:1 randomization ratio). Based on data from Stage 1, a decision will be taken to either randomize patients from the ITT (F) or from the PD-L1positive (S) population only in Stage 2."
101,page_101,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 102/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7This design has two sources of multiplicity: a) Two co -primary populations and b) two analyses ( Stage 1 data only, Stage 1 and Stage 2 data combined). To protect the familywise one- sided type I error of the trial (α) for this study at 0.025 in the strong sense, the co -primary endpoints will be tested using Simes’ method at each stage (Wassmer et al. 2016) and p -values will be combined across stages usin g the weighted inverse normal combination test with pre -defined weights (Wassmer et al. 2016)   =   (  +   ) ⁄and   =   (  +   ) ⁄ for Stage 1 and Stage 2, respectively, with   =204and   =120denoting the planned sample sizes for both stages. Ofnote, the planned sample size rather than the actual number of recruited patients will be used for the determination of the weights to protect type I error. If   and   denote the p-values based on Stage 1 or S tage 2 data only (for the null hypotheses   { },   { }orthe intersection null hypothesis   { , }, respectively), then the combination p -value is defined as      = 1 −   {  ∙    (1 −    )+   ∙    (1 −    )}(Wassmer et al. 2016) . Further details regarding the testing procedure are provided in Appendix 14and Appendix 15, as well as the Statistical Analysis P lan. 6.1.2 Type I Error Control The pre -defined one -sided type I error for the interim analysis at Stage 1 is   0.0125 (i.e.,50% of the total type I error). The co -primary endpoints in F and S at Stage 1 will be tested using a closed testing procedure using Simes’ test for the intersection hypothesis. As stated in Wassmer et al . 2016 , test statistics in F and S are always positively correlated, hence type I error rate control of the Simes test can be guaranteed in general. Importantly , the p -value   based on Stage 1 data only and the combination p -value       have the same joint distribution under the null hypothesis as the p -values from a group -sequential test with two stages at information times   =   and  = 1. Thus standard statistical software for group sequential designs can be used for the determination of critical values for the adaptive design (Wassmer et al. 2016) . As the study design uses a critical value of   0.0125 (i.e. ,50% of the total type I error) for Stage 1, this implies that a critical value of      0.0184 can be applied to the combination p -values. 6.2 SUMMA RIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY For all randomized patients (i.e., ITT population) , aparticipant flowchart for depicting the progress of subjects through the phases of the trial will be provided by treatment arm , including a complete description of patient disposition specifying the number of randomized patients and completed and discontinued patients from trial treatment and study with reasons for premature discontinuation. Documented protocol deviations including those related to study inclusion/exclusion criteria, conduct of the study, patient management ,or patient assessment will be also tabulated by treatment arm."

Only descriptive analyses are planned; no formal statistical tests will be applied . Continuous variables will be reported and summarized by use of standard measures of central tendency and dispersion ( mean , standard deviation, median, and range including mi nimum and maximum ),and categorical (i.e., discrete) data will be reported and summarized by frequencies and percentages . The baseline value of any variable will be defined as the last available value prior to the first administration of study treatment. 6.4 EFFICA CY AN ALYSES Details of the analyses, including methods for handling missing data, are specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). 6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint : Pathologic Complete Response The primary efficacy objective for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant atezolizumab nab-pacAC compared with placebo nab-pacAC in patients with T2 -4d TNBC , as measured by pCR defined as eradication of tumor from both breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/is ypN0). The primary efficacy endpoin t will be established following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery. The ITT as well as PD -L1positive population swill be used for the primary analysis of pCR. In the primary analysis, patients whose pCR assessment was missing will be counted as not achieving a pCR. An estimate of the pCR rate and its 95% CI (Clopper and Pearson 1934) will be calculated for each treatment arm. The difference in pCR rates will be provided with 95% CI, using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. For the ITT population, theCochran -Mantel -Haenszel 2teststratified according to tumor PD -L1 status (IC0 vs .IC1/2/3) and clinical stage at presentation (Stage II vs .III) will be used to testpCR rates between treatment groups at a two- sided significance level of 5%. For the PD -L1positive population, similar test will be used with stratification only for clinical stage at presentation. An unstratified 2versions of these tests will also be provided as a sensitivity analysis. 6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary efficacy e ndpoints are the following : EFS in all patients (ITT population) and in the subpopulation with PD-L1positive tumor status DFS in all patients (ITT population) who und ergo surgery and in the subpopulation of patients with PD -L1-positive tumor status who undergo surgery"

Patients without an event at the time of the analysis will be censored on the date on which they are last known to be alive and event free, on or before the clinical data cutoff date for the respective analysis. Patients with no post -baseline information will be censored at the date of randomization. EFS will be compared between treatment arms with anunstratified log-rank test. TheHR for EFS will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. The95% CI for the HR will be provided. Kaplan -Meiermethodology will be used to estimate the median EFS (if reached) for each treatment arm, and Kaplan -Meier curves will be produced. Brookmeyer -Crowley methodology will be used to construct the 95% CI for the median EFS for each treatment arm ( Brookmeyer and Crowley 1982 ). The Kaplan -Meier approach will be used to estimate 3-year EFS rates and corresponding 95% CIs for each treatment arm. The stratification factors for all analyses bas ed on the ITT population will be : AJCC disease stage (II vs. III) and PD -L1 status (IC0 vs. IC1/2/3). The stratification factors for EFS analysis in the PD -L1positive subpopulation will be AJCC disease stage (II vs. III) . Results from unstratified analyses will also be provided. 6.4.2.2 Disease -Free Survival DFS is defined as the time from surgery (i.e., the first date of no disease) to the first documented disease recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. DFS will be analyzed with the use of the same met hodology as specified for EFS for both t he ITT population and the PD -L1positive subpopulation .The DFS analysis will be performed approximately 36 months after the randomization of the last patient. Patients who do not undergo surgery at the end of neoadjuvant treatment will be excluded from the analysis of D FS. Patients without a DFS event at the time of analysis will be censored at the date whe n they were last known to be alive and event free. Patients who do not have information after surgery will be censored at the date ofsurgery. 6.4.2.3 Overall Survival OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Patients who are not reported as having died at the time of analyses will be"

Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range) of absolute scores and mean changes from baseline will be calculated for the functional (role [Question {Q}6, Q7], physical [Q1 Q5]) and the GHS/HRQoL (Q29, Q30) scales of the EORTC QLQ -C30 at each assessment timepoint foreach arm .The mean (and 95% CI) and median of the absolute scores and the changes from baseline will be reported for interval and continu ousvariables. Previously published minimally important differences will be used to identify meaningful change from baseline within each treatment group on the function al and GHS/ HRQo L scales (Osoba et al. 1998; Cocks et al. 2011). The EORTC QLQ -C30 (Version 3) data will be scored according to the EORTC scoring manual ( Fayers et al. 2001 ). PRO completion, compliance rates, and reasons for missing data will be summarized at each timepoint by treatment arm .

When determining post -baseline incidence, patients are considered to be A DA positive if they a re ADA negative or aremissing data at baseline but develop an A DA response following study drug exposure (treatment -induced A DA response), or if they are A DA positive at baseline and the titer of one or more post -baseline samples is at least 0.60 titer un it greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment -enhanced A DA response). Patients are considered to be ADA negative if they are A DA negative or aremissing data at baseline and all post-baseline samples are negative, or if they are A DA positive at baseline but do not have any post -baseline samples with a titer that is at least 0.60 titer unit greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment unaffected). The relationship between A DA status and safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics may be investigated. 6.8 BIOMA RKER ANAL YSES Exploratory biomarker analyses will be performed in baseline pretreatment , on-treatment, residual -disease, and post -recurrence samples in an effort to understand the association of these markers with study treatment outcom e, including efficacy and/or adverse events. The biomarkers may include but will not be limited to PD -L1 and other biomarkers in tumor and blood, as defined by IHC, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, NGS, or other methods. Results will be presented in a separate report. WGS data will be analyzed in the context of this study and explored in aggregate with data from other studies to increase researchers ’understanding of disease pathobiology and guide the development of new therapeutic approaches. 6.9 INTERIM A NALYSES 6.9.1 Planned Interim Analysis Up to a total of two analyses of pCR endpoints will be performed. Aninterim efficacy analys is will be initiated for this study after all of the patients enrolled in Stage 1 (approximately 204) have received surger yor discontinued early from the neo-adjuvant phase. The interim analysis will be performed by an independent Data Coordinating C enter (iDCC) and evaluated by an independent Data Monitoring C ommittee (iDMC). Depending on iDMC recommendation at the interi m analysis, the study could continue enrolling approximately 120 patients in S tage 2 and primary efficacy pCR analysis will then be conducted after all of these patients have received surgery or discontinued early from t he neo -adjuvant phase. The decision rules to be applied at the interim analysis will be clearly expressed to the iDMC and documented in the iDMC charter ,as well as Appendix 14and the Statistical Analysis Plan, so that the study can be conducted with"
107,page_107,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 108/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7the Sponsor remaining completely blinded to all results at this stage. Provisions will be in place to ensure the study continues to meet the highest standards of integrity when an optional interim analysis is executed. Interactions between the iDMC and Sponsor will be carried out as specified in the iDMC charter. The boundar iesfor statistical significance at the interim andprimary analysis for pCR, as well as me thods to control for the overall type I error are discussed in Section 6.1.2 . 6.9.2 Optional Interim Analysis To adapt to information that may emerge during the course of this study,the Sponsor may choose to conduct optional interim analyses before the final analysis for EFS , DFS , and OS, if needed (e.g., for regulatory or publication purposes). The decision to conduct an optional interim analysis, along with the rationale, timing, and statistical details for the analysis, will be documented in the Sponsor’s trial master file prior to the c onduct of the interim analysis. 7. DATA COLLECTION A ND M ANAG EMENT 7.1 DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE The Sponsor will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of the data. Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of eCRFs. Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system. In the event of discrepant data, the Sponsor will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. The Sponsor w ill produce an EDC Study Specification document that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data. Central laboratory data and any other externally generated electronic study data will be sent directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail. System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the Sponsor’s standard procedures. PRO data will be collected on paper questionnaires. The data from the questionnaires will be entered into the EDC system by site staff . 7.2 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RT FORMS eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system. Sites will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion. eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the Sponsor ."
108,page_108,"Atezolizumab F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 109/Protocol WO39392 , Version 7All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff. eCRFs should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee. At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her si te in a readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required. 7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to confirm th at critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documen ted for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PRO questionnaires , evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copiesof transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical department s involved in a clinical trial. Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior wri tten or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retent ion of records described in Section 7.5. To facilitate source data verification and review , the investigators and institutions must provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The study site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with healt h authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. Anacceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewab le audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the change, and date of the change."

However, patients who experience an infusion -related reaction (IRR) or cytokine -release syndrom e (CRS) with atezolizumab may receive premedication with antihistamines , anti-pyretics , and/ or analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions. Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited in treating atezolizumab -associated IRRs because of its potential for causing agranulocytosis. IRRs are known to occur with the administration of monoclonal antibodies and have been reported with atezolizumab. These reactions, which are thought to be due to release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators, occur wi thin 24 hours of atezolizumab administration and are generally mild to moderate in severity. CRS is defined as a supraphysiologic response following administration of any immune therapy that results in activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T ce lls and/or other immune effector cells. Symptoms can be progressive, always include fever at the onset, and may include hypotension, capillary leak (hypoxia), and end -organ dysfunction (Lee et al. 2019). CRS has been well documented with chimeric antigen receptor T -cell therapies and bispecific T -cell engager antibody therapies but has also been reported with immunotherapies that target PD -1 or PD -L1 (Rotz et al. 2017; Adashek and Feldman 2019), including atezolizumab. There may be significant overlap in signs and symptoms of IRRs and CRS, and in recognition of the challenges in clinically distinguishing between the two, consolidated guidelines for medical management of IRRs and CRS are provided in Table 7."

NCI CTCAE v4.0 should be used when reporting severi ty of IRRs, CRS, or organ toxicities associated with CRS on the Adverse Event eCRF. Organ toxicities associated with CRS should not influence overall CRS grading. bFever is defined as temperature 38C not attributable to any other cause. In patients who develop CRS and then receive anti -pyretic, anti -cytokine, or corticosteroid therapy, fever is no longer required when subsequently determining event severity (grade).

Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders sharing the common feature of inflammatory muscle injury; dermatomyositis and polymyositis are among the most common disord ers. Initial diagnosis is based on clinical (muscle weakness, muscle pain, skin rash in dermatomyositis), biochemical (serum creatine kinase increase), and imaging (electromyography/MRI) features, and is confirmed with a muscle biopsy. Patients with signs and symptoms of myositis, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 13.

The overall one- sided type I error for testing the co -primary endpoints of pCR is   =  .   . Two main sources for multiplicity in statistical testing from the current design are: Multiple target populations, namely ITT and PD -L1positive populations Study having two stages with target population at Stage 2 depending on results from Stage 1 Simes’ closed testing procedure will be used to address multiplicity in target populations and weighted inverse p -value combination method is applied to account for the adaptive choice of target population at Stage 2 as follows. At Stage 1 For the interim analysis at end of Stage 1, the co -primary endpoints of pCR in the ITT and PD -L1positive population will be tested at the pre-defined one -sided type I error of 0.0125 (i.e., 50% of the total type I error) following Simes’ procedure. This involves the following p -values:   { }is the p -value from the one-sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) χ test for difference in pCR rates between treatment groups in the ITT population (F) stratified according to tumor PD -L1 status (IC0 vs. IC1/2/3) and clinical stage at presentation (Stage II vs. III). The associated elementary null hypothesis is denoted as H { }:F0.   { }is the p -value from the CMH χ test for difference in pCR rates between treatment groups in the PD-L1positive population (S) stratified according to clinical stage at presentation (Stage II vs. III).

At Stage 2 (if needed) If the study advances to Stage 2, at the prim ary efficacy analysis for pCR to protect the overall αthe corresponding boundary for statistical significance is α =0.0184, accounting for the fact that and overall α = 0.0125 having been spent at Stage 1 and the information fraction at Stage 1, namely w = N (N + N ) ⁄. Indeed, the p -value p based on Stage 1 data only and the combination p -value p have the same joint distribution under the null hypothesis as the p -values from a group- sequential test with two stages at information times t = w andt = 1. Thus, standard statistical software for group sequential designs can be used for the determination of critical values for the adaptive design (W assmer andBrannath 2016, Section 6.2.4). Final test(s) involving the target population(s) selected at Stage 1 will be based on weighted inverse normal p -value combination method ( Wassmer andBrannath 2016) as follows: Let w = N (N + N ) ⁄and w = N (N + N ) ⁄be the a priori chosen weights associated with Stage 1 and Stage 2, respectively.

N was fixed at 120 to achieve optimal statistical operating characteristics across several simulation scenarios as provided in Appendix 15. A summary table that presents the number and proportion of pCR in each treatment arm, together with the 2- sided 95% CIs with use of the Clopper Pearson method (Clopper and Pearson 1934) will be produced by stage and overall for both the ITT and PD-L1positive populations. Confidence intervals for the difference in pCR rate between the two arms will be determined using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution."

Simulations were carried out to e valuate the operation characteristics of the current design under a variety of conditions as follows. Three simulation scenarios were considered with numerical details provided in Table 1 and results in Tables 2, 3 , and 4. Subgroup S with very strong credentials Subgroup S has very strong credentials when convincing evidence indicates that the benefits of the treatment are limited to the Subgroup S. Subgroup S with strong credentials Subgroup S has strong credentials whe n evidence for the predictive ability of the subgroup is convincing enough to assume that the treatment is more likely to be effective (and is probably more effective) in the Subgroup S than in the complement Subgroup C, but the evidence is not sufficientl y compelling to rule out a clinically meaningful effect in complement Subgroup C. Subgroup S with weak credentials If the Subgroup S has weak credentials when convincing evidence for predictive value of the Subgroup S is lacking and the treatment is expect ed to be broadly effective.
