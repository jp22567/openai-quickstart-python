Multiple sclerosis has a prevalence of approximately 1 case per 1,000 in the population and a predominance in women (female to male ratio, 2:1). The mean age at onset is 30 years. Although MS is a heterogeneous illness , in 85% of patients it begins with e pisodic, largely reversible neurologic dysfunction, in a pattern termed relapsing- remitting (RR) MS. In 75% of those patients, the disease advances over time to a steady, irreversible worsening state designated secondary -progressive (SP) MS. Less than 5% of patients have very severe disability (fulminant MS) within the first 5 years after onset, and 10% to 20% of patients remain unimpaired without therapy (benign MS) for 20 years or so . Clinical manifestations of MS include visual loss, paresthesias, weakness, spasticity, fatigue, and pain. Multiple sclerosis symptoms may initially wax and wane with the onset and resolution of exacerbations. However, in the latter disease stages, most patients progress to have some permanent disability. Multiple scleros is treatment relies on pharmaceutical agents to slow disease progression and reduce the burden of MS symptoms. Spasticity is a common complication in MS and occurs in up to 84% of patients. The main sign of spasticity is resistance to passive limb movemen t characterized by increased resistance to stretching, clonus, and exaggerated deep reflexes. The associated features of spasticity, including pain, gait disorders, fatigue, and loss of function, significantly affect patient quality of life. Data collect ed from the North American Research Committee on MS (NARCOMS) Patient Registry showed that 34% of over 20,000 MS patients surveyed experienced moderate, severe, or total limitation of physical abilities due to spasticity. Consequently, one of the main obj ectives for the functional management of MS is the symptomatic treatment of spasticity , aiming to improve gait, hygiene, and all the impeded activities of daily living. However, current oral pharmacologic treatments of MS fail in the total control of this problem, both for intolerability or lack of efficacy, defining the unmet medical need for treatment of spasticity. Baclofen has been in clinical use for more than 35 years and the benefits and risks are well characterized. It is approved for the treatmen t of spasticity due to MS and spinal cord injury and is a first -line pharmacotherapy as described in the MS Council for Clinical Practice Guidelines for treatment of spasticity in MS. However, the therapeutic potential of baclofen is limited because it is poorly tolerated by patients due to the side effects of sedation, drowsiness, and worsening of fatigue. Therefore, an unmet medical need exists for an effective, better tolerated oral treatment of spasticity. Baclofen is a racemate (rac- baclofen) consist ing of an equal mixture of two enantiomers: the l- or R-enantiomer (arbaclofen) and the d- or S -enantiomer. Osmotica Pharmaceutical is currently developing arbaclofen extended -release tablets (AERT) for the treatment of spasticity in patients with MS. Ar baclofen is the active R -enantiomer of baclofen and it has been postulated that the efficacy of baclofen is primarily due to the R -enantiomer. This"

Subjects from the double- blind study (Study OSS440- 3004) may rollover into this open- label extension study , as well as de novo subjects , provided that all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are met. Eligible de novo subject s will undergo a washout period withdrawing all medications used for anti- spasticity and/or muscle relaxation up to 21 days prior to enrolling in this open- label study. T here will be a 9-day titration period, then a 52- week maintenance period, followed by a 2- week taper period. Figure 1 presents the timeline diagram for the study. Figure 2 presents the open- label dosing regimen flowchart, including titration and taper doses, to be used during the study. Once the subject has reached the maintenance dose, they will remain on that dose for approximately 1 year. The maintenance dose will be the highest tolerated dose not exceeding 80 mg per day. Table 1 presents the schedule of assessments, including study visits and weeks, for the study. 4.2 Rationale for S tudy Design and Dose Selection Chronic exposure in an open- label extension design is appropriate to evaluate the safety of long- term use of an investigational product . The omission of a control group is appropriate. The subjects will be selected according to predefined entry criteria from the previous Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo -controlled study. The open- label study treatment duration of approximately 1 year is adequate for chronic exposure. Nonclinical arbaclofen data from a 3 -month rat toxicity study (Study 0460RO24.001) show margins of exposure greater than 1 and adverse effects at exposures up to 10-fold higher than those projected to occur in this Phase 3 study that were not life -threaten ing, were clinically monitorable, and were reversible, which"

To date, Osmotica has conducted 11 clinical studies (Phases 1 through 3) utilizing AERT in doses up to 80 mg/day in single and divided doses. The open -label exten sion study is necessary to obtain safety information about the long -term use of AERT at the highest target dose to treat patients with spasticity due to MS because it is a chronic condition. 5 STUDY POPULATION It is anticipated that approx imately 50% of subj ects randomized into the double -blind study (Study OSS440-3004) may rollover into this open- label study . In addition, United States ( US) subjects who did not participate in Study OS440- 3004 ( i.e., de novo subjects ) may also enroll into the current study provided that all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are met. In total, approx imately 300 subjects are to be enrolled in order to achieve treatment of at least 100 subjects for 6 months, and 50 subjects at 80 mg/day for at least 1 year; however, the sponsor reserves the right to end this clinical study after a sufficient number of subjects have enrolled to complete the requirement . 5.1 Inclusion Criteria Male and female subjects will be considered eligible for participation in the study if all the following inclusion criteria are satisfied at Visit 1 ( Baseline). 1. Subjects 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive. 2. An established diagnosis per McD onald Criteria (Polman et al 2011) of MS (either RR or SP course) that manifests a documented history of spasticity for at least 6 months prior to Baseline. 3. Has participated in Study OS440- 3004 or is a new US subject (i.e., a de novo subject ) who fulfills the inclusion/exclusion criteria . a. De novo subjects being considered for enrollment must have spasticity due to MS as shown by a TNmAS -MAL score ≥2a (Appendix 1) 4. Is willing to continue on open- label treatment with AERT as described in this protocol. 5. If receiving disease- modifying medications (e.g., interferons appr oved for MS, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, fingolimod , or mitoxantrone ), there must be no change in dose for at least 3 months prior to Baseline, and the subject must be willing to maintain this treatment dose for the duration of the study . If receivin g AMPYRA® (dalfampridine, fampridine, 4-amino puridine), subject must be at a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to Baseline. 6. Stable regimen for at leas t 1 month prior to Baseline for all medications and non-pharmacological therapies that are intended to alleviate spasticity . a Total numerical score of a limb accounts for the sum of the 3 main joint muscular group scores."

Once the subject has reached the maintenance dose, they will remain on that dose for approximately 1 year (Figure 2). The maintenance dose w ill be the highest tolerated dose, not exceeding 80 mg per day. The description of study drug kits and treatments is shown below in Table 2. Subjects may choose to taper study drug after Visit 3 if they experience adverse events . Direct consultation with the investigato r site must be conducted before consideration for dose taper. Dose tapers should occur over the course of 9 days in 20 mg increments. Subjects should be encouraged to titrate back to 80 mg once adverse events subside or remain on the maximally tolerated AERT dose. Up to 3 dose tapers over the course of the clinical study are permitted."

Package description: HDPE whi te bottles with 60 active 20-mg tablets. Daily dose: 40, 60, and 80 mg arbaclofen depending on the study day. There will be a 9-day titration period ( 3 days at 40 mg/day, 3 days at 60 mg/day , and then increase to 80 mg/day ), then a n approximately 1-year maintenance period at 80 mg/day or the highest tolerated dose , followed by a 2 -week taper period . Study tablets will be taken twice daily (BID). Cumulative maximal dosage: up to 28,420 mg arbaclofen Manufacturer: Osmotica Pharmaceutical US LLC, Marietta, GA 30062 7.1.1 Treatment Administration The study medications will be administered orally twice daily (every 12 hours, or BID) without regard to food. Note: For the 60 mg/day titration, this means 1 x 20 mg AERT in the morning and 2 x 20 mg AERT in the even ing. Once the subject has reached the maintenance dose, they will remain on that dose for approximately 1 year. The maintenance dose will be the highest tolerated dose, not exceeding 80 mg per day. All attempts should be made for subjects to titrate to the 80 mg per day dose. If subjects experience untoward tolerability issues due to AERT , they may taper study drug only under the guidance of the study site ( i.e., in 20 mg increments per week). Subjects may subsequently attempt study drug taper if the investigator deems this clinically appropriate. There will be no taper phase for subjects who solely achieve a 40 mg per day maintenance dose. Subjects may attempt to titrate to the target dose of 80 mg per day, if tolerability issues have resolved. If a s ubject misses 7 or more consecutive days of dosing AND has taken less than 80% of their doses of study medication in a 42- day (6 -week) period, then the subject must be discontinued ( see Section 12.4). 7.1.2 Labeling of Study Drug Study medication will be provided in labeled bottles. The labels will include all information required by federal and local regulations. 7.1.3 Storage of Study Drug Arbaclofen extended -release tablets must be stored at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F), excursions permitted to between 15°C and 30°C (59°F to 86°F) (see USP Controlled Room Temperature . At study sites, all study medication must be stored, secured , and locked in a safe place."

The Principal Investigator or designee will confirm receipt of the study drug by signature and date. A copy of this receipt must be returned to the Sponsor or designee when the contents of the drug shipment have been verified. In addition, an accurate study drug dispensing record that specifies the date and amount dispensed to each subject must be kept in accordance with the study drug accountability form . This inventory record must be available for inspection during an audit ( e.g., by Sponsor or a regulatory agency). At the conclusion of the study, the Principal Investigator must provide a copy of this record to the Sponsor. Under no circumstances will the i nvestigator allow the investigational drugs to be used other than as directed by this protocol. The study medication must be protected from unauthorized access (e.g., in a locked storage facility). Qualified study personnel must use the specified randomization system to a ssign subjects to treatment. Reasons for digression from the expected dispensing regimen must also be recorded. At the end of the study , all medication must be reconciled. Any unused medication will be inventoried by the investigator or designee and retained by the site until instructed otherwise by Sponsor. 7.3 Handling and Disposal of Study Drug The study drug must be protected from unauthorized access ( e.g., in a locked storage facility). Any unused, partially used, or empty bottles of study drug will be returned to the Sponsor or designee by the time of the site’s close -out visit. Receipt, distribution, and return of the study drug must be properly documented on forms provided by the Sponsor or designee. 7.4 Method of Assignment of Study Drug This is an open- label study and all subjects will begin treatment with AERT at 40 mg per day (20 mg BID) for 3 days , then increase to 60 mg per day ( 20 mg in the morning and 2 x 20 mg in the evening ) for 3 days , and then increase to 80 mg per day (2 x 20 mg BID). Once the subject has reached the maintenance dose, they will remain on that dose for approximately 1 year. The maintenance dose will be the highest tolerated dose, not exceeding 80 mg per day. Subject will be allowed to taper the 80- mg/day dose for issues of tolerability on at most three occasions. If tolerability issues persist, the subject will be required to discontinue from the study. After Baseline procedures have been completed, authorized site personnel will acknowledge that the applicable subject met al l the specified inclusion criteria ( Section 5.1) and none of the exclusion criteria ( Section 5.2) and an enrollment number will be sequentially assigned."

For de novo subjects, a ll medications taken within 30 days before Baseline are to be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF ). Eligible de novo subjects will undergo an up to 21-day washout period (no drug onboard) for withdrawal of all medications used for anti -spasticity and/ or muscle relaxation prior to Baseline (see Inclusion Criterion 6). Any s ubject will be ineligible for the current open- label study if they are concomitantly us ing any of the medications listed in Appendix 5 (see Exclusion Criterion 5). Table 3 presents the half -life, taper period, and washout period for specific anti -spasticity a nd/or muscle relaxation medications. Tapering of an existing anti -spasticity drug depends on the dose of the drug and other conditions. The investigator should use medical judgment to safely taper the dose. Under most conditions, the taper should take no more than 2 weeks. For anti -spasticity medications not shown in Table 3, please contact the medical monitor for discussions of the washout period .

Changes in either the dose or frequency of conc omitant medications taken for the treatment of MS should not be made for the duration of this study. In the event a dose adjustment is needed for a concomitant medication, the investigator will contact the Sponsor to determine if the subject may remain in the study or needs to be withdrawn."

Subjects who experience an acute MS exacerbation/relapse (symptoms including but not limited to visual disturbance, dizziness, tingling, or extreme fatigue lasting greater than 24 hours and occurring at least 30 days after a previous relapse) requiring immediate therapy or adjustment in disease- modifying medication dose ( e.g., oral or intravenous high-dose steroid therapy) will be discontinued from this study. Other medication that is considered necessary for the subject’s safety and well -being may be given at the discretion of the investigator. The administration of all medication (including investigational products) will be recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF . Data collection for concomitant medication s will include information on indication, dose, route, dosing frequency, start date, stop date, and will continue throughout the study. The investigator or study staff will ask the subject at every study visit whether they have taken any new medications or had changes in their current medications since the last study visit. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that any change in concomitant medications during the study is recorded in the source documentation and entered in the eCRF . 7.8 Use of Contraception and Pregnancy Testing Prior to study enrollment, females of childbearing potential and female partners of male subjects must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. Females of childbearing potential include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea >12 consecutive months). De novo premenopausal women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 21 days before Baseline and all enrolled subjects , if they are sexually active or become sexually active during the study, must use an effective method of birth control such as those listed below during the course of the study. Urine pregnancy testing will be done at Visits 1 through 8. The following is not an all -inclusive list; the subject must discuss with the investigator the most appropriate form of birth control: • Hormonal methods o Oral contraceptives o Implant o Injection o Transdermal patch"
28,page_28,"Study OS440 -3005 Osmotica Pharmaceutical US LLC Arbaclofen extended -release tablets CLN.OS440 -3005.PR.A02.USA CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 of 70 o Intravaginal ring • Intrauterine device (hormonal or non-hormonal) • Barrier methods o Condom (male or female) with spermicide o Diaphragm with spermicide • Complete abstinence 7.9 Treatment Compliance Subject compliance will be based on drug accountability information. Non-compliance will be defined as subjects taking less than 80% or more than 120% of prescribed study medication overall as assessed by the amount of study drug returned by the subject at the end of the study . If a subject misses 7 or more consecutive days of dosing AND has taken less than 80% of their doses of study medication in a 42- day (6 -week) period, then the subject must be discontinued. 8 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 8.1 Patient Global Impression of Change The PGIC is a standard instrument that is a well validated outcome measure. The 7 -point PGIC measures change in the subject’s overall status using the following categorical scale: • 1 = Very much improved • 2 = Much improved • 3 = Improved • 4 = No change • 5 = Minim ally wor se • 6 = Much worse • 7 = V ery much worse The PGIC will be completed at the visits specified in Table 1. The PGIC is provided in Appendix 3. 8.2 Total Numeric- Transformed Modified Ashworth Scale The TNmAS is considered the primary clinical measure of muscle spasticity in subjects with neurological conditions. It is a useful 6-point rating scale to measure abnormality in tone or the resistance to passive movements, since there is no clinically direct method f or measuring spasticity."
29,page_29,"Study OS440 -3005 Osmotica Pharmaceutical US LLC Arbaclofen extended -release tablets CLN.OS440 -3005.PR.A02.USA CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 of 70 When initially developed in the early 1960s (Ashworth 1964) to estimate the efficacy of anti-spastic drugs in subjects with MS, i t was a 5 -point scale, with a grade score of 0 to 4. In 1987, the gra de “1+” was added and slight changes were proposed on the definitions of each score in order to increase the sensitivity of the measure and facilitate scoring. The new measure was then called the Modified Ashworth Scale (mAS) and it is considered the gold standard for measuring spasticity ( Bohannon and Smith 1987). Although there are no standardized guidelines for its use, it can be applied to muscles of both the upper or lower body. The rater should extend the client ’s limb from a position of maximal flexion to maximal extension until the first soft resistance is felt. Moving a subject’s limb through its full range of motion should be done within 1 second by counting “one thousand and one.” It is suggested that the testing of the upper limbs should take place while the subject is lying supine, with the upper limbs parallel to the trunk, elbows extended, wrists in a neutral position, and the lower limbs positioned parallel to one another. Exceptions are made for the shoulder extensors, where the arm should be moved from extension to 90 degrees of flexion, and for the shoulder internal rotators, where the arm should be moved from neutral to a maximum external rotation. For the lower limbs, it is recommended that the subject be lying on their side. Specifically for testing the soleus muscle, the hips and knees should be positioned in 45 degrees of flexion and the ankle is moved from maximum plantar flexion to maximum dorsiflexion. For the gastrocnemius muscle, hips should be in 45 degrees of flexion with the knees in maximum extension and the ankle is moved from maximum plantar flexion to maximum dorsiflexion. For the quadriceps femoris muscle, knees and hips should be in maximal extension and the knee is moved from maximum extension to maximum flexion. Throughout testing, the subject should be instructed to remain calm and relaxed, and when repeated testing is undertaken, testing should be initiated at the same time of the day to minimize possible changes in spasticity leve ls due to medication interaction. To arrive at the TNmAS -MAL score, the total numerical score of the most affected limb accounts for the sum of the 3 main joint muscular group scores. The TNmAS -MAL assessment will be performed by the investigator who has been appropriately trained to perform and assess the TNmAS -MAL , and when possible , all TNmAS -MAL assessments should be performed for a particular subject by the same person throughout the study and always prior to any scheduled lab draw . The most affect ed limb will be determined by the investigator . The TNmAS -MAL assessment will be done at the visits specified in Table 1. The mAS and TNmAS -MAL are provided in Appendix 1. 8.3 Expanded Disability Status Scal e The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in MS and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. It is widely used in clinical trials and in the assessment of people with MS. The scale was developed by John Kurtzke in 1983 as an advance from his previous 10- step Disability Status Scale (DSS) (Kurtzke 1983). The EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5- unit increments that represent higher levels of disability."
30,page_30,"Study OS440 -3005 Osmotica Pharmaceutical US LLC Arbaclofen extended -release tablets CLN.OS440 -3005.PR.A02.USA CONFIDENTIAL Page 30 of 70 EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with MS wh o are able to walk without any aid and is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems (FS): pyramidal (weakness or difficulty moving limbs), cerebellar (ataxia, loss of coordination, or tremor), brainstem (problems with speech, swallowing , and nystagmus), sensory (numbness or loss of sensations), bowel and bladder function, visual function, cerebral (or mental) functions , and other. Each FS is scored on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 5 or 6 (more severe disability). EDSS steps 5.0 to 9.5 are defined by the impairment to walking. The EDSS assessment will be done at the visits specified in Table 1. The EDSS is provided in Appendix 2. 9 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS Safety will be assessed by the mo nitoring of AEs volunteered, observed, and elicited by general questioning in a non- suggestive manner. Changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory test results, 12-lead ECG s, the USP questionnaire, and the C- SSRS will also be assessed. 9.1 Medical/Surgical History A complete medical and surgical history will be obtained at Baseline (Screening for de novo subjects) , which will record previous respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, nephron- urologic, metabolic, allergic, infectious, gynecologic, musculoskeletal, endocrine, neurologic, psychiatric, dermatologic , allergi c, hematologic, and any other diseases. 9.2 Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured at all visits. Blood pressure measurements will be made using a sphygmomanometer with an appropriate cuff size for the individual subject. To evaluate the potential of arbaclofen to trigger orthostatic hypotension, BP and heart rate will be measured twice at each study visit. Orthostatic testing should take place in a quiet room, preferably at a temperature between 20 °C an d 24°C (68 °F to 75°F). Emptying the bladder before testing is also recommended. The diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension is established by measuring the BP in the supine and then in the standing position, at least 3 minutes apart, and noting a substantial drop accompanied by symptoms of dizziness or syncope. A positive response is considered if systolic BP falls below 20 mmHg and diastolic BP 10 mmHg of baseline. If symptoms occur, the subject should be returned to the supine position immediately. Vital signs, including BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature, will be measured after the subject has been in a supine position quietly for 10 minutes. Then, with the subject in a standing position, BP and heart rate will be measured again after the supine assessment is completed. 9.3 Physical Examination A physical examination will be performed at Baseline (Screening for de novo subjects) and will include the following categories : general , head, ears, eyes, nose and throat , neck,"

Height will be measured only at Baseline. At each site the same balance will be used for all measurements. Subjects will wear only indoor clothing without shoes. 9.5 Clinical Laboratory Tes ts A central laboratory will be used for this study. Blood draws for chemistry and hematology tests and urine samples for urinalyses will be collected and sent to the central laboratory. Table 4 presents the specific clinical laboratory tests to be evaluated. All laboratory values that are outside of the normal range for that parameter will be so flagged when reported to the site. The investigator will annotate laboratory reports to indicate whether any abnormal laboratory value is considered clinically significant. Any abnormal laboratory value that is considered clinically relevant should be confirmed by a repeated laboratory test when possible. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality requires treatment or is the re ason for a subject being discontinued from the study, the abnormal result must be classified as an AE.

Site personnel will do a routine urinalysis by dipstick on site and the central laboratory will do a complete microscopic urine examination. Site personnel will also complete a urine pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential on site at the visits specified in Table 1 (see Section 7.8 regarding serum pregnancy testing in premenopausal women of childbearing pote ntial at Baseline [Screening for de novo subjects] ). Sample collection kits, requisition slips, and shipping boxes will be supplied by the central laboratory. Sample collection procedures and shipping instructions will be detailed in the laboratory manual . Study centers must be equipped to store the samples according to the laboratory manual procedures before shipping samples to the central laboratory. 9.6 Other Safety Assessments 9.6.1 Electrocardiograms A standard 12- lead ECG will be performed on subjects in the supine position. Subjects will have rested in the supine position for at least 5 minutes prior to the ECG . The time at which the subject assumed the supine position will be recorded to confirm the rest time. ECGs will be done at the visits specified in Table 1. 9.6.2 Urinary Symptom Profile © Questionnaire The USP is a health -related quality of life questionnaire developed in 2005 by the French Association of Urology and validated in 2008 ( Haab et al 2008 ). It is composed of 13 items in 3 dimensions to assess urinary symptoms among adults (both men and women) with stress, urge, overactive bladder, or urinary obstructive symptoms. It is administered with a time frame over the past 4 weeks. The USP is a valu able tool for self -administration by the subject to complement clinical measures and diagnosis due to it being a valid and reliable questionnaire providing comprehensive evaluation of all urinary disorders and their severity. It also allows the pathology screening and contributes to the differential diagnosis of these symptoms. Due to the potential risk of arbaclofen to produce urinary problems, mainly at the bladder level (as seen in some animal toxicological studies ; see the current arbaclofen Investigator’s Brochure [IB] ), the utilization of this questionnaire has been implemented in the context of this study to monitor urinary symptomatology and rule out any complication that could be developed during the course of the study. An increase of 4 points in the total USP score from the previous visit will be considered an AE. The USP questionnaire will be completed by the subject at the visits specified in Table 1. The USP is provided in Appendix 6. 9.6.3 Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C -SSRS will be administered by the investigator or a qualified designee trained in its administration. The C -SSRS is a standardized instrument that was developed to assess the severity of and monitor changes in suicidal ideation and behavior. Four constructs are measured. The first is severity of ideation rated on a 5 -point ordinal scale. The second is intensity of ideation, which"
33,page_33,"Study OS440 -3005 Osmotica Pharmaceutical US LLC Arbaclofen extended -release tablets CLN.OS440 -3005.PR.A02.USA CONFIDENTIAL Page 33 of 70 comprises 5 items (frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason for ideation) each rated on a 5 -point ordinal scale. The third is behavior rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and non- suicidal self -injurious behavior. The fourth is lethality, which asses ses actual attempts; actual lethality is rated on a 6 -point ordinal scale, and if actual lethality is zero, potential lethality of attempts is rated on a 3 -point ordinal scale. The C -SSRS assessment will be done at the visits specified in Table 1. The C -SSRS is provided in Appendix 4. 9.7 Adverse Events 9.7.1 Method of Determining Adverse Events Safety assessments will include recording AEs reported spontaneously by the subject or observed by the investigator. AEs will be recorded at each visit throughout the study. All AEs will be recorded on the AE log of the eCRF . Every attempt should be made to describe the AE in terms of a diagnosis. If a clear diagnosis has been made, individual signs and symptoms will not be recorded unless they represent atypical or extreme manifestations of the diagnosis, in which case they should be reported as separate events. If a clear diagnosis cannot be established, each sign and symptom must be recorded individually. Subjects should be asked whether, since the time of the last observation or visit, they had any of the following: • Experienced any changes in well -being. • Used any new medications . • Changed medication regimens (both prescription and over-the-counter). • Were admitted to a hospital or had any accidents. All questions should be of a general nature and should not suggest symptoms. When an AE is suspected, all relevant evaluations will be performed and appropriate treatment provided. Additional follow -up will be done as nec essary ( Section 9.7.4) and recorded in the subject’s source documents, and the results will be provided to the Sponsor. 9.7.2 Adverse Event Definitions 9.7.2.1 Adverse Events An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that appears or worsens in a subject after the subject signs the ICF for a clinical study. Examples of what may be considered an AE include any of the following: • A new illness ."
34,page_34,"Study OS440 -3005 Osmotica Pharmaceutical US LLC Arbaclofen extended -release tablets CLN.OS440 -3005.PR.A02.USA CONFIDENTIAL Page 34 of 70 • An exacerbation of a sign or symptom of an underlying condition or of a concomitant illness unrelated to participation in the clinical study or an effect of the study drug or comparator drug . No causal relationship with the study drug is implied by the use of the term “adverse event.” An exacerbation of a pre- existing condition/illness is defined as a more frequent occurrence or as an increase in the severity of the pre- existing condition/illness during the study. Planned or elective surgical procedures for pre -existing conditions that have not worsened are not AEs. However, any complication that occurs during a planned or elective surgery is an AE. (If the event meets the criteria for a SAE , such as an extended hospitalization, it will be considered a n SAE). Conditions leading to unplanned surgical procedures may also be AEs. 9.7.2.2 Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE that: • Results in death . • Is life -threatening . Note: The term “life -threatening” refers to any AE that, as it occurs, puts the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not refer to an AE that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. • Results in hospitalization or prolongation of current hospitalization (not including hospitalization for a pre -existing condition that has not increased in severity or frequ ency from the subject’s underlying medical condition prior to entry into the study). • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject • Is another serious event (important medical events) Note: Important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 9.7.2.3 Severity of Adverse Events “Severity” of the AE refers to the extent to which an AE affects the subject’s daily activities and differs from “Serious”, which is a regulatory classification. Severity will be categorized according to the following criteria:"
35,page_35,"Study OS440 -3005 Osmotica Pharmaceutical US LLC Arbaclofen extended -release tablets CLN.OS440 -3005.PR.A02.USA CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 of 70 • Mild: The symptom has a negligible effect or no impairing effect on the subject ’s normal function. • Moderate: The symptom impairs the subject’s normal function to some extent. • Severe: The symptom has an obvious, significantly impairing effect on the subject ’s normal function. 9.7.2.4 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Treatments “Causality” refers to the relationship of the AE to study drug and will be categorized according to the following criteria: • Unlikely: There is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related to study drug usage, or there is another more probable medical explanation. • Possible: There is medical evidence to suggest that there is a reasonable possibility that the AE ma y be related to study drug usage. However, other medical explanations cannot be excluded as a possible cause. • Probable: There is strong medical evidence to suggest that the AE is related to study drug usage. 9.7.2.5 Adverse Events Expectedness Expected AEs are d efined as those described in the arbaclofen IB. If an event increases in intensity or severity from that described in the IB, it will be considered unexpected. 9.7.3 Reporting Adverse Events Adverse events that occur from the time of informed consent through completion of the last study visit should be reported. Any AE that the investigator becomes aware of that occurs within 30 days of study completion or withdrawal should also be reported. Any SAEs occurring in a subject receiving study medication must be rep orted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site being informed of the event, even if the event does not appear to be drug- related. This reporting must be done by faxing the appropriate completed form (SAE form or Exposure during Pregnancy form) to the Sponsor. Any pertinent follow -up information should be provided in a similar manner. Contact information is provided below:"

If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must be withdrawn from the study and the Sponsor and site monitor notified. Additional relevant information about the confirmed pregnancy will be recorded on the appropriate form(s); pregnancy will not be captured as an AE. The subject should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. 9.8 Appropriateness of Saf ety Measurement The safety assessments to be utilized in this study are standard safety measures in clinical trials. 10 DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) will oversee study subject safety with respect to AEs and clinically important lab values. The committee will include three individuals with collective experience and knowledge about clinical trial conduct, study subject safety, MS, and bladder dysfunction, a condition common in MS subjects. DSMB members will be independent of the Sponsor, study sites, and the managing vendors, and will have no other role in the trial. The DSMB will convene after 33%, 66% , and 100% of the trial is enrolled. The role of the DSMB will be governed by a DSMB c harter. 11 STATISTICAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS 11.1 Statistical Analysis Plans A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) will be finalized prior to study termination . Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum for continuous data; frequencies and percentages for categorical data) will be used to summarize study data. Unless specified otherwise, all statistical testing will be two -sided and performed using a significance level of 0.05. 11.2 Analysis Populations The following population will be defined for analysis: • Safety population: Includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of open- label study treatment and have at least one post -dose visit. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment received. This population will be used for all safety and efficacy analyses. 11.3 Determination of Sample Size In total, approx imately 300 subjects are to be enrolled in this study (i.e., both rollover and de novo subjects) . It is anticipated that approx imately 50% of subjects randomized into the double -blind study ( Study OS440-3004) may roll over into this open- label study , and US subjects who did not participate in the previous double -blind Study OS440-3004 (i.e., de novo subjects ) may also enroll into the current study. The number of subjects at each site will be determined primarily by the rate of recruitment in Study OS440-3004. No statistical rationale for subject number is provided."

In Study O S440-3003 a total of 148 subjects were treated. Study OS440- 3005 is designed to enrich the existing safety database and provide long -term safety and tolerability data at the maximum daily dose of 80 mg/day. Target recruitment includes at least 100 subject s treated at 6 months and 50 subjects treated for 1 year at 80 -mg per day. 11.4 Efficacy Analyses 11.4.1 Efficacy Endpoints 11.4.1.1 Patient Global Impression of Change Descriptive summaries for PGIC scores will be tabulated by study visit and for change from baseline. 11.4.1.2 Total Numeric -Transformed Modified Ashworth Scale Descriptive summaries for TNmAS -MAL scores will be tabulated by study visit and for change from baseline. 11.4.1.3 Expanded Disability Status Scale Descriptive summaries for EDSS scores will be tabulated by study visit and for change from baseline. 11.5 Safety Endpoints Safety endpoints will be reported on the Safety population. Subjects will be reported according to the treatment they actually received. Safety assessment will be based on descriptive statistics and individual subject listings. No statistical tests will be performed for any of the safety assessments. All reported AEs will be mapped to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ classifications (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs). If a s ubject reports multiple events of a single PT, the greatest severity and strongest investigator assessment of relationship to study treatment will be assigned to that PT. Should an event have a missing severity or relationship, it will be classified as ha ving the highest severity and/or strongest relationship to study drug. Summaries of treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) will include any AEs reported beginning with the first dose of study treatment on Day 1. The occurrence of TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group using SOCs, PTs, and severity. Separate summaries of treatment -emergent SAEs, TEAEs considered related to study treatment, and events leading to the discontinuation of study drug will be generated. Descriptive summaries of vital signs, clinical laboratory results , USP results, and the C -SSRS results will be presented by study visit and treatment group. The number and percentage of subjects with treatment- emergent clinical laboratory abnormalities will be summarized by treatment group. Normal range clinical laboratory shift s from baseline to end of study will be summarized by treatment group."

These data will be summarized by treatment group. Previous and concomitant medications will be presented in a data listing. Subject disposition will be presented for all subjects. The numbers of subjects who complete the study and who discontinue early from the study will be provided. The reasons for early discontinuation will also be presented. 11.6 Interim Analysis No interim analysis is planned. 12 STUDY MANAGEMENT 12.1 Monitoring The investigator will be responsible for preparing and maintaining adequate and accurate source documents (medical records, ECGs, raw data collection forms, etc.) designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject treated with the study drug. The investigator will allow representatives of the Sponsor, contract designees, authorized regulatory authority inspectors, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) to have direct access to all documents pertaining to the study. The investigator is to immediately notify the Sponsor of any regulatory authority inspections. The investigator will be informed about the outcome of any Sponsor audit. This study will be monitored regularly, by or under supervision of a monitor from the Sponsor. The frequency of monitoring visits will be agreed upon by the Sponsor’s representative and the study site. Moni toring visits will take place on a regular basis according to the enrollment rate and number of subjects enrolled at each investigational site. During these visits, the monitor will check the completion of the eCRF entries, compliance with the study protocol and with Good Clinical Practice - International Conference on Harmoni zation (GCP -ICH), and their agreement with the source data. The monitor will also verify the correct use of the study drug. At a final visit, the monitor will check all remaining material including the remaining quantities of the study drug and will organize their return to the Sponsor or designee. At each visit, the investigator and staff will be expected to cooperate with the Sponsor’s representative(s) for the purposes of review and verification of protocol compliance, AE reporting, eCRFs, source documents, clinical supplies and inventory records, and any additional records as may have been previously arranged between the investigator and the Sponsor’s representative(s). The inves tigator and/or other designated study personnel are expected to contact the Sponsor with any study concerns and/or questions. Contact information is provided in the Study Reference Manual for the site. 12.2 Protocol Amendments The Sponsor may propose to amend this protocol at any time."
40,page_40,"Study OS440 -3005 Osmotica Pharmaceutical US LLC Arbaclofen extended -release tablets CLN.OS440 -3005.PR.A02.USA CONFIDENTIAL Page 40 of 70 No change to the protocol will be implemented until the Sponsor and the IRB/IEC have reviewed and approved the amendment. In the event of an emergency, the investigator shall implement any medical procedures deemed appropriate for subject safety. All such procedures must have written documentation and be promptly reported to the Sponsor. 12.3 Protocol Deviations A protocol deviation is any change, divergence , or departure from the IRB/IEC approved protocol (intentional or unintentional). Protocol deviations are to be reported to the IRB/IEC according to the IRB/IEC guidelines. 12.4 Withdrawal of Subjects Withdrawn subjects are those who do not complete all evaluations and procedures outlined in the protocol. Subject withdrawal requires a 2-week dose taper. A subject will be considered to have discontinued prematurely if he/she withdraws prior to completing Visit 8 (Final Visit). If a subject misses 7 consecutive days AND has taken less than 80% of their doses of study medication in a 42-day (6 -week) period, then the subject must be discontinued. Subjects may also be withdrawn from the study because of any of the following: • Adverse Event: An AE that, in the opinion of the investigator or Sponsor, suggests that continued participation in the study is not in the subject’s best interest for safety reasons (also see Section 10). All AEs that are present when the subject withdraws from the study will be followed as described in Section 9.7.4. • Medical Condition : Any medical condition that, in the investigator’s judgment, would increase the risk or interfere with the evaluation of study objectives . • Lost to Follow- up: Confirmed at minimum by two phone calls and a traceable letter without answer . • Subject Request: Subject requests for any reason to be withdrawn or withdraws his/her consent. Every effort should be made to determine the reason for the withdrawal request ( e.g., AE, lack of efficacy, scheduling issues , etc. ). • Protocol Deviation: A subject may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the investigator or Sponsor due to poor compliance with protocol requirements that may compromise the study results or subject safety. • Enrollment in Another Study: Enrollment in other protocols involving research drugs, medical devices , or surgeries . • Other Anti -spasticity Treatment: Starting any other pharmacological anti -spasticity treatment during the study."

When possible, a decision to discontinue a subject from the study should first be discussed with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. If a subject is prematurely discontinued after randomization and prior to the final scheduled visit, every effort should be made to perform all of the Visit 8 assessments ( Table 1). The reason(s) for early withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF . Subjects withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. 12.5 Termination of the Study The study may be terminated at any time at the request of the Sponsor or a regulatory authority, with proper and timely notification of all parties concerned. The IRB/IEC will be informed promptly and the Sponsor or the investigator will supply reason(s) for the termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. Otherwise, the study is considered terminated upon completion of all subject treatments and evaluations. 12.6 Publication Policy The data obtained in this study are the property of the Sponsor, who will make reasonable efforts to assure that the results are published in a peer -reviewed journal. As some of the information concerning the investigational product and development activities at the Sponsor may be of a strictly confidential nature, any manuscript or other presentation of data must first be reviewed by the Sponsor before its submission. 13 ETHICS 13.1 Conduct of the Study This study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for GCP, 1997; the US Title 21 CFR parts 50, 56, and 312; and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will not begin until all of the requirements of the appropriate re gulatory authorities have been fulfilled. 13.2 Institutional Review Boards and/or Independent Ethics Committees This protocol (and any changes), all consent forms, and subject consent procedures must be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted IRB/IEC. The information presented to the IRB/IEC at the time initial approval is sought must include any plans for subject recruitment that"

A letter of approval issued by the IRB/IEC must be sent to the Sponsor prior to initiation of the study. Any changes made to the protocol must be approved by the IRB/IEC prior to implementation, except where needed to eliminate a potential imminent safety hazard to the subject. In this case, immediate implementation may take place followed by IRB/IEC approval. Review and approval by the IRB/IEC for continuation of the study must take place at least once a year. 13.3 Written Informed Consent The investigator or designee will explain the nature of the study, its purpose and associated procedures, the expected duration, and the potential benefits and risks of participation to each subject prior to his/her entry into the study ( i.e., before examinations and procedures associ ated with selection for the study are initiated). Each subject will have ample opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision. Following this informative discussion, the subject will be asked if he/she is willing to sign a statement of informed consent. Only subjects who voluntarily sign the ICF may enter the study. The ICF must be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor and the IRB/IEC prior to its use. The original signed ICF will remain in the investigator’ s files. The investigator or designee will indicate in each subject’s source documents that he/she has informed the subject about the study and its procedures, the subject has signed and dated the ICF, and the subject has been given a copy of the signed ICF. The investigator or designee will inform subjects of any new information that may be relevant to the subject ’s willingness to continue in the study. 13.4 Subject Confidentiality The Sponsor ensures that the following have permission to review all study -related documents: monitor, auditor, IRB/IEC , and regulatory authorities. The subject’s identity and study -related records will remain confidential throughout the duration of the study data collection and reporting process. A unique subject identification code will be assigned to each potential study subject. The identification code protects the subject’s identity and is used in lieu of the subject’s name when reporti ng subject data. The data will always maintain the confidentiality of the subject. The investigator or designee will review the subject data, which will be referenced using the subject identifier. At the conclusion of the study, the data obtained may be presented to regional regulatory authorities but the subject’s identity will not be revealed. In addition, if any clinical data obtained from the study are published in scientific journals or presented at scientific meetings, the subject’s identity will n ot be revealed. 13.5 Records Retention The investigator must maintain essential study documents (protocol and amendments, source documentation corresponding to all information contained in the eCRFs, signed ICFs, relevant"

These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or the hospital, institution, or private practice in which the study is being conducted. Subject identification codes (subject names and corresponding study numbers) will be retained for this same time period. Custody of the records may be transferred to another responsible party, acceptable to the Sponsor, who agrees to abide by the retention polic ies. Written notice of transfer must be submitted to the Sponsor. The investigator must contact the Sponsor prior to disposing of any study records. 13.6 Financing Funding for this study will be agreed between the investigator and the Sponsor and will be confirmed in writing before the study starts. Completion of Financial Disclosure Forms will be required before the study starts. Any additions to the primary site personnel will necessitate the completion of new Financial Disclosure Forms. This information w ill also be collected at site closure and 1 year after the completion of the study. 14 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE The Sponsor and investigator will take all steps possible to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and reliability of the data, including participating in an investigator meeting and/or site initiation visit, routine site monitoring, review of eCRFs against source documents, and quality control checks. In addition, a representative from the Sponsor’s Clinical Quality Assurance Department may conduct periodic audits of the study processes, including, but not limited to, auditing the clinical site, laboratories, vendors and CROs, the clinical database, and the final study report. 15 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING This study will us e web -based eCRFs developed through a validated, Electronic Records/Electronic Signatures -compliant platform (US Title 21 CFR Part 11). The Sponsor’s Clinical Data Management department or designee will create the eCRFs and corresponding clinical database based on the final protocol. All site personnel who will be using this system will receive formal training on the system, after which each person will be issued a unique username and password. Only the person who owns the username and password will enter the system using that username and password. For data security reasons and to be in compliance with regulatory guidelines, usernames and passwords are not transferable. The investigator is responsible for all data entered via the remote data capture (RDC ) system eCRFs and must confirm the accuracy of the data by electronically approving (signing) the eCRFs. This responsibility includes the timely completion and accuracy of the data entered into the eCRFs by their site personnel as well as the review and approval of some data entered directly into the"
