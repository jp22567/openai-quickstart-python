Section 5.3 .3 • Off-site study procedures in case of crisis situation Based on assessment of risk, and to ensure patient safety and minimize risks to trial integrity, the sponsor determined that the following optional off -site study procedures can be performed in case a study participant cannot attend an on -site visit during the COVID -19 crisis: • Safety assessment via phone call • Local lab assessment • Delivery of the study treatment to patient • Visit to patient’s home These options apply to all on -site study visits except for the randomization visit (Visit 1). Visit 1 must occur on -site as per section 5.2.2. These solutions can be applied after Medical Monitor approval and depending on the investigator’s judgment of each case and the patient /parent (s)’s agreement. The alternative solutions can b e implemented in response to the COVID -19 crisis prior to the notifi cation or submission to and approval of regulatory agencies and ethics committees. Before implementing any of these options for a patient, the site will contact the patient and parent(s) to check whether they agree with the off -site procedures. The pa tient will be invited to attend an on -site visit to complete the study procedures as per protocol, as soon as the situation allows it. 5.3.3.1 Safety and drug compliance procedures The following procedures will be performed if applicable for the visit via eithe r a phone contact, or, if safe and possible, a direct visit to the patient: • Check for AEs • Collection of any lifestyle modifications • Check concomitant/prior medication • Check of compliance (review of dosing diary with the patient/parent(s)) • Physical exam ination if possible with a direct visit to the patient or using vi deo (described in Section 6.2.1 ) • Record vital signs, waist circumfer ence and weight if possible with a direct visit to the patient (described in Section 6.2.1 and Section 6.2.2 ) 5.3.3.2 Local lab assessment"
5,page_5,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V4.0 2 0 April 2020 GENFIT Page 6 of 83 The patient will be asked if he/she can access a local lab in the few days after the phone contact to obtain hematology a nd biochemistry testing. If a direct visit to the patient is safe and possible, the appropriate lab parameters corresponding to the o n-site study visit will be collected. 5.3.3.3 Delivery of study treatment to the patient The study treatment can be shi pped to the patient or delivered directly to the patient by the site study staff if safe and possible as per the site procedure. As per the usual study visit, the patient will be instructed to continue taking the available tablets from the existing kit u ntil he/she receives the new kit. The study drug compliance and study drug accountability will be performed as described in Section 7.7 and_ Section 7.8 once brought to the study site/study pharmacy. 5.3.3.4 Completion of Missed Study Procedures As soon as the situation allows it, the site will schedule the patient’s on -site visit to complete the missed study procedures (those that could not be performed dur ing the phone calls/visit to patient) as per protocol."

The target population will include patients with NASH with and without fibrosis . Of the 20 patients that will be enrolled and dosed with elafibranor , at least 4 patients ≥12 to ≤17 years of age , and at least 2 patient s ≥8 to ≤11 years of age , will have significant fibrosis [i.e., fibrosis stage 2 or 3]). Two p atient cohorts will be dosed sequential ly. Cohort 1 will consist of approximately 1 2 patients who are ≥12 to ≤17 years of age and will be enrolled first. Once 10 (80%) patients in cohort 1 have been eva luated for PK and safety through Visit 4 by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) , and if agreed upon by the DSMB, enrollment will be open to patients ≥8 to ≤11 years of age . Cohort 2 will consist of appro ximately 8 patients who are ≥8 to ≤11 years of ag e. Potential patients will be screened within 28 days (Day -28 [Week -4] to Day -7 [Week -1]) prior to Day 1. Day 1 will include randomization and dosing with study drug. After signing the informed consent form (ICF) (parent /legal guardi an) and the assen t (patient ) documents, patients will undergo screening procedures to confirm study eligibility. The patient (and parent/ legal guardian ) will be given counselling regarding a diet and exercise regimen to be maintained starting from the screening visit . Eligible patient s will return to the clinic on Day 1 . Baseline evaluations1 will be obtained prior to study drug admi nistration . Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive either 80 mg or 120 mg once daily for 12 weeks . The patien t (and parent /legal guardian ) will again be counselled on dietary and exercise regimen requirements that will be maintained throughout the study period. Patien ts will be dispensed a 1-month supply of study drug and dosing diary and will be schedule d for their next visit on Day 15 (± 2 days) for safety evaluation s and complianc e check1. The patient will return on Day 2 9 (± 2 days) /Week 4 for safety , PD (biological laboratory assessments) , PK assessments , and compliance check1. A 1-month supply of study drug and dosing diary will be dispensed . The patien t will return the following day for collection of the 24 -hour (±10 minute s) post-dose sample ( prior to the next daily dose). The patient will return to the clinic on Day 5 7 (± 2 days) /Week 8 and Day 85 (± 2 days) /Week 12, for safety , PD (biological laboratory assessments) and compliance evaluations. On Day 5 7 (± 2 days)/Week 8, in addition to safety and PD, a 1-month supply of study drug and dosing diary will be dispensed. At the End of Treatment (EOT) visit, Day 8 5 (± 2 days)/W eek 12, quality of life will be assessed , the final PK sample will be collected, and unused study drug and completed diary will be collected. A final safety evaluation will be conducted at the End of Study (EOS) visit, Day 11 3 (± 2 days)/Week 16. 1Refer to General Study Assessment Schedule and Section 5 – Trial Procedures for detailed procedure listings ."

The DSMB will consist of two independent clinicians with relevant expertise in related NAFLD/NASH pedia tric clinical trials and 1 statistician with expertise in clinical trial and interim data analysis . At a minimum, s afety data will be summarized by the statistician after every 5th patient comp letes visit 4 or available data at the end of each quarter (at approximately 3-month intervals ), whichever comes first throughout the study. The DSMB will also review safety and PK data once 80% of the patients in Cohort 1 have completed through Visit 4. Enrollment in Cohort 2 will commence as recommended by the DSM B. Statistical Considerations Sample Size The primary objective of this study is to characterize individual PK parameters in children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age (inclusive) , by collecting rich PK samples to support non-compartmental analysi s (NCA) . Inter-patient variability of PK parameters in adults was low to moderate (coefficient of variation [CV]% ranged from 23.3% to 68.3%) . Assuming a similar degree of varia bility in pediatric population, a sample size of 20 patients is set to target a 95% CI [confidence interval] within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimates of clearance and volume of distribution for elafibranor with at least 80% power (Wang et al., 2012). Additionally , 20 patients should be sufficient to evaluate the safety and tolerability and explore the responsiveness (efficacy) of once daily oral dosing of 80 mg and 120 mg of elafibranor for up to 12 weeks. Analysis Populations Three populations will be used for analysis: safety , PK and intent -to-treat. The definition of these populations follows: • Safety Population : All patien ts who received at least one dose of study drug and ha ve at least one post-baseline safe ty assessment. • Pharmacokinetic Population : All patient s who received at least one dose of s tudy drug, do not have protocol deviations or adverse events which may significantly affect PK, and have at least one post -dose PK sample . • Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : All randomised patient s who received at least one dose of study drug. PK and safety data will be analysed based respectively on the PK population and the safety population. Efficacy data will be analysed based on the ITT p opulation."

24,page_24,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 25 of 83 Among the adult population, it is believed that simple hepatic steatosis is generally non -progressive, while NASH may lead to progressive liver disease ( Fazel et al., 2016). In the adult population, the progression of NASH can take years to manifest. In this context, the presence of type 2 diabetes and the severity of histologic features such as ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes can be important predictors of fib rosis progression, but only the stage of fibrosis predicts liver mortality ( Liou and Kowdley, 2006 ). Similarly, evidence suggests t hat that among the pediatric population, insulin resistance and obesity are important predictors of p rogression ( Schwimmer et al., 2003 ). A longitudinal follow -up study on former pediatric NAFLD patients indicated a high ra te of type 2 diabetes (30%) and the persistence of obesity into young adulthood ( Cioffi et al., 2017 ). Factors that account for differences between children with NASH versus children with milder forms of NAFLD are unclear ( Pardee et al., 2009 ). At diagnosis, 10 –25% of children can have advanced fibrosi s. In the most severe cases, children can progress within a few years to cirrhosis and end -stage liver disease. Quality longitudinal data of the natura l history of pediatric NAFLD are limited. However, available data suggest that children with NAFLD are at risk for higher mortality rates as young adults ( Goyal and Schwimmer, 2016 ). The natural history of pediatric NAFLD in the se tting of lifestyle counselling was represented by the placebo arm of the treatment of non -alcoholic fatty liver disease in children (TONIC) trial, a 2 -year randomized control trial designed to compare vitamin E, metformin, and placebo with liver biopsies a t baseline and at 2-year follow -up. All 3 arms received nutrition and physical activity (lifestyle) advic e. In the placebo cohort, 28% had resolution of NASH, 40% improved fibrosis, 40% improved steatosis, and 43% improved lobular inflammation. Progression of disease was seen in 25% ( Lavine et al., 2011 ). Although limited, the p ediatric data on the natural history of pediatric NAFLD support some conclusions. Fifteen percent of children with NAFLD have stage 3 fibrosis or higher at diagnosis ( Schwimmer et al., 2014) and disease in children appears to be more severe compared with adults ( Holterma n et al., 2013). Given that pediatric disease is by definition early onset disease, it may represent an aggressive phenotype of the disease. Reports show that a few children have rapid progression to clinical events from NAFLD (death, transplant, diabetes, CVD). Because such clinical events from pediatric NAFLD typically do not occur under the age of 21 years, studies determining clinical outcomes from pediatric NAFLD will require long-term follow -up into adulthood ( Vos et al., 2017). 1.3.3. Diagnosis The diagnosis of NASH begins with the clinical suspicio n of liver disease in a child. NAFLD may be suspected on the basis of an elevated serum alanine aminotransfera se (ALT), hepatomegaly, or an abnormal imaging study consistent with fatty liver. In children, NAFLD is typically diagnosed between the ages of 10–13 years but the actual onset of disease for most children is not known (Goyal and Sc hwimmer, 2016). Interpretation of liver histology is required to confirm a diagnosis of NAFLD, and to identify the presence and severity of NA SH (Pardee et al., 2009 ). Not all children with NAFLD will develop NASH ( Pardee et al., 2009). Pediatric NASH is a histological diagnosis divided into two types: • Type 1: Liver biopsies consistent with adult histology . Defined as presence of steatosis with ballooning degeneration and/or perisinusoidal fibrosis, wit hout portal involvement. • Type 2: Liver biopsies are unique in appearance . Defined as the presence of steatosis with portal inflammation and/or fibrosis, in the absence of ballooning degeneration or perisinusoidal involvement. Though the biological mechani sms behind the subtypes are currently unknown, these findings highlight a potentially important distinction between adult and pediatric NASH ( Pardee et al., 2009 ). Identification of fibrosis in children with NASH and NAFLD is impo rtant because these phenotypes are expected to be more likely to progress to cirrhosis ( Loomba a nd Chalasani, 2015 ). Overt signs and symptoms of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis are, however, uncommon in children with NAFLD and NASH ( Vos et al., 2017 )."
25,page_25,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 26 of 83 1.3.4. Prevalence Prevalence of NAFLD varies by race/ethnicity. US studies have revealed a 4 -fold increased risk of hepatic steatosis in Hispanic, compared with non -Hispanic adolescents (11 –22 years old) (Rehm et al., 2014). White and Asian children also have high prevalence, compared to African American childr en (Schwimmer et al., 2006 ). The prevalence also differs by sex, with most studies showing higher pe rcentages in male compared to females ( Pardee et al., 2009 ). However, males and females appear to be equally likely to have NASH ( Goyal and Schwimmer, 2016 ). Prevalence is higher in obese children compared with normal weight, although not all children with NAFLD are obese (Schwimmer et al., 2006 ). Anderson et al (Anderson et al., 2015 ), conducted a systematic review and meta -analysis of all studi es reporting a prevalence of NAFLD based on any diagnostic method (i.e. biopsy, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging or other scans or liver enzymes) in participants 1 –19 years old, regardless of whether assessing NAFLD prevalence was the main aim of the study . The commonest serum biomarkers used to assess NAFLD prevalence in research settings and to identify patients who may benefit from further investigation in clinical settings are alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (Golberg, 1980 [reported in Anderson et al., 2015 ]). Both liver enzymes have been reported to correlate with the degree of liver fat infiltration, inflammation (Anderson et al., 2015 ). Prevalence of NAFLD ranges from 9 to 37% (Jou , 2008; Hesham, 2009 [reported in Anderson et al., 2015 ]). In one study of NAFLD in children, about 23% had NASH ( Schwimmer et al., 2006 ). 1.4. Summary of Studies with Elafibranor 1.4.1. Nonclinical Experience No safety issues were identified when assessing the potential effects of elafibranor on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems. In animal studies, elafibranor was well and rap idly absorbed although absolute bio availability was moderate (about 20% to 40%). Elafibranor is extensively metabolized and the activity is mainly carried by the active metabolite GFT1007. In all species, maximal plasma concentrations and exposure for both elafibranor and GFT1007 increase w ith the dose after single or repeated administrations. Elafibranor and its metabolites are rapidly cleared from the plasma and are mainly excreted by the fecal route, with urinary excretion as a secondary route of elimina tion. In the rat, elafibranor and/o r its metabolites are rapidly excreted into the bile and undergo an extensive entero - hepatic cycle, giving support for liver targeting of elafibranor and/or GFT1007. Tissue distribution studies in rodents and monkeys supp ort the liver targeting of elafibra nor and/or its metabolites. The toxicology program performed according to ICH guidelines demonstrates that elafibranor has no genotoxic or mutagenicity potential. According to acute toxicity study results, it can be conc luded that elafibranor is safe when administered as single oral doses in rat and mouse, since no sign of toxicity was detected up to the dose of 1000 mg/kg. The safety of elafibranor has been assessed in multiple preclinical toxicology studies with repeate d-dose oral administration for up t o 6 months in rats and 12 months in monkeys. Two-year repeated -dose carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been completed. The only consistent safety concern raised by these studies is the expected PPAR α-associated hepatomegaly, hepatocellular hypertrophy, and liver carcinoma in rodent species (mice and rats). However, it is well known that, compared to nonhuman primates and humans, rodents are highly sensitive to PPAR α agonist induced peroxisome prolife ration and associated liver side effects. Thus , available information on this class of drug, which includes marketed fibrates, together with the lack of any liver side effects in monkeys treated with high doses of elafibranor for 1 year, support the nonrel evance to humans (Cattley , 1998). Overall, these studies did not reveal any other safety issues up to the highest doses tested. Notably, elafibranor did not show any of the known PPAR γ-related concerns such as excess weight gain, hemodilution, edema, cardiomegaly, adiponectin induction, or urinary bladder carcinoma. The phototoxic potential of elafibranor has been assessed by the in vitro 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test and the ultraviolet (UV)-Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) test in mice. Elafibranor, but no t its major metabolite GFT1007, showed UVA -dependent cytotoxicity in vitro. The UV -LLNA test was performed in mice with oral dosing for 3 days at up to 800 mg/kg/day elafibranor. Although a very conservative NOEL was set at 400"
26,page_26,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 27 of 83 mg/kg/day based on isolated findings at the highest dose, it is considered that data are more in favour of an absence of phototoxic effect, given the tissue distribution of elafibranor, and absence of phototoxicity signal in all clinical studies. To support dosing in children, a juvenile toxicity study has recently been performed in rats, with administration of elafibranor from post -natal day (PND) 21 to PND 63 (6 weeks). An assessment of delayed onset toxicity and/or reversibility of toxicity was made following a 4 week recovery peri od. Overall, changes observed during the study were either minor and monitorable (and at least partially reversible), or recognized adaptive changes associated with the PPAR α agonist class of compound in the rat. Therefore, the no observed adverse effect l evel (NOAEL ) for male and female juvenile rats was considered to be 100 mg/kg/day elafibranor. 1.4.2. Clinical Experience Overall, a total of 2511 subjects have been randomized in the elafibranor clinical program , of which it is estimated that 1704 were exposed t o elafibranor (based upon actual exposure data from completed clinical trials and the enrol lment/randomization schemes for ongoing trials ). These studies have been conducted in adult patients aged 18 to 75 years of age. Overall, 549 healthy subjects, 60 obese but otherwise healthy subjects, 37 patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia (type IIb Frederickson), 94 patients with atherogenic dyslipidae mia and abdominal obesity, 47 pati ents with impaired glucose tolerance and abdominal obesity, 109 diabetes mellitus type 2 patients, 22 patients with insulin resistance and abdominal obesity, 1548 NASH patients and 45 PBC patients were randomized and treat ed in clinical trials to date. Of these, 406 healthy subjects, 45 obese but otherwise healthy subjects, 24 patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia, 63 patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia and abdominal obesity, 23 patients with impaired glucose tolerance an d abdominal obesity, 59 diabetes mellitus type II patients, 22 patients with insulin resistance and abdominal obesity, and an estimated 1032 NASH patients and 30 PBC patients received elafibranor, based upon actual exposure data from completed clinical t rials and the enrol lment/randomiz ation schemes for ongoing trials. Clinical data have confirmed the potential beneficial effect of elafibranor in subjects with metabolic disorders and NASH. Phase 2 studies in subjects with cardiometabolic disorders and NASH have demonstrated consistent reduc tions in ALP compared to placebo. The reduction in ALP was associated with relevant reductions in markers of liver injury such as GGT and ALT and in inflammatory markers. These data are encouraging to consider elafibr anor as a potential drug candidate to t reat PBC. In addition, the Phase 2b trial in adult NASH patients demonstrated the efficacy of elafibranor at the therapeutic dose of 120 mg on a clinically meaningful primary endpoint, resolution of histological NASH without worsening of fibrosis, in patie nts with active disease (NAS ≥4). While the trial was short and not designed for antifibrotic endpoints, it nonetheless showed that elafibranor, at 120 mg daily, improved fibrosis indirectly through the resolution of NASH. Importantly, elafibranor 120 mg c oncomitantly improved the cardiometabolic risk profile of the patients by decreasing plasma triglycerides, total and low density lipoprote in-cholesterol (LDL-C), increasing high density lipoprotein -cholesterol (HDL-C), and improving inflammation, insulin r esistance, and glucose homeostasis. Together, these results position elafibranor as a drug candidate to treat NASH with the objective to block fibrosis evolution and ultimately avoid long term liver outcomes while red ucing cardiovascular risk. A Phase 3 st udy in subjects with NASH and fibrosis is ongoing with up to 2224 patients to be enrolled and, to date, more than half of the subjects have been randomized. In this study, subjects are receiving 120 mg/day elafibranor or placebo for up to 72 weeks during t he first treatment period, followed by a long-term treatment period to assess efficacy on progression to cirrhosis, all -cause mortality, and liver-related clinical outcomes – as measured by the onset of any of the lis ted adjudicated events of portal hypert ension or cirrhosis -related events. These studies have highlighted the good safety profile of elafibranor and no major safety concerns have been raised. Based on the cumulative experience gathered to date, gastrointestinal disorders and asthenia/"
27,page_27,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 28 of 83 fatigue are considered common non -serious adverse reactions reasonably associated with elafibranor. Most of them are of mild to moderate intensity. Laboratory in creases in serum creatinine or CPK should be monitored throughout clinical trials as this has been obse rved in Phase 2 studies to date and is a known PPARα agonist effect. Elevation of transaminases should also be monitored as well as drug -induced liver injury. In the absence of human pregnancy data, highly effective contraception should be maintained for women of childbearing potential participating in clinical trials with elafibranor treatment, up to 1 month after end of study treatment. A DSMB has been r eviewing the safety data of the ongoing phase 3 study every 6 months in an unblinded manner and has not raised any safety signal. In conclusion, the safety data and the current knowledge on elafibranor confirm the favourable balance between anticipated eff icacy/benefits and risks. For additional detailed information see current version of Investigator’s Bro chure. 1.5. Rationale for Elafibranor in Pediatric Population 1.5.1. Rational e for Elafibranor in Pediatric NA SH The goal of treatment of pediatric NAFLD and NASH is to stop and reverse liver injury ( Nobili et al., 201 4). Lifestyle modificat ion is the current first -line therapy for pediatric NAFLD and NASH , even though it is difficult to obt ain and to maintain ( Della Corte et al., 2014 ). There is no approved pharmacological therapy for NAFLD and NASH in child ren or adults ( Loomba et al., 2009 ). As described above, pre -clinical studie s have shown that elafibranor reverses histological NASH and liver fibrosis in multiple pre -clinical models of NAFLD/NASH, reducing hepatic inflammation a nd normalizing liver enzymes. In addition, elafibranor improves dyslipidemia in numerous preclinical m odels, and has insulin - sensitizing and glucose -lowering properties in experimental models of type 2 diabetes. Possible PPAR -related side -effects have been considered in order to assess the benefit -risk of the use of elafibranor in pediatric populations. Mo st of the PPAR -related safety concerns described in humans are associated with the PPAR γ isoform, notably those reported with PPAR γ agonists on cardiova scular risks. They are therefore not relevant to elafibranor, which shows no evidence of PPAR γ -associated activity in vivo. In particular, there is no evidence of cardiomegaly or increased risk of cardiac insufficiency that have been associated with PPAR γ agonists ( Nesto et al., 2003 ). PPARα associated liver and relat ed tumors observed in two -year rodent carcinogenicity studies with elafibranor are rodent specific and are not considered relevant to humans. The proposed 3 -month study in the 8 -17 year old pediatric population will allow to obtain the PK/PD profile and the safety data under close monitoring in highly -recognized academic setting s. Overall, the non -clinical data, along with clinical studies to date, support the u se of elafibranor for the treatment of fatty liver diseases (NAFLD/NASH) and hepatic fibrosis, with associated benefit on atherogenic dyslipidemia (high triglycerides, low HDL -cholesterol), glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, and inflammatory stat us. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the therapeutic activity of elafibranor may b e different in children compared to the adult. Taking into account , the prevalence of NAFLD in children, and the beneficial effects of elafibranor on liver damag e and on the various components of the metabolic syndrome, we therefore propose NAFLD as a trea tment indication for elafibranor in children. 1.5.2. Rationale for the Study Population Patients enrolled in this study are children and adolescents (8 to 17 years old , inclusive ) will be representative of the pediatric population with NASH that will include patients without fibrosis and some with significant (stage 2 or 3) fibrosis. In addition, they have metabolic abnormalities, suffer from overweight (BMI z-score > 85th percenti le) and insulin resistance (HOMA -IR ≥ 5). These abnormalities"
28,page_28,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 29 of 83 represent the basis for the development of their liver disease, with insulin resistance being the central element of progression of NAFLD. As elafibranor has consistently demonstrated clear effi cacy on metabolic parameters, insuli n resistance and inflammation in the phase 2a program and in the phase 2b, it is expected that the patients will all have a clinical benefit with elafibranor treatment, which addresses the metabolic abnormalities present at the early stage of NAFLD. The sa fety will be closely monitored in high level academic sites. 1.5.3. Justification of the Selected Dose The results obtained in the phase 2 program showed that both doses of elafibranor 80mg and 120mg beneficially affect the met abolic parameters such as plasma lip ids, glucose homeostasis, and insulin resistance in the adult population. In all studies currently performed (including the ongoing phase 3 study monitored by a DSMB), a good safety profile of elafibranor has been demonstrated . Due to the overweight/obese profile of the targeted population in this first pediatric study (inclusion criteria related to minimum BMI z-score), dose intended to be used on this study are similar to the ones used in phase 2b and phase 3 studies. Therefore, given the good safety prof ile and the efficacy of elafibranor 80 and 120mg , both doses will be tested in this pediatric study. The PK data obtained in this study will be used to confirm the dose to be used in future studies in children and adolescents (8 to 17 years old). 1.5.4. Rationale for the Study The present short-term study will provide important preliminary information related to pharmacokinetics, safety , tolerability, and efficacy (including metabolic function ) in this pediatric population. The study results will inform the develo pment of the pediatric formulation and optimize the design of future studies. 2. TRIAL OBJECTIVES 2.1.

Off-site study procedures in case of crisis situation Based on assessment of risk, and to ensur e patient safety and minimize risks to trial integrity, the sponsor determined that the following optional off -site s tudy procedures can be performed in case a study participant cannot attend an on -site visit during the COVID -19 crisis: • Safety assessment via phone call • Local lab assessment • Delivery of the study treatment to patient • Visit to patient’s home"
40,page_40,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 41 of 83 These opti ons apply to all on -site study visits except for the randomization visit (Visit 1). Visit 1 must occur on-site as per section 5.2.2. These solutions can be applied after Medical Monitor approval and depending on the investigator’s judgment of each case and the patient /parent(s) ’s agreement. The alternative solutions can be implemented in response to th e COVID -19 crisis prior to the notification or submission to and approval of regulatory agencies and ethics committe es. Before implementing any of these options for a patient, the site will contact the patien t and parent(s) to check whether they agree wit h the off -site procedures. The patient will be invited to attend an on -site visit to complete the study procedur es as per protocol, as soon as the situation allows it. 5.3.3.1. Safety and drug compliance procedures The following procedures will be performed if applicable for the visit via either a phone contact, or, if safe and possible, a direct visit to the patient: • Check for AEs • Collection of any lifestyle modifications • Check concomit ant/prior medication • Check of compliance (review of dosing diary with the patient/parent(s)) • Physical examination if possible with a direct visit to the patient or using vi deo (describe d in Section 6.2.1 ) • Record vital signs , waist circumference and weight if possible with a direct visit to the patient (described in Section 6.2.1 and Section 6.2. 2) 5.3.3.2. Local lab assessment The patient will be asked if he/she can access a local lab in the few days after t he phone contact to obtain hematology and biochemistry testing. If a direct visit to the patient is safe and possible, the a ppropriate lab parameters corresponding to the on - site study visit will be collected. 5.3.3.3. Delivery of study treatment to the patient The study treatment can be shipped to the patient or delivered directly to the patient by the site study staff if safe and po ssible as per the site procedure . As per the usual study visit, the patient will be instructed to continue taking the av ailable tablets from the existing kit until he/she receives the new kit. The study drug compliance and study drug accountability will be performed as described in Section 7. 7 and Section 7. 8 once brought to the study site/study pharmacy."

Completion of Missed Study Procedures As soon as t he situation allows it, the site will schedule the patient’s on -site visit to complete the missed study procedures (those that could not be performed during the phone calls/visit to patient) as per protocol . 5.4. Patien t Withdrawal and Discontinuation 5.4.1. Early Termination A patien t or the patien t’s parent/legal guardian may withdraw the patient from treatment or from the study at any time at their request or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons. Upon withdr awal, the study drug should be permanent ly discontin ued. 5.4.1.1. Discontinuation for Treatment A patien t must be permanently discontinued from the study drug for any of the following reasons: • The patien t becomes pregnant ; • Allerg ic or adverse reaction to the study drug; • Per section 6.3 of the protocol referring to Important specific biological considerations for patient discontinuation related to reported lab values ; • Clinically signific ant adverse event, which in the opinio n of the Investigator, would put the patien t at unnecessary risk if dosing was continued; or • If a patien t is discontinued from treatment at any time after V isit 1, they should complete the V isit 6/EOT visit and will be encouraged to return one month later for Visit 7/EOS visit . 5.4.1.2. Discontinuation from Study A patien t must be discontinued from the study drug and from the study for the following reason: • The patien t/parent/ legal guardian withdraws consent. From the time conse nt is withdrawn, no additional data should be collected. However, the Sponsor may retain and continue to use data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 5.4.2. Replacement Patien t replacement will be at the discretion of the Sponsor. 5.4.3. Lost to Follow -up A patien t is considered to have been lost to follow -up if he/she [ patient or parent/legal guardian] cannot be contacted by the Investigator (or designee). The Investigator (or designee) will document efforts to attempt to reach the patien t twice by telephone and will send a certified letter before considering the patien t lost to follow -up. The end of participation for a patien t lost to follow -up is documented as the delivery date of the certified letter."

Investigator The Principal Investiga tor must have access and be available to promptly review the results of all safety assessments (i.e., clinical laboratory testing), electrocardiogram (ECG) results, vital signs and adverse events (AEs) including application site assessment information thro ughout the study. Safety assessments must be promptly (should be within 48 hours of notification of event) entered into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. Clinical laboratory data will be evaluat ed by the Principal Investigator and clinical relevanc e will be assessed for abnormal values and the assessment will be documented on the laboratory report. A copy of the reports will be maintained as part of the source documentation. 5.5.2. Data and Safety Mon itoring Board A DSMB will be established to monitor th e progress of the study and to perform safety data reviews as designated in the DSMB charter, in order to protect patient welfare. The DSMB charter will define the role, responsibilities, rules and task s, schedule, and format of meetings and data review an d reporting requirements. The DSMB considers study -specific data as well as relevant background knowledge about the disease, test agent, or patient population under study. The primary responsibilities of the DSMB are to 1) review and evaluate the accumula ted study data for participant safety, study conduct and progress, and 2) make recommendations concerning the continuation (i.e. proceeding with enro llment of patients in cohort 2), modification, or ter mination of the trial. All DSMB discussions, decisions , and recommendations will be communicated promptly to the Sponsor as described in the DSMB charter. The DSMB will consist of two independent clinicians with relevant expertise in related NAFLD/NASH pediatric clinical trials and 1 statistician with expert ise in clinical trial and interim data analysis. At minimum, safety data will be summarized by the statistician after every 5th patient completes visit 4 or available data at the end of each quarter (a t approximately 3 -month intervals), whichever comes fi rst throughout the study. The DSMB will also review safety and PK data once 80% of the patients in Cohort 1 have completed through Visit 4. Enrollment in Cohort 2 will commence as recommended by the DS MB. 6. ASSESSMENTS 6.1.

Pharmacokinetic Blood Handling Procedures Blood samples will be collected into 1mL lithium heparin tubes protected from light with foil and plasma will be separated in a refrigerated centr ifuge (ca.4°c) at 1500 g for 15 minutes and a volume of 250µl will be dispensed in a polypropylene opaque tube for both aliquots 1 and 2. The plasma will be stored at -20°c ±5°C at the site facilities. Thereafter, the plasma will be transported in dry ice, first to the central laboratory where they will be stored at -20°C ±5°C until shipped to Eurofins ADME BIOAN ALYSE for analysis. 6.2. Other Safety Assessments and On-going Safety Monitoring 6.2.1. Physical Examination A physical examination will be performed at each v isit. The physical examination will include an examination of general appearance, skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck/thyroid, lungs, heart, upper/lower extremities, lymph nodes, abdomen, musculoskeletal system and basic neurological assessment. Additiona l systems will be evaluated as needed. Physical exam findings must be recorded in the source documen tation and include the date and name of the individual conducting the examination. Physical examinations must be performed by an individual licensed to cond uct standard physical examinations . 6.2.2. Vital Signs Blood pressure [BP (mmHg)] and pulse rate [PR ( BPM)] will be measured at each visit (with the exception of Visit 4) according to the “Recommendations for Blood Pressure Measurement in Humans and Experimental Animals” published in an AHA scientific statement. It is important that vital signs be taken before any in vasive procedures ( e.g., venipuncture ). Each measurement should be recorded in the source document and recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Important Points for Clinical Blood Pressure Measurement: • The patient should be seated comfortably with the back supported and the upper arm bared without constrictive clothing. The legs should not be crossed. It is recommended the same arm be used for the collection of blood pressure readings throughout the patient’s participation. • The arm should be supported at heart level, and the bladder of the cuff should encircle at least 80% of the arm circumference. • When using a mercury sphygmomanometer, th e mercury should be deflated at 2 to 3 mm/s, and the first and last audible sounds should be ta ken as systolic and diastolic pressure. The column should be read to the nearest 2 mmHg. • Neither the patient nor the observer should talk during the measurement. • Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and D iastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) will be measured after 5 minutes of rest in the seat ed position with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer or a validated sphygmomanometer. Validated manometer has to be the same for a given p atient throughout the visits."
46,page_46,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 47 of 83 6.2.3. 12-Lead ECG All investigative sites will perform ECG using a calibrated ECG machine. Site personnel must assess the quality of the ECG while the patient is still at the investigative site in the event that additional ECGs ne ed to be performed (i.e., if artifact is present). Any potential clinical significance of ECG will be determined by the Investigator with relation to the patient’s medical history, physical examination and concomitant medication and recorded in the eCRF. For younger children, the parent/ legal guardian may need to practice, prior to the study visit, lying still. Suggest use of a timer to help the child understand how long to hold still. If possible, have the patien t rest quietly for at least 10 minutes. R efer to Study Procedure Manual for additional details re garding data collection and transmission . 6.2.4. Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL ™) The child, adolescent and parent /legal guardian PedsQL ™ (Version 4.0) Generic Core Scales will be used in this study. The scale validated for use in the pediatric populations; child version for 8 -12 years of age and teen version for 13 to 18 years of age and a parent version for each respective age group . It is composed of 23 items comprising 4 dimensions . A copy of the scal es and instructions for scoring will be pr ovided to the site . The Sponsor has secured the required licensing for use of the scale in this study. The PedsQL ™ (Version 4.0) will be completed on paper by the patient and by a parent /legal guardian individuall y. This information will then be entered on the eCRF page by study site staff . The patient/ parent or legal guardian will complete the same version of the questionnaire throughout the study. 6.3. Important Specific Biological Considerations and Patient Discontinuation Rules 6.3.1. Creatine Phosphokinase If at any visit during the treatment periods, a patient experiences diffuse myalgia, muscle tenderness, and marked increase in muscle CPK values higher than 2 x ULN, the patient must be discontinued from study drug i mmediately and followed up as described in Section 5.4.1.1 . If at any visit during the treatment periods, a patient experiences marked increase in muscle CPK values >2x ULN w ithout symptoms or if associated with vigorous exerci se, an additional visit and test should be done within approximately 48 to 72 hours. If during that visit CPK elevations persist, the patient must be discontinued from study treatment immediately and fol lowed up as described in Section 5.4.1.1 . 6.3.2. Liver Function Monitoring • Increase in aminotransferase ( AT) of <3 x baseline value: no additional action required, schedule next visit as per assessment schedule. • Liver function monitoring requirements for all patients with increased in AT > 3x baseline value : o Increase in AT of >3 x baseline value but less than 10 x ULN: retest after 48 to 7 2 hours . o AT remains >3 x baseline value and <5 x the baseline, or 10 x ULN: continue the drug with close serial monitor ing (once a week) . o AT increases >5 x baseline value will lead to permanent discontinu ation of th e patient from stu dy drug and schedule EOT Visit (refer to Section 5.2.7). o An increase of AT >10 x ULN will lead to immediate perma nent discontinuation of the patient from study drug, and schedu ling of EOT visit (refer to Section 5.2.7). Patients will permanently discontinue from study drug ( refer to Section 5.2.8 and 5.4.1.1 ) if at any visit during the treatment periods they exhibit any of the following:"

Renal Function M onitoring • Decrease in eGFR of 15ml/min/1.73m² or more compared to baseline value associated with cystatin C > ULN : retest of serum creatinine , cystatin C and eGFR within approximately 48 to 72 hours. • If decrease in eGFR and increase in cystatin C persists, permanent discontinu ation from study drug will be considered and discussed with the Medical Monitor (see Section 5.2.8 and 5.4.1.1 ). • In case of a n increase of creatinine or Cystatin C >20% from baseline: retest every two weeks until two consecutive results are <20% f rom baseline . A retest visit should be considered and discussed with the Medical Monitor if no protocol required visit is planned within the nex t two weeks. • Decrease of eGFR at a value less than 60 ml/min/1.73m²: permanently discontinue patient from study drug and schedule EOT Visit (refer to Section 5.2.7). 6.3.4. Additional Monitoring • Decrease in haemoglobin greater th an 2mg/dL from baseline: retest within 48 to 72 hours . • If haemoglobin decline is persistent or worsening and unexplai ned by other cau ses, permanently discontinue patient from study drug and schedule EOT Visit ( refer to Section 5.2.7). 6.4. Guidance for Investigators 6.4.1. Summary of Safety Data 6.4.1.1. Non-Serious Adverse Drug Reactions For all completed studi es to date with repeated administration of elafibranor (at least 14 days) from 80 mg/day up to 300 mg/day (MTD), numbers and percentages of frequency of adverse drug reactions (A DR, adverse events r eported by investigators as possibly related or related to study drug) have been calculated compared to the total number of subjects treated with elafibranor and the total number of subjects treated with placebo. Only non -serious adverse reactions with fr equency > 1% are considered for reporting. Given the small numbers for each adverse reaction identified with a frequency >1%, an imbalance in frequency of occurrence compared to placebo is reported when the relative delta is ≥ 30%. The common non -serious a dverse drug reactions reported with repeated doses of at l east 80 mg elafibranor per day are thus summarized in Table 1. Among the non -serious adverse reactions, the most frequent were gastro -intestinal disorders and general disorders. The first ones in term of frequency consisted mostly of dia rrhea and vomiting. For general disorders, the main symptoms were fatigue / asthenia. Other non -serious adverse reactions reported in more t han 1% of patients concerned changes in biological parameters such as liver enzymes increase (mainly transaminases) , CPK elevation, or increase of creatinine (reported by investigators as renal failure and/or impairment due to the calculation of creatinine clearance"

However, f or atrial fibrillation, acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis, and Parkinson’s disease, after later investigations, given the medical history of the patients or the time of occurrence of the event, these events were considered as having no reasonable causal relationship to elafibranor by the Sponsor."
49,page_49,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 50 of 83 For the other cases of possibly related serious adverse events (SAEs), the causality assessment to elafibranor was considered as having a reasonable possibility both by the investigator and by the Sponsor as there was no way to rule out a relationship to study drug. 6.4.2. Potential Risks In toxicology studies, the only consistent safety concern was the expected PPAR -associated hepato megaly, hepatocellular hypertrophy, and liver carcinoma in rodent species (mice and r ats). However, it is well known that, compared to nonhuman primates and humans, rodents are highly sensitive to PPAR agonist induced peroxisome proliferation and associat ed liver side effects. Thus, available information on this class of drug, which inclu des marketed fibrates, together with the lack of any liver side effects in monkeys treated with high doses of elafibranor for 1 year, support the nonrelevance to humans [Cattley et al., 1998]. Elafibranor did not show any of the known PPAR -related concerns such as excess in weight gain, hemodilution, edema, cardiomegaly, adiponectin induction, or urinary bladder carcinoma. Regarding specific moni toring, although no signal for increase in CPK has been observed in clinical trials, given the known effects of PPAR  agonists on the increase of CPK enzyme, this parameter is monitored in clinical trials. For this reason, it is recommended that investigators review these lab results in the course of clinical trials. Other known effects o f PPAR agonists include an incr ease of creatinine, which was observed in Phase 2 trials with elafibranor, and corresponded to an increase of 5-10% that was reversible at end of treatment. This should also be monitored in clinical trials. Liver enzymes are also monitored in clinical tria ls, with specific attention paid to drug -induced liver injury. Based on the findings of non -clinical reproductive and developmental toxicity studies performed to date, and in the absence of human pregnancy data, elafibranor may be classed in the “Possible human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in early pregnancy” risk category according to the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) document “ Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials ” (Sept ember 2014). As such, all clini cal trials with elafibranor including women of childbearing potential require a negative pregnancy test before randomization, with highly effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. It is recommended to maintain t he contraception up to 1 month a fter end of treatment. Pregnancy tests should be repeated as stated within the Study General Assessment schedule . 6.4.3. Risk Benefit Analysis Clinical data have confirmed the potential beneficial effect of elafibranor in adult s ubjects with NASH. Phase 2 studies in subjects with cardiometabolic disorders and NASH have demonstrated consistent reductions in ALP compared to placebo. The reduction in ALP was associated with relevant reductions in markers of liver injury such as GGT and ALT and in inflammatory markers. These data are encouraging to consider elafibranor as a potential drug candidate to treat PBC. In addition, the Phase 2b trial in NASH patients demonstrated the efficacy of elafibranor at the therapeutic dose of 120 mg on a clinically meaningful primary endpoint, resolution of histological NASH without worsening of fibrosis, in patients with active disease (NAS ≥4). While the trial was short and not designed for antifibrotic endpoints, it nonetheless showed that elafibr anor, at 120 mg daily, impro ved fibrosis indirectly through the resolution of NASH. Importantly, elafibranor 120 mg concomitantly improved the cardiometabolic risk profile of the patients by decreasing plasma triglycerides, total and LDL -cholesterol, increasing HDL -C, and improving i nflammation, insulin resistance, and glucose homeostasis. Together, these results position elafibranor as a drug candidate to treat NASH with the objective to block fibrosis evolution and ultimately avoid long term liver outcome s while reducing cardiovascu lar risk. Moreover, these studies have highlighted the good safety profile of elafibranor and no major safety concerns have been raised."
50,page_50,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 51 of 83 Based on the cumulative experience gathered to date, gastrointestinal disorders and asthen ia / fatigue are considered common non -serious adverse reactions reasonably associated with elafibranor. Most of them are of mild to moderate intensity. Laboratory increases in serum creatinine or CPK should be monitored throughout the clinical trials as t his has been observed in Pha se 2 studies to date and is a known PPAR α agonist effect. Elevation of transaminases should also be monitored as well as drug -induced liver injury. In the absence of human pregnancy data, highly effective contraception should be maintained for women of childbearing potential participating in cli nical trials with elafibranor treatment, up to 1 month after end of study treatment. In conclusion, the safety data and the current knowledge on elafibranor confirm the favorable balance between anticipated efficacy/ benefits and risks. 7. TREATMENTS 7.1. Descript ion of Study Drug Elafibranor (propanoic acid, 2 -[2,6-dimethyl -4-[3-[4-(methylthio)phenyl] -3-oxo-1(E)-propenyl] phenoxy] -2- methylpropanoic acid) will be supplied as 80 mg or 120 mg white to off -white round coated ta blets (of different size) with no printe d inscription. The tablet contains elafibranor and inactive ingredients (microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, croscarmellose, anhydrous colloidal silica, magnesium stearate, opadry II HP 85F18422). The safety of elafibranor is supported by non -clinical to xicity data (adult and juvenile toxicity studies) for the youngest/lightest patients at the two dosage strengths for the expected duration of treatment. The excipients used in the manufacture of ela fibranor 80 mg and 120 mg coated tablets have been common ly used in drug oral forms for decades both in adult and pediatric formulations. All of them are compliant with the European and US Pharmacopeia (including all components of the coating) (refer to Table 3). Elafibranor tablets for mulation does not contain any excipient with known adverse effects such as preservatives, coloring agents, sugars, and sweeteners.

Study Drug Compliance From Visit 1 and at each subsequent visit while the patient is being treated with study drug up to the EOT visit, the patient will be instructed to bring back all used and unused cartons and wallets containing blisters . Compliance will be checked by the Investigator or their designee during those visits and recorded in the eCRF. If treatment is interrupted, whatever the cause, duration and reason for the interruption should be documented in the dosing diary and on the source documentation . 7.8. Treatment Accountability, Retrieval and Destruction The Investigator or pharmacist will sign a receipt for each study treatment on the day of receipt. A drug accountability record should be maintained by the person responsible for dispensing the trial medication to the patient. All partially used or unused treatments will b e inventoried by the monitor during and at the conclusion of the study. On Sponsor request, all treatments (used or unused) may be destroyed on site per acceptable site Drug Destruction S tandard Operating Procedure or the Drug Distr ibution Centre will orga nize the retrieval of all treatments (used or unused) and will proceed to their destruction after the Sponsor provides written authorization. 7.9. Other Medication 7.9.1. Handling of Concomitant Medication In a general manner, patient s should be discouraged from start ing any new medication without consulting the investigator unless the new medication is required for emergency purpose. In the same way, any qualitative or quantitative change in concomitant the rapy should be avoided when possible ( Appendix III) In the event that it becomes necessary during the study, this should be recorded by the Investigator in the eCRF (including concomitant medications taken with in 3 months prior to screening) and information should be comm unicated to the Medical Monitor. This includes drugs used on a chronic as well as on an ‘as needed’ basis. 7.9.2. Non-Permitted Medication The following medications are not allowed : • Thiazolidinediones (glitazones [pioglitazone & rosiglitazone]): From 3 months ( 12 weeks ) prior to Screening Visit 1 (SV1) up to End of Study (V isit 7); • Fibrates: From 2 months ( 8 weeks ) prior to Screening Visit 1 up to End of Study (V isit 7); • Indomethacin: From Randomization (V1 /Day 1 ) to End of Treatment (V6 ). Chronic use of the foll owing medication is not permitted ): • Methotrexate, tamoxifen, chronic systemic glucocorticoid, tetracyclin e, valproic acid, salicylates: • From 12 months prior to screening (S creening Visit 1) up to Randomization (V isit 1): chronic use defined as treatment l onger than 3 consecutive months . If it is identified that these non -permitted drugs have been administered to a patient within the excl uded timeframes, the site will discuss the continuation of the patient with the Medical Monitors of the study."
53,page_53,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 54 of 83 7.9.3. Permitted Medication Under Conditions The following medications are permitted under the condition of no qualitative change and stable dose for 3 months prior to Screening Visit 1 up to Randomization (V isit 1/Day 1 ): • Statins, ezetimibe, and other nonfibr ate lipid low ering medications ; • Anti-diabetic as insulin, metformin, Gliptins, Sulfonylureas, glucagon -like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist , sodium /glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibitor ; • Medication to treat NAFLD/NASH such as Vitamin E, ursodeoxycholic acid, PUFA s. Durin g the study (from V1 to V7), qualitative change and dose change should be avoided as much as possible. All qualitative and dose changes must be captured in the source and eCRF. Chronic use (defined as treatment longer than 2 consecutive weeks) of the foll owing medication should be avoided if possible , from V1 to V7: • Methotrexate, tamoxifen, chronic systemi c glucocorticoid, tetracyclin e, valproic acid, salicylates . 8. ADVERSE EVENT / SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENT RE PORTING 8.1. Definitions 8.1.1. Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical (investigational) product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment will be considered as an AE. The term AE is syno nymous with the term “adverse experience” as used by the Food and Drug Administra tion (FDA). An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding or physiological observation, for example), symptom, or diseas e temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, wh ether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Examples of AE include (but are not limited to): abnormal test findings; clinically significant symptoms and signs; c hanges in physical examination findings; hypersensitivity; progression/worsening of pre -existing condition or underlying disease; recurrence of a pre -existing condition; lack of effect, complication, and termination of pregnancy. Additionally, they may inc lude the signs or symptoms resulting from: drug overdose, drug withdrawal, drug abuse, drug misuse, drug interactions, drug dependency, extravasation, exposure in utero. The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be repo rted as an AE are as follows: • Test result is associated with accompanying symptom s; • Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention ; • Test result leads to a change in trial dosing or discontinuation from the study, signif icant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy ; • Test result is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or Sponsor. Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test res ult that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE."
54,page_54,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 55 of 83 An AE does not include the following: • Medical or surgical procedures performed; the condition that leads to the procedure may be an AE if applicable ; • Pre-existing disease, conditio n or laboratory abnormalities present or detecte d before the Screening Visit that do not worsen ; • Overdose without clinical sequelae ; • Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset before the consent form is signed. Suc h a medical condition is pre-existing and should be documented on the medical history of the eCRF ; • Uncomplicated pregnancy ; • An induced elective abortion to terminate a pregnancy without medical reason . The questions concerning whether the condition existed before the start of the active phase of the stu dy and whether it has increased in severity and/or frequency will be used to determine whether an event is a treatment -emergent AE. An AE is considered to be treatment emergent if (1) it is not present when t he active phase of the study begins and is not a chronic condition that is part of the patient’s medical history, or (2) it is present at the start of the active phase of the study or as part of the patient’s medical history, but the severity or frequency increases during the active phase. The active ph ase of the study begins at the time of the first dose of the study drug. The active phase of the study ends at the last study visit . 8.1.2. Serious Adverse Events (SAE) A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death ; • Is life -threatening (see Section 8.1.2.1 ); • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (see Section 8.1.2.2 ); • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (see Section 8.1.2.3 ); • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (including fetal malformations associated with spontaneous abortions or elective abortions) ; or • Is another medically important condition (see Section 8.1.2.4 ). In addition, any illnesses reported before starting active treatment that have wors ened after ICF signed or AE meeting the criteria of seriousness (as defined above) must be reported as an SAE. 8.1.2.1. Life-Threatening Adverse Events A life-threatening AE in the definition of ""serious"" refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to a n event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 8.1.2.2. In-Patient or Prolonged Hospitalizati on An inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization means that the patient stays overnight in the hospital. Visits to the emergency room will not be considered hospital admission. Pre -planned hospital stays or hospital stays for nonmedical social reasons will not be considered as hospitalization, for example: • Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is needed for a pr ocedure required by the protocol."
55,page_55,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 56 of 83 • Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of a routine procedure followed by the study center (e.g., stent removal after surgery). This should be recorded in the study file. • Hospitalization for survey visi ts or annual physicals fall in the same category. • Hospitalization planned before the start of the study for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened does not constitute an SAE (e.g. , elective hospitalization for a total knee replacement due to a pre -existing condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened during the study). 8.1.2.3. Significant or Incapacitating Disability Only a persistent or significant or incapacitating disab ility is intended. This item refers to a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. Thus, disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, dia rrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma. 8.1.2.4. Medically Important Conditio n Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediat ely life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may je opardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events a re: • Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm . • Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization . • Development of drug dependency or drug abuse . 8.1.3. Clarification on Serious Adverse Events • Death is an outc ome of an AE, not an AE. • An SAE may occur even if the patient was not being treated with the investigational medicinal product at the occurrence of the event. • Life-threatening means that patient is at immediate risk of death. This does not include an event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severit y. • Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs. If a complication prolongs the hospitalization, it is a SAE. • Patient hospitalization means that the patient stays overnig ht in the hospital. Pre -planned hospital stays or hospital stays for nonme dical social reasons will not be considered as hospitalization. • A procedure for protocol/disease -related investigations should not be reported as SAE. Hospitalization or prolonged ho spitalization for a complication of such procedures should be reported as SAE. 8.1.4. Adverse Drug Reaction An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended and that is considered causally related to a n investigational medicinal product. A serious adverse drug reaction (SADR ) is an ADR which meets the seriousness criteria. 8.1.5. Unexpected Adverse Event Expectedness is assessed by the Sponsor. An unexpected AE is defined as an event that has a nature of sever ity or specificity that is not consistent with the applicable Investigator Brochure or that is"
56,page_56,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 57 of 83 symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to a known toxicity but differs because of a greater severity or specificity. “Unexpected” refers to an ADR that has not been previously observed and reported rather than an event that h as not been anticipated based on the properties of the drug . 8.2. Assessments The Investigator will establish whether or not any AEs have occurred at each visit from the date of consent through the EOS visit (or 30 days after the last drug intake whichever is l ater). The patient will be questioned in a general manner to determine specific symptoms without offering the patient any suggestion. 8.2.1. Intensity Assessment The intensity of the AE will be graded as follows: • Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily t olerated and are of minor irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. • Moderate : Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the par ticipant and may interfere with daily activities but are usually improved by simple therapeutic measures; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe : Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally re quire systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating. 8.2.2. Relation to the Study Treatment The Investigator will make a clinical and scientific judgmen t regarding whether or not the AE was related to study treatment. The Investigator will evaluate any changes in laboratory values and make a determination as to whether or not the change is clinically important, and whether or not the changes were related to study drug. However, even if the Investigator feels there is no relationship to the study drug, the AE or clinically significant laboratory abnormality must be recorded in the eCRF. The Investigator will record the relation to the study treatment accord ing to the following causality terms: • Related: the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration, and it cannot be explained by the patient's clinical state or the study procedures/conditions. The AE abates upon discontinua tion of the study drug and reappears when the study drug is introduced. • Possibly re lated: the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration but could have been produced by the patient's clinical state or the study procedure s/conditions. • Unlikely related: the temporal association between the AE and the stu dy drug is such that the study drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE. The relationship is not likely because of other plausible explanations. • Not related: the AE must definitely be caused by the patient's clinical state or the s tudy procedure/conditions. A reasonable explanation must be given, e.g., no study drug taken, preplanned elective medical intervention, or incompatible temporal relationship . • Not assessable : the report suggesting an adverse reaction cannot be judged becaus e information is insufficient or contradictory and data cannot be supplemented or verified. 8.2.3. Action Taken and Outcome"
57,page_57,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 58 of 83 The Investigator will record the action taken with drug and outcome of the event for each AE according to the following: Action taken with investigational drug • Drug permanently withdrawn – in case a patient is permanently withdrawn from the study drug • Drug temporarily withdrawn – in case the study drug is temporarily withdrawn • Dose not changed – in case no action is taken regarding the study drug • Unknown • Not applicable – an AE started before initiation of treatment with study drug, the treatment had been completed prior to reaction/event, or the patient has died. Outcome • Recovered/resolved • Recovering/resolving • Not recovered/not resolved • Recove red/resolved with sequelae • Fatal • Unknown Note: In case of irreversible congenital anomalies the choice not recovered/not resolved should be used. “Fatal” should be used when death is possibly related to the reaction/event. 8.3. Reporting 8.3.1. Reporting an Adverse Ev ent All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug, including those occurring during the Screening Period, are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) of the eCRF and in the patient’s medical record from the ICF signature until the EOS visit (or 30 days after last drug intake, whichever is later). Whenever possible, symptoms should be group ed as a single syndrome or diagnosis. The Investigator should specify the date of onset, maximal intensity, action taken with respect to study drug, corrective therapy given, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the study drug. Adverse event reporting begins from signature of the patient ICF at the first Screening Visit and ends at the EOS visit (or 30 days after last drug intake, whichever is later). 8.3.2. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event Seriou s AE reporting begins from signature of the patient ICF and ends at the EOS visit (or 30 days after last drug intake, whichever is later). Any SAE th at is brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the reporting period and which is con sidered by him/her to be caused by the study drug within a reasonable possibility, should be reported. Investigators must notify, by fax or e -mail, th e Sponsor designated representative SGS Life Science s Services Medical Affairs of all SAEs IMMEDIATELY (within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event)."

The SAE Form should include a clearly written narrative describing signs, symptoms, and treatment of the event, diagnostic procedures, as well as any relevant la boratory data and any sequelae, in order to allow a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of the possible causality. The Investigator is also required to submit f ollow-up SAE reports to SGS L ife Science Services Medical Affairs within 24 hours of becoming aware of additional information such as diagnosis, outcome, causality assessment, results of specific investigations, and any new significant information that has not been previously reported. It is critical that the informa tion provided on the initial or follow -up SAE Form matches the information recorded in the source documents and the eCRF for the same event. Copies of additional laboratory tests, consultation r eports, postmortem reports, hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents relevant to the reported SAE should be sent when requested and applicable. All provided reports must be anonymized. Follow -up reports relative to the patient’s subseque nt course must be submitted to SGS L ife Science Services Medical Affairs until the event has subsided or, in case of permanent impairment, until the condition stabilizes. The Sponsor or its designated representative will report all the relevant safety info rmation to the concerned Competent Authorities and to th e concerned IRB/IEC according to the country -specific requirements. Investigator must fulfill his/her regulatory obligations to the Regulatory Authorities and/or to the Ethics Committee in accordance with local regulations. Depending on local regulations i n different regions and countries, the Sponsor or designated clinical research organization (CRO) may be required to expedite report to the Regulatory Authorities for: • SAEs (including events related t o study procedures) • SADRs • Suspected unexpected serious a dverse reactions (SUSARs) Each SAE report received from the Investigators will be evaluated by the designated CRO for pharmacovigilance who will assess the seriousness of the event. Each SAE report wi ll be evaluated by the Sponsor and/or his designees who will assess the relationship to study procedure or study treatment and the expectedness of the event. Expectedness will be assessed using the reference safety information included in the Investigator Brochure. Any unexpected safety issue that changes the r isk benefit analysis and is likely to have an impact on the patients who have participated in the trial will be reported by the Sponsor as soon as possible to the concerned Competent Authority(ies) to gether with proposed actions."
59,page_59,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 60 of 83 8.3.3. Follow -up The Investigato r should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients, notably he/she should follow up the outcome of any AE until the return to normal or until stabilization of the patient’s condition, even if this goes beyond the EOS visit. The pat ient must be followed up until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized. This may imply that follow -up will continue after the patient has left the study and that additional inve stigations may be requested by the Sponsor. This information should be documented in the patient’s medical records. 8.4. Post Study Reporting Requirements Any SAEs and deaths that occur within 30 days of t he last dose of the study drug, regardless of causality, should be reported. Any SAE that is brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the reporting period and which is considered by him/her to be caused by the study drug within a reas onable possibility, should be reported. 8.5. Clinical Laborat ory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Laboratory abnormalities are not necessarily recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities that are considered clinically relevant by the Investigator must be recorded as an AE or SAE as applicabl e. 8.6. Special Situation Reports Special situations rep orts include pregnancy reports, reports of medication error, abuse, misuse or overdose, and reports ass ociated with product complaints. 8.6.1. Pregnancy In case of pregnancy a communication will be sent by the Investigator to SGS L ife Science Services Medical Affairs by faxing a completed pregnancy form within 24 hours of his/her knowledge of the pregnancy. Pregna ncies of female partners of male patients e xposed to study medication should also be reported to SGS L ife Science Services Medical Affairs using the corresponding pregnancy form. Female patients must be instructed to discontinue the study drug immediately and inform the Investigator as soon as poss ible once they are aware of being pregnant or suspect that they are pregnant during the study or within 30 days of the last dose of the study drug. Female patients will be requested, as part of the general ICF, to provide informed consent to allow reasonab le attempts to be made to obtain information on any possible medicinal product exposure to an embryo or fetus and to follow up on the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator will contact the patient at the expe cted time of delivery for follow -up. If the outcome of pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, congenital anomaly, birth defect), the Investigator should fo llow the procedure for reporting SAEs as de tailed in Section 8.3.2. The pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. 8.6.2. Medication Error Medication error is defined as an unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or adminis tration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or consumer. All medication"

Misuse This refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the protocol . In case of any potential risk to patient safety, would be repo rted as appropriate (see Section 8.6). 8.6.4. Overdose This refers to the administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively, which is above the highest dose of the protocol. Clinical judgment should always be applied. 8.6.5. Abuse This corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects. 9. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS 9.1. Rand omization and Treatment Assignment Number of Randomized Patients (planned): A total of 20 patients will be enrolled across the two cohorts. • Cohort 1: ≥12 to ≤17 years of age. A total of approximately 12 patients will be randomized in this cohort. • Cohort 2: ≥8 to ≤11 years of age. A total of approximately 8 patients will be randomized in this cohort. Enrollment in this cohort will not star t until 80% of the patients in cohort 1 have been evaluated through Visit 4 by the Data Safety Monitoring Board. Patients will be randomize d 1:1 to receive either dose (80 or 120 mg). Considering that at least 4 patients ≥12 to ≤17 years of age and at leas t 2 patients ≥8 to ≤11 years of age with fibrosis stage 2 or 3 will be enrolled and to achieve balance between dosing groups according to the fibrosis severity , randomization will be stratified within each cohort based upon screening fibrosis severity stag e (stratum 1:fibrosis stage 0 to 1 and stratum 2: fibrosis stage 2 to 3). The randomization procedure will be further described in the Stud y Procedure Manual. 9.2. Endpoints 9.2.1. Primary Endpoint Plasma concentrations of elafibranor and its active metabolite GFT1007. 9.2.2. Secondary Endpoints 9.2.2.1. Efficacy • Change from baseline in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and other liver markers ; • Change from baseline in serum lipid pa rameters ; • Change from baseline in glucose homeostasis makers ( Fasting plasma glucose, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Re sistance [HOMA -IR] and fasting insulin) ;"

Plasma concentra tions equal to or greater than the qualified lower limit of the assay (LOQ) will be used in the pharmacokinet ic analysis. The following calculated PK parameters will include, but not limited to: • Maximum concentration (C max); • Time to maximum concentration ( Tmax); • Area under the plasma concentration time curve over 24 hours (AUC [0-24]); • Trough concentrations in plasma (C trough). The analysis plan will be further detailed in the PK Statistical Analysis Plan (PK -SAP). 9.6. Other Statistical Analysis 9.6.1. Safety Safety evaluations will consist of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, and laboratory measurements (hematology, coagulation parameters, biochemistry, and urinalysis). Full details will be specified in the SAP. A general descrip tion of the planned analysis is as follows: • Laboratory parameters will be descriptively summarized (mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum) by dose group, for values at each visit and for changes from baseline at each subsequent visit. In addition, at each post base line visit, parameter status (low, normal, high) will also be summarized as shift tables vs. baseline status. • Vital signs will be summarized si milarly as for laboratory parameters but without shift tables. • Descriptive statistics and frequency tables will be prepared as appropriate for physical examinations, vital signs and ECG. • Adverse Events o AEs descriptions will be mapped to standard terms according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activity (MedDRA). o AEs that start prior to first study drug dose and that worsen after, and the AEs that start on or after first study drug dose will be considered a treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE). o The number of events, the number and proportion of patients reporting at least one event will be tabulated overal l and by severity . Each patient will be counted only once according to the worst severity reported over the treatment period . o Separate tables w ill be constructed by dose group and overall for (a) all reported TEAEs, (b) protocol treatment related TEAEs, ( c) serious TEAEs, and (d) TEAEs leading to protocol treatment discontinuation. o The non TEAEs will be listed separately and will not be included in the AE tabulations. • Concomitant medications will be mapped according to the World Health Organization (WHO) D rug Dictionary (WHODD) and will be presented in data listings."

Retention of Records The Investigator must ma intain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. The Investigator will be provided with a study file, which should be used to file the Investigator Brochure, protocol/amendments, drug accountability records, sample informed consent, staff curriculum vitae, correspondence with the IRB/ IEC, Sponsor, and other study -related documents. To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients, all ori ginal signed ICFs, copies of all eCRFs, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. The Investigator must retain the study documentation until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and unt il there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study drug . However , these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor. All hospital records will be archived according to local regulation. The Sponsor should be notified if the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the trial. The trial records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another Investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor . 11. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 11.1. Quality Control & Monitoring Procedures It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (ICH topic E6 ), applicable regulatory requirements, and the current Declaration of Helsinki ( Appendix I ) and th at valid data are entered into the eCRFs. To achieve this objective, the Study Monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the sam e time, the Sponsor in the maintenance of complete, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data. Before enro lling any patient s in this study, the Study Monitor will review the protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure , the eCRFs and instructions for t heir completion and return, the procedure for obtaining informed consent, and the procedure for reporting AEs and SAE s with the Investigator. In addition, the Study Monitor will explain the Investigator’s reporting responsibilities and all applicable regul ations concerning the clinical evaluation of the study drug. The Investigator will permit the representatives of Spon sor to monitor the study as frequently as the Sponsor deems is necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisf actory. A Study Monitor from the CRO will be responsible for monitoring this clinical trial. To this end, the Study Monitor will visit the study site at suitable intervals and be in frequent contact through verbal and written communication. The eCRFs and r elated source documents, as well as drug accountability will be reviewed in detail by the monitor at each visit, in a ccordance with relevant S tandard Operating Procedures and Good Clinical Practice (GCP; ICH topic E6 ) regulations. This includes results of tests performed as a requirement for participation in this study and any other medical records required to confirm in formation contained in the eCRFs, such as past medical history and secondary diagnoses. It is essential that the Study Monitor has access t o all documents (related to the study and the individual participants) at any time these are requested. In turn, the Study Monitor will adhere to all requirements for patient confidentiality as outlined in the ICF. The Investigator and Investigator’s staff will be expected to cooperate with the Study Monitor, to be available during a portion of the Monitoring Visit to an swer questions, and to provide any missing information."
65,page_65,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 66 of 83 All monitoring activities , including interim monitoring visit reports will be repor ted and archived in the Trial Master File. 11.2. Quality Assurance For the purpose of ensuring compliance with the protocol , GCP and applicable regulatory requirements, the Investigator should permit auditing by the Sponsor and/or designee and inspection by appl icable regulatory authorities. The Investigator agrees to allow the auditors/inspectors to have direct access to his/ her study records for review, being understood that these personnel will adhere to all requirements for patient confidentiality, and as suc h will not disclose any personal identity or personal medical information. As soon as the Investigator is notified of a future inspection by the Authorities, he/she will inform the Sponsor and authorize the Sponsor to participate at this inspection. The co nfidentiality of the data verified , and the anonymity of the patients should be respected during these inspections. Clinical data manager from the Sponsor or sponsor ’s representative will review the data for completeness and logical consistency. Additionally, the clinical data associates will use automated validation programs to help identify missing data, selected proto col violations, out of range data, and other data inconsistencies. Requests for data clarification or correction wil l be electronically provided to the investigative site for resolution. Clinical data associates will assure that corrections have been appli ed properly. 12. ETHICS AND REGULATORY 12.1. Ethical Principles This protocol complies with the principles laid down by the 18th World Medical Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and all applicable amendments laid down by the World Medical Assemblies ( Appendix I ), and the GCP guideline. This trial also complies with applicable local regulatory requirements and laws of each country in which the study is performed, as well as any applicable guidelines. 12.2. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethic s Committee (IRB/IEC) The GCP guidelines and the US CFR Title 21 Section 56 (21 CFR 56) require that approval must be obtained from an Institutional Review Board/ Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) prior to participation of human patients in research s tudies. Prior to the study onset, the protocol, ICF, assent, advertisements to be used for patient re cruitment, and any other written information regarding this study to be provided to the patient or the patient’s legally acceptable representative must be approved by the IRB/IEC. The Sponsor will supply relevant material for the Investigator to submit to the IRB/IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. Verification of the IRB’s unconditional approval of the protocol and the written ICF statement will be transmitted to the Investigator. Documentation of the relevant IRB/IEC approval and of the IRB/IEC co mpliance with GCP guideline will be maintained by the site and will be available for review by the Sponsor or its designee or by the authorized members of regulatory agencies. The Applicant must supply the Sponsor with written documentation of the initial favorable opinion of the clinical research before the start of the trial. The study will not commence until favorable opinion has been obtained from the ap propriate IRB/IEC. If any alterations, other than changes of administrative nature only, are made to the study protocol, a formal protocol amendment will be issued. The IRB/IEC will be informed by the Investigator of subsequent protocol amendments and of S USARs. Approval for protocol amendments will be transmitted in writing to the Investigator."
66,page_66,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 67 of 83 The amend ment will not be implemented until IRB/IEC approval, except in cases where immediate implementation is necessary to eliminate or prevent imminent hazard to the patients. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard must be documente d in an amendment, reported to the IRC/IEC within 5 working days, and submitted to the appropriate regulatory agencies in the required time frame. If reque sted, the Investigator will permit audits by the IRB/IEC and regulatory inspections by providing direct access to source data/documents. The Investigator will provide the IRB/IEC with progress reports at appropriate intervals (not to exceed one year) and a Study Progress Report following the completion, termination, or discontinuation of the Investigator’ s participation in the study. 12.3. Competent Authority In the same way, when required by national regulation, approval from Competent Authorities (CA) should be granted before the beginning of the study. If applicable, Amendments will also be submitted to CA fo r approval. 12.4. Informed Consent 12.4.1. General Provisions Informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, US Code of Feder al Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), HIPAA (if applicable), and local regulati ons. The Investigator (or designee) will prepare the Informed Consent Form, Assent and HIPAA authorization, as applicable, and provide the documents to the Sponsor or designee for approval prior to submission to the IRB/IEC . The consent/assent forms genera ted by the Investigator must be acceptable to the Sponsor and be approved by the IRB/IEC. The written cons ent document will embody the elements of informed consent as described in the International Conference on Harmonization and will also comply with loc al regulations. The Investigator will send an IRB/IEC -approved copy of the Informed Consent Form and Assent Form to the Sponsor (or designee) for the study file. A properly executed, written, informed consent will be obtained from the patient ’s legally aut horized representative (parent(s) or legal guardian(s)) prior to entering the patient into the trial and co nducting any Screening procedures . Information should be given in both oral and written form and study patient s and their parent(s)/ legally authorize d representative (s) must be given ample opportunity to inquire about details of the study. In accordance wi th the requirements of the approving IRB/IEC, assent from the study patien t will also be obtained. A copy of the signed consent form (and assent) wil l be given to the study patien t or legal representative of the study patien t and the original will be maint ained with the study patien t’s records . 12.4.2. Written Parental/Legal Guardian Consent Adequate provisions must be made for soliciting the permission of the child’s (less than 18 years of age) parent(s) or lega l guardian . If a patien t turns 18 years of age during the course of the study, written informed consent will be obtained from the patien t. The process for obtaining oral and/or written consent for children and adolescents is similar to that of obtaining consent for adults. An effective informed consent proce ss involves at minimum these elements: • Conducting the process in a manner and location that ensures privacy; • Giving adequate informa tion about the study in a language understandable to the parent/legal guardian and child/adolescent;"
67,page_67,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 68 of 83 • Providing adequate oppo rtunity for the parent/legal guardian and child to consider all options; • Responding to the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and child’s q uestions; • Ensuring the parent/legal guardian and child has understood the information provided; • Obtaining the parent/legal g uardian and child voluntary agreement to participate, and • Continuing to provide information as the parent(s)/legal guardian(s), chi ld, or research requires. 12.4.3. When Parents/Lega l Guardian Disagree If there are two parents/legal guardians available to give pe rmission but they disagree about allowing their child to participate in the study, the child may not be enrolled unless that disagre ement can be resolved. This applies to all permissible categories, even if only one parent or legal guardian’s signature is required, when both parents /guardian s are involved in the decision, they must agree for the child to be enrolled. If a parent or leg al guardian who was not involved or available for the original consent later becomes involved or available, the two parents /legal guardian s must then agree. 12.4.4. Assent The Investigator should carefully consider and propose adequate provisions for obtaining assent of children and adolescents prior to their participating in research. In general assent is usually obtained from a child ≥ 7 years of age, however the approving IRB/ IEC will determine whether or how assent will be obtained. The child shoul d be provided with essential information and asked if they wish to participate in the research study. 12.4.5. Documenting the Consent/Assent Pro cess Consent/Assent MUST be obtained and documented PRIOR to initiation of any study procedures. The Investigator or his/her approved designee must explain the nature of the study and associated risks to the parent(s)/legal guardian and study patien t. The date/time that the ICF and Assent is signed, a brief description of the consent/assent process (e.g., questions asked b y the patien t), and the name of the individual who obtained consent /assent will be recorded in the source record. A copy of the signed and dated ICF and Assent should be provided to the parent(s)/legal guardian (s). Depending on the approving IRB/IEC and lo cal requirements, an assent form may be included as part of the consent and may or may not be required to be signed by the child. Investi gators must adhere to their local requirements for proper documentation of consent/assent. A summary of assent procedur es for execution of this study must be maintained in the Investigator Essential Regulatory File. It is the responsibility of the Investig ator to ensure that any individual delegated the responsibility for obtaining consent/assent are familiar and adhere to the applicable consent/assent requirements. 12.5. Confidentiality The Sponsor will affirm and uphold the principle of the patien t’s right to p rotection against the invasion of privacy. Throughout this study and any subsequent data analyses, all data will be identified only by protocol number and patient number. All unpublished information that the Sponsor gives to the Investigator shall be kept confidential and shall not be published or disclosed to a third party without the prior written consent of the Spons or. When the Sponsor generates reports for presentations to regulatory agencies, one or more of the Investigators who has/have contributed s ignificantly to the study will be asked to endorse the final report. The endorsement is required by some regulatory agencies. The Investigator shall not make a patent application based on the results of this study and shall not assist any third party in ma king such an application without the written authorization of the Sponsor unless otherwise specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement."

Appendix I – World Me dical Association Declaration of Helsinki ETHICAL PRINCIPLES F OR MEDICAL RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS - WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSI NKI Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 and amended by the: 29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975 35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983 41st WMA Ge neral Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989 48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, Republic of South Africa, October 1996 52nd WMA General A ssembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000 53rd WMA General Assembly, Washington DC, USA, October 2002 (Note of Cla rification added) 55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 2004 (Note of Clarification added) 59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Repub lic of Korea, October 2008 64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013 16.1.1. Preamble 1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving huma n subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data. The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 2. Consistent wi th the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles. 16.1.2. General Principles 3. The Declaration of Geneva of t he WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the Inter national Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.” 4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and rights of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects. 6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve p reventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven inte rventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. 7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights. 8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take prec edence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects. 9. It is the duty of physicians who a re involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent. 10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving human subj ects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards."
73,page_73,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 74 of 83 No national or international ethical, legal or regulator y requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration . 11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimises possible harm to the environment. 12. Medical research invo lving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the appropriate ethics and scientific education, tr aining and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified phy sician or other health care professional. 13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research. 14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients in research only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or the rapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects. 15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of participating in research must be ensured. 16.1.3. Risks, Burdens and Benefits 16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects. 17. All medical research involving hu man subjects must be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens to the individua ls and groups involved in the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the condition under investigation. Measures to minimise the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously moni tored, assessed and documented by the researcher. 18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately stop the study. 16.1.4. Vulnerable Groups and Individuals 19. Some groups and individual s are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm. All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered protection. 20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive to the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non -vulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or intervention s that result from the research. 16.1.5. Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols 21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to general ly accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, oth er relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be r espected. 22. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must b e clearly described and justified in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicat e how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, potential conflicts of interest, incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the resear ch study. In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial provisions."
74,page_74,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 75 of 83 16.1.6. Research Ethics Committees 23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the concern ed research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the spo nsor and any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the la ws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in t his Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especia lly information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without co nsideration and approval by the committee. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. 16.1.7. Privacy and Confidentiality 24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information. 16.1.8. Informed Consent 25. Participation by indivi duals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical research must be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees. 26. In medical research involving human subjects capab le of giving informed consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, inst itutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of th e study and the discomfort it may entail, post -study provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the inform ation. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physici an or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study. 27. When seeking informed conse nt for participation in a research study the physician must be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by an approp riately qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship. 28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative. Th ese individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burd en. 29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able to give assent to decisions about participation in researc h, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorised representative. The potential subject’s dissent should be respected. 30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consen t, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group . In such circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the le gally authorised representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unabl e to give informed"
75,page_75,"Clinical Trial GFT505E -218-1 Protocol V 4.0 20 April 2020 GENFIT Page 76 of 83 consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorised representat ive. 31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship. 32. For medical research using identifiable human materia l or data, such as research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or impracti cable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee. 16.1.9. Use of Placebo 33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be teste d against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons t he use of any intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not receiving the best proven intervention. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 16.1.10. Post -Trial Provisions 34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclose d to participants during the informed consent process. 16.1.11. Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results 35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly accessible database before recruitment of the first subject. 36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the results of the ir research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwi se made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 16.1.12. Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice 37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or other known interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent f rom the patient or a legally authorised representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician’s judgement it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be made the objec t of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available."

Such methods include: • combined (estrogen and progesto gen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation1 o oral o intravaginal o transdermal • progestogen -only hormonal contrace ption associated with inhibition of ovulation1 o oral o injectable o implantable2 • intrauterine device (IUD)2 • intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)2 • bilateral tubal occlusion2 • vasectomised partner2,3 • sexual abstinence4 1Hormonal contraception may be suscep tible to interaction with the investigational medicinal product (IMP), which may reduce the efficacy of the contraception method. 2Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user dependency. 3Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the woma n of childbearing potential (WOCBP) trial participant and that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success. 4 In the context of this guidance sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence need s to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject.
