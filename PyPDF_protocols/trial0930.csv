The primary population used to evaluate efficacy will be the Efficacy Analysis Set and safety will be the Safety Analysis Set. The PK Analysis Sets will be used to conduct PK analyses . The primary analysis is percent change from baseline in plasma oxalate (Cohort A) / pre -dialysis plasma oxalate (Cohort B) summarized through Month 6 by cohorts. Secondary endpoints will be analyzed and reported with by -patient listings and by -patient figures of actual values, change from baseline and percent change (where change in percent is applicable) at each visit (scheduled and unscheduled visits). Tabular summaries using descriptive statistics (mean, standard error, median, min, max) will be reported. Long -term treatment effect of lumasiran will be summarized descriptively for the long -term extension period. Safety data will be summarized descriptively and presented in by -patient listings ."

Disease Overview Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by excessive oxalate production by the liver and consequent hyperoxaluria. PH1 is caused by mutations in the alanine -glyoxylate aminotransferase ( AGXT ) gene, which encodes the liver peroxisomal enzyme alanine -glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). As a consequence of AGT deficiency, glyoxylate accumulates and is oxidized to oxalate in the hepatocyte and ultimately transported to the kidneys for excretion. Oxalate, in the form of its calcium salt, is excreted almost entirely by the kidney. Due to its insolubility, calcium oxalate can crystallize readily in the urinary tract. In PH 1, excess urinary oxalate results in recurrent nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis, which can lead to pain, infections, progressive kidney disease and failure, along with reduced quality of life. [Cochat 2013 ] As renal function declines, elimination of oxalate is further reduced, such that calcium oxalate accumulates in bone, vasculature, skin, retina, heart, and nervous system, resulting in severe end -organ damage. [Cochat 2013 ] This devastating condition, systemic oxalosis, arises when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has declined to below 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.[Cochat 2013 ] Without treatment, the disease progresses inexorably, and death from end -stage renal disease (ESRD) and/or complications of oxalosis is inevitable. [Cochat 2013 ; Harambat 2010 ; van der Hoeven 2012 ] Over 150 mutations in AGXT have been described. [William s 2009 ] While there are broad genotype –phenotype associations with the underlying causative defect, patients can present with very different symptoms, disease course, including timing of an individual’s eGFR decline, and treatment response. [Danpure 2014 ; Hoppe 1997 ] Patients progress at various rates and an event that leads to acute or chronic worsening, such as an obstructive kidney stone or episode of dehydration, can occur at any time. The incidence of PH1 is approximately 1 in 120,000 live births, and the prevalence is 1 to 3 per million in North America and Europe. [Cochat 2013 ; Hopp 2015 ; Hoppe 2010 ] The disease is more prevalent in areas where consanguineous marriage s are common, especially in the Middle East and Northern Africa. [Al-Eisa 2004 ; Boualla 2015 ; Frishberg 2005 ; Kamoun 1996 ] PH1 often presents as a pediatric disease, and many patients remain undia gnosed for years after the initial clinical manifestations of the disease. [Lieske 2005 ; Mandrile 2014 ; van Woerden 2003 ] A recently published analysis of 247 patients with PH1 from 206 pedigrees in the Rare Kidney Stone Consortium PH Registry demonstrated a median age of first symptoms at 5.2 years of age and a cumulative renal survival of 76%, 43%, and 12% at 20 years, 40 years, and 60 years of age, respectively. [Hopp 2015 ] Similarly, an analysis of 526 patients with PH1 published by the OxalEurope Consortium indicated a median age of disease symptom onset of 3.9 years and a median age of diagnosis of 8 .1 years; disease presented in infancy in 29% of patients, 40% of whom had ESRD. [Mandrile 2014 ] Overall, 43% of all pati ents diagnosed with PH1 had already progressed to ESRD at the time of diagnosis. There are no approved therapies for the treatment of PH1 and the current standard of care is burdensome to patients and their families. Disease management is based on suppo rtive measures, including high fluid intake and crystallization inhibitors to increase urinary oxalate solubility, and treatment of disease complications such as urinary tract stones and infections in"
32,page_32,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 32 those that do not yet have ESRD. Pyridoxine can normal ize hepatic oxalate production (and consequently urinary oxalate ) in a small subset (~5%) of patients .[Hoppe 2010 ] Dietary modification plays a minor role in treatment since endogenous oxalate production far exceeds dietary intake in patients with PH1. Patients progressing to, or presenting with ESRD, require intense dialysis replacement therapy. Dialysis is not viewed as an effective therapy for PH1, but rather serves as a step in the clinical course toward a liver -kidney transplant or as an alternative to no therapy at all. Dialysis is often inadequate to effectively offload accumulating oxalate, and systemic oxalosis with end organ damage may develop despite this burdensome treatment. Dialysis regimens for PH1 are typically more frequent than conventional dialysis, predisposing to increased risk of complications. Combined liver -kidney transplantation offers potentially curative therapy, but is limited due to restricted availability, complications associated with the procedure, ethical considerations in resource -poor settings [Cochat 2013 ], and intense use of health care resources. PH1, over time, develops into a serious, severely debilitating disease with significant morbidity and mortality which have a profoundly negative impact on quality of life. In renally impaired patients, plasma oxalate saturation and persistent deposition across multiple organs leads to systemic o xalosis manifestations. Given the clinical course and characteristics of PH1 disease progression, it is reasonable to expect that decreases in hepatic oxalate production may result in clinical benefit in PH1 patients with advanced renal disease. Limited and burdensome management options for PH1 outlined above highlight the serious unmet need for a safe and efficacious treatment for all patients with this devastating disease, regardless of renal function . 1.2. Lumasiran Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponso r) is developing lumasiran (ALN -GO1), an investigational agent comprised of a synthetic, small interfering RNA (siRNA) (drug substance ALN -65585) covalently linked to a triantennary N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand, designed to target liver hydroxyaci d oxidase 1 ( HAO1) mRNA, blocking production of glycolate oxidase (GO) and hence reducing hepatic oxalate production, which is the underlying cause of the morbidity and mortality associated with PH1. Lumasiran is currently in development for treatment of PH1 in infants, pediatric, and adult patients. A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of lumasiran is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.2.1. Summary of Nonclinical Data with Lumasiran The pharmacology, safety pharmaco logy, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of lumasiran were evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies. Lumasiran was pharmacologically active in all tested species. Subcutaneous (SC) administration of lumasira n demonstrated potent, dose -dependent pharmacologic activity resulting in reduced hepatic HAO1 mRNA levels with the expected increases in glycolate levels in wild -type and diseased animals and subsequent reductions in urinary oxalate in diseased animals."

The nonclinic al toxicology program for lumasiran includes a repeat -dose exploratory toxicology study in rats, and a series of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) studies, which include developmental and reproductive studies in rats and rabbits, a pilot study in juvenile rat s, and repeat -dose studies of up to 25 - and 36 -weeks in duration in rats and nonhuman primates, respectively. To support inclusion of pediatric patients, the GLP repeat -dose rat studies were initiated with post -weaning animals that were 4 to 5 weeks old. Additionally, a GLP -compliant pilot neonatal and juvenile rat toxicology study in the rat that was initiated in postnatal -day 4 pups, and continued through postnatal -day 33, did not identify any evidence of potential developmental safety concerns due to e ither the toxicology or pharmacology of lumasiran. Notably , an in vitro study using human hepatocyte showed that infants have similar ASGPR mRNA and protein levels as adults, indicating that siRNA uptake into the liver will not be influenced by age. In addition, the PK and PD evaluations of lumasiran and two additional siRNAs in subtotal nephrectomy model in rats, where 5/6th of the kidney s was removed to mimic severe renal impairment, showed no meaningful differences in plasma or liver PK, and no differe nces in PD in rats with and without nephrectomy. The results of these nonclinical toxicology studies demonstrate a favorable safety profile for lumasiran and supports the use of lumasiran in the planned pivotal clinical studies in pediatric (as young as full-term neonates) and adult patients with PH1. A summary of nonclinical studies is included in the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.2.2. Summary of Clinical Data with Lumasiran Lumasiran is being investigated in 4 clinical studies, 3 of which are currently ongoing. Study ALN -GO1 -001 is a Phase 1/2 study, and was completed in 2 parts (single -ascending dose [SAD; Part A] and multiple -ascending dose [MAD; Part B]), in healthy adult subjects and adult and pediatric patients (≥ 6 years old) with PH1. In this study, heal thy adult subjects in Part A were randomized to receive a single -blind dose of lumasiran (0.3 -6.0 mg/kg) or placebo (6:2). In Part B, patients ≥6 years of age with PH1 and preserved renal function (eGFR >45 mL/min/1.73 m2) were randomized 3:1 to receive s ingle -blind doses of lumasiran or placebo at 1.0 mg/kg monthly for 3 doses, 3.0 mg/kg monthly for 3 doses, or 3.0 mg/kg every -3-months for 2 doses. Patients in Part B on placebo transitioned to the open -label portion of the study to receive lumasiran. Available preliminary data from Study ALN -GO1 -001 demonstrate a mean maximal reduction in 24-hour urinary oxalate of 64% (Cohorts 1 to 3) and achievement of normal to near -normal levels of urinary oxalate (<0.7 mmol/24h/1.73 m2) in patients dosed with lumasiran (range: 0.29 to 0.67 mmol/24h/1.73 m2). This suppression of urinary oxalate was maintained with repeat dosing, indicative of the durability of the pharmacodynamic effect of lumasiran. In addition, in the multiple -ascending dose group (Part B ; n=10), preliminary data showed a mean reduction of 59% in plasma oxalate relative to baseline 28 days after the last dose . The mean maximal reduction in plasma oxalate was 75% (range 57 -94%), and 50% of patients achieved plasma oxalate levels within the no rmal range (<1.6 μmol/L)."

In the ALN -GO1 -001 and ALN -GO1 -002 clinical studi es, available data indicate that lumasiran has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile across all dosing regimens with no drug -related serious adverse events (SAEs) or study discontinuations attributed to drug administration. Additional detailed in formation on the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of lumasiran is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.3. Study Design Rationale Elevated oxalate is the direct cause of disease pathology (kidney stones, renal failure, and systemic oxalosis) in patients with PH1 , and can be evaluated as plasma oxalate level , plasma oxalate AUC between dialysis sessions , urinary excretion of oxalate , and measures of systemic oxalosis . As discussed in Section 1.2.2 , meaningful reductions in urinary oxalate excretion were seen in the Phase 1/2 study, ALN -GO1 -001. In addition to reducing urinary oxalate, l umasiran is expected to significantly lower plasm a oxalate levels in patients with renal impairment based on the observed decrease in plasma oxalate levels in clinical studies of patients with preserved renal function. PH1 patients with advanced renal disease (eGFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2), who have severe u nmet medical need, are also expected to meaningfully benefit from decreased hepatic oxalate production , regardless of whether or not on dialysis therapy . The majority of PH1 patients in the United States present in early childhood and many progress to ren al failure by early adulthood. Up to 26% of PH1 patients present with severe infantile disease and can develop end stage renal disease (ESRD) as early as 4 to 6 months of age. [Harambat 2010 ; Hopp 2015 ] Therefore, it is justified to study the effect of lumasiran in a PH1 population with advanced renal disease , ranging from full term infants to adults . The weight -based dosing regimen of this study, for PH1 patients with advanced renal disease, is similar to those being studied (studies ALN -GO1 -003, ALN -GO1 -004) in PH1 patients of the same age range as this study, with less advanced renal disease and is described in Section 5.2.2 . Preclinical and clinical data indicate renal impairment does not influence the systemic exposure , PD, or safety of siRNA compounds (see Section 1.4). This study will evaluate PH1 patients with advanced renal disease in separate cohorts to account for differences in patients who do not yet require dialysis (Cohort A) vs patients who are currently on a dialysis maintenance regimen (Cohort B). The objectives and endpoints reflect the differences in clinical management between cohorts during both the Primary Analysis Period (Baseline to 6 months) and the Long -term Ext ension Period (Month 6 to End of Study; 54 months total). The primary objective of plasma oxalate reduction applies to both cohorts. Also, the following can be measured regardless of dialysis dependence status and objectives are the same for both cohorts : evaluation of growth parameters and developmental milestones (in children <6 years of age), quality of life, caregiver resource use, patient/caregiver experiences on lumasiran , antidrug antibodies (ADA), and additional PD parameters of plasma and urinary glycolate. In addition, to further evaluate the effect of lumasiran on disease progression, measures of systemic oxalosis will be assessed across multiple organ systems , ie, cardiac, dermatologic, skelet al, and ocular ."
35,page_35,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 35 Multiple samples will be collected for evaluation of plasma oxalate level (in both cohorts) and 2 separate plasma oxalate profile assessments (in Cohort B only, to calculate AUC between dialysis sessions ) will be performed during Screening to establish robust baseline measurements of the primary and secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint is an objective laboratory assessment and not subject to bias. D ue to the combination of patient heterogeneity of a population spanning full term infan ts to adults, heterogeneity of disease characteristics in the broad age range, and the ultra-rare orphan population, a single -arm design is employed for this study. Lumasiran is currently being investigated in 4 separate clinical studies comprising infant, pediatric and adult populations of patients with PH1 who have relatively preserved renal function with regard to oxalate excretion by the kidneys . In this study, lumasiran will be evaluated in PH1 patients of all ages with advanced renal disease, including patients on dialysis. Enrolling infants and young pediatric patients in this study is acceptable given that lumasiran has been well tolerated in children ≥6 years old, and PH1 can present as a pediatric disease with life - threatening consequences as early as infancy, with particularly high unmet medical need in this subpopulation with impaired renal function . 1.4. Dose Rationale Contribution of Renal Pathway on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Lumasiran Preclinical and clinical data indicat e the renal pathway is a minor elimination route for lumasiran, consistent with the renal excretion properties of 5 other siRNAs with similar physiochemical properties, as detailed below. Hence it is considered that the weight -based dose regimen should be the same regardless of degree of renal function . A preclinical rat model of renal impairment using lumasiran and 2 additional GalNac conjugated siRNAs showed that renal impairment does not influence the systemic exposure of siRNA , liver PK, or PD (Table 8). The preclinical study used nephrectomized (subtotal nephrectomy) rats, where 5/6th of the kidney s was removed to mimic severe renal impairment. Urinary excretion of siRNAs was reduced to approximately 1% in rats with nephrectomy relative to the 5% renal excretion seen in rats without nephrectomy. However, no meaningful differences were observed in the plasma concentrations, liver PK, and PD of the siRNAs in rats with and without subtotal nephrectomy . Thus, the preclinical study results infer that renal excretion plays a minor role in the disposition of siRNA molecules and that moderate to severe ren al impairment does not influence the liver concentration and activity of these molecules."

The contribution of renal excretion to total plasma clearance of lumasiran in humans is low (<25%) . This is similar to the renal excretion profiles of other GalNAc conjugated siRNA molecules. The low urinary recovery is attributable to the short plasma circulation time (about 24 hours) for these GalNAc conjugated molecules, including lumasiran. The GalNAc on lumasiran binds to abundantly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptors on hepatocytes leading to highly efficient and rapid uptake of lumasiran from the plasma into hepatocytes. Consequently, plasma concentrations decline rapidly to less than the lower limi t of quantitation within 24 to 48 hours postdose. In addition, a dedicated renal impairment study of a similar GalNAc conjugated siRNA molecule showed that urinary drug excretion accounted for 13.3%, 13.7%, 6.68%, and 3.16 % of that administered study drug in subjects with normal renal function and those with mild, moderate, and severe renal function, respectively . The urine PK data in renal impairment subjects show a small reduction in the already low urinary excretion of siRNA compounds, which suggest up to a 10% increase in liver exposure can be expected in subjects with severe renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. This indicates that the influence of renal impairment on liver exposures is minimal; hence no major difference in p harmacodynamics is expected in renal impairment patients. Weight -based Dose Regimen Lumasiran liver concentration is the sole driver of the pharmacodynamic properties of lumasiran, therefore, change in body weight and liver size particularly during infan cy and early childhood (<6 years of age) were considerations that went into dose regimen selection. The weight -based dosing regimen for this study was informed by preclinical and clinical data of lumasiran ( Section 1.2), preclinical data of similar GalNAc conjugated siRNAs, and results of"
37,page_37,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 37 PK/PD modeling and simulation which considered differences in body weight, liver growth, and metabolic rates. Data from Study ALN -GO1 -001 Parts A and B in healthy subjects and PH1 patients and associated PK/PD modeling were used to support dose selection in adults and children ≥20 kg body weight . The urinary oxalate reductions observed in PH1 patients serve as an indicator of suppression of hepatic oxalate production. P opulation PK/PD modeling demonstrated dose dependent oxalate reductions over the dose range (1.0 to 6.0 mg/kg continuous once monthly or once every 3 months SC administrations), with diminishing add itional effect predicted with higher doses consistent with an asymptotic rather than linear dose-response relationship. For a given dose level, the PK/PD model indicated that monthly administration leads to a more rapid decline in urinary oxalate levels r elative to dosing every 3 months. Thus, a lumasiran dosing regimen of 3.0 mg/kg once monthly for 3 loading doses total followed by 3.0 mg/kg once every 3 months was selected for PH1 patients ≥20 kg body weight regardless of renal function status or degree of renal impairment. The modeling and simulation approach in infants and young children considered the changing rate of body weight and relative liver size in this population. The body weight of children nearly triples during the first year of life incr easing from a median weight of 3.5 kg at birth to about 10 kg at 1 year of age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Growth Chart [Kuczmarski 2002 ]). Subsequently, the annual rate of body weight gain decr eases to about 20% per year up to 6 years of age. Furthermore, published reports and data from the United States National Centers for Health Statistics indicate children have proportionally larger liver size relative to body weight compared to adults. [CDC 2018 ; Johnson 2005 ] For an individual in the 0 to 1 year, 1 to 6 years, and 6 years of age categories, the mean liver weight as a percentage of body weight were 3.5%, 2.9%, and 2.0%, res pectively, indicating that younger children are expected to have lower hepatocyte drug concentrations at a given dose level. Moreover, based on allometric principles, children have faster drug clearance and drug clearance decreases with increasing weight. Thus, considering the rapid growth rate, higher relative liver size, and faster drug clearance, children require a higher mg/kg dose to achieve similar systemic concentration and target suppression. It should be noted that although the mg/kg dose is hig her in younger patients, the absolute amount (mg) of lumasiran administered is small due to the lower body weight in these younger patients. Body weight categories for dose selection in this study were determined using CDC growth chart data. Based on PK/P D modeling and simulation, for children with body weight <10 kg, the regimen is 6.0 mg/kg monthly × 3 doses (loading) followed by 3.0 mg/kg monthly (maintenance). For children and adults with body weight ≥10 kg, the regimen consists of a combination of an initial monthly loading dose for the first 3 months, followed by a quarterly maintenance regimen thereafter , as described in Table 9, which also shows the predicted glycolate oxidase suppression per body weight category . At steady state, these dose regimens are expected to achieve approximately 90% target suppression and reduce hepatic oxalate production to normal or near normal levels . Because renal function is a minor pathway for the elimination of lumasiran, the lumasiran dosing regimen in patients with advanced renal impairment will be the same as in patients with normal renal function."

The physicochemical properties of lumasiran and the available preclinical, clinical, PK, PD, and safety data indicate renal impairment is not expected to influence the systemic exposure, PD, safety, or efficacy properties of lumasiran. Based on these findings the Sponsor has determined that no dose adjustment is required in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, and the weight -based regimen described in this study is therefore appropriate for patients of all ages with advanced renal disease . 1.5. Benefit -Risk Assessment PH1 is a rar e autosomal recessive disease characterized by excessive oxalate production by the liver leading to excessive urinary oxalate and varying types and degrees of renal disease, progressing to end -stage renal disease. Systemic accumulation of calcium oxalate results in severe end -organ damage. Without treatment, the disease progresses, and patients die from end - stage renal disease and/or complications of systemic oxalosis. Lumasiran is designed to reduce hepatic production of oxalate. Based on the available data from nonclinical studies and the Phase 1/2 clinical study ALN -GO1 -001, lumasiran, administered subcutaneously, demonstrated a potent, dose -dependent inhibition of glycolate oxidase resulting in decreased urinary oxalate and increased plasma and urinar y glycolate. Unlike oxalate, glycolate is highly soluble and readily excreted in the urine. Thus, by reducing the production of oxalate, lumasiran is expected to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of PH1 and alter the clinical course in patients across th e spectrum of disease, irrespective of age, disease stage, and status of dialysis dependence. Based on the available safety data from the Phase 1/2 clinical study, lumasiran has been well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. Most adverse events (AEs ) have been mild or moderate in severity. There have been no severe or serious adverse events related to study drug. Transient, mild injection site reactions (ISRs) have been observed but have not resulted in any treatment discontinuations. No clinicall y significant laboratory or hematologic changes have been observed. Given the biological target of lumasiran , the available nonclinical and clinical data, and mode of administration, important potential risks for lumasiran are injection site reactions and liver function test abnormalities. During the study, patients will be closely monitored, including evaluation of injection sites, laboratory monitoring for liver function test abnormalities, along"

Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately (see Section 6.5.6.7 for reporting and follow -up of pregnancy). A positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the stud y drug. If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section 6.5.6 . When a patient di scontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Invest igator judgement, as applicable. Patients who discontinue from study drug during the 6 -month primary analysis period (defined as the time the first dose of study drug is administered on Study Day 1 through completion of the Month 6 assessments) will be enc ouraged to remain on the study and complete assessments (including 24 -hour urine collections, but excluding PK assessments) through Month 6 (see Table 1). They will also be asked to complete safety follow -up visits, once every 3 months, per the safety follow -up schedule (see Table 3 or Table 4) for up to 12 months after the last dose of lumasiran. Patients who discontinue study drug after Month 6 will be asked to return for their next scheduled visit to complete early termination (ET) assessments and complete safety follow -up visits, once every 3 months, per the safety follow -up schedule (see Table 3 or Table 4) for up to 12 months after the la st dose of lumasiran. 4.3.2. Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation 4.3.2.1. Patient or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study A patient or their legal guardian may stop participation in the study at any time. A patient or legal guardian considering stopping p articipation in the study prior to the Month 6 visit should be informed that the patient can discontinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study to complete their study assessments, through the Month 6 visit, including follow-up, or alternatively may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient or legal guardian consents as described in Section 4.3.1 . If a pa tient or legal guardian still chooses to discontinue study drug and stop participation prior to the completion of the 6 -month treatment period, every effort should be made to conduct early the assessments scheduled to be performed at the Month 6 visit (see Table 1)."
47,page_47,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 47 If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient appropr iate procedures for stopping participation in the study. Data collected from the patient can continue to be used, in countries where permitted. In addition, in the countries where the collection and processing of the patient data is based on the patient c onsent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process his/her data (see Section 4.3.2.2 ), as applicable, patient data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases) can be included after withdrawal of consent, where a vailable and allowable by local law. 4.3.2.2. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data Where allowed by local law, the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, and use biological samples and, as applicable, other personal data, informing the study doctor at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required. The Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samp les until the time of withdrawal) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as applicable, further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements. 4.3.2.3. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are best maintained if all enrolled patients continue stud y assessments and follow -up through Month 6 even if study drug is discontinued. Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section 8.1.6 . 4.3.2.4. Recording Reason for Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will be mad e to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section 6.5.6 . 4.3.3. Lost to Follow -Up A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the clinical study center. The following actions must be taken if a patient misses a required study visit: • The s ite must attempt to contact the patient or legal guardian and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient or legal guardian on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the patient or legal guard ian wishes [for the patient] to continue in the study, and/or should continue in the study."

These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record. • Should the patient or legal guardian continue to be unreach able, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study. • For patients who are lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee should search publicly available records (where permitted and allowed by local law) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients Patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study prior to Month 6 may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion. Patients who crossover from Cohort A to Cohort B due to progressing to dialysis prior to Month 6 also may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion . Patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study after Month 6 will not be replace d. 5. TREATMENTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS 5.1. Treatments Administered Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. Study drug that has been dispensed and returned unused must not be re -dispensed. 5.2. Study Drug Detailed information describing the preparation, administration, and storage of lumasiran is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 5.2.1.

Patients with weight increases crossing the threshold for the next weight -based dosing category (<10 kg to ≥10 kg or <20 kg to ≥20 kg) will follow the new dosing regimen for the remainder of the study or until the n ext dosing category threshold is reached (ie, patients will not switch back to the lower -weight dosing schedule if their body weight subsequently decreases). Patients in maintenance dosing who transition from <10 kg to ≥10 kg will continue to receive month ly doses at 3.0 mg/kg until the next visit that coincides with Table 4, whereby they will follow every -3-months dosing as per Table 4 until the end of the study. If a patient does not receive a dose of lumasiran within the specified dosing window, the Investigator should conta ct the Medical Monitor. After such consultation, the dose may be administered or considered missed and not administered. If a patient misses multiple consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss whether the p atient will be able to continue the study (see Section 4.3). Additional details can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. In addition, instructions and procedures related to the administration of lumasiran by a patient or caregiver will be provided in the Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Instructions. 5.2.3. Dose Modifications Dose modifications are not permitted. If a study drug -related AE occurs in a patient that the Investigator judges as presenting a potential risk to the patient for further dosing, the study drug dose may be held at the discretion of the Investigator and the Medical Monitor should be contacted. 5.2.3.1. Liver Function Test Criteria for Wi thholding, Monitoring and Stopping Lumasiran Dosing 1. Liver function test (LFT) results (see Table 13) are to be obtained within 7 days prior to dosing and results are to be reviewed prior to each dose of lumasiran. During periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site and healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes and LFT assessments are not feasible within 7 days prior to the dose, LFT test results up to 6 weeks prior to the planned monthly dose or up to 4 months prior to the planned quarterly dose may be reviewed to determine whether the dose can be administered. Consult the Laboratory Manual for the blood draw priority list based on patient weight. Central laboratory results are preferable. If not available, local laboratory results may be used; however, if a local assessment is drawn, a serum chemistry sample mus t also be drawn for analysis at the central laboratory . 2.

Dose adjustments for interval weight gain are permitted. Patients should avoid high dose vitamin C preparations within 4 days prior to oxalate assessments. Patients may be treated for PH1 according to local standard of care and dialysis mai ntenance as determined by treating physician. Patients should continue their current standard of care and dialysis regimen, including hyperhydration, crystallization inhibitors, and/or pyridoxine therapy at least until the Month 6 visit. Changes in dialy sis regimen may be permitted only if medically indicated. Standard of care treatment may be adjusted after Month 6 in accordance with clinical judgement. If pyridoxine therapy is discontinued, pyridoxine levels should be assessed for at least the next 2 timepoints indicated in the Schedules of Assessments (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). Consultation with the Medical Monitor is required if treated with any new emerging products. For other permitted concomitant medications administered subcutaneously, do not administer in same injection site area as the study drug, for at least 7 days after the last dose of study drug. Any concomitant medication that is req uired for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the Investigator. However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the CRF. Concomitant medication will be coded using an internat ionally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 5.4. Treatment Compliance Compliance with study drug administration will be verified by study staff. 5.5. Other Requirements 5.5.1. Contraception Females of child -bearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective method of contraception from 14 days before first dose, throughout study participation, and for 90 days after last dose administration or until study completion. Pediatric/adolescent female patients must initiate one of the birth control methods below, w hich includes true abstinence, at menarche or must discontinue study drug. Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include: • Placement of an intrauterine device. • Placement of an intrauterine hormone -releasing system. • Bilateral tubal o cclusion. • Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). • Established use of oral (except low -dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception."
54,page_54,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 54 • True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovul ation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent patients must agree to use one of the above -mentioned contraceptive methods if they start heterosexual relationships during the study and f or up to 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. Females of child -beari ng potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or begin menarche over the course of the study), and who are not postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy). A postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the postmenopausal range. For male patients, no contraception is required. However, use by ado lescent males of contraception (condom) may be required in some countries, eg, France, in order to comply with local requirements as described in the corresponding patient informed consent forms. Males with partners of child -bearing potential must agree t o use a condom throughout study participation and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug or until study completion . Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by the Investigator throughout the course of the study. The Investigator will ensure that adolescent patients, and their legal representatives if applicable, are adequately inf ormed about contraceptive requirements and the need for contraception once a patient initiates heterosexual intercourse. The need for contraception and compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed at every visit for adolescent patients, and pregnancy testing will be performed before every dose for postmenarcheal females throughout the course of the study (see Section 6.5.5.2 ). 5.5.2. Dietary Restrictions Patients should refrain from consumption of foods with high oxalate content, including, but not limited to, chocolate, rhubarb, spinach, and beet root, for 1 week prior to assessments of urinary and plasma oxalate . 6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS The schedules of study assessments are provided in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4. Additional information on the collection of study assessments will be detailed in the Study Manual. Urine collection assessments are not required for patients who are anuric (ie, produce <100 ml per day ). Where applicable country and loca l regulations and infrastructure for home healthcare allow, home healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical trial site to perform study assessments , which may include collection of blood and urine sample s, measure ment of vital"

Screening Assessments The Investigator will notify the Sponsor before screening pa tients to allow an assessment of the ability of the site or any new trial participant to comply with the protocol given COVID -19 limitations. An informed consent form (ICF) or assent form in the case of patients under the age of legal consent that has been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) must be signed by the patient (or legal guardian if under the age of legal consent) before the Screening procedures are initiated. All patients (or their lega l guardians if under the age of legal consent) will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF and/or assent form. In the case when a patient reaches the legal age of consent during the study, the Investigator must obtain the patient’s informed consent , and assent if applicable, prior to performing any further study interventions and/or procedures involving that patient (see Section 8.1.1 ). Patients will be screened to ensure that they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 4.1 and Section 4.2). Rescreening of patients is permitted with consultation of the Medical Monitor (see Section 6.1.2 ). Patient demographic data and medical history/disease history will be obtained. Non -serious events occurring after signing of the ICF and prior to study drug administration will be captured as medical history. Any changes to medical history occurring between the screening assessment and Day 1 will be updated prior to study drug administration. A blood sample for AGXT mutation analysis will be collected during Screening for patients who do not have documented PH1 genetic analysis to confirm eligibility. For all patients who are not anuric, single -void urine samples (in triplicate) will be collected during screening to establish baseline. Also, in patients who are able to produce urine, 24 -hour collections will be performed during Screening to establish baseline urinary oxalate levels (Section 6.1.2 ). The timing of samples collected durin g Screening for plasma oxalate and plasma glycolate will be as shown in Figure 1. The three most recent screening plasma oxalate samples collected prior to Day 1, which may include the pre -dialysis sample from the plasma oxalate profile collection for Cohort B patients, will be used to assess eligibility. If all 3 plasma oxalate assessments are obtained >60 days prior to Day 1, one additional plasma oxalate will be performed (at least 7 days prior to Day 1). For subjects in Cohort B, there must be 2 separate plasma oxalate profile assessments performed during Screening, performed at least 1 week apart. If a patient’s stable dialysis regimen at the time of con sent is interrupted during screening for ≤14 days, plasma oxalate levels should not be collected until the prior dialysis regimen has resumed for at least 2 weeks. If a patient’s stable dialysis regimen at the time of consent is"

Echocardiogram and ECG will be repeated if obtained 60 or more days prior to Day 1. 6.2. Efficacy Assessments The efficacy of lumas iran will be assessed in all patients in bo th cohorts by evaluating changes in plasma oxalate levels ; and plasma oxalate profile assessment in Cohort B only (Section 6.2.1 ); urinary oxalate (in non -anuric patients, Section 6.2.2 ), and measures of systemic oxalosis (Section 6.2.3 ). In Cohort A patients, all blood and urine samples will be collected predose, when applicable. In Cohort B patients with a dialysis session on the day of dosing, samples will be collected prior to the dialysis session. The efficacy of lumasiran on renal function will be assessed by eGFR (Section 6.3.4 ). Change in the frequency and mode of dialysis will be assessed (Section 6.5.5.5 ). In both cohorts, change in levels of urinary and plasma glycolate will be assessed. 6.2.1. Plasma Oxalate Plasma oxalate levels will be assessed from blood samples collected in all patients ; levels will be measured via central laboratory using a validated assay. The collection timing during Screening is detailed by cohort in Figure 1. During the treatment period, s amples will be collected as specified in the Schedules of Assessments (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4) and i n Table 6. 6.2.1.1. Cohort A In Cohort A patients, plasma oxalate levels will be assessed via blood samples collected throughout the study as specified in the Schedules of Assessments (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). The three most recent screening plasma oxalate samples collected prior to Day 1 will be used to assess eligibility ; see Section 6.1 and Figure 1. 6.2.1.2. Cohort B Plasma Oxalate Level In Cohort B patients, plasma oxalate levels will be assessed via pre -dialysis blood samples collected throughout the study as specified in the Schedules of Assessments. From Screening to Day 1 , at least 4 pre-dialysis blood sample s obtained at least 7 day s apart over the span of at least 28 days will be collected to assess eligibility . Up to 2 of the blood samples may originate from the pre -dialysis samples collected at the beginning of the plasma oxalate profile assessments performed during Screening (described below) . See Figure 1. Plasma Oxalate Profile Plasma oxalate profiles will be performed as specified in the Schedules of Assessments to permit calculation of the AUC between dialysis sessions . The plasma oxalate profile assessment consists of an overnight visit requiring collection of up to 8 blood samples for plasma oxalate over the course of a 24-hour span , dependent on b lood volume limitations and study center"
58,page_58,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 58 facilities ; blood sample collection schedule is described in Table 6, which includes collections before, during, and after the dialysis session. During Screening, t here will be 2 separate profile assessments performed at least 7 days apart . See Figure 1. During Screening, the blood sample timepoints described in Table 6 are relative to when d ialysis is performed. During the treatment period, the timepoints described in Table 6 are relative to dialysis or when the dose is administered , as specified . The 24 -hour postdose sample will be collected prior to beginning the next hemodialysis session, or 24 hours (±3 hours) postdose if there is no hemodialysis session on the day following dosing. In patients with ≥ 1 systemic oxalosis manifestation during the study, additional plasma oxalate profile assessments will be performed at the Month 36 and Month 48 visits , and blood sample collection timepoints are the same as described above . 6.2.2. Urinary Oxalate In patients in both Cohort A and Cohort B who ar e not anuric (ie, patients who are able to continue to produce urine ≥100 ml per day) and are able to complete the collection procedure, 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion will be assessed. Since not all patients will be able to provide 24-hour urine sampl es, single -void urine samples (in triplicate) will be collected throughout the study in all patients who are not anuric. Table 12 shows the 24 -hour uri ne collection procedure by study visit. In patients who are able to comply with 24 -hour urine collection procedures, urinary oxalate excretion will be determined from 24 -hour urine sample collections to be completed at the time points specified in the Sche dules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). Urinary oxalate concentrations will be analyzed centrally using a validated assay. 24 -hour urine collections in patients not undergoing dialysis must meet pre -specified validity criteria (see Section 6.2.2.1 ). For patients who are able to comply with the 24 -hour urine collection procedure, three 24 -hour urine collections will be sc heduled during screening to establish baseline urinary oxalate excretion. For Month 6, three 24 -hour urine collections will be scheduled within 14 days prior to dose to evaluate changes in oxalate concentrations over the 6 -month interval. A single 24 -hour collection will be scheduled at Month 3, Month 12 , and then every 6 months thereafter as specified in the Schedules of Assessments (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). In patients undergoing dialysis, the timing of the collections relative to patients’ weekly dialysis schedule should remain consistent for each patient, when possib le. Patients able to comply with 24 -hour urine collections will either bring a 24 -hour urine collection to the clinic, courier samples to the laboratory, or have their 24 -hour urine collected during an inpatient stay at the time of the study visit. All pat ients who are not anuric will have 3 single -void urine samples collected during Screening (first morning voids are preferred, when feasible). Following screening, single -void collections are performed within 7 days predose, as specified in the Schedules o f Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). Samples may be collected as an outpatient prior to the visit or collected during the study visit prior to dosing, as applicable."

Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be collected using standardized machines at the timepoints specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 ). During periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site, ECG assessments may be completed up to 2 months after the Month 3 timepoint, up to 5 months after the Month 6 timepoint, and up to 11 months after the Month 12 timepoint. 12-lead ECGs will be centrally read. 6.2.3.2. Dermatologic In cases where skin manifestation s due to systemic oxalosis are reported during the course of the study, (eg, patient presenting with skin lesion during physical examination) photographs of the lesions should be obtained. The Investigator may engage a local dermatologist’s opinion if required. When a skin manifestation of systemic oxalosis is observed, at each succeeding visit, photographs of the affected area will continue to be collected to record the resolution or worsening of the manifestation. Further details will be provided in th e study manual. 6.2.3.3. Skeletal Radiographs ( X-rays) of hands, hip, knee, and chest will be obtained and read centrally for features of skeletal oxalosis, where local IRB/IEC permits at the timepoints specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 ), whe re feasible based on patient compliance . During periods of tim e when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site, X-rays may be completed up to 1 month after Day 1, and up to 11 months after the Month 12 timepoint. Only a subset of these x-rays will be collected at selected study centers. In addition, a reading of bone age will be performed for patients who have not yet reached skeletal maturity. Results will be interpreted using a scale developed in conjunction with the central reading core laboratory, as detailed in the study manual. Optional bone scans will be performed in only Cohort B patients ≥18 years of age to assess calcium oxalate systemic deposition, where local IRB/EC permits and if patient consents to the bone scan. During periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemi c impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site, optional bone scans may be completed up to 1 month after Day 1, and up to 11 months after the Month 12 timepoint. 6.2.3.4. Ocular Ophthalmology The following ophthalmologic exams will be performed: Color Fundus Photography ( CFP), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), and , where available at select sites , Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF). Ophthalmologic exams with fundus photography will be standardized and the fundus photographs will be read centrally. OCT assessments will also be standardized and read centrally. For young children unable to cooperate , examinations will be optional. Anesthesia"

Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Where available, BCVA using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts will be assessed longitudinally throughout the course of the study to evaluate for changes which correspond to changes in retinal oxalate deposition. Exams will be standardized across applicable sites. In younger patients <6 years of age, alternate visual acuity testing per local standard practice may be performed (eg, LEA symbols) . In sites where ETDRS testing is not available, Snellen or LEA symbol charts may be used for BCVA. Testin g is not required in preverbal infants. 6.3. Renal Assessments and Additional Pharmacodynamic Measurements Renal assessments and additional pharmacodynamic assessments include: nephrocalcinosis as assessed by renal ultrasound (Section 6.3.1 ); frequency of renal stone events (Section 6.3.2 ); urine oxalate:creatinine ratio (in available urine collections; Section 6.3.3 ); and eGFR (Section 6.3.4 ). Glycolate concentrations may be collected at the same time as the plasma oxalate sample collection (Section 6.2.1 ) as specified for Screening ( Figure 1) and as per the Schedules of Assessments (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). Additional colle ctions may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator. In Cohort A patients, all samples will be collected predose, when applicable. In Cohort B patients with a dialysis session on the day of dosing, samples will be collected prior to the dialysis session. All PD assessments will be analyzed centrally. Details regarding the processing and aliquoting of samples for storage and analyses will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. Where local regulations allow, and infrastructure is in place, home nur sing may be used to collect urine and blood samples. 6.3.1. Renal Ultrasound Renal ultrasounds will be obtained locally, as specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4) when feasible ; anephric patients are exempt from renal ultrasound assessments . Renal ultrasound wil l be performed according to instructions provided in the Study Manual in a standardized manner. Renal ultrasounds will be reviewed centrally.

62,page_62,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 62 6.3.2. Renal Stone Events A renal stone event is defined as an event which includes at least one of the following: • Visit to healthcare provider (eg, outpatient clinic, urgent care, emergency department, procedure) because of a renal stone • Medication for r enal colic • Stone passage • Macroscopic hematuria due to a renal stone All relevant clinical information pertaining to the event should be obtained, including laboratory values, medical records, discharge summaries, and medical test results. Since renal sto ne events are recorded as an efficacy assessment for lumasiran, these will not be treated as AEs or SAEs. However, if a patient experiences other AEs or SAEs during a renal stone event, they should be reported (see Section 6.5.6.1 ). 6.3.3. Urinary Oxalate:Creatinine Ratio Urine oxalate:creatinine ratios will be calculated from the oxalate and creatinine levels measured in the available 24 -hour urine collecti ons to assess the PD effect of lumasiran on urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio. Urinary oxalate:creatinine ratios from single -void urine collections will also be measured. 6.3.4. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate In patients not undergoing dialysis, b lood sampl es for the assessment of eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) will be obtained at the time points specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). In patients ≥12 months to <18 years at consent, eGFR will be calculat ed based on the Schwartz Bedside Formula [Schwartz 2009 ] (Appendix 10.1). In patients ≥18 years of age at consent , eGFR will be calculated based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. [Levey 2009 ; Schwartz 2009 ] 6.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments Blood samples will be collected for assessment of lumasiran PK parameters and possible metabolite analysis (as necessary) at the time points in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). Plasma PK parameters, maximum plasma concentration (C max), time to maximum plasma concentration (t max), elimination half -life (t ½β), area under the concentration -time curve (AUC), apparent clearance (CL/F), and apparent volume of distri bution (V/F) , will be calculated for the lumasiran plasma concentration profiles. A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples for PK analysis in patients in Cohort A is provided in Table 5. In patients who are able to produce urine, a urine sample for PK analysis will be collected as on Day 1. Also, a detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples for PK analysis in Cohort B patients is provided in Table 6. Plasma oxalate profile assessment during Screening"
63,page_63,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 63 should be conducted as explained in Section 6.2.1 . PK and plasma oxalate blood samples should be collected before the start of the next dialysis session. In patients who are not on dialysis at c onsent but start dialysis prior to Month 6 visit, PK and plasma oxalates blood samples should be collected as per Table 6 at the next scheduled protocol assessment in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4) and then continue per the timepoints in Table 6 for the rest of the study. In addition, if an SAE occurs associated with dosing, an additional PK sample may be collec ted at 4 to 8 hours postdose on the day of dosing, where blood volume limits permit (see Section 6.5.5.4 ). Lumasiran plasma concentrations will be determined using a central laboratory with a validated assay. Details regarding sample volumes to be collected, sample processing , and shipping will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 6.5. Safety Assessments The assessment of safety during the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital signs, weight and heigh t/length, ECG findings, and laboratory tests. Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination will be recorded. 6.5.1. Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4) and include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate. On dosing days, vital signs will be measured predose. On Day 1 only, vital signs will also be measured 30 ± 10 minutes postdose. When vital signs and blood sample collecti on occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes, when feasible. Blood pressure should be taken using the same limb, when feasible. Body temperature in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, or axillary methods. Heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. Additional vital sign assessments, as medically indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice. Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF. 6.5.2. Weight and Height/Length Height and body weight measurements will be collected as specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4) and will be recorded in the eCRF. Height/length will be measured in centimeters. Standing height should be captured for patients ≥24 months old who are able to stand independently. Supine length should be captured for patients <24 months old or those unable to stand independently. All height/length measurements should be performed in triplicate for patients <18 years of age."
64,page_64,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 64 Body weight will be measured in kilograms. In patients <6 years of age, body weight will be obtained within 7 days of dosing. In Cohort B patients, body weight will be obtained post - dialysis. In patients ≥6 years of age, body weight collected within 3 months prior to the study drug dose or the predose weight collected on the study visit day or d osing day will be used for dose calculations (see Section 5.2.2 ). 6.5.3. Physical Examination Full and abbreviated physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). If a physical examination is scheduled for a dosing visit, it should be conducted prior to dosing. In Cohort B patients, the physical examination should be conducted after dialysis is completed. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointest inal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and neurological status. Abbreviated physical examinations will include examination of at least the following: respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems. If a visit is conducted offsite (eg, at the patient’s home), a body system assessment may be performed in lieu of a physical examination. Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on the medical history or AE eCRF as appropriate. Abnormal f indings from dermatological examinations will be recorded via photography (see Section 6.2.3.2 ). 6.5.4. Electrocardiogram Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be obtained predose, when applicable, as specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). Electrocardiograms may be completed up to 2 months after the Month 3 timepoint, up to 5 months after the Month 6 timepoint, and up to 11 months after the Month 12 t imepoint. 12-lead ECGs will be centrally read. When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the same time, ECGs should be performed before blood samples are drawn and when the patient is calm, if feasible. Qualified staff will review all ECGs to assess whether the results have changed since the Baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded on the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC adv ice. Recordings will be archived according to the Study Manual. ECGs will be utilized as secondary endpoints of the pharmacodynamic effect of lumasiran on systemic oxalosis, as described in Section 6.2.3.1 . 6.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory, except in cases where it is not feasible to perform all tests centrally due to blood draw volume limits, ie, in infants and very young patients, hematology, and biochemistry panels may be performed locally, with central laboratory confirmation of any abnormalities.

For any other unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice, until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately explain the abnormality. For any safety event or laboratory abnormality , additional laboratory assessments, imaging, and consultation may be performed for clinical evaluation and/or in consultation with the Medical Monitor; results may be collected and should be included in the clinical database. Clinical laboratory assessme nts are listed in Table 13 and will be assessed as specified in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical decisions, on the day of visit assessments, all laboratory assessments specified in Table 13 which are performed at a local laboratory should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory except in cases where it is not feasible to perform all tests centrally due to blood draw v olume limits, ie, in infants and very young patients. Central laboratory results (once available) should be used for subsequent clinical and dosing decisions in the case of discrepant local and central laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day. Consult the Laboratory Manual for the blood draw priority list based on patient weight (see Section 6.5.5.4 ). Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical site or at a location other than the clinical study center by a trained healthcare professional."

Dialysis Parameters Dialysis modality evaluations will be performed in all patients in Cohort B. To prevent potential confounding of study results for the primary analysis, e lective changes to dialysis regimen are not permitted during Screening or the 6 -month primary analysis period, ie, decreasing dialysis frequency in response to lowered plasma oxalate , or elective changes to dialysis frequency, duration, filter size or type , and blood flow . Changes in dialysis due to management of renal failure (eg, electrolyte content, fluid withdrawal settings), will be performed throughout the study according to Investigator judgement in consultation with the patient’s treating physician . Dialysis parameters may include, but are not limited to, duration and frequency. The dialysis regimen will be monitored according to the Schedules of Assessments (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). 6.5.6. Adverse Events 6.5.6.1. Definitions Adverse Event According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 CFR 312.32, IND Safety Reporting, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Renal stone events (as defined in Section 6.3.2 ) are recorded for efficacy assessment of lumasiran. These events will not be treated as AEs or SAEs. Other AEs or SAEs occurring during a renal stone event are reported. Serious Adverse Event An SA E is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death • Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death) • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect • Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensiv e treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse)."
70,page_70,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 70 Adverse Events of Clinical Interest The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: • Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3× upper limit of normal (ULN) • Severe or serious injection site reactions (ISRs); ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), or those that lea d to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of study drug. An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as may occur with swelling or hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site is not considered an ISR. For information on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section 6.5.6.2 and Section 6.5.6.3 , respectively. Adverse Event Severity AEs are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: Mild : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Moderate: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, pr eparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money). Severe: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden); OR life - threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to an AE. Changes in seve rity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of a n AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE)."
71,page_71,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 71 Relationship o f the Adverse Event to Study Drug The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by the Investigator by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug?” A “ yes” response indicates that the event is considered as related to the study drug. 6.5.6.2. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events Eliciting Adverse Events The patient or legal guardian should be asked about medically relevant changes in the patient’s health since the last visit. The patient or legal guardian should also be asked if the patient has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and over -the-counter). In addition to pati ent observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety. Recording Adverse Events The Investigator is responsible for reco rding non -serious AEs that are observed or reported by the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to study drug through the end of study. Non -serious AEs will be followed until the end of study. Even ts occurring after signing of the ICF and before study drug administration will be captured as medical history (see Section 6.1), while AEs that occur after study drug administration, and baseline events that worsen after study drug administration, must be recorded as AEs. The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient after the time when the informe d consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug through the end of study. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the pati ent is stable, as appropriate. All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug -related. Each AE must be described in detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). For SAEs, record the event(s) on both the eCRF and the SAE form. For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical inter est (see Section 6.5.6.1 ), the supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF should be completed. Additional clinical and laboratory information may b e collected. Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF. For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or Symptoms eCRF, recording ad ditional information regarding each injection site reaction that is entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom(s), injection site location, follow -up actions taken, etc )."

Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee For AEs that are considere d AEs of clinical interest (Section 6.5.6.1 ), the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within 24 hours using the appropriate eCRF. 6.5.6.4. Serious Adve rse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator. Any AE and laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section 6.5.6.1 must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center staff first learns of the event. All SAEs must be reported regardless of the re lationship to study drug. The initial report should include at least the following information: • Patient’s study number • Description and date of onset of the event • Criterion for serious • Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug, and • Investigator/s ite information To report the SAE, complete the eCRF and the SAE form. Within 24 hours of receipt of follow - up information, the Investigator must update the eCRF and the SAE form. SAEs must be reported using the contact information provided in the Study Manual. Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best medical judgment to treat the SAE. These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should be recorded. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by the Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or stable. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event. 6.5.6.5. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electron ic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 6.5.6.6. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Co mmittee Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) according to country requirements. Copies of each report and documentation of IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 6.5.6.7. Pregnancy Reporting If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through study completion, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of being notified of the"
73,page_73,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 73 pregnancy. Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form. The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the pregnancy, the po ssible effects on the fetus, and be counseled to not breastfeed for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the ou tcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE as outlined in Section 6.5.6.4 . 6.5.6.8. Overdose Reporting An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or intentionally) that exc eeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the protocol for the patient’s weight category. The Investigator will decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in consultation with the Sponsor. In the event of an o verdose, the actual dose administered must be recorded in the eCRF. All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor or designee. 6.5.7. COVID -19 Data Collection Information on the COVID -19 infection status of the pa tient, if known, and other information on the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the patient's participation in the study will be collected. 6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotyping, and Biospecimen Repository Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly spec ific targeting of investigational therapies based on genetic sequence. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence will result in variations in drug effect. More generally, genetic variations may account for the well-described heterogen eous manifestations of disease in patients with PH1, as well as their responses to treatment. Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval, and legal guardian consent (and patient assent, where applicable), samples will be colle cted as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further elucidate the outcomes of this study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or ef ficacy of lumasiran. Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedules of Assessment (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). Potential exploratory investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy or safety. The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety laboratory samples, PK samples, etc) that are obtained during the study."
74,page_74,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 74 These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After 10 years have elapsed, samples will be destroyed. Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shipping of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manua l. Exploratory analysis of these biospecimens will be performed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals or its designees. When biobanking is permitted by local regulation, study participants will be advised during the informed consent process of these biobanking detail s and the potential for exploratory investigation of their samples. 6.7. Developmental Assessments The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale will be assessed at the timepoints specified in the Schedules of Assessment ( see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4), and may be completed up to 4 months after the intended time point during periods of time when t he COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site, to assess the achievement of developmental milestones over time. This tool assesses the domains of communication, daily living skills, socialization, and motor skills. The survey can be completed by a legal guardian or caregiver in approximately 20 to 60 minutes. 6.8. Quality of Life Questionnaires For QOL instruments described below, they will be assessed where available, and all will be carried forward throughout the study duration as patient age advances to qualify for each succeeding age -specific instrument, as appropriate. The surveys and questionnaires described below will be completed at the timepoints specified in the Schedules of Assessments (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4) and may be completed u p to 4 months after the intended time point d uring periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site . 6.8.1. EQ-5D The EQ -5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of QOL outcome. [Herdman 2011 ] It consists of a questionnaire pertaining to 5 dimensions. There is also a visual analog scale, scoring of which is based on a visual scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginab le health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Higher scores indicate better health status. Patients ≥18 years of age at time of assessment will complete the EQ -5D adult version of the questionnaire using the 5-level (5L) value set, and patients ≥2 to <18 years of age at time of assessment will complete the youth version of this questionnaire, the EQ -5D-Y. Legal guardians may complete questionnaires on behalf of younger infant to pediatric patients, as appropriate. 6.8.2. PedsQL Peds -QL is a modular a pproach to measuring QOL in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. The PedsQL Generic Core Scales contain 23 items designed to measure core domains of health (physical, emotional, and social functioning) and"

Scores are summarized as Total Scale Score, Physical Health Summary Score, and Psychosocial Health Summary Score. The Total Scale Score, individual subscales of the generic and ESRD modules (parent and/or self -report versions) , and ESRD module total score will be assessed for this study. The PedsQL will be completed by patients ( or caregivers, as appropriate) who are ≥2 to <18 years of age at the time of consent . 6.8.3. KDQOL The Kidney Disease and Quality of Life (KDQOL -36) questionna ire is used to assess 3 core domains of kidney disease including: burden, symptoms/problems, and effects of kidney disease on daily life . The KDQOL subscales ( Burden of Kidney Disease , Effect of Kidney Disease on Daily Life , and Symptoms and Problems of Kidney Disease) , and the accompanying Short Form - 12 (SF-12) Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary will be assessed for this study. These will be completed by patients who are ≥18 years of age at the time of consent. 6.9. Patient/Caregiver Experience Surveys and Impact Questionnaires The surveys and questionnaires described below will be completed at the time points specified in the Schedules of Assessments (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4), and may be completed up to 4 months after the intended time point d uring periods of time when the COVID - 19 pandemic impedes the abi lity of patients to travel to the study site . 6.9.1. Patient Experience Survey The Patient Experience Survey assesses patients’ experience living with PH1, including their experience with PH1 treatments. Patients ≥13 years of age at screening will complete the s urvey unaided if they are able. If the patient is unable to complete the Patient Experience Survey alone, their caregiver or study site staff may complete the survey on behalf of the patient. If the patient is <13 years of age at screening, a caregiver w ill complete the Patient Experience Survey on behalf of the patient for as long as the patient remains under the legal age of consent. 6.9.2. Caregiver Experience Survey The Caregiver Experience Survey assesses the consequences of PH1 on caregivers of PH1 patien ts. Caregivers of patients under legal age of consent at the time of Screening will be asked to complete the Caregiver Experience Survey. For patients who reach the legal age of consent per local regulations during the study, caregivers will be encourage d to continue completing the survey, but are not required to do so. Caregivers of patients over the legal age of consent at the time of Screening will also be encouraged to complete the survey according to the Schedule of Assessments, but are not required to do so . 6.9.3. Patient and Caregiver Impact Questionnaire The patient and caregiver impact questionnaire will be used to assess impacts of PH1 on the patients’ lives, including their need to relocate/travel to receive treatment, the number an d type"

The questionnaire will also assess the impact on caregivers’ employment and/or education. Patients ≥13 years of age at screening will complete the questionnaire unaided if they are ab le. If the patient is unable to complete the survey alone, their caregiver or site staff may complete the survey on the patient’s behalf. If the patient is <13 years of age at Screening, a caregiver will complete the questionnaire on behalf of the patien t. For patients who reach the legal age of consent per local regulations during the study, and whose caregivers had previously completed the Patient Impact Questionnaire on their behalf, caregivers will be encouraged to continue completing the questionnai re, but are not required to do so. 6.10. Healthcare Resource Utilization Healthcare resource utilization will be assessed using patient or caregiver -reported information related to all hospitalizations, urgent healthcare visits, procedures and surgeries, and col lected as specified in the Schedules of Assessments (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). 7. STATISTICS A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before the dosing of the first patient in this study. The plan will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance with the principle features stated in the protocol. For information on study endpoints, see Section 2. 7.1. Determination of Sample Size The planned enrollment for the study is 20 patients, including at least 6 patients in each cohort. Of those 20 patients, t he planned enrollment includes 4 patie nts <6 years of age at consent , and 2 patients between ≥6 to <18 years of age at consent . The sample size was determined based on feasibility considerations, not power calculations. 7.2. Statistical Methodology Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptiv e. Summary statistics and by -patient listings/by - patient figures will be presented. Summaries for efficacy will be based on the Efficacy Analysis Set and safety endpoints will be based upon the Safety Analysis Set (Section 7.2.1 ). For categorical variables, summary tabulations of the number and percentage of patients within each category (with a category for missing data) will be presented. For c ontinuous variables, descriptive statistics will be presented (ie, number of patients, mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, minimum and maximum values). All data will be provided in by -patient listings. Additional data summaries to help under stand any impact of COVID -19 on efficacy and safety assessments will be outlined in the SAP. 7.2.1. Populations to be Analyzed The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows: • Safety Analysis Set: All patients who received any amount of lumasiran during the study."
77,page_77,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceut icals Confidential 77 • Efficacy Analysis Set: All patients who received any amount of lumasiran and have at least 1 valid plasma oxalate value at baseline and at the Month 3 assessment or beyond . • PK Analysis Set: All patients who received any amount of lumasiran have at least 1 postdose blood sample for PK parameters and have evaluable PK data . The primary population used to evaluate efficacy will be the Efficacy Analysis Set and safety will be the Safety Analysis Set. The PK Analysis Sets will be used to conduct PK analyses. 7.2.2. Examination of Subgroups Subgroup analyses may be conducted for selected endpoints. Detailed methodology will be provided in the SAP. 7.2.3. Handling of Missing Data Every effort will be made to minimize the amount of missing data in the study. Pa tients who discontinue the study prior to Month 6 will be encouraged to remain on study and complete their remaining clinical visits (excluding PK assessments) through the Month 6 visit and only safety follow -up visits afterwards. Details about handling o f missing data will be described in the SAP. 7.2.4. Baseline Evaluations Demographics and other disease -specific baseline characteristics will be summarized for the Safety Analysis Set . 7.2.5. Efficacy Analyses There will be a Primary Analysis Period for Cohort A, and s eparately for Cohort B. There will not be an interim analysis prior to at least 1 cohort completing the Primary Analysis Period. 7.2.5.1. Primary Endpoint In Cohort A patients, the p lasma oxalate baseline is defined as the mean of the last 4 plasma oxalate level v alues collected prior to the first dose of lumasiran. In Cohort B patients, the plasma oxalate baseline is similarly defined except that the values obtained from the plasma oxalate profile assessment visits will only include the first pre -dialysis sample collected per visit. The primary analysis is percent change from baseline in plasma oxalate (Cohort A) / pre -dialysis plasma oxalate (Cohort B) summarized Month 3 through Month 6 by cohorts. For patients who crossover from Cohort A at baseline to Cohort B before Month 6, due to initiation of dialysis between Day 1 and the Month 6 assessments, descriptive listing and figures will be provided. Percent change in plasma oxalate from baseline (pre -dialysis levels in Cohort B ) will be summarized through Month 6. Further details will be included in the SAP. 7.2.5.2. Secondary Endpoints Secondary endpoints will be analyzed and reported with by -patient listings and by -patient figures of actual values, change f rom baseline and percent change (where appropriate per endpoint) at"
78,page_78,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN-GO1-005 lumasiran Amendment 1, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 78 each visit (scheduled and unscheduled visits). Tabular summaries using descriptive statistics (mean, standard error, median, min, max) will be reported. For binary endpoints, the number and percentages of patients in each category will be displayed at each visit. Other subgroup analyses may be generated if applicable. For patients in Cohort B, the secondary endpoint of percent change from baseline in plasma oxalate AUC will be summarized through the Month 6 plasma oxalate profile assessment. Baseline plasma oxalate AUC measurement will be obtained via the plasma oxalate profile assessments prior to initial dosing, after the stab le dialysis regimen is established. Post- treatment AUC measurements will be obtained at the Month 3 and Month 6 plasma oxalate profile assessments. Long-term treatment effect of lumasiran will be summarized descriptively for the long-term extension period. Safety data will be summarized descriptively and presented in by-patient listings. Further details will be included in the SAP. 7.2.5.3. Exploratory Endpoints Details will be included in the SAP. 7.2.6.

RATIONALE FOR PROTOC OL AMENDMENT The purpose of this protocol amendment is to incorporate Urgent Safety Measures (USMs) that were communicated to investigators in a Dear Investigator Le tter dated 07 April 2020 to assure the safety of study participants while minimizing risks to study integrity amid the COVID -19 pandemic. These changes are in line with guidance from both the European Medicines Agency and the United States Food and Drug Ad ministration on the conduct of clinical trials during the COVID -19 pandemic. [EMA 2020; FDA 2020 ] This protocol amendment also incorporates the following changes that are not related to USMs. After ongoing review and assessment of t he safety data from studies conducted with lumasiran, modifications are designed to enhance patient safety, reduce patient burden regarding blood sampling, and clarify a study procedure pertaining to urine collection. These changes are summarized in Secti on 1.2 in Table 2 and will not be implemented until appropriate Health Authority and Ethics Committee ( EC) and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. 1.1. Urgent Safety Measures due to the Impact of the COVID -19 Pandemic The USM modifications and new procedures are outlined below, and a detailed summary of the protocol changes is provided in Section 2 (Table 1). These measures were to be adopted immediately by the Investigator site as specified in the Dear Investigator Letter . • Screening period (notification of new patients) The Investigator will notify the Sponsor before screening patients to allow an assessment of the ability of the site or any new trial participant to comply with the protocol given COVID -19 limitations. • Screening period and pl asma oxalate eligibility (expanded windows) To ensure adequate time to complete screening assessments, t he screening window will be expanded from 60 days to 120 days; screening assessments previously obtained within 120 days prior to Day 1 may be used. Ho wever, echocardiogram and ECG will be repeated if obtained 60 or more days prior to Day 1, and 1 additional plasma oxalate will be performed if all 3 plasma oxalate assessments were obtained 60 or more days prior to Day 1. The plasma oxalate repeat collec tion should occur at least 7 days before Day 1. The three most recent screening plasma oxalate samples collected prior to Day 1, which may include the pre -dialysis sample from the plasma oxalate profile collection for Cohort B patients, will be used to ass ess eligibility."
88,page_88,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 ALN -GO1 (lumasiran) Amendment 1 Summary of Changes, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 2 • Lumasiran dosing outside the study center by patient or caregiver Following appropriate training and after consultation with the Medical Monitor, d osing will be permitted at a location other than the study center ( eg, home) , by the patient or patient’s caregiver with the oversight of the Investigator, provided the patient has tolerated at least 1 dose of lumasiran administered in the clinic. In addition, references to patient/caregiver instructions for administration and storage of study drug are now included within the protocol . This measure is intended to remain in effect only during periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site and healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes for dosing. In order to assure uniform and comprehensive training and to assure compliance with the dosing instructions, the sponsor has prepared both Investigator and caregiver -facing written materials. The caregiver materials will provide detailed guid ance on the scope of the self -administration allowance and detailed instructions on procedures surrounding dosing. These materials serve as a supplement to virtual training that caregivers will receive. The site -facing materials outline the investigator re sponsibilities under the self - administration scheme and provide a guide to the expectations around caregiver training. In addition, investigators will make verbal contact with caregivers to assure compliance with protocol procedures and to assure that any adverse events or deviations are properly captured. • Study visit window Except for assessments with other specified timing requirements (as noted below), study assessments and dosing are to be performed within a visit window of ±14 days (previously ±7 days) for all patients through Month 6, and for patients who weigh <10 kg from Month 7 through the end of study, and within a visit window of ±28 days (previously ±14 days) for patients who weigh ≥10 kg from Month 7 through end of study. Study drug doses must be administered at least 21 days apart. • Assessment of adverse events, concomitant medications, renal stone events, and healthcare utilization In situations where a study visit is unable to be completed (either at the site or offsite by a healthcare profess ional visit), the study Investigator (or delegate) may verbally contact the patient within the expected study visit window to assess adverse events, concomitant medications, renal stone events, and healthcare utilization. • Liver function tests Liver functio n test (LFT) results are to be obtained within 7◦days prior to dosing and results are to be reviewed prior to each dose of lumasiran. During periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site and healthc are professionals to go to patients' homes, when LFT assessments are not feasible within 7 days prior to the dose, LFT test results up to 6◦weeks prior to the planned monthly dose or up to 4 months prior to the planned quarterly dose may be reviewed to determine whether the dose can be administered. LFTs from the Week 2 visit must be reviewed prior to administration of the Month 1 dose."
89,page_89,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -GO1 -005 ALN -GO1 (lumasiran) Amendment 1 Summary of Changes, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 3 This change in the window for LFT assessment is supported by data from our clinical trials . In the 75 patients with PH1 treated with lumasiran for a duration of up to 22 months, no clinically significant changes in LFTs due to lumasiran have been observed. Based on available data, lumasiran has an acceptable hepatic safety profile. • Time period to obtain weight for dose determination If the current procedure (weight obtained within 7 days or within 3 months prior to monthly or quarterly dose, respectively ) is not possible due to the COVID -19 pandemic impacting activities at the study site or patient ability to access the site, dose will be based on weight obtained within 6 weeks prior to dosing for patients who are <10 kg and within 4 months for patients who are ≥10 kg. For Cohort B patients, if a post dialysis weight taken at the study center is not available within the above specified timeframes, weight taken at the dialysis center may be used. • 24-hour urine sample collection To avoid risks associated with use of urinary catheters and prolonged hospitalization, the option to use catheterization for 24 -hour urine sample collection has been removed. • Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, and the Patient/Caregiver Experience and Impact Questionnaire The Vineland Behavior Scale, Quality of Life questionnaires, and Patient/Caregiver Experience and Impact questionnaires may be com pleted up to 4 months after the intended timepoint. • Systemic oxalosis assessments Broader windows will be applied for systemic oxalosis assessments: − 12-lead ECGs may be completed up to 2 months after the Month 3 timepoint, 5 months after Month 6 , and 11 m onths after Month 12 − Renal ultrasound s may be completed up to 1 month after Day 1, 5 months after Month 6 , and 11 months after Month 12 − Echocardiogram may be completed up to 5 months after Month 6, and up to 11 months after Month 12 − Radiographs, ophthalmo logy evaluation, and optional bone scan may be completed up to 1 month after Day 1 and up to 11 months after the Month 12 timepoint • Plasma oxalate profile Plasma oxalate profile samples can be collected up to 2 months after the Month 3 timepoint, up to 5 m onths after the Month 6 timepoint, and up to 11 months after the Month 12 timepoint. If a patient’s stable dialysis regimen at the time of consent is interrupted during screening for ≤14 days, plasma oxalate levels should not be collected until the prior d ialysis regimen has resumed for at least 2 weeks."

If a patient’s stable dialysis regimen at the time of consent is permanently changed during screening, plasma oxalate should not be collected until the new dialysis regimen has been established for at least 4 weeks. Any plasma oxalate profiles and pre -dialysis plasma oxalate samples collected prior to this point will not be used for the study. A total of 2 plasma oxalate profiles and a pre -dialysis plasma oxalate sample need to be collected AFTER the new stable dialysis regimen has been established for at leas t 4 weeks. The sampling times for plasma oxalate profile samples in protocol Table 6 are listed relative to dosing. If plasma oxalate profile samples are taken on a non -dosing day, these times (2:00, 4:00, 8:00, 12:00 and 24:00 hours post -dose) should correspond to the end of dialysis. • Assessments required to be performed in clinic Where applicable country and local re gulations and infrastructure allow for home healthcare, healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical trial site to perform study assessments including blood and urine collection, vital signs, weight, administration of study drug, an abbr eviated physical examination/body system assessment , and a height/length measurement . • Pregnancy tests Given the expanded use of offsite dosing, p regnancy tests will be permitted at an offsite location (eg, home) by a healthcare professional or the patient /patient’s caregiver at all timepoints as of Month 1. • Pharmacokinetic assessments In situations where the full PK profile (2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours post -dose plasma PK samples) cannot be drawn on the Day 1 visit, PK samples should be collected at 2, 4, a nd 24 hours. The next full PK profile will be drawn at Month 6 with a window of ±3 months. • Impact of COVID -19 Information related to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on patient participation in the study will be collected for each patient. Additional i nformation regarding collection of this information, including completion of a new CRF specific to COVID -19, will be provided separately. This change is implemented to enable analysis of the impact of the COVID -19 global pandemic on clinical trial data. • Updates to study administration text Text was updated to provide clarification of Investigator responsibilities regarding communication of new study information to patients and IRB/IECs."

Changes Not Related to Urgent Safety Measures Additional changes to study conduct (outlined below) will not be implemented until appropriate HA and EC/IRB approval . The removal of the requirement to perform routine coagulation studies after screening reduces patient burden regarding the frequency of blood samples and the volume of blood collected, while ensuring patient safety. No safety signal pertaining to coagulation has been identified to date in any clinical study conducted with lumasiran. This modification is particularly important for pediatr ic patients given the greater limits placed on blood collection volumes . • Remove the collection of blood samples to assess pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) levels after Month 12 and after discontinuation of pyridoxine therapy. After a patient discontinues pyridox ine therapy, measurement of pyridoxine is no longer medically indicated to verify medication compliance. • Increase sample size based on feasibility ; additional patien ts were identified since original protocol was implemented. • Revise renal ultrasound and ur ine collection assessments as anephric patients are exempt from renal ultrasound and procedures requiring urine samples, and anuric patients are exempt from procedures requiring urine samples. • Clarify ophthalmologic exams : Fundus photography (FP), Optical Coherence Test (OCT) and Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) will be performed for all patients at specified timepoints; however, FAF will not be performed if unavailable at the study site. A detailed summary of these changes is provided in Section Section 2 (Table 2). Corrections to typographical errors, punctuation, grammar, abbreviations, and formatting (including administrative changes between the original protocol and protocol amendment 1) are not detailed."
