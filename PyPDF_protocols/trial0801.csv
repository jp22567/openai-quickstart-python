7,page_7,"INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM in LP Version 6.0 Revised 05/29/2020 Page 7 of 50 Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D. 2 Introduction This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in accordance with the applicable United States government regulations and Mayo Clinic research policies and procedures. 2.1 Background INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM is a top ical JAK1/2 inhibitor with potent activity on the cytokine IFN -γ. IFN -γ is a critical cytokine in the signaling of LP. This study is aimed at evaluating the effects of topical INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 1.5% twice daily on lesions of cutaneous LP. Lichenoid tissue reaction (LTR) includes: lichen planus (LP) cutaneous lupus, dermatomyositis (DM), and graft versus host disease (GVHD). The pathogenesis of LP is incompletely understood; however, it is clea rly T -cell mediated without a known auto -antigen. Lichen Planus (LP) is an inflammatory skin condition characterized by purple, polygonal, pruritic, papules and plaques. LP can affect any ectodermally derived tissues including: the skin (most commonly), na ils, and mucous membranes. LP is thought to affect approximately 1 -2% of the general population. Most cutaneous LP resolves within one to two years. Disease duration, in ascending order, is: generalized cutaneous, non -generalized cutaneous, cutaneous and m ucosal, mucosal, hypertrophic, and Lichen Planopilaris (hair LP). LP is the prototypical lichen tissue reaction(LTR). Modern theories of LP encompass three major stages: antigen recognition, lymphocyte activation, and keratinocyte apoptosis. A fourth stage , resolution, is a new and emerging topic. The occurrence of triggering factors in a genetically predisposed individual carrying LP -associated genes, results in disease development. During the initiation phase, damage to keratinocytes result in the release of DNA, RNA, and cathelicidin (LL37). These proteins can stimulate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) via toll like receptors 7, 9 (TLR7,9) which result in the release of interferon alpha (IFN ). IFN can have both local and distant affects upon myeloid d endritic cells (MDC) as well as keratinocytes. Stimulated MDC interact with CD4+ T -helper cells and with the correct antigen. The antigen remains unknown but may represent a viral derived peptide. Signaling receptors on MDC will stimulate CD4+ T -helper cel ls via the release of Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF ), Interleukin -1 (IL -1), and -12. In addition, cluster of differentiation - (CD40) and CD40 ligand (CD40L) will result in the co -stimulation of the T -helper/MDC interaction. Stimulated CD4+ T - helper cel ls then release of interferon gamma (IFNγ) and IL -2. These cytokines stimulate CD8+ T-cytotoxic cells. The stimulated CD8+ cells expressing Chemokine receptor -3 (CXCR3) will migrate to the dermal -epidermal junction following the release of chemokines ligan ds 9(CXCL9), -10,-11. These chemokines are released by stressed and stimulated keratinocytes. The stimulated CD8+ cells will interact with the stressed keratinocytes and can induce apoptosis in with the proper and signaling receptors. This antigen also rem ains unknown but may be a self -antigen released by local stress. The major kill signals are TNF , granzyme, and perforin. Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) are expressed on both keratinocytes and lymphocytes. Local CXCR3+ DC and T -regulatory cells may also modulat e the local lichenoid response. Based upon critical role of CD8+ T -cytotoxic cells and IFN  and IFNγ signaling in LP, inhibition with topical Janus Kinase (JAK) 1, 2 inhibitors have significant therapeutic potential. The current"
8,page_8,"INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM in LP Version 6.0 Revised 05/29/2020 Page 8 of 50 Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D. topical therapeutic optio ns for LP are limited to topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and retinoids. Topical therapies are effective with limited disease but refractory disease is frequently encountered. Specific variants of LP, such as hypertrophic LP and localized c utaneous disease, are often refractory to all topical therapies and require systemic or skin -directed treatment with oral acitretin or methotrexate or light therapy. Therefore, additional topical therapies would be highly desirable in hypertrophic and refr actory localized cutaneous LP. As proof of principle, systemic JAK1, 2 inhibition with ruxolitonib was highly effective in steroid refractory graft versus host disease (GVHD). (1) Additionally, there was a recent case report of an exceptional responder to JAK1, 2 inhibition with ruxolitinib in refractory dermatomyositis (DM). (2) As stated above, DM, GVHD, and LP share a similar histological pattern as well as signaling mechanism and, therefore, we would expect LP to respond similarly with systemic as well as topical treatment. To test this concept, we would propose a single -center, exploratory, open -label, single -arm design study using topical JAK1, 2 inhibitor on selected lesions of LP. 2.2 Investigational Agent INCB018424 PHOSPHATE (ruxolitinib) is an inhibitor of the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases. Mitogenic and inflammatory cytokines are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis, and lichenoid tissue reactions of the skin incl uding LP. INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM also potently inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT proteins and the production of pro -inflammatory factors induced by cytokines such as IL -23 and IFNγ. (Investigator’s Brochure) IFNγ is a key cytokine in the pathogenes is of LP. INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 1.5%, topical application, twice daily on lesions of cutaneous LP. 2.3 Preclinical Data The absorption, pharmacokinetics (PK), distribution, and metabolism of INCB018424 were characterized in CD -1 mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys, beagle dogs, and Gottingen minipigs, and the metabolism of INCB018424 was characterized in vitro in rat, dog, and human and in vivo in CD -1 mouse, rat, dog, minipig, and human. Additional studies include the mass balance excretion of 14C -INCB01842 4 in rats, dogs, and humans after oral dosing, the tissue distribution in rats after an oral dose, and the skin distribution in Gottingen minipig after daily topical administration. The relative bioavailability of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM was markedly ( ~ 90%) lower than that following oral administration. Following intravenous (IV) administration of INCB018424, the total systemic clearance was species -dependent, ranging from 26% (dog) to 450% (minipig) of hepatic blood flow. The primary clearance pathway is via metabolism based on the identification of multiple metabolites coupled with negligible renal clearance of parent drug in all species studied. In vitro metabolism studies strongly suggest that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the predominant CYP isozyme responsible for the metabolism of INCB018424."
9,page_9,"INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM in LP Version 6.0 Revised 05/29/2020 Page 9 of 50 Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D. The major metabolites in rat, dog, and the minipig were the hydroxylated products and the corresponding ketones. All INCB018424 human in vitro metabolites were also present in rat, dog, and minipig. Several in vitro and/or in vivo metabolites of INCB018424 found in rat, dog, and human retain JAK -related pharmacological activity. In CD -1 and hairless (CrL:SKH1 -hr) mice after topical dosing for up to 3 months, there were minimal differences in the plasma toxic okinetics of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM . The distribution and elimination was rapid, while the AUC values for INCB018424 were not consistently different between steady state and Day 1. Higher application rates resulted in higher exposures, which further in creased when administered twice daily (BID) compared to once daily (QD). The in vitro transdermal flux of INCB018424 in a solubilized cream formulation across mouse skin was about 20 -fold higher than with human cadaver skin. In Gottingen minipigs following a single topical application using either a 1.5% w/w solubilized cream or a 1.0% w/w dispersed cream, INCB018424 exhibited an apparent zero -order transdermal absorption with an average plasma concentration over 24 hours of about 1 nM. In toxicolo gy studies in minipigs up to 9 months using the solubilized cream formulation, plasma concentrations of INCB018424 were significantly higher at steady state compared to Day 1. There were minimal sex differences in plasma AUC values, which were higher when administered BID compared to QD. In rats, elimination of drug -derived radioactivity after a single oral and IV dose was rapid, with excretion in urine, bile, and feces accounting for approximately 50%, 37%, and 12% of the dose, respectively. Elimination w as rapid in male and female dogs after an oral dose, with excretion in urine and feces accounting for 34% to 36% and 55% to 58% of the dose, respectively. These results are similar to humans, which after a single oral dose of 14C -INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM , recovery of administered radioactivity was 96% (74% in urine and 22% in feces). The apparent steady -state volume of distribution (Vss) of INCB018424 ranged from 0.81 L/kg (monkey) to 6.4 L/kg (minipig), and the terminal elimination half -life ranged from 0.4 hour (rat) to 2.5 hours (dog). In Sprague Dawley rats, after oral dosing, the highest concentrations were observed in the tissues and contents of the gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, renal cortex, 12 renal medulla, liver, aorta, and adrenal gland. In Long Evans rats, the highest concentrations of drug-derived radioactivity were tissues and contents of the gastrointestinal tract, urine, bile, uveal tract, liver, renal medulla, renal cortex, skin (pigmented), and kidney. Eliminatio n in Sprague Dawley and Long Evans rats was rapid and complete in most tissues. In a male Gottingen minipig after 4 consecutive daily topical doses of 1% 14C -INCB018424 cream, radiolabeled material penetrated from the site of application into the epidermis , while penetration into the underlying dermis was substantially lower. The serum and plasma protein binding of INCB018424 was species -dependent, with fraction unbound ranging from 2.7% in CD -1 mice to 33% in the minipig (human in vitro unbound fraction in plasma was 3.3%). The toxicologic and toxicokinetic profiles of INCB018424 were characterized in single and repeat oral dose studies of up to 4 weeks in mice, 6 months in duration in rats, and 12 months in duration in dogs, and in single and repeat topic al dose studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 9 months in the Gottingen minipig. INCB018424 was evaluated in acute dermal and ocular"
10,page_10,"INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM in LP Version 6.0 Revised 05/29/2020 Page 10 of 50 Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D. irritation studies in rabbits, an acute ocular irritation study in dogs, 10 -day ocular toxicity studies in rabbits an d dogs, the mouse local lymph node assay, and in phototoxicity and photoallergy studies in hairless albino guinea pigs. Genetic toxicology, safety pharmacology, and reproductive toxicology assessments have also been conducted, and the carcinogenic potentia l of INCB018424 was evaluated in a 6 -month Tg.rasH2 transgenic mouse model and in oral and topical 2 -year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, respectively. INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM applied at concentrations ≤ 1.5% BID, using a 10 mg/cm2 applicatio n rate to 10% body surface area (BSA) was well tolerated in assessments of up to 9 months in the Gottingen minipig. Decreases in lymphocytes were observed in both male and female animals administered INCB018424 but were considered nonadverse in the absence of any other findings suggestive of systemic toxicity. INCB018424 -associated microscopic skin lesions were generally of minimal to mild severity and lacked a clear dose -response relationship. The no-observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) was 1.5% BID (Day 293 mean unbound AUC 0.064 μM*h). INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM did not act as a contact sensitizer nor did it produce significant dermal or ocular irritation, acute phototoxicity, or photoallergic potential. There was no evidence of systemic toxicity followi ng repeated ocular administration to rabbits or dogs. Effects noted in multiple -dose oral toxicity studies were primarily those associated with the mechanism of action of INCB018424. Decreases in red blood cells, reticulocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocyte s have been observed along with lymphoid depletion in bone marrow and lymphoid organs. In addition, in dogs, demodectic mange, bacterial pneumonia, and viral - induced papillomas, expected consequences of the pharmacology of JAK inhibition, were noted. INCB0 18424 doses ≥ 50 mg/kg given to rats as a single oral dose in a central nervous system evaluation were associated with decreases in body temperature and transient decreases in locomotor activity. Administration of single oral doses of 150 mg/kg INCB018424 was associated with decreases in respiratory frequency, increases in tidal volume, and, for females only, an adverse decrease in minute volume. The IC50 for inhibition of the human -ether -à-go-go related gene (hERG) channel was determined to be 131.6 μM. In a cardiovascular evaluation of INCB018424 in radiotelemetry -implanted dogs, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters were unaffected at all doses. Administration of 30 mg/kg INCB018424 resulted in an adverse lowering of systolic, diastolic, mean arterial, and p ulse pressures with a corresponding increase in heart rate. There were no effects on ventricular repolarization at any dose in the study. In embryo -fetal assessments in rat and rabbit, maternal toxicity and minimal embryo -fetal toxicity were noted at the highest doses evaluated. INCB018424 was not teratogenic in either species. The NOAEL dose for the rat and rabbit study was 30 mg/kg per day. In an evaluation of fertility and early embryonic development, no effects were noted on reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats. Increases in postimplantation loss were noted at the higher doses. In a prenatal and postnatal development and maternal function study in rats, there were no adverse findings for fertility indices or for maternal and embr yo-fetal survival, growth, and developmental parameters. INCB018424 passed into the milk of lactating rats with an exposure that was 13 -fold higher than maternal plasma exposure."

Study INCB 18424 -201 was a double -blind, vehicle -controlled, rising -dose, safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy study of INCB01824 1% cream applied QD and 1.5% cream applied BID. All doses were safe and well tolerated. Prelimina ry efficacy was consistently shown for the 1.0% QD and 1.5% BID cohorts compared with vehicle, with a trend toward a dose response. The 1.5% cream BID showed similar responses compared with Dovonex® (calcipotriene) 0.005% cream and Diprolene® AF (betametha sone dipropionate) 0.05% cream. Systemic bioavailability of INCB018424 was independent of formulation strength. All adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in intensity and most judged unrelated to study medication, with no associated serious AEs (SAEs) or withdrawals. Laboratory and ECG evaluations did not suggest any safety issues, specifically no instances of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia. INCB 18424 -202 was an open -label, multicenter, sequential -cohort, dose -escalation, safety, tolera bility, PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), and preliminary efficacy study of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 1.0% or 1.5% applied to 2% to 20% BSA QD or BID for 4 weeks. Application area increased sequentially, and alternative dosing paradigms were explored at the highe st application area. The efficacy analyses collectively demonstrated efficacy of all 5 regimens of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM in psoriasis. The incidence of all reported AEs, the clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and ECG findings showed no confirme d safety signals or trends. Mean topical bioavailability ranged from 3.4% to 5.2% with no significant inhibition of cohort mean PD. Overall, INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM (1.0% or 1.5% ) was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated when applied QD or BID fo r 28 days to plaque psoriasis affecting 2% to 20% of the BSA. INCB 18424 -203 was a double -blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, vehicle -controlled dose-ranging study with application of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM or vehicle in subjects with stable plaque psoriasis The study was designed to evaluate safety a nd efficacy of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 0.5%, 1.0%, or 1.5% relative to vehicle cream when applied QD for 12 weeks in equal size groups. Overall, 199 subjects were enrolled. A total of 161 (80.9%) completed the Day 84 visit. Within each active treatment group, the mean scores for the individual and total psoriasis lesion assessments, the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), and the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA), as well as the mean treatable percent BSA decreased from baseline to each subseque nt assessment, which indicated an overall lessening of disease severity. Based on a review of the extent of exposure, the incidence of all reported AEs, the clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and ECG findings, no safety signals or trends were observ ed. Overall, INCB018424"
12,page_12,"INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM in LP Version 6.0 Revised 05/29/2020 Page 12 of 50 Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D. PHOSPHATE CREAM (0.5%, 1.0%, or 1.5%) was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated when applied QD for 12 weeks to plaque psoriasis affecting 2% to 20% of the BSA. Study INCB 18424 -204 is a 2 -part study of subjects with alopecia areata with Part A being open - label and Part B being double -blind, randomized, and placebo -controlled; subjects in both parts who meet prespecified criteria are eligible for an additional 24 weeks of open -label treatment. Preliminary unaudited dat a for this study are presented through 28 JUN 2016. Twelve subjects were enrolled in Part A, the open -label portion of the study. Of these 12 subjects, 5 subjects (41.7%) have completed the study through Week 24, and no subjects have discontinued study treatment. Forty -four subjects were randomized in Part B, the double -blind portion of the study. Of these 44 subjects, 3 subjects (6.8%) discontinued from the study, 1 subject because of an AE (pruritus judged not related to study drug), 1 subject because of subject decision, and 1 subject because of abnormal laboratory values at screening. In Part A, 8 subjects (66.7%) had a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE). One subject had Grade 3 SAEs of noncardiac chest pain, pulmonary mass, and sepsis judged as not related to study drug by the investigator that led to interruption of study drug; these events resolved, and the subject resumed study drug. All of the TEAEs reported in Part A occurred in 1 subject each. In Part B, 7 subjects (16.7%) had TEAEs. One subje ct had an SAE of nausea and vomiting (judged not related by the investigator); this event resolved with continuation of study drug. The most frequently reported TEAE in Part B was skin exfoliation, which was reported in 3 subjects (7.1%); these events were judged as not related by the investigator. INCB018424 has also been administered orally as single or multiple doses to healthy volunteers and subjects with inflammatory, hematologic, and oncologic disease. Oral administration has been generally safe and well tolerated. Literature reports also indicate that oral INCB018424 may restore hair growth in patients with alopecia areata. INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM appears to pose a low risk of cutaneous toxicity. INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM applied at concentratio ns ≤ 1.5% (10 mg/cm2 application rate to 10% BSA corresponding to 434 -1099 cm2) was well tolerated in a 9 -month assessment in the Gottingen minipig. INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM did not act as a contact sensitizer nor did it produce significant dermal irrita tion or demonstrate phototoxicity or photoallergenic potential. This lack of adverse cutaneous effects has been supported by clinical trials to date where cutaneous AEs have been infrequent and of similar frequency and severity as with vehicle control trea tment. INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM tested positive in a photoclastogenicity assay; hence there may be a risk of skin reaction to the combined exposure of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM and sunlight. Subjects should be cautioned to avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight (including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc), and, when outdoors, should be advised to wear loose -fitting clothing that protects the treated area from the sun. The primary clinical risks noted with orally administered INC B018424 treatment are the potential sequelae of decreased hematopoietic proliferation secondary to the inhibition of growth factor pathways by JAK2 antagonism. Systemic exposure with topical INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM is several fold below that which is as sociated with hematologic changes that may be seen following oral dosing. Dose -dependent, reversible thrombocytopenia has been"

An increased rate of infection i s an additional potential risk of immunomodulation. A few subjects have had an apparent worsening of their premorbid disease symptoms following rapid cessation of INCB018424 therapy. A gradual tapering and use of steroids in fragile patients may be conside red when stopping INCB018424 therapy. Leukemic transformation has been observed, but was considered to be consistent with the natural history of the underlying disease and unrelated to drug. In healthy volunteers and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with greater bone marrow reserve, the effects on hematopoietic proliferation appear to be less pronounced. Overall, the safety profile of ruxolitinib in the polycythemia vera (PV) population treated was generally consistent with what was observed in the MF pop ulation. Ruxolitinib was generally well tolerated in subjects with PV, and only a small proportion of subjects discontinued ruxolitinib due to AEs (3.6%). Most of the AEs have been managed by dose adjustments. Hematologic toxicities were less frequent and less severe in subjects with PV as compared to those observed in subjects with MF. 2.5 Dose Rationale Topical Dosing: In addition to the safety pharmacology and toxicology studies that were completed to support development of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM . The relative bioavailability of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM was markedly (~ 90%) lower than that following oral administration. In vitro metabolism studies strongly suggest that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the predominant CYP isozyme responsible for the metabo lism of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM . INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM has been evaluated in over 200 subjects with plaque psoriasis in 3 clinical studies with dosing of 1 to 3 months' duration. Study INCB 18424 -201 was a double -blind, vehicle -controlled, rising -dose, safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy study of INCB01824 1% cream applied QD and 1.5% cream applied BID. All adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in intensity and most judged unrelated to study medication, with no associated serio us AEs (SAEs) or withdrawals. Laboratory and ECG evaluations did not suggest any safety issues, specifically no instances of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia. INCB 18424 -202 was an open -label, multicenter, sequential -cohort, dose -escalation, safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy study of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 1.0% or 1.5% applied to 2% to 20% BSA QD or BID for 4 weeks. Application area increased sequentially, and alternative dosing paradigms were explor ed at the highest application area. The efficacy analyses collectively demonstrated efficacy of all 5 regimens of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM in psoriasis. The incidence of all reported AEs, the clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and ECG findings sho wed no confirmed safety signals or trends. Mean topical bioavailability ranged from 3.4% to 5.2% with no significant inhibition of cohort mean PD. Overall, INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM (1.0% or 1.5%) was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated when applie d QD or BID for 28 days to plaque psoriasis affecting 2% to 20% of the BSA."

The amount of radiation has a low risk of harmful effects. Blood draw: The risks of drawing blood include pain, bruising, lightheadedness, and/or fainting, or rarely, infection at the site of the needle stick.

Exploratory Objectives: To predict re sponses and examine the pharmacodynamics of treatment through the identification of unique biomarkers and transcriptomic changes of LP at week 0 and utilizing RNA sequencing on responsive and non -responsive tissue at week 4 To correlate these biomarkers wi th measures of global response: Modified CAILS, PGA, BSA, and lesion count. 4 Study Design 4.1 General Description"
17,page_17,"INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM in LP Version 6.0 Revised 05/29/2020 Page 17 of 50 Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D. This is a single center, exploratory, open -label, single -arm design study of 12 patients. Treatment naïve and treatment refractory patients with LP will be treated with INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM . Patients who are non -responders, to physician choice standa rd of care, will undergo a washout period and will be enrolled in the study. Multiple safety studies have been conducted with INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM (see Safety) and a dose of 1.5% cream BID on up to 20% BSA is deemed safe. (Investigator’s Brochure) The Within each cohort, the maximum reduction from baseline in the total psoriasis lesion assessment scores for the treated lesions was observed at the en d of treatment (Day 28). (Investigator’s Brochure) Therefore, we propose a single center, exploratory, open -label, single - arm design study of 12 patients. Treatment naïve and treatment refractory patients with LP will be treated with INCB018424 PHOSPHATE C REAM . Individuals with LP involving less than 20% of the BSA will be eligible. Individuals must have 4 lesions at baseline, however, a minimum of 10 lesions is ideal, which are at least 5mm in diameter. 10 lesions are ideal as 2 lesions will be index les ions and 8 or more lesions will be selected from as responsive or non -responsive at 4 weeks. All lesions except for one index lesion will be treated and all lesions will be annotated, photographed, and scored. The rationale for a minimum of 8 lesions is ba sed upon the assumption of a 50% response rate at 2 weeks. With 8 lesions, there would be a less than 1% chance that all 8 lesions would respond. Ideally, the 2 index lesions will be 10mm in diameter but this is not a requirement. Prior treatment will be allowed; however, a washout period of 2 weeks for topical and 4 weeks for systemic agents is required. At the washout period, individuals will undergo evaluation with a PGA, BSA calculation, and have the 2 largest, representative lesions selected for evalua tion using a modified CAILS score lesion A - treatment index lesion and B -index control lesion. The determination of which lesion receives treatment and which is a control will be determined randomly. The additional lesions will be photographed, measured, scored, and recorded with Modified CAILS scores as well. The later calculations will be used for the determination of responsive and non -responsive lesions. Additional Pruritus measures using the NRS and Skindex -16 will be collected at that time. Individ uals will then initiate treatment on all lesions of LP BID and will be evaluated weekly and assessed by PGA, BSA, lesion count; Modified CAILS, Pruritus NRS, and Skindex -16 between weeks 0 -4 (see Appendix). Week 4 will be the primary endpoint; however ther apy will be continued for an additional 4 weeks. Therapy will be stopped and the individuals will be evaluated at week 8 and assessed by PGA, BSA, lesion count, Modifed CAILS, Pruritus NRS, and Skindex -16. Laboratory and safety monitoring will occur at wee ks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8, and 12. 3D Photographs will be taken at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12. Individual lesions will be circled at that time and the exact volume of each lesion will be measured . Up close photos will be taken of the disease and normal tissues attained at weeks 0 & 4. Tissue will be collected for RNA sequencing at week 0 and 4. Blood collection will include the isolation at week 0, 2, and week 4, 5mL vials of blood which will be separated and the serum and cell pellet will be stored for future analysis. Five skin biopsies will be taken during the study. At week 0, up to two 3mm tissue biopsies will be taken from lesional skin and one biopsy will be taken from normal appearing ski n. The initial biopsy of lesional tissue and control will be"

At week 4, up to two 3mm biopsies will be taken from lesional responsive tissue and lesional refractory tissue. Responsive and non -responsive lesions will be determined by the change i n Modified CAILS between week 0 and 4. Responsive will require a 50% reduction in Modified CAILS and non -responsive can have progression, no change, or up to a 50% reduction in Modified CAILS. The lesions will be chosen using full body photographs taken at week 0. Up to 60 samples will be snap frozen and stored in the tissue biobank. Once completed, RNA sequencing will be performed on the 60 tissue samples and analysis will be performed. Paired analysis of treatment responsive and refractory lesions will be made as well as treated and untreated lesions. Nucleic Acid Extractions: RNA will be extracted from a total of 50 um of fresh tissue using the Qiagen FFPE RNeasy Micro extraction Kit according to manufacturer’s recommendation. RNA Transcriptome Sequen cing: RNA transcriptome sequencing will be carried out using commercially available techniques. Briefly, RNA Libraries will be created using up to 100ng of RNA as starting material using the Agilent RNA Access Library kit according to manufacturer’s recom mendation. Libraries will be QCed for quality and quantity using the Agilent BioAnalyzer High Sensitivity Chip. Pair -End sequencing will then be carried out on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 using 101bp insert fragments. Primary and Secondary Measures: All efficacy assessments will be performed prior to the administration of study treatment at each visit. The recommended order and the overall outline of measurements for the efficacy assessments are described below. Efficacy measures: PGA, BSA, Modified CAILS, Pruritus NRS, Skindex -16 To determine the efficacy of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM as measured by the change in Modified CAILS score of the index treatment and control lesion (weeks 0 and 4) and changes in lesion count (week 0 and 4) Secondary Outco me Measures: To determine the efficacy of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM and the duration of response after discontinuation as measured by the change in Pruritus NRS, (week 0 to week 4 , week 0 to week 8, weeks 4 to 8 , weeks 8 to 12 ), Change in Skindex -16 (week 0 to week 4 , weeks 4 to 8 , weeks 8 to 12 ), Change in Physician Global Assessment (PGA) (week 0 to week 4 , week 0 to week 8, weeks 4 to 8 , weeks 8 to 12 ), Change in BSA (week 0 to week 4 , week 0 to week 8, weeks 4 to 8 , weeks 8 to 12 ), Cha nge in Modified CAILS (week 0 to week 8, weeks 4 to 8 , weeks 8 to 12 ). Exploratory Outcome Measures: To predict responses and examine the pharmacodynamics of treatment through the identification of unique biomarkers and trasnscriptomic changes of LP at week 0 and utilizing RNA sequencing on responsive and non -responsive tissue at week 4 to correlate these biomarkers with measures of global response: Modified CAILS, PGA, BSA, and lesion count."

INCB018424 phosphate has a molecular formula of C17H21N6O4P and a molecular weight of 404.36. INCB018424 Phosphate Structural Formula INCB018424 phosphate drug substance is a white to off -white to light pink powder. INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM has been formulated in 4 strengths (0.15%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% w/w free base equivalent) that are actively being investigated. All excipients in b oth the INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM and placebo cream formulations are compendial grade or are approved for use in topical products. INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM is a topical formulation of an investigational product under development for the treatment of p atients with psoriasis, alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis, and other potential autoimmune diseases of the skin. INCB018424 phosphate (ruxolitinib) is an inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of protein tyrosine kinases. INCB018424 inhibits Janus Asso ciated Kinases (JAKs) JAK1 and JAK2 which mediate the signaling of a number of"
25,page_25,"INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM in LP Version 6.0 Revised 05/29/2020 Page 5 of 50 Mayo Clinic - Aaron Mangold, M.D. CONFIDENTIAL cytokines and growth factors that are important for hematopoiesis and immune function. JAK signaling involves recruitment of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcri ption) to cytokine receptors, activation and subsequent localization of STATs to the nucleus leading to modulation of gene expression. Mitogenic and inflammatory cytokines are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, alopecia areata, atopic de rmatitis, and other potential autoimmune diseases of the skin. Inhibition of specific cytokine function using antibodies directed against the common p40 subunit of interleukin (IL) -12 and IL -23 has demonstrated proof -of-concept validating cytokine signalin g as a therapeutic target for the treatment of psoriasis. INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM has been evaluated in over 200 subjects in 3 clinical studies with dosing of 1 to 3 months in duration. One study of 12 subjects with Alopecia Areata. Pharmacodynamics: Ex vivo addition of INCB018424 to the whole blood samples from psoriasis subjects inhibited cytokine -induced STAT3p levels with a similar potency to that observed previously in whole blood from healthy volunteers (IC50 = 334 nM vs 414 nM, respectively). N o significant inhibition of mean systemic STAT3p was observed in any cohort following topical INCB018424 application. Pharmacokinetics: Study 1: • Cohort A: INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 0.5% versus vehicle applied QD. • Cohort B: INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 1.0% versus vehicle applied QD. • Cohort C: INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 1.5% versus vehicle applied BID. Application of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 0.5% to 1.5% QD or BID resulted in mean plasma concentrations of INCB018424 ranging from 0.34 ± 0.4 nM (Coho rt A) through 2.10 ± 1.78 nM (Cohort C) at steady state. The mean INCB018424 steady -state concentration increased approximately proportional to application dose per day. The size of the lesion areas treated ranged from 9 to 63 cm2. Application of INCB01842 4 PHOSPHATE CREAM 0.5% to 1.5% QD or BID resulted in a mean skin flux of INCB018424 ranging from 54 ± 41 ng/cm2/h (Cohort A) through 422 ± 200 ng/cm2/h (Cohort C). The mean skin flux of INCB018424 increased with increasing application (API) strength. The m ean systemic bioavailability was 2.8 ± 3.2%, 3.0 ± 1.9%, 3.0 ± 1.9%, 2.7 ± 1.1%, and 2.7 ± 2.3% for Cohorts A through E, respectively. The systemic bioavailability of INCB018424 applied as a topical cream appears independent of the strength of the cream fo rmulation. Study 2: • Cohort A: treat 2% -7% BSA with 1.5% BID in 5 subjects • Cohort B: treat 8% -13% BSA with 1.5% BID in 5 subjects • Cohort C: treat 14% -20% BSA with 1.5% QD in 5 subjects • Cohort D (optional): treat 14% -20% of BSA with 1.0% QD or BID in 5 subjects • Cohort E (optional): treat 14% -20% of BSA with 1.5% QD or BID in 5 subjects The average plasma concentrations of INCB018424 for Cohort A , Cohort B, Cohort C, Cohort D, and Cohort E were 7.00 ± 2.11 nM, 29.38 ± 13.10 nM, 24.42 ± 10.07 nM, 34.96 ± 20.43 nM,"

The mean INCB018424 Css increased approximately proportional to application dose per day. The mean skin flux of INCB018424 was estimated to be 180 ± 126 ng/cm2/h, 131 ± 92 ng/cm 2/h, 60 ± 43 ng/cm2/h, 151 ± 126 ng/cm2/h, and 152 ± 74 ng/cm2/h, respectively, for Cohorts A, B, C, D, and E. The mean topical bioavailability was estimated to be 3.8 ± 2.5%, 4.1 ± 3.4%, 3.4 ± 1.9%, 3.9 ± 1.3%, and 5.2 ± 1.9%, respectively, for Cohorts A, B, C, D, and E. Based on this result, it is concluded that the systemic bioavailability of INCB018424 applied as a topical cream is independent of the strength of the cream formulation and %BSA. Study 3: • Treatment A: INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 0.5% ap plied QD for 12 weeks • Treatment B: INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 1.0% applied QD for 12 weeks • Treatment C: INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 1.5% applied QD for 12 weeks • Treatment D: Vehicle containing placebo cream applied QD for 12 weeks Application of INCB 018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% QD resulted in mean steady -state trough plasma concentrations (Css,min) of INCB018424 of 9.19 ± 11.77 nM, 16.99 ± 19.05 nM, and 19.97 ± 25.13 nM, respectively, for 0.5% QD to 1.5% QD. Thus, the mean INCB018424 Cs s,min increased approximately proportional to application dose. As the severity of lesion thickness, erythema, and scale increased, the INCB018424 Css,min appeared to be decreased for the same treatment. The subjects with less severe lesion thickness, eryt hema, and scale seemed to have higher trough INCB018424 exposures. Study 4: Twelve subjects were enrolled in Part A (1.5% BID). Pharmacokinetic data were available for 12 subjects at Week 4 and 5 subjects at Week 12. Application of INCB018424 PHOSPHATE CREAM 1.5% BID resulted in mean steady state plasma concentrations of 25.4 ± 15.9 nM at Week 4 and 43.0 ± 36.5 nM at Week 12, which are generally consistent with the steady state concentrations seen in subjects with psoriasis. Steady state was assumed to be achieved at Day 8. 6.2 Treatment Regimen Subjects will apply the study drug topically to LP lesions twice daily. Treatment will take place from Day 0 to Week 8. 6.3 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug The study drug will be supplied by Incyte to the Mayo Clinic Pharmacy , attn. , , Scottsdale, AZ .

Due to the costs associated with a study, we propose a single armed study of 12 subjects with corollary science including RNA sequencing. This will reduce costs and provide biomarkers predictive of response. Effect sizes will be estimated for the appropriate statisti cal tests that will be used for group comparisons in future studies. This will enable more accurate power and sample size estimates moving forward. 8.2 Statistical Methods Descriptive Statistics Sample Size Computation and Power Analysis : The sample size for this pilot study is set at 12 subject s for logistical and financial reasons. This is similar in size to other exploratory studies and will provide adequate data for estimation purposes for planning future studies. With 12 subjects , the study is intended to be for estimation purposes only. Statistical Analysis Plan: Data Analysis - The statistical analysis will provide descriptive summary statistics for categorical and continuous outcomes. Categorical variables will be described by their count and proportion of occurrence while continuous, normally distributed variables will be described by their mean and standard deviation; and continuous, non -normally distributed variables will be described by their median and range. The paired or unpaired Wilcoxon tests will be used to quantify differences in numerical outcomes while the Fisher’s exact test and the McNemar’s or Bowker’s tests will be used to quantify changes in categorical variables. If missingness occurs at random a mixed model w ill be utilized to assess the change in the lesion over time. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the last observation carried forward and the results will be compared to that of the mixed -model. Effect sizes will be estimated for the appropriat e statistical tests that will be used for group comparisons in future studies. This will enable more accurate power and sample size estimates moving forward. Bioinformatic Analysis : RNA -seq analysis: We will use our recently developed LinNorm program (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Linnorm.html) to process RNA -seq data and detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by comparing the RNA -seq profiles. We will first find DEG betwe en responsive and non -responsive samples from the same individual by using paired or unpaired Wilcoxon rank -sum test (depending on how the samples are collected). We will then rank each gene in the DEGs based on the occurrence frequencies in all 12 subject s"

For the top ranked genes (common DEGs), we will use DAVID (3) and GSEA (4) software to find enriched inflammatory pathways and GO terms for the DEGs. By comparing the normal tissue with the pathogenic tissue (responsive + non -responsible) using the above approach, we will detect a common DEGs for LP pathogenesis. Hierarchical clustering (5) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (6) will be applied to samples for their hierarchical relationship and clustering properties. Ideally normal, responsive and non -responsible tissues should form three distinct groups. The PCA analysis will provide us a set of gene signatures that can distinguish these three types of tissues. The common DEGs for responsiveness and pathogenesis, as well as gene signature from PCA will be used for our pathogenesis or survival prediction. We will perform struct ure variants calling from RNA -seq data with SNPiR (7), and reconstruct gene co - expression networks with ARACHNE. (8) Additionally, we will perform de -convolutional analysis, to compare the immune profiles of responsive and non -responsive tissue and to correlate immune profiles. Predictive biomarkers will be correlated with lesional and global responses. 8.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis • All-completed population : All subjects that receive at least one dose will be considered for analysis."

These include: ( 1) death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospitalization - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new inf ormation (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opinion of the local investigator may adversely affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data , AND • Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is ""unanticipated"" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or event is ""unanticipated"" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND • Related : A problem or event is ""related"" if it is possibl y related to the research procedures. Adverse Event An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, device, biologic) in a patient or research subject. Serious Adverse Event Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious. Serious problems/events can be well defined and include ; • death • life threatening adverse experience • hospitalization • inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity • persistent or significant disab ility or incapacity • birth defect/anomaly and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opinion of the sponsor -investigator may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the rese arch data. ."

Adverse Event Reporting Period For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is defined as 30 days following the last administration of study treatment. Preexisting Condition A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. General Physical Examination Findings At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. A thorough baseline screening will be foll owed for all subjects and is outlined in Table -2. A detailed list of the methods in which baseline screening will be performed is outlined in Supplemental 2 . All blood draws and safety assessments must be performed prior to study treatment administration. Appropriate sa fety assessments (e.g., evaluation of AEs and SAEs) should be repeated after dosing with study treatment. A physical examination, including general appearance and vital signs, will be performed as indicated in Table -2. If indicat ed, based on medical history and/or symptoms, additional exams will be performed at the discretion of the investigator. If possible, the same member of the study site staff throughout the study will perform assessments for an individual subject. Informatio n for all physical examinations will be included in the source documentation at the study site. Significant findings that are present prior to the subject signing informed consent will be included in the Medical History. Significant findings made after the signing of the informed consent, which meet the definition of an AE, must be recorded as an AE. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, height, weight) will be assessed at each physical examination as indicated in Table -2 (see Supplemental 2 for details on how to acquire vital signs). Whether action needs to be taken to address notable vital signs will be decided by the investigator, considering the overall status of the subject. Supplemental 1: App ropriateness of Measures Skin Scoring: There are no validated skin scoring systems for LP. Therefore, we will use simple measures of BSA which is objective and PGA which is well validated in other inflammatory skin conditions. Additionally, we will simply annotate the number of lesions on the i ndividual as a marker of total disease burden. The later measure, CAILS was devised for evaluation of cutaneous T -cell lymphoma lesions for trial purposes. This system provides accurate measurements of CTCL patches, plaques, and tumors. This scoring system capture s lesion redness, size, textur e,"

We will use a Modified CAILS scoring system that discards pigmentation scoring as resolving LP lesion inherently leave behind hyperpigmented skin changes which may confound active lesion scoring. This will provide a composite analysis of the index lesions as well as the general body involvement of the individual. The Modified CAILS system is advantageous over the PASI or EASI system in that in allows for more accurat e calculation of surface area and incorporates that into the final score. In cases where some or all of the affected body regions contain such extensive LP disease that make counting individual LP lesions unfeasible, the lesion count in these areas will be estimated. The palmar surface of the hand equates to approximately 1% BSA. To estimate the lesion count in a body region of extensive disease, the number of lesions counted within an area equivalent to area the palmar surface of the hand within that ex tensively diseased body region will be multiplied by the representative BSA of that body region to determine the estimated lesion count contained in that body region. Representative BSAs of body regions are defined as follows: head (7%), neck (2%), anterio r trunk (13%), arms (8%), forearms (6%), hands (5%), posterior trunk (13%), buttocks (5%), thighs (19%), legs (14%), feet (7%) and groin (1%). Itch Scoring: The NRS and Skindex -16 are all well validated measure of itch. The First score measure focuses in upon a gestalt of itch. The later scoring system focuses in upon the itch and its impact upon quality of life. Supplemental 2: Safety Measures Baseline Scr eening: A serum β -hCG test will be performed in all pre -menopausal women as indicated. All pre - menopausal women who are not sterile at screening will also have a urine pregnancy test performed locally as indicated. Any woman with a confirmed positive pregnancy test during screening is not eligible for the study. A positive urine pregnancy test during the treatment periods of the study requires immediate interruption of study treatment until serum β -hCG is performed and found to be negative. If the serum β -hCG test is positive, study treatment must be definitively discontinued. Blood Pressure and Pulse: Height and Weight: Height and body weight will be measured in indoor clothing, but without shoes. If possible, body weight assessments should be performed by the same study site staff member and using the same scale throughout the study. Blood Draws: Subjects should avoid smoking within the hour preceding the blood draws. All laboratory studies will be conducted within the Mayo Clinic Health Systems (Mayo Clinic Arizona and Mayo Clinic Rochester).

Alert ranges for labs and other test abnormalities are included determined by the Mayo Clinic Arizona and Mayo Medical Laboratory. Adverse eve nts will be recorded in the Adverse Events Case Report Form (CRF) under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, and severity. All adverse events will be treated appropriately. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until it s resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the out come (see Supplemental 3 ). Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found in the package insert. This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. The investigator will also instruct each patient to report any new adverse event (beyond the protocol observation period) that the patient, or the patient’s personal physician, believes might reaso nably be related to study treatment. This information should be recorded in the investigator’s source documents, however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE. To ensure patient safety, every SAE (see Supplemental 3 for definition), regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and after the patient begins taking study drug and until 30 days after the patient has stopped study participation will be recorded and reported to In cyte. Any SAEs experienced after this 30 - day period should only be reported to Incyte if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug. All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousne ss criteria are not met. Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or ho spitalization but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in SAE. Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. All AEs (ser ious and non -serious) are captured and recorded, SAEs also require individual reporting ( see Supplemental 3 ). To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the patient is on study treatment must be reported to t he sponsor - investigator within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congeni tal abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment. Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelate d to the pregnancy must be reported on a SAE form."

Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: • What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study • Who will have access to that information and why • Who will use or disclose that information The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. (This information is contained within the Mayo IRB Informed Consent Template Sectio Study data will be securely stored on a password protected computer that only the research study team will have access to. Any study related paper documents will be stored in a locked cabinet that only the research study team will have access to. • 14) In the event that a subject re vokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to coll ect at least vital status (long term survival status that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 10.2 Source Documents Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents. Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complet e, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial. 10.3 Case Report Forms The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study. All data requested on the CRF must be recorded. All missing data must be explained. If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”. If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”. All entries should be printed legibly in black ink. If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it. All such changes must be initialed and dated. Do not erase or use “white -out” for errors. For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it. If the rea son for the correction is not clear or needs additional explanation, neatly include the details to justify the correction."
