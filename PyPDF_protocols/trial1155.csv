Protocol Synopsis Protocol Title: An Open -label Phase 2 Study of Carfilzomib Combinations (Carfilzomib Plus Dexamethasone, Carfilzomib Plus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone, and Carfilzomib Plus Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone), To Assess Tolerability and Adherence in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma at US Community Oncology Centers Short Protocol Title: A Study of Carfilzomib Combinations in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma at US Community Oncology Centers Study Phase: 2 Indication: relapsed or refractory multiple m yeloma (RRMM) Rationale The ENDEAVOR study demonstrated the superiority of the combination of carfilzomib (Kyprolis ) with dexamethasone (Kd; 56 mg/m2 twice weekly) over bortezomib with dexamethasone (Vd; 1.3 mg/m2 twice weekly). Superiority of the Kd regimen was demonstrated in terms of both progression- free survival (PFS) (18.7 m onths vs 9.4 months, hazard ratio [ HR] = 0.53) and overall survival (OS) (median 47.6 months vs 40.0 months, HR = 0.791, one -sided p = 0.010) ( Dimopoulos et al, 2016; Dimopoulos et al, 2017 ). Despite the favorable benefit -risk profile of the Kd regimen, as demonstrated in the ENDEAVOR study, logistical challenges of the twice- weekly dosing have been reported within the United States (US) community practice setting. With the results from the A.R.R.O.W. study, the Kd 70mg/m2 once weekly dosing schedule was approved in the US, providing the US practicing centers one more option to treat MM patients with relapse/refractory disease. Triplet therapy combining a proteasome inhibitor ( PI) with an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) and steroid remains an important and commonly used option for many patients with RRMM. Patients refractory to PIs and IMiDs have extremely poor prognosis with median OS of approximately 13 months and PFS about 5 months ( Kumar et al, 2017). Current treatment practices lead to a high prevalence of dual, lenalidomide- bortezomib refractory relapses in later lines of therapy. The ASPIRE study demonstrated the superiority of the combination of carfilzomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd; 27 mg/m2 twice -weekly) over lenalidomide with dexamethasone. Superiority of the KRd regimen was demonstrated in terms of median PFS (26.3 vs 17.6 months, HR = 0.69), overall response rate (87.1% vs 66.7%, Approved"
10,page_10,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20170596 Date: 20 May 2019 Page 11 of 132 CONFIDENTIAL odds ratio = 3.47) ( Stewart et al, 2015 ), health -related quality -of-life (Stewart et al, 2016 ), as well as OS (median OS: 48.3 vs 40.4 months, HR = 0.79 [ Siegel et al, 2018]). Safety results from the final analysis were consistent with the known safety profile of carfilzomib, with no new safety signals observed after extended follow -up. Despite the favorable benefit -risk profile of the KRd regimen, as demonstrated in the ASPIRE study, compliance with the currently available twice- weekly KRd dosing schedule may be less than optimal because of the convenience- related attributes of this regimen. Pomalid omide and dexamethasone (Pd) has been approved for subjects with RRMM and has proven efficacy in subjects who were refractory to both bortezomib and lenalidomide. Several phase 2 studies have demonstrated improved efficacy and safety of adding carfilzomib to Pd (KPd) in advanced RRMM compared to historical outcomes with Pd. The key benefits of carfilzomib, pomalidomide, dexamethasone as a triplet - therapy for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma include increases in PFS, OS, and ORR (San Miguel et al, 2013). The purpose of this study is to: • Describe the safety profile of 3 different weekly carfilzomib based regimens: o carfilzomib plus dexamethasone regimen (Kd 56 mg/m 2 twice weekly in cycles 1-2 followed by Kd 70 mg/m2 once weekly in cycles 3–12); o carfilzomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone regimen (KRd 27 mg/m2 twice weekly in cycles 1- 2 followed by KRd 56 mg/m2 once weekly in cycles 3-12); o carfilzomib plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone regimen (KPd 27 mg/m2 twice weekly in cycles 1-2 followed by KPd 56 mg/m2 once weekly in cycles 3- 12) in subjects with RRMM with 1 –3 prior lines of therapy at study entry. • Describe subjects’ adherence these carfilzomib based regimen s.

Introduction 3.1 Study Rationale Carfilzomib (Kyprolis) with dexamethasone (Kd) and the combination of carfilzomib with the immunomodulatory agent ( IMiD) lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) twice -weekly dose regimens have demonstrated favorable benefit risk profiles as in the ENDEAVOR and ASPIRE studies, respectively, and preliminary data for the KPd twice -weekly regimen also indicated the favorable benefit risk profile; however, logistical challenges of the twice weekly dosing have been reported within the United States (US) community practice setting. Ther efore, there is the need to explore a more convenient dosing schedule which may lead to better adherence to the treatment, especially in the community setting. The ENDEAVOR study demonstrated the superiority of the Kd regimen ( 56 mg/m 2 twice weekly) over bortezomib with dexamethasone (Vd; 1.3 m g/m2 twice weekly). Superiority of the Kd regimen was demonstrated in terms of both progression- free survival (PFS) (18.7 months vs 9.4 months, hazard ratio [ HR] = 0.53) and overall survival (OS) (median 47.6 months vs 40.0 months, HR = 0.791, one -sided p = 0.010) (Dimopoulos et al, 2016; Dimopoulos et al, 2017 ). Subsequently, the A.R.R.O.W. study results demonstrated that treatment with once weekly Kd at the dose of 70 mg/m2 (30 minute infusion) resulted in superior PFS and overall response rate ( ORR ), compared to the twice weekly administration of Kd 27 mg/m2 in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) . The safety profile was comparable in the 2 arms. Based on A .R.R.O.W. data, the Kd once weekly dose of 70 mg/m2 was included in the US label. Meanwhile, the treatment for RRMM is evolving towards triplet therapies, and triplets containing a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and IMiD are among the most efficacious therapies. The ASPIRE study demonstrated the superiority of the KRd regimen ( 27 mg/m 2) twice -weekly) over lenalidomide with dexamethasone. Superiority of the KRd regimen was demonstrated in terms of median PFS (26.3 vs 17.6 months, HR = 0.69), ORR (87.1% vs 66.7%, odds ratio = 3.47) ( Stewart et al, 2015), health- related quality -of-life (Stewart et al, 2016), as well as OS (median OS: 48.3 vs 40.4 months, HR = 0.79 [ Siegel et al, 2018]). Safety results from the final analysis were consistent with the known safety profile of carfilzomib, with no new safety signals observed after extended follow -up. Approved"
26,page_26,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20170596 Date: 20 May 2019 Page 27 of 132 CONFIDENTIAL In addition to the twice weekly triplet dosing regimen (KRd), the once weekly KRd dosing regimen has been tested. The ongoing Study CFZ013 evaluates once- weekly KRd in patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have been treated with 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy. As of data cut -off 18 July 2018, efficacy results from 56 subjects treated with weekly KRd 56 mg/m 2 (n = 10) or KRd 70 mg/m2 (n = 46) has shown similar efficacy , as determined by ORR (90.0% versus 89.1%, respectively) and similar ORR as previously reported for twice- weekly KRd (27 mg/m2) in the ASPIRE study, 87.1% (Biran et al, 2018 ). These results complement the significant efficacy results of carfilzomib as a triplet therapy. The IMiD p omalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) has been approved for subjects with RRMM and has proven efficacy in subjects who were refractory to both bortezomib and lenalidomide. Several phase 2 studies have demonstrated improved efficacy and safety of adding carfilzomib twic e weekly to Pd (KPd) in advanced RRMM compared to historical outcomes with Pd. The key benefits of carfilzomib, pomalidomide, dexamethasone as a triplet -therapy for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma include increases in PFS, OS, and O RR. The safety profile shows that the adverse events observed with the combination KPd are consistent with the product labels for carfilzomib and pomalidomide ( Sonneveld et al, 2018 ; Shah et al, 2015). These data from the twice weekly KPd regimen provided the rationale to explore a once weekly KPd regimen, which may deliver a comparable clinical benefit /risk profile with more convenience. This study will assess the tolerability and adherence in RRMM subjects at US community oncology centers with 3 carfilzomib combinations: Kd, KRd and KPd. The 3 regimens will be given for 2 cycles as a twice weekly dosing schedule followed by 10 cycles of a once weekly dosing schedule. The twice weekly schedule of these 3 carfilzomib combinations is the or iginally appr oved schedule and familiar to the treating physicians. The approval of the once weekly dosing schedule for Kd is relatively new to the clinical practice. To provide a consistent dosing schedule among the different arms, in context of this variable carfilzomib dosing, each carfilzomib combination begins with a twice weekly schedule and transitions to a once weekly schedule.

According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 30 000 new cases of MM are expected to be diagnosed in 2016 ( SEER Cancer Statistic Review ). Multiple myeloma is a disease of older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years ( Howlader et al, 2013). Although MM is usually responsive to cytotoxic therapy, responses are often brief, highlighting the need for new therapeutic targets and more successful combination therapies. Over the years, progress has been made in autologous st em cell transplantation along with the introduction of several breakthrough drugs, including IMiD and PI , which led to a significant increase in response rate as well as survival rate (Kumar et al, 2012). The 5 -year survival rates have almost doubled, inc reasing from 27% to 47% between 1989 and 2010 ( Pulte et al, 2014). Despite improvements in the management of the disease, MM still remains a serious illness and most patients eventually develop treatment resistance ( Barlogie et al, 2006 ). In addition, response time generally decreases with subsequent number of treatment lines (Kumar et al, 2004). Treatment of RRMM presents a special therapeutic challenge, due to the heterogeneity of disease at relapse and the absence of clear biological based treatment recommendations at various time points of disease progression. The treatment landscape is evolving rapidly with increasing recognition of the inherent clonal heterogeneity and genomic instability of the plasma cells influencing both inherent and acquired therapeutic resistance, the identification of the optimal choice and sequence of therapies has become critical. Several new agents and targets are currently under development and show considerable promise. Besides PI and IMiD, other newer treatment approaches have been approved since 2015, including monoclonal antibodies Approved"

The choice of salvage therapy for RRMM patients depends on various factors including disease biology, patient’s general condition, as well as the prior treatment and the response and long -term toxicity of prior treatment. The other considerations are tolerability and adherence to salvage therapy which will impact the treatment exposure hence impact the treatment effects. Given the various considerations around treatment decision, it’s critical to evaluate multiple salvage therapies to provide options meeting the different needs of RRMM patients. 3.2.2 Amgen Investigational Product Background : Carfilzomib Carfilzomib is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone PI that binds selectively and irreversibly to the 20S proteasome, the proteolytic core particle within the 26S proteasome. Consequently, proteasome function after therapy can only be regained by de novo proteasome synthesis. Specifically, carfilzomib inhibits the chymotrypsin- like catalytic activity of the β5 subunit over the caspase- like catalytic activity of the β1 subunit or the trypsin -like catalytic activity of the β2 subunit, resulting in the accumulation of proteasome substrates and ultimately growth arrest and apoptosis ( Hoy, 2016 ). Carfilzomib extensively penetrates all tissues, but the brain. It is metabolized largely extra -hepatically and rapidly cleared from the circulation by biliary and renal excretion (t 1/2 = 15-30 minutes); < 1% is excreted intact ( Kortuem and Stewart, 2013 ). Carfilzomib entered clinical studies in September 2005. On 20 July 2012, Kyprolis® was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) for the treatment of patients with MM who have received at least 2 prior therapies, including bortezomib and an IMiD, and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. The initial accelerated approval was based on the results of the phase 2 PX -171-003-A1 study in the United States. Subsequent full approval in the United States and globally were based on 2 phase 3 trials: PX-171-009 ASPIRE and 2011- 003 ENDEAVOR. Following these approvals, Kyprolis in combination with either lenalidomide and dexamethasone or dexamethasone alone is indicated for the treatment of RRMM . The exact indication wording varies by region. With the results from the A.R.R.O.W. study, the Kd 70 mg/m 2 once weekly dosing schedule was approved in the US to treat MM. Carfilzomib for Injection has been approved in 34 countries/reg ions worldwide. Approved"
29,page_29,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20170596 Date: 20 May 2019 Page 30 of 132 CONFIDENTIAL As of 19 July 2018, approximately 8210 subjects have been enrolled in 116 actively enrolling or completed/closed single- group or randomized carfilzomib clinical trials. It is estimated that approximately 88964 patients have been exposed to carfilzomib in the post-marketing setting. A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of carfilzomib is provided in the Car filzomib Investigator’s Brochure. 3.2.3 Benefits of Once- weekly Dosing Carfilzomib is FDA approved as a weekly administration in combination with dexamethasone ( Kyprolis USPI ); however, triplet therapies are emerging as SOC for RRMM. Evidence suggests that the convenience afforded by a once- weekly dosing schedule can help improve patient adherence t o treatment with antimyeloma IV agents . The ongoing Study CFZ013 evaluating once -weekly KRd in patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma has shown similar efficacy as previously reported for twice- weekly KRd (27 mg/m 2) in the ASPIRE study (Biran et al, 2018). Two studies of a once- weekly versus twice- weekly schedule of bortezomib as combination therapy showed consistent findings that patients with multiple myeloma treated with a once- weekly dose regimen were more adherent, received higher doses, had fewer dose reductions, and were treated for longer durations compared with patients treated with a twice- weekly dose regimen ( Bringhen et al, 2010 ; Reeder et al, 2010) . Reducing the burden of treatment with once- weekly dosing is also expected to improve quality of life in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, which has been shown to be dependent on the ability to maintain a social role and meaningful activities ( Mortensen and Salomo, 2016). A once-weekly dose regimen would substantially reduce the time burden on patient s and caregiver s over twice- weekly dosing. The total time for a patient to receive IV treatment includes transportation time to and from the clinic, wait time, pre- infusion preparation time, infusion and post -infusion time, and lost work or leisure time for family members or friends who accompany patients to the clinic . Travel time to the medical facility was < 30 minutes for most patients, with 40% of patients traveling over 1 hour, based on a study in the United Kingdom and an averag e of 30 to 35 minutes based on a survey in the US ( Barrett -Lee et al, 2007; data on file) . Thus, a once- weekly dose regimen w ould represent substantial time- savings for patients and their caregivers. In summary, in the setting of RRMM, the ENDEAVOR study demonstrated that the labelled dose of twice weekly carfilzomib (56 mg/m 2) significantly improved survival. Approved"

Once weekly data from the A.R.R.O.W. and CHAMPION 1 trials demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a once weekly dose of 70 mg/m 2 and cross trial comparison between ENDEAVOR and CHAMPION 1 indicate there may be no loss of efficacy with weekly dosing ( Berenson et al, 2016 ). The A.R.R.O.W. study results demonstrated that treatment with once weekly Kyprolis and dexamethasone at the dose of 70 mg/m 2 (30 min infusion) resulted in s uperior PFS and ORR, compared to the twice weekly administration of Kd 27 mg/m2 in patients with RRMM . The safety profile was comparable in the two arms. Based on A .R.R.O.W . data, the Kd once weekly dose of 70 mg/m2 was included in the US label. Meanwhi le, other once weekly dosing combination regimens including carfilzomib based triplets are being explored and this study is expected to add the data evidence generated from the multi- center community setting . The goal of the study is to demonstrate feasibility and adherence of weekly combinations of carfilzomib. The initial treatment with 2 cycles of twice weekly therapy is designed to provide the more familiar labelled treatment for subjects with RRMM. 3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment The following benefit risk assessment supports the conduct of this clinical trial. Reference should be made to the Carfilzomib Investigator’s Brochure for further data on carfilzomib. 3.3.1 Therapeutic Context Multiple myeloma is a clonal neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells , the second most common hematologic malignancy, and is responsible for approximately 80 000 annual deaths worldwide (1% of cancer deaths). The 5 -year prevalence of MM worldwide was estimated at 229 000 persons. Multiple myeloma is a disease of older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years ( Howlader et al, 2013 ). While treatment for MM will typically induce remission, the disease eventually relapses in most patients. As patients go through cycles of relapse and remission, the duration of remi ssion becomes shorter with each successive line of therapy, and eventually becomes nonresponsive to therapy (Richardson et al, 2007 ; Kumar et al, 2004 ). The goal of treatment for RRMM is to achieve the longest PFS and subsequently OS. The depth of response is associated with OS and a critical factor to achieving that goal (Chanan- Khan and Giralt, 2010 ; Richardson et al, 2007). Additional goals include: Approved"

Doublet therapy combining a PI and steroid remains an important and commonly used option for many patients . The ENDEAVOR trial was a phase 3 head- to-head comparison of Vd and Kd in RRMM. Patients treated with Kd in the ENDEAVOR study had improved PFS compared with those treated with Vd: median PFS 18.7 vs 9.4 months (HR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.44 -0.65; p < 0.0001) (Dimopoulos et al, 2016 ) and improved OS in subjects followed for a minimum of 3 years , median OS 47.6 vs 40 months (HR = 0.79, 95% CI, 0.648- 0.964; one- sided p = 0.01) (Dimopoulos et al, 2017). All patient subgroups demonstrated clinical benefit from Kd compared with Vd (Moreau et al, 201 5; Chng et al, 2017 ). The ENDEAVOR study led to expanded approval of carfilzomib in patients who had received 1 to 3 lines of prior therapy. Based on these findings, Kd is the only doublet regimen on the NCCN recommended preferred list for RRMM (NCCN Multiple Myeloma, 2018 ). The CHAMPION -1 study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carfilzomib administered once weekly in combination with dexamethasone to subjects with RRMM. The MTD was determined to be 70 mg/m 2. The efficacy and safety of 70 mg/m2 once- weekly dosing regimen was evaluated in 104 subjects. Among this cohort, 52% of subjects were refractory to bortezomib. For the overall population, the overall response rate (ORR) at 70 mg/m 2 was 77% (71% in patients refractory to bortezomib) with 13% achieving complete response ( CR). The median PFS was 12.6 months ( Berenson et al, 2016). The median PFS for the ENDEAVOR (56 mg/m2 twice weekly) and CHAMPION -1 (70 mg/m2 once weekly) trials were 18.7 and 12.6 months, respectively. However, bortezomib- refractory subjects were not eligible in the ENDEAVOR trial. Among the 50 subjects who were not refractory to bortezomib in the CHAMPION- 1 trial, the Kaplan- Meier median PFS were 21.0 months (no prior bortezomib exposure) and 19.4 months (prior bortezomib exposure but not refractory), which compared favorably to the results in the ENDEAVOR study ( Amgen data on file) . The MTD defined in the CHAMPION -1 trial was used in the phase 3 A .R.R.O.W. trial, in which subjects with RRMM were treated with Kd with carfilzomib dosed either at Approved"

The study included 478 subjects with RRMM who received 2 or 3 prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an IMiD. Subjects treated with the once- weekly Kd regimen achieved a statistically significant superior PFS with a m edian of 11.2 months compared with 7.6 months for those treated with the twice -weekly Kd regimen (HR = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.54 -0.88) ( A.R.R.O.W. Press release, 2017 ). The safety profile was comparable in the two arms. Based on A.R.R.O.W. data, the Kd once weekly dose of 70 mg/m2 was included in the US label. These results provide additional evidence supporting the efficacy and tolerability of the once- weekly Kd regimen. Other once weekly dosing combination regimens of carfilzomib are being explored. Triplet therapies are emerging as the SOC for RRMM. The combination of a proteasome inhibitor (PI) with an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) and steroid is a commonly used and guideline recommended option for patients with RRMM. Patients refractory to PIs and IMiDs have extremely poor prognosis with median OS of approximately 13 months and PFS about 5 months ( Kumar et al, 2017 ). Current treatment practices lead to a high prevalence of dual, lenalidomide- bortezomib refractory relapses in later lines of therapy. The ASPIRE study demonstrated the superiority of the combination of carfilzomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd; 27 mg/m2 twice -weekly) over lenalidomide with dexamethasone. Superiority of the KRd regimen was demonstrated in terms of median PFS (26.3 vs 17.6 months, HR = 0.69), overall response rate (87.1% vs 66.7%, odds ratio = 3.47) ( Stewart et al, 2015), health- related quality -of-life (Stewart et al, 2016), as well as OS (median OS: 48.3 vs 40.4 months, HR = 0.79 [ Siegel et al, 2018]). Safety results from the final analysis were consistent with the known safety profile of carfilzomib, with no new safety signals observed after extended follow -up. Despite the favorable benefit -risk profile of the KRd regimen, as demonstrated in the ASPIRE study, compliance with the currently available twice- weekly KRd dosing schedule may be less than optimal because of the convenience- related attributes of this regimen. Pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) has been approved for subjects with RRMM and has proven efficacy in subjects who were refractory to both bortezomib and lenalidomide. Several phase 2 studies have demonstrated improved efficacy and safety of adding carfilzomib to Pd (KPd) in advanced RRMM compared to historical outcomes with Pd.

Dose modification instructions for the management of toxicities is provided in Section 7.4. Where applicable, risk minimization measures specific to a particular risk are al so provided. Additional information regarding important identified risks as well as adverse drug reactions for carfilzomib are detailed in the Kyprolis USPI . Embryo -fetal toxicity is associated with lenalidomide treatment. Investigators and subjects mus t comply with the requirements of restricted distribution programs if one is present in the local region; (eg, REVLIMID Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy [REMS] program in the United States). Additional information regarding risks for lenalidomide are described in REVLIMID USPI and REVLIMID Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or local prescribing information. Embryo -fetal toxicity is associated with pomalidomide treatment. Investigators and subjects must comply with the requirements of restricted distribution programs if one is present in the local region; (eg, POMALYST REMS program in the United States). Additional information regarding risks for pomalidomide are described in Pomalyst USPI or local prescribing information. 3.3.3.1 Risks 3.3.3.1.1 Cardiac Toxicity In the pooled data set (n = 2944), the subject incidence of cardiac failure and myocardial infarction was 7.2% and 2.0%, respectively. The subject incidence of serious cardiac failure and serious myocardial infarction was 4.1% and 1.3%, respectively. Fatal outcomes have been observed with cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest. The risk of cardiac failure is increased in elderly patients (≥ 75 years). Subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III and IV heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, and conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by medications were not eligible for clinical trial and may be at greater risk for cardiac complications.

Some events have been fatal. 3.3.3.1.4 Dyspnea The subject incidence of dyspnea was 31.0% with a subject incidence of 2.3% for serious events. The cause of the dyspnea should be investigated promptly and treated accordingly (see Section 12.9 for more details). 3.3.3.1.5 Hypertension The subject incidence of hypertension was 20.3% with a subject incidence of 1% for serious events. Blood pressure is monitored while on study and hypertension should be treated as needed. If the hypertension cannot be controlled, the carfilzomib dose should be held. In case of hypertensive crisis, carfilzomib should be stopped until the hypertensive crisis resolved. The investigator may consider restarting carfilzomib based on an individual benefit -risk assessme nt. 3.3.3.1.6 Acute Renal Failure The subject incidence of acute renal failure was 10.8% with a subject incidence of 5.3% for serious events. Some events have been fatal. Acute renal failure was reported more frequently in patients with advanced RRMM who received carfilzomib monotherapy. The incidence was increased in patients with a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance, calculated using Cockcroft and Gault equation, prior to receiving carfilzomib. Renal function should be monitored with regular measureme nt of the serum creatinine and/or estimated glomerular filtration r ate (GFR ).

The dexamethasone that is admi nistered as part of the regimen is expected to decrease the incidence and severity of infusion- related reactions. 3.3.3.1.9 Hemorrhage and Thrombocytopenia The subject incidence of hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia was 19.5% and 33.8%, respectively. The subject incidence of serious hemorrhage and serious thrombocytopenia was 2.2% and 1.5%, respectively. Thrombocytopenia is a significant risk factor for hemorrhage events. Fatal outcomes have been reported for these events. Carfilzomib causes thrombocytopenia with platelet nadirs observed between day 8 and 15 of each 28 -day cycle with recovery to baseline platelet count by the start of the next cycle. Serial monitoring of platelets will be performed every 28 days throughout treatment period (see Schedule of Activities , Table 2-1 ).

ENDEAVOR compared carfilzomib administered at 56 mg/m2 over a 30- min infusion twice per week with dexamethasone against Vd in subjects with RRMM who had received between 1 and 3 previous treatments, a similar subject population to what is being proposed in this phase 2 trial. The carfilz omib arm proved superior at the first interim analysis for efficacy reducing the risk of progression or death by 47% (median PFS [Kd vs Vd]: 18.7 months vs 9.4 months), and at the second interim Approved"

Grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in 81% of subjects in the Kd group and 71% of subjects in the Vd group. The most frequent grade 3 cardiopulmonary events of interest reported in the Kd and Vd groups, respectively, included hypertension 15% vs 3%, pneumonia 9% vs 9%, dyspnea 6% vs 2%, and congestive heart failure in 6% vs 2%. Based on the results of the ENDEAVOR study, the FDA approved carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with RRMM who have received 1 to 3 lines of therapy. The dose of carfilzomib to be used in combination with dexamethasone is 56 mg/m 2 twice weekly following an initial treatment with 20 mg/m2 on the first 2 days of treatment ( Kyprolis USPI ). The safety and efficacy of the 70 mg/m2 dose has been evaluated in the phase 2 (CHAMPION- 1) and phase 3 (A.R.R.O.W. ) studies. Carfilzomib pharmacokinetics in the CHAMPION- 1 study with the 70 mg/m2 once weekly dose showed higher maximum concentration than that with the 56 mg/m2 twice -weekly dose (2390 ng/mL vs 2079 ng/mL, respectively). However, the area under the curve was higher with 56 mg/m2 twice a week (1896 ng •hr/mL vs 1030 ng•hr/mL per week). The CHAMPION- 1 study, a phase 1/2 trial, provided additional safety data for the 70 mg/m2 weekly dosing of carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone. In that study, 104 subjects were treated for a median of 7.7 months at the MTD of 70 mg/m2 weekly in combination with dexamethasone 40 mg weekly in a similar patient population as the proposed study. At 70 mg/m2, the most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events were fatigue (11%) and hypertension (7%). For specific adverse events of interest, the rates of grade ≥ 3 hypertension, dyspnea, cardiac failure, and peripheral neuropathy were 7%, 5%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. Discontinuations due to adverse events were reported to occur in 12% of subjects. Discontinuations due to adverse events and the incidence of specific cardiovascular events of interest were all lower than that reported in the phase 3 ENDEAVOR trial ( Berenson et al, 2016). The MTD defined in the CHAMPION -1 trial was used in the phase 3 A .R.R.O.W. trial, in which subjects with RRMM were treated with Kd with carfilzomib dosed either at 27 mg/m2 twice -weekly or 70 mg/m2 once -weekly. The study included 478 subjects with RRMM who received 2 or 3 prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an IMiD. Subjects treated with the once- weekly Kd regimen achieved a statistically significant superior PFS with a median of 11.2 months compared to 7.6 months for those treated with the Approved"

The overall safety profile of the once -weekly Kd regimen was comparable to that of the twice- weekly reg imen. The most frequently reported treatment -emergent adverse events (greater than or equal to 20%) in either treatment arm were anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, insomnia and pyrexia ( A.R.R.O.W. Press release, 2017 ). With the results from the A.R .R.O.W. study, the Kd 70 mg/m2 once weekly dosing schedule was approved in the US, providing the US practicing centers one more option to treat MM patients with relapse/refractory disease. 5.4.2 Justification for Investigational Product Dose for KRd and KPd Arms The safety experience from 56 subjects with RRMM with weekly KRd 56 mg/m 2 (n = 10) or 70 mg/m2 (n = 46) in Study CFZ013 (NCT02335983) has not identified any safety concerns which would preclude the investigation of KRd 56 mg/m2 weekly in this study. The subject incidence of grade ≥ 3 treatment -emergent adverse events was 70.0% in the KRd 56 mg/m2 group and 69.6% in the KRd 70 mg/m2 group. Grade ≥ 3 adverse events reported in more than 2 patients were thrombocytopenia (56 mg/m2, n = 2; 70 mg/m2, n = 4), neutropenia (56 mg/m2, n = 1; 70 mg/m2, n = 4), anemia (56 mg/m2, n = 2; 70 mg/m2, n = 3), pneumonia (70 mg/m2, n = 4), decreased platelet count (56 mg/m2, n = 1; 70 mg/m2, n = 3), decreased neutrophil count (56 mg/m2, n = 2; 70 mg/m2, n = 2), hypertension (56 mg/m2, n = 1; 70 mg/m2, n = 3), and hypophosphatemia (70 mg/m2, n = 4 ). There were 3 deaths in the KRd 70 mg/m2 group (1 each due to cardiac arrest, cardiac disorder, and disease progression). No deaths occurred in the KRd 56 mg/m2 group ( Biran et a l, 2018). The median weekly dose of carfilzomib was 53.2 mg/m2 for subjects administered 20/56 mg/m2 and 62.4 mg/m2 for subjects administered 20/70 mg/m2. The median relative dose intensity of carfilzomib was 90.7 for subjects administered 20/56 mg/m2 and 88.2 for subjects administered 20/70 mg/m2. The median weekly dose and the relative dose intensity suggest that 20/56 mg/m2 weekly dose was tolerable. Available efficacy results indicated similar efficacy (as determined by ORR) with either KRd 56 mg/m2 or KRd 70 mg/m2 (90.0% versus 89.1%, respectively) to the effect previously reported for twice- weekly KRd (27 mg/m2) in the randomized phase 3 ASPIRE study ( Biran et al, 2018). Based on evidence from phase 2 studies of KPd, weekly doses up to 70 mg/m2 in subjects with first relapse and up to 54 mg/m2 in subjects with advanced myeloma using a twice -weekly schedule of carfilzomib have been tolerated (Sonneveld et al, 2018; Approved"
42,page_42,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20170596 Date: 20 May 2019 Page 43 of 132 CONFIDENTIAL Shah et al, 2015 ). Consistent with the observation from the A.R.R.O.W. study, that adjustment from a twice -weekly to a once -weekly schedule was demonstrated to have a favorable benefit/risk profile with no new safety issues identified, the CFZ013 trial identified 56 to 70 mg/m2 weekly carfilzomib combined with Rd to have an acceptable safety profile. Given these data, this phase 2 study will evaluate the 56 mg/m2 once- weekly dose schedule for KRd and KPd triplet therapies. 5.5 Patient Input on Study Design Not applicable. 6.

The subject must personally sign and date the IRB and Amgen approved informed consent before commencement of study -specific procedures . A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met all elig ibility criteria. The investigator is to document this decision and date, in the subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form (CRF). Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study (defined as the point when the subject signs the informed consent) receives a unique subject identification number before any study -related activities/procedures are performed. The subject identification number will be assigned via IXRS . This number will be used to identify the subject thr oughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject. The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is rescreened. 6.4 Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently enrolled in the study.

Carfilzomib is to be a dministered as an IV infusion over 30 (± 5) minutes. Subjects should receive 250 mL of normal saline or equivalent IV fluid prior to and after each dose during cycle 1. After cycle 1, at the discretion of treating physician, subjects may receive up to but no more than 250 mL of normal saline or equivalent fluid prior to each dose of carfilzomib. For subjects at risk of TLS, see Section 7.1.4.3 . Mechanical infusion pumps are recommended, but gravity -dependent infusions are permitted if the 30 -minute infusion duration can be reliably maintained. Carfilzomib infusion must occur at a facility capable of managing hypersensitivity reactions. Each subject’s first dose will be calculated based upon baseline BSA per the Mosteller formula. In subjects with BSA of greater than 2.2 m2, the dose should be capped based on a BSA of 2.2 m2. The dose for each subject should not be revised unless the subject experiences a change in body weight of ≥ 20% compared to baseline or last calculation of BSA, in which case the BSA and dose should be recalculated. The dose can also be modified in response to toxicity following the dose modification guideline tables (see Section 7.4). The planned dose, dose administered, start date/time, stop date/time, reason for change in planned dose or schedule, and package lot number of carfilzomib are to be recorded on each subject's CRF . 7.1.1.2.1 Starting Dose in Hepatic Insufficiency For subjects with mild hepatic insufficiency during screening, the initial dose of carfilzomib on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 should be reduced by 25% to 15 mg/m 2.

Risk factors for TLS include but are not limited to: elevated lactate dehydrogenase, beta -2 microglobulin > 5.5 mg/L , elevated uric acid, elevated circulating plasma cells, elevated serum creatinine, presence of soft tissue plasmacytomas, or international stage III disease. Subjects at elevated risk of TLS should be hydrated with 500 mL of normal saline or equivalent IV fluid prior to and 250 mL after the first dose of carfilzomib and each subsequent dose until the investigator determines that the risk of TLS has resolved or up to the end of the first cycle. 7.1.4.4 Proton- pump Inhibitor Proton- pump inhibitor (omeprazole or equivalent) is required while on dexamethasone . 7.1.4.5 Other Permitted Therapies The following medications and supportive therapies are examples of support therapies that may be used during the study: • Antifungal prophylaxis: Fluconazole 200 mg/day (minimum) or equivalent therapy is recommended, especially for patients living (coming from) areas known to have high incidence of environmental mycoses. • Prophylaxis for Pneumocystosis jirovenci: Pneumocystis jirovenci pneumonia prophylaxis should be considered, as per institutional guidelines while on dexamethasone. • Bone- preserving therapy: bone preserving therapy (bisphosphonate or other bone preserving therapy) is strongly recommended for all subjects with evidence of lytic destruction of bone or with osteopenia ( Gralow et al, 2013 ; Terpos et al, 2013). Commercially available IV bisphosphonates (pamidronate and zoledronic acid) or monoclonal antibodies are preferred when available, used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, as described in the prescribing information, for subjects with osteolytic or osteopenic myelomatous bone disease. Oral bisphosphonates may be used as alternatives if IV bisphosphonates are not available at the study site. It is preferred that investigators use the same route of bisphosphonate therapy for all subjects at their sites. • Subjects who are using bone preserving therapy when they enter the study should continue the same treatment. Subjects with evidence of lytic destruction of bone or with osteopenia who are not using bone preserving therapy at the time of enrollment should start as soon as possible during cycle 1 or 2 of treatment. Investigators should not start bone- preserving therapy during the study, unless it has been agreed with the sponsor that there is no sign of disease progression. • Antivirals, antihypertensives, statins, and antibiotics . • Hyperglycemia medical management .

Carfilzomib may be discontinued, temporarily delayed, or dosage temporarily reduced, in the event of a treatment -related toxicity that, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants the discontinuation, temporary delay or dose reduction. Carfilzomib dose must be modified based on specified toxicities, as indicated in Table 7-3 and Table 7-4 . The subject will be considered on protocol treatment while receiving carfilzomib. Carfilzomib (both twice- weekly and once- weekly regimen) must be discontinued permanently if a delay of more than 6 weeks is required due to unresolved toxicity. If day 1 of a cycle is delayed, day 1 of subsequent cycles should be adjusted accordingly to maintain the 28 -day cycle duration. However, if a wit hin-cycle dose is delayed, then the dates of the subsequent within- cycle doses should not be adjusted. Approved"

The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit : • The site must attempt to conta ct the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or is able to continue in the study. • In cases in which the subject is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts are to be documented in the subject’s medical record. • If the subject continues to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. • For subjects who are lost to follow -up, the investigator can search publicly available records where permitted to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the data set(s) produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible. 9. Study Assessments and Procedures Study procedures and their time points are summarized in the Schedule of Activities (see Table 2 -1). As protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed if an enrolled subject is subsequently determined to be ineligible for the study, this must be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject is to continue or discontinue study treatment . Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Activities, is essential and required for study conduct . Approved"

After the subject has signed the informed consent form, the site will register the subject in the IXRS and screen the subject in order to assess eligibility for participation. The screening window i s up to 28 days for bone marrow aspirate, bone lesion assessment, and plasmacytoma assessment and up to 21 days for all other assessments . All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects meet all eligibility crit eria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, see Section 6.4, as applicable. If a subject has not met all eligibility criteria at the end of the screening period, the subject will be registered as a screen fail. Screen fail subjects may be eligible for rescreening 1 time. Rescreen subjects must first be registered as screen failures in IXRS and subsequently registered as rescreens. Once the subject is registered as rescreened, a new 28-day (for bone marrow aspirate, bone lesion assessment, and plasmacytoma assessment ) or a new 21- day (for all other assessments) screening window will begin. Subjects will retain the same subject identification number assigned at the original screening. If the rescreening period begins more than 28 days (for bone marrow aspirate, bone lesion assessment, and plasmacytoma assessment ) or more than 21 days (for all other assessments) after the original signing of the ICF , all screening procedures, including informed consent , must be repeated. 9.1.2 Treatm ent Period Visits will occur per the Schedule of Activities ( Table 2-1 ). The date of the first dose of carfilzomib is defined as day 1. All subsequent doses and study visits will be scheduled based on the day 1 date. All doses should be administered on the scheduled day + 2 days, and the day 8 and 15 doses should have at least a 5 -day treatment -free interval (see Section 7.1.1.2 for additional details ). Administration of protocol -required therapies is to be administered last d uring each visit that it is required. Approved"

After the safety follow -up, subjects who remain on study are required to complete disease response assessments and will be followed for subsequent antimyeloma treatment every 28 ± 7 days until up to 12 months from enrollment, death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent or progressive disease ( PD), whichever occurs first. 9.2 Description of General Study Assessments and P rocedures The sections below provide a description of the individual study procedures for required time points . 9.2.1 General Assessments 9.2.1.1 Informed Consent All subjects must sign and personally dat e the IRB -approved in formed consent before any study -spec ific procedures are performed . 9.2.1.2 Demographics Demographic data collection including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in order to study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness . 9.2.1.3 Medical History The investigator or designee will collect a complete medical and surgical history that started within 5 years prior to enrollment through signing of the ICF. Medical history will include information on the subject's concurrent medical conditions. Record all findings on the medical history CRF. The current toxicity grade will be collected for each condition that has not resolved. Cardiovascular risk factors are to be recorded for the subject including history of cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, per ipheral vascular disease), arrhythmias and previous abnormal ECG findings (eg, ventricular hypertrophy and/or ischemic changes) , hypertension (include treatment history), thromboembolism, hyperlipidemia (include statin use), and diabetes. Family history o f coronary artery disease in first degree relatives with onset < 65 years of age for female relative or < 55 years of age for male relative should also be recorded. In addition to the medical history above, multiple myeloma history must date back to the original diagnosis. For subjects who were previously referred to a research site, critical referral information will constitute multiple myeloma information from source notes. Approved"

Physical examination findings should be recorded on the appropriate CRF (eg, medical history, event). A complete physical examination includes examination of cardiovascular and respiratory systems, abdominal examination, and general neurolog ic examination. Clinically significant abnormal physical examination findings identified prior to the signing of the ICF should be reported as part of medical history, not as adverse events. 9.2.1.5 Physical Measurements 9.2.1.5.1 Height and Weight Height in centimeters is to be measured without shoes. Weight in kilograms is to be measured without shoes. 9.2.1.5.2 Body Mass Index Body Mass Index (BMI) is to be calculated using the following formula: BMI (kg/m 2) = weight (kg)/(height [cm]/100)2 9.2.1.5.3 Body Surface Area Body Surface Area (BSA) is to be calculated using the Mostelle r formula: BSA (m²) = ([Height(cm) × Weight(kg)] / 3600)½ 9.2.1.6 Substance Abuse History Obtain a detailed history of prior and/or concurrent use of tobacco (smoking and tobacco) . 9.2.1.7 Performance Status The subject’s performance status will be assessed using the ECOG PS ( Section 12.10 ). 9.2.2 E fficacy Assessments Investigators are required to follow International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG ) criteria for assessment of response and disease progression (see Section 12.8). Disease assessments are required during screening to confirm eligibility and for determination of disease response (per the Schedule of Activities , Table 2 -1). Per IMWG, determination of disease response requires : serum free light chain (SFLC), serum and uri ne protein electrophoresis (SPEP, UPEP, respectively) , serum and urine immunofixation (SIFE, UIFE, respectively), bone marrow aspirate (for CR confirmation; Section 9.2.2.1 ), corrected calcium, and plasmacytoma evaluation, if present at screening ( Section 9.2.2.3 ).

Disease assessments based on local laboratory data will start on day 1 of cycle 1 and are performed every 28 (± 7) days regardless of cycle duration, including dose delays until confirmed PD or cycle 12. The cycle 12 disease assessment is conducted 28 (± 7) days post cycle 12, day 1. Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to confirmed PD should continue to comple te disease assessments until up to 12 months from enrollment, death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent or PD, whichever occurs first. 9.2.2.1 Bone Marrow Sample Evaluation Including FISH Assessment A baseline bone marrow sample evaluation with fluorescenc e in-situ hybridization ( FISH, aspirate slides and/or biopsy) will be performed prior to first dose and will be used to confirm the diagnosis and quantify the percent (%) of myeloma cell involvement. Biopsy or aspirate slides obtained as standard of care may be used as baseline if performed within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1. Additional bone marrow biopsy or aspirate should be obtained as clinically indicated to confirm a response of CR or stringent CR. 9.2.2.2 Bone Lesion Assessment (Skeletal Survey, Computed Tomography , or Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography ) Skeletal survey will include lateral radiograph of the skull, anteroposterior and lateral views of the spine, and anteroposterior views of the pelvis, ribs, femora, and humeri. Low-dose whole body computed tomography (CT) or fluorodeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) may be used in place of skeletal survey. Bone lesion assessment will be conducted at screening and for confirmation of PD, if PD is based on bone lesions (see IMW G criteria in Section 12.8). Bone lesion assessments obtained as part of standard of care may be used as baseline if performed within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1. The same method of assessment used at baseline will be used throughout the study. These imaging studies will be read locally. 9.2.2.3 Extramedullary Plasmacytoma Extramedullar y plasmacytoma evaluation will be conducted at screening only if a lesion is clinically suspected. The evaluation may be performed within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1 if performed as a part of standard of care. If an extramedullary plasmacytoma is detected, evaluation will be repeated to confirm a response of MR or better or to confirm PD (see IMWG criteria in Section 12.8).

The same technique (which may include clinical evaluation by palpation, ultrasound, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or PET/CT) should be employed for each measurement of plasmacytoma dimensi ons as clinically appropriate ( Section 12.8). Bidimensional lesion measurements should be performed (see Section 9.2.2.3.1 ). 9.2.2.3.1 Sum of Perpendicular Dimensions Response and progression of soft tissue plasmacytomas or progression of bone lesions should be determined by the change in the sum of perpendicular dimensions (SPD) measured radiographically or by physical examination, as clinically indicated. The SPD is defined as the sum of the longest dimension added to the second longest dimension that is perpendicular to the longest dimension. Sum of perpendicular dimensions of bone lesions will be measured only for evidence of progression. The SPD for a bone lesion is defined the same as it is for a plasmacytoma. An increase of 50% or more from the nadir in the size of any bone lesion provides evidence for PD, see Section 12.8 for more details. 9.2.2.4 Progressive Disease Assessment Progressive disease (including PD due to development of hypercalcemia attributed solely to recurrence/progression of multiple myeloma) will be based on local laboratory evaluation. Confirmation of PD (using 2 consecutive assessments) will be required only when it is determined by laboratory evaluations and not if identified via imaging as per IMWG criteria. The assessments outlined in Section 12.8 are required for determination of PD. Subjects should be considered to have PD if they meet the c riteria for progression by a variable that was not considered measurable at baseline; however, for subjects who had a measurable serum or urine M -spike at baseline, progression should not be defined by increases in SFLC alone ( Kumar et al, 2016). 9.2.3 Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Schedule of Activities see ( Table 2 -1).

The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the ICF through the 30 (+3) days after the last dose of study drug(s) are reported using the Event CRF. 9.2.3.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the ICF through 30 (+3) days after the last dose of study drug(s) are reported using the Event CRF. All serious adverse events will be collected, recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated in Section 12.4 . The investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. The criteria for grade 4 in the CTCAE grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria for serious adverse events. It is left to the investigator’s judgment to report these grade 4 abnormalities as serious adverse events . 9.2.3.1.1.3 Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required Reporting Period There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study. However, these serious adverse events can be reported to Amgen. Per local requirements in some countries, investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become aware of after e nd of study. If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report them to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event . Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases and handled accordingly based on relationship to investigational product .

Information provided about the serious adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the Event CRF. 9.2.3.1.4 Regulatory Reporting Requir ements for Serious Adverse Events If subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen. Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of serious advers e events is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs , and investi gators . Individual safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary .

The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and recording any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the Event CRF. The investigator must determine whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values. In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events. However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events. Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event .

EORTC QLQ -C30 includes 30 items grouped into: • five quality of life categories : physical, social, emotional, cognitive and role performance; • three scales o f symptoms : fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting; • a global scale of quality -of-life and individual items related to the symptoms of the disease and its treatment; dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea and • an item on economic impac t The responses to the scale items refer to “last week,” with the exception of the subject’s physical performance scale, where the timeframe involved is the present. 9.2.6.2 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality -of-life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma Module (EORTC QLQ -MY20) In addition to the QLQ -C30, a number of disease -specific modules have been produced by the EORTC. This modular approach was adopted by EORTC in recognition of the limitations of generic patient -reported outcome instruments to provide an appropriate coverage of disease- specific concerns. Modules specific to tumor site, treatment modality, and quality of life have been developed. These were designed to be administered alongside the core questionnaire (QLQ -C30); lik e the core questionnaire, the modules were designed for use in cancer clinical trials. The MM module (the QLQ -MY20) was developed by EORTC in 1999 ( Bjordal et al, 2000 ). A summary of the QLQ -C30 and QLQ -MY20 subscales are provided in Section 12.16. Approved"

Safety Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up and Reporting Definition of Adverse Event Adverse Event Definition • An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject irrespective of a causal relationship with th e study treatment. • Note: An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a treatment, combination product, medical device or procedure. Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition • Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, electrocardiogram , radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, that are considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). • Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre- existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. • New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug- drug interaction. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an adverse event/serious adverse event unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses are to be reported regardless of sequelae. • For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to multiple myeloma report all known signs and symptoms. Death due to disease progression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor type (eg, metastatic pancreatic cancer). Note: The term “disease progression” should not be used to describe the disease- related event or adverse event. • “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as adverse event or serious adverse event if they fulfill the definition of an adverse event or serious adverse event. Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition • Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy) : the condition that leads to the procedure is the adverse event. • Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). • Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Approved"
103,page_103,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20170596 Date: 20 May 2019 Page 104 of 132 CONFIDENTIAL Definition of Serious Adverse Event A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria : Results in death (fatal) Immediately l ife-threatening The term “life- threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are an adverse event. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event is to be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disrupti on. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Other medically important serious event Medical or scientific judgment is to be exercised in deciding whether serious adverse event reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events are typically to be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number , will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to Amgen. • The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the adverse event/serious adverse event. Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Assessment of Severity The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each adverse event and serious adverse event reported during the study. The assessment of severity will be based on: The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , version 4.03 which is available at the following location : http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . Assessment of Causality • The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational product , protocol -required therapies, and/or study -mandated procedure and each occurrence of each adverse event/serious adverse event. • Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship between investigational product and the event . • The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. • Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. • The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. Approved"
105,page_105,"Product: Carfilzomib Protocol Number: 20170596 Date: 20 May 2019 Page 106 of 132 CONFIDENTIAL • For each adverse event/serious adverse event, the investigato r must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event/serious adverse event and has provided an assessment of causality. • There may be situations in which a serious adverse event has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the serious adverse event data. • The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send a serious adverse event follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. • The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event • The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Amgen to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the adverse event or serious adverse event as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. • If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen. • New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed Event CRF. • The investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to Amgen within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of Serious Adverse Event Serious Adverse Event Reporting via Electronic Data Collection Tool • The primary mechanism for reporting serious adverse event will be the electronic data capture (EDC) system via the Safety Report Form. • If the EDC system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will report the information to Amgen using an electronic Serious Adverse Contingency Report Form (see Figure 12-1 ) within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event . • The site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available. • After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC system will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. • If a site receives a report of a new serious adverse event from a study subject or receives updated data on a previously reported serious adverse event after the EDC has been taken off-line, then the site can report this information on a paper Serious Adverse E vent Report Form (see Figure 12-1 ).

Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy and Lactation Information Study -specific contraception requirements for male and female of childbearing poten tial are outlined in Section 6.2. Male and female subjects of childbearing potential must receive pregnancy prevention counseling and be advised of the risk to the fetus if they become pregnant or father a child during treatment and for 30 days (for female subjects) and 90 days (for male subjects) after the last dose of protocol -required therapies . Additional medications given during the study may alter the contraceptive requirements. These additional medications may require female subjects to use highly effective methods of contraception and/or for an increased length of time. In addition, male subjects may also be required to use contraception for an increased length of time. The investigator must discuss these contraceptive changes with the subject . Definition of Females of Childbearing Potential A female is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy . Females in the following categories are not considered female of childbearing potential : • Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: − Documented hysterectomy ; − Documented bilateral salpingectomy ; or − Documented bilateral oophorectomy . Note : Site personnel documentation from the following sources is acceptable: 1) review of subject’s medical records; 2) subject’s medical examination; or 3) subject’s medical history interview . • Premenarchal female • Postmenopausal female − A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insuffici ent. − Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the non -hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmatio n of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. Approved"

Plasmacytomas of lesser size will be considered non- measurable. The requirement for bi -directional measurements applies only to plasmacytomas. The plasmacytoma specifications for PD are based on the sponsor’s inter pretation of the IMWG -URC and practical considerations for study execution. For defining nadir, in the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physicia n/Independent Review Committee discretion (eg, a possible laboratory error), that value will not be considered when determining the lowest value.

Guidelines for Documenting Prior Treatment Patients must have documented relapse after at least 1, but no more than 3 prior treatment regimens or lines of therapy for multiple myeloma. When documenting prior treatments for multiple myeloma, the following guidelines should be used (Rajkumar et al, 2015): • A new line of therapy is considered to start when a planned course of therapy is modified to include other treatment agents (alone or in combination) as a result of lack of adequate response, progressive disease (PD) (even if the level of progression has not yet met International Myeloma Working Group- Uniform Response Criteria [IMWG -URC] for PD), relapse, or toxicity. • An increase in dose of therapy, with the intention of recapturing response in a patient who has evidence of progression on that therapy, is considered a new therapy. • A new line of therapy is also considered to start when a planned period of observation off therapy is interrupted by a need for additional treatment for the disease. • Examples of 1 line of therapy include: − Induction therapy and stem cell transplant followed by planned maintenance therapy (provided there is no intervening PD) − Induction therapy followed by maintenance therapy (provided there is no intervening PD) • Documentation of at least partial response (PR) to at least 1 prior therapy • For patients with prior carfilzomib therapy, documentation of response (≥ PR) must be available for the most recent previous carfilzomib therapy as well as stop date. Documentation that the patient was not removed from carfilzomib therapy due to toxicity must also be available. For patients with prior therapy with carfilzomib, the start of the 6 -month treatment -free interval is when carfilzomib is discontinued even if other portions of the regimen are continued.

In the light of A.R.R.O.W. approval, and based on the feedback from investigators, the protocol amendment increased the cycles of Kd once weekly dosing schedule while keeping the total treatment cycles. The initial treatment with 2 cycles of twice weekly therapy is designed to provide the more familiar labelled treatment for subjects with RRMM. • Triplet therapy are emerging as standard of care for RRMM patients. The ASPIRE study demonstrated the superiority of the combination of carfilzomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd; 27 mg/m 2 twice -weekly) over lenalidomide with dexamethasone. However, despite the favorable benefit -risk profile of the KRd regimen, compliance with the currently available twice- weekly KRd dosing schedule may be less than optimal because of the convenience- related attributes of this regimen. The ongoing Study CFZ013 evaluates once- weekly KRd in patients with RRMM and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Available efficacy results have shown similar efficacy to the effect previously reported for twice- weekly KRd (27 mg/m2) in the ASPIRE study (Biran et al, 2018). Hence, to better reflect the clinical practice, and to investigate a more convenient KRd once weekly dosing schedule in the community setting, the protocol amendment is adding a KRd arm, starting with 2 cycles of the approved twice weekly dosing schedule followed by 10 cycles of the investigational once weekly dosing schedule. • Pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) has been approved for subjects with RRMM. Several phase 2 studies have demonstrated improved efficacy of adding carfilzomib to Pd (KPd) in patients with RRMM compared to historical data for Pd with safety consistent with carfilzomibs known profile. Based on the phase 2 studies, the protocol amendment is adding a KPd arm and will further investigate the once weekly KPd dosing regimen. Considering the safety data on KPd is limited compared to other Kyprolis containing regimens, a Data Review Team will be implemented to review the safety data. Approved"
