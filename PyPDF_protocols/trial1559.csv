This translates to 63,000 new cases a year with 14,000 associated deaths.1 Metastatic disease is found in 30% of subjects at diagnosis. Close to 90‐ 95% of metastatic disease is of the clear ‐cell histology.2 Multiple scoring systems are available to characterize prognosis in treatment ‐naive RCC. Two of the most commonly used scoring systems are the Memorial Sloan ‐ Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC).3,4 Each of these systems categorizes patients as favorable, intermediate, or poor risk based on how many adverse prognostic factors are present (0: favorable risk; 1‐2: intermediate risk; 3 or more: poor risk). The five parameters included in the MSKCC prognostic score are KPS, nephrectomy status, hemoglobin value, LDH, and corrected cal cium concentration. Time from diagnosis to treatment is often used in place of nephrectomy status. The six parameters of importance for IDMC prognostic score classification are Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), time from diagnosis to treatment, hemoglobin value, corrected calcium concentration, absolute neutrophil count, and platelet count. With each system, total numb er of adverse prognostic factors present has been shown to correlate with overall survival. Approximately 25% of patients are in the favorable ‐risk group, 50% are in the intermediate ‐risk group, and 25% are in the poor ‐risk group. In an analysis of 1028 patients scored using the IMDC system, median OS for favorable ‐, intermediate‐, and poor ‐ risk patients is 43. 2 months, 22.5 months, and 7.8 months, respectively.5 Until recently, the cytokines IL‐2 and IFN‐were the only active treatments for advanced or metastatic RCC. However, due to each of these agents’ limited clinical benefit and substantial toxicity profile, newer targeted agents have largely replaced cytokines in the treatment of advanced or mRCC.6‐8 The recognition of the importance of hypoxia ‐inducible factor alpha (HIF signaling in the pathogenesis of clear ‐cell RCC has led to widespread study of two classes of targeted therapies: anti ‐angiogenic agents and mTOR inhibitors.9 Targeting of angiogenesis is rational because constitutive HIF activation leads to the upregulation or activation of several proteins including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can subsequently lead to tumor proliferation and neovasculature formation. Targeting of the mTOR pathway is important because activation of the upstream PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is one method by which constit utive HIFactivation or upregulation occurs. There are 8 targeted agents approved for the treatment of RCC in the United States: 5 that target angiogenesis (i.e., the VEGF ‐receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, and the VEGF ‐ binding monoclonal antibody bevacizumab), 2 that target the mTOR pathway (i.e., ever olimus and temsirolimus), and 1 that targets an immune checkpoint (i.e., the PD‐1 inhibitor nivolumab). Among these approved agents, none have demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) except for temsirolimus poor ‐risk patients and nivolumab in VEGF ‐refractory patients. According to National Comprehensive Cancer Ce nter Network (NCCN) guidelines, sunitinib, temsirolimus (poor risk only), bevacizumab plus interferon, and pazopanib are Category 1 recommendations for first‐line therapy of mRCC.10 3.2 Study Agent – Sunitinib in Renal Cell Carcinoma Sunitinib is a VEGF receptor TKI that is approved and recommended for the treatment of mRCC across prognostic groups.10 In a randomized Phase 3 trial of sunitinib vs. IFN in treatment ‐naive subjects, median progression free survival (mPFS) and median OS (mOS) were greater in the sunitinib group than in the IFN group (mPFS: 11 mo vs. 5 mo, HR = 0.539; p = < .001); mOS: 26.4 mo vs . 21.8 mo, HR = 0.821; p = .051).11 The overall response rate (ORR) was also greater in the sunitinib group (47%) than in the IFN group (12%). More recently, sunitinib was compared to pazopanib in treatment ‐naïve subjects in the Phase 3 COMPARZ study.12 In this non‐inferiority study, sunitinib and pazopanib demonstrated similar mPFS (8.4 mo for pazopanib vs. 9.5"
9,page_9,"Pro00072588: Exercise Testing & Sunitinib 2/1 vs. 4/2 (ASSET) Duke Cancer Institute Page 9 of 65 CONFIDENTIAL mo for sunitinib, HR = 1.05) and mOS (28.4 mo for pazopanib vs. 29.3 mo for sunitinib, HR = 0.91; p = 0.28). The ORR of pazopanib and sunitinib was 31% and 24%, respectively. The most common (≥ 20) adverse reactions include fatigue, generalized muscle weakness, fever, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia, a bdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, peripheral edema, rash, hand ‐foot syndrome, skin discoloration, dry skin, hair color changes, altered taste, headache, back pain, arthralgia, extremity pain, cough, dyspnea, anorexia, and bleeding [Sunitinib (Sutent®) U.S. Prescribing Information, April 2015]. Other important adverse reactions include hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation (including Torsades de Pointes), osteonecrosis of the jaw, tu mor lysis syndrome, and thyroid dysfunction. 3.3 Study Purpose/Rationale Schedule 2/1: An Important Alternative Dosing Regimen of Sunitinib A key challenge with sunitinib therapy for mRCC is to maximize quality of life (QOL) by minimizing toxicity without compromising efficacy. Specifically, maintenance of sunitinib dose intensity is related to improved clinical outcomes.13 A recent Phase III trial provides an example of these difficulties: fatigue was one of the most common treatment ‐emergent adverse events (AEs), with 63% of sunitinib ‐treated patients experiencing fatigue, including 17% with grade 3/4 fatigue.12 Interestingly, 49% of sunitinib ‐treated patients required dose interruptions of ≥7 days, and 51% required dose reductions; 20% discontinued treatment due to AEs. More work is clearly needed to achieve this delicate balance. Preliminary evidence suggests that the alternative schedule 2/1 of sunitinib may maximize both efficacy and tolerability. In theory, sch edule 2/1 (2‐weeks on, 1‐week off) results in more frequent dose interruptions than the standard schedule 4/2 (4‐weeks on, 2‐weeks off) without affecting dose intensity over the same six‐week period. In practice, however, schedule 2/1 may achieve better dose intensity. Multiple retrospective studies comprising over 70 0 patients have suggested that switching from the standard 4/2 schedule to the alternative 2/1 schedule is associated with both improved outcomes and toxicity profile.14‐18 Four sets of observations may explain these findings.  First, maximizing the dose intensity of sunitinib is associated with improved clinical outcomes (PFS and OS).13  Second, both steady state of sunitinib and optimal inhibition of vascular perfusion are reached after 2 weeks.17,19  Third, an increased compensatory angiogenic response (proliferation of endothelial cells) has been associated with increased time off of sunitinib therapy.20,21  Fourth, AEs such as fatigue were typically the impetus for dose/schedule modification from schedule 4/2 in the retrospective studies. AEs improved with modification, potentially resulting in fewer dose interruptions and discontinuations due to toxicity.14‐18 For example, Atkinson et al demonstrated that the most common AE associated with schedule modification was fatigue (64%), which was reduced to 29% upon follow up after schedule modification.14 In this study alternative schedule sunitinib, comprised mostly of schedule 2/1 (82%), was also associated with at least comparable time on treatment, PFS, and OS. Further prospective evaluation of sunitinib schedule 2/1 is clearly warranted. To this end, two prospective single ‐arm studies are ongoing: (1) to evaluate the tolerability of the 2/ 1 schedule compared with historical controls (NCT02060370), and (2) to study individualized dosing of sunitinib, including dose reduction to the 2/1 schedule in those who experience treatment ‐emergent toxicity (NCT01499121). While these studies will provide prospective safety and efficacy data on schedule 2/1, neither trial is comparative or quantitates th e functional consequences of treatment ‐emergent AEs."
10,page_10,"Pro00072588: Exercise Testing & Sunitinib 2/1 vs. 4/2 (ASSET) Duke Cancer Institute Page 10 of 65 CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Importance of VO 2peak Cardiorespiratory fitness testing provides a unique way to measure the tolerability and physiological effects of cancer therapy. The gold standard for direct assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness is peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak). As measured by an objective exercise tolerance test (CPET), VO 2peak reflects the integrative ability of the cardiopulmonary system to deliver adequate oxygen and substrate to metabolically active skeletal muscles for ATP resynthesis.22 Measured or estimated VO 2peak is a well‐established independent predictor of mortality in a broad range of non‐cancer populations.23,24 In a series of studies, measurement of VO 2peak has also been demonstrated to be safe and well‐tolerated in a wide range of cancer patients both during and following therapy.25‐28 Both a diagnosis of cancer and its associated therapeutic management are associated with significant impairments in VO 2peak,29‐31 while low VO 2peak is a significant predictor of physical and functional QOL domains, fatigue, and other patient reported outcomes (PROs).32,33 For example, for a given age group (i.e., 60 year olds), compared with healthy women with no diagnosis of breast cancer, patients with breast cancer reached a given VO 2peak value about 20 to 30 years earlier. This amounts to “physiologic aging” of several decades in the women with cancer. Finally, VO 2peak was demonstrated to be a significant predictor of overall mortality in cancer patients, providing prognostic information beyond established factors including performance status.25,34 In summary, VO 2peak may be an important quantitative marker of change in function due to cancer therapy and is associated with survival in patients with cancer. Summary: Rationale & Hypothesis While 4/2 is the recommended starting sunitinib dosing schedule in mRCC, retrospective evidence exists suggesting that schedule 2/1 may be at least as efficacious with an improved safety profile. However, no prospective da ta exists comparing the two schedules in terms of tolerability. Studies are needed to quantitate the functional cardiovascular and muscular changes induced by these two regimens. Specifically, the phenomenology of fatigue in this setting needs to be better understood. Our overall hy pothesis is that schedule 2/1 of sunitinib is not only better tolerated but will be associated with less fatigue and functional cardiovascular/muscular toxicity than the 4/2 schedule. In this study, the first in a continuum of research, we will obtain data on the magnitude of VO 2peak decline (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) in each arm in order to design a more definitive study to test this hypothesis. Because future studies will include exercise training as a component, data on physiological determinants of VO 2peak will be useful to design an optimal exercise training program.

12,page_12,"Pro00072588: Exercise Testing & Sunitinib 2/1 vs. 4/2 (ASSET) Duke Cancer Institute Page 12 of 65 CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 5.1 Study Design Proposed is a randomized (1:1) prospective trial to determine changes in VO 2peak in patients with treatment‐ naïve mRCC treated with sunitinib therapy on two different common schedules (see Section 2). Patients randomized to sunitinib schedule 4/2 (Arm A) will receive sunitinib at 50 mg daily for 4 weeks on, followed by 2 weeks off, per standard of care. Patients randomized to sunitinib sc hedule 2/1 (Arm B) will receive sunitinib 50 mg daily for 2 weeks on, followed by 1 week off. All subjects will undergo detailed functional capacity assessments at baseline, 4‐5 weeks, and after 12 weeks. Specific recommendations for management of possible AEs, along with guidelines for dose delay /modification or discontinuation from study treatment are provided in this section, based on best evidence from contemporary trials and retrospective studies.12,15 5.1.1 Dose Modification Dose interruptions or reductions of sunitinib may be required following potential drug ‐related toxicities. Fatigue, generalized muscle weakness, mucositis/stomatitis, hypertension, hand ‐foot syndrome, bleeding, vascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia/neutropenia, and other AEs have been reported in response to treatment with sunitinib.35 At each visit during the Treatment Period, subjects should first be evaluated for the occurrence of AEs and laboratory abnormalities. Specific recommendations for management of possible AEs, other than hepatoxicity, along with guidelines for dose delay/modification or discontinuation of study treatment, are adapted from Kollmannsberger et al.,36 and are provided in Table 1. In the event of treatment ‐emergent hepatotoxicity, please follow the guidelines for management hepatotoxicity provided in Table 2. For toxicities unrelated to sunitinib, dose modifications and holds are per the discretion of the investigator. If dose reduction is necessary, two dose reductions are pe rmitted in a stepwise fashion (initially to 37.5 mg and subsequently to 25 mg if necessary); however, the schedule (4/2 vs. 2/1) will not be changed during the study period. If the toxicity does not recur or worsen, the dose can then be increased stepwise back to the next dose level (37 .5 mg or 50 mg as appropriate) at the start of the next treatment cycle. Increases to the next dose level should only be initiated at the start of the next treatment cycle, not during a treatment cycle."

Concomitant medications known to be hepatotoxic that may be contributing to liver dysfunction should be discontinued or replaced with alternative medications to allow for recovery of liver function. As ge nerally understood, ALT >3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and concomitant bilirubin ≥2.0 x ULN (>35% direct bilirubin), in the absence of elevated alkaline phosphatase or biliary injury, suggest significant liver injury. See Table 2: Guidelines for Management of Treatment ‐Emergent Hepatotoxicity . Table 2 Guidelines for Management of Treatment-Emergent Hepatotoxicity AE Terms & Descriptions Dose Modi fication Algorithms (A). ALT of ≤3.0 x ULN Continue study treatment with full‐panel liver function tests (LFTs) 1 monitored as per protocol. (B). ALT >3.0 x ULN to ≤8.0 x ULN without bilirubin elevation (defined as total bilirubin <2.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin ≤35%) and without hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., fever, rash) Continue study treatment. Perform the following assessments for excluding hypersensitivity and other contributing factors:  Eosinophil count  Viral serology for hepatitis A, B, and C  Liver imaging Monitor subject closely for clinical signs and symptoms; perform full‐panel LFTs1 weekly or more frequently if clinically indicated until ALT/AST reduced to Grade 1. If the subject is withdrawn from study treatment, follow up per protocol. (C). ALT >3.0 x ULN with concomitant elevation in bilirubin (defined as total bilirubin ≥2.0 x ULN; with direct bilirubin >35%) or with hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., fever, rash) Or (D). ALT >8.0 x ULN without concomitant elevation in bilirubin (defined as total bilirubin ≥2.0 x ULN; with direct bilirubin >35%) Discontinue study treatment immediately. Consult a hepatologist, and perform the following assessments to identify co‐ contributing factors:  Eosinophil count  Viral serology for hepatitis A, B, C, and E; cytomegalovirus (CMV); Epstein ‐Barr virus (EBV IgM antibody, or heterophile antibody, or monospot testing); anti‐nuclear antibody (ANA); anti‐smooth muscle antibody (SMA); and anti‐ mitochondrial antibody  Serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) for possible muscle injury  LFT elevation  Liver imaging (ultrasound or CT scan) Monitor subject closely for clinical signs and symptoms; perform full‐panel LFTs1 weekly or more frequently if clinically indicated until LFTs reduced to Grade 1. Isolated total bilirubin elevation without concurrent ALT elevation (defined as ALT <3 x ULN) Step 1. Perform bilirubin fractionation at any time when total bilirubin is ≥1.5 X ULN. Continue dosing at full dose, and perform weekly LFT assessments 1 until total bilirubin return to ≤1.5 x ULN. 1. Full‐panel LFTs include: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, γ‐GT, and total bilirubin. If at any time the total bilirubin is > 1.5 x ULN, perform bilirubin fractionation for direct and indirect bilirubin. Note : Because many subjects are taking multiple concurrent medications, it is critical to do a thorough evaluation of the subject’s concurrent medications, identify and discontinue those with known hepatotoxicity, and replace with a non‐ hepatotoxic equivalent for the same indication if necessary."

Both fatigue and generalized muscle weakness have been reported with sunitinib and other angiogenesis inhibitors in this class. Although the etiology of these events is generally unknown, hypothyroidism has been reported with this class of agents [Rini, 2007] and may be a con tributing factor in some patients with fatigue and generalized muscle weakness. To avoid any delay in the treatment of easily manageable conditions such as electrolyte disorders and to quickly recognize possible serious conditions such as cardiac dysfunction, the following steps are recommended when caring for subjects with fatigue and generalized muscle w eakness. Subjects complaining of grade 2, 3, or 4 fatigue and/or generalized muscle weakness should be investigated as appropriate including the following suggested workup outlined below. • Subjects with grade 3 or more fatigue and/or generalized muscle weakness should be seen immediately. • A workup should include a detailed history an d physical examination, measurement of serum electrolytes, liver function tests, an electrocardiogram, chest X‐ray, thyroid function tests, and an early ‐morning cortisol. • Electrolyte abnormalities should be supplemented and adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism should be treated with replacement therapy. • An ACTH stimulation test should be perform ed if the cortisol concentration is <10 mcg/dL (280 nmol/L). • If the subject's history or physical examination points toward symptoms or signs of congestive heart failure, the appropriate investigations should be performed including an echocardiogram. • Subjects should be closely monitored on a weekly basis or more frequently if clinically indica ted for duration of severe fatigue and generalized muscle weakness. • Sunitinib dose (but not schedule) should be adjusted according to the dose adjustment guidelines in Table 1: Dose Modification Algorithms for Potential Treatment ‐Related Adverse Events (AEs) . Please contact the Duke PI if you require further guidance. 5.2.2 Abdominal Pain Abdominal pain is a common symptom with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor antagonists, including sunitinib. Bowel perforations have been reported in clinical trials of pazopanib, sunitinib, and with other agents in this class. Bowel perforations have been associated in some patients with tumor in the bowel wall, or diverticulitis, while in othe rs there has been no clear explanation. Although bowel perforation is a rare event, investigators and study staff at the site are advised to be vigilant of this potential complication in subjects receiving sunitinib. Please contact the Duke PI if you need further guidance or would like to discuss an even t involving abdominal pain or bowel perforations. 5.3 Treatment Compliance 5.3.1 Missed Doses Missed doses of sunitinib will be skipped, the subject should resume dosing the next day, and this should be recorded in the Pill Diary. 5.3.2 Concomitant Medications All concomitant medications must be recorded on the appropriate case report form (CRF) and will be assessed at each study ‐related clinic visit."

The in vitro studies in human liver microsomes and hepatocytes of the activity of CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, and CYP4A9/11 indicated that sunitinib and its primary active metabolite are unlikely to have any clinically re levant drug ‐drug interactions with drugs that may be metabolized by these enzymes.35 See the sunitinib package insert35 for full details: http://www.labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=607#S7.1 5.3.2.2 Drugs That May Affect Exposure to Sunitinib CYP3A4 Inhibitors Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme inhibition potential is recommended. Concurrent administration of sunitinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in 49% and 51% increases in the combined (sunitinib + primary active metabolite) Cmax and AUC 0– ∞ values, respec Ɵvely, aŌer a single dose of sunitinib in healthy volunteers. Co‐administration of sunitinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) may increase sunitinib concentrations. Grapefruit may also increase plasma sunitinib concentrations. A dose reduction for sunitinib should be considered when it must be co‐administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.35 CYP3A4 Inducers CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decrease sunitinib plasma concentrations. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential is recommended. Concurrent administration of sunitinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in a 23% and 46% reduction in the combined (sunitinib + primary active metabolite) Cmax and AUC 0– ∞ values, respec Ɵvely, aŌer a single dose of sunitinib in healthy volunteers. Co‐administration of sunitinib with inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort) may decrease sunitinib concentrations. St. John's Wort may decrease sunitinib plasma concentrations unpredictably. Patients receiving s unitinib should not take St. John's Wort concomitantly. A dose increase for sunitinib should be considered when it must be co‐ administered with CYP3A4 inducers .35 5.3.2.3 Precautions Regarding Concomitant Medications Refer to the following links for updated lists of CYP inhibitors and inducers:  http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentAppro valProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugIn teractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm#potency  http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx See also the sunitinib package insert:35 http://www.labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=607#S7.1"

For this pilot study, subjects will be randomly assigned (randomized) with equal probability to either sunitinib sc hedule 4/2 or 2/1. This study is open label, meaning that neither subjects nor study personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment. Note: For subjects who are not eligible and fail the screening process, no further action is necessary and no additional information will be collected. Ho wever, the number of screen failures and reason for screen failure will be collected and tallied at the end of the study. Case report forms will only be completed for those registered and randomized subjects, including those who do not receive treatment. However, subjects who do not receive the assigned tr eatment will be replaced and not counted toward the overall study sample size. Data limited to demographics and reason for screen failure will be collected for screen failures. 5.4 Rationale for Selection of Dose, Regimen, and Treatment Duration Sunitinib has an indication for the treatment of advanced RCC.35 The FDA‐approved dose of sunitinib for advanced RCC is one 50 mg oral dose taken once daily, on a treatment schedule of 4 weeks on followed by 2 weeks off (schedule 4/2), which is the dose that will be used in Arm A for this study. Sunitinib packaging (4/2015) states, “In pati ents with advanced RCC who are unable to tolerate Schedule 4/2, consider the dose reduction described in the FDA‐approved label or, as an alternative, consider modifying the schedule to 2 weeks on treatment followed by 1 week off (Schedule 2/1) using the same dose. —“Studies supporting Schedule 2/1 have not bee n reviewed by the FDA. For most studies, the patient population was small and/or analysis was post hoc, and therefore susceptible to bias. The efficacy of any particular alternative dosing schedule has not been established.” https://www.pfizerpro.com/product/sutent/advanced ‐rcc/dosing#dm Schedule 2/1 will be used in Arm B for this study. Note: The dose intensity for a 6‐week period is the same for schedule 4/2 and 2/1 (50 mg/day * 28 days = 1400 mg). 5.5 Rationale for Study Evaluations PRIMARY PHYSIOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS OF VO 2peak Rest and Exercise Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction and Cardiac Function will be measured by 2‐D and 3‐D echocardiography including Global Longitudinal Strain as described previously.37 The rate of cardiac dysfunction was approximately 11% in a recent large randomized trial of sunitinib in which schedule 4/2 was utilized.12 However, to date, testing for cardiac dysfunction in clinical trials has only been performed at rest. We hypothesize that the addition of stress echocardiography will reveal other abnormalities. Muscle Function will be evaluated by two outcomes: (1) upper and lower extremity maximal muscular strength will be assessed as a voluntary one‐repetition maximum (1‐RM) and muscular endurance (number of repetitions to fatigue at 70% of 1‐RM); and (2) muscle cross‐sectional area (CSA) of the major muscles near L3 will be assessed using standard of care restaging computed tomography (CT) scans and Slice‐ O‐Matic software (TomoVision; Magog, Canada), as described previously. Standard ‐of‐care CT scans at baseline and after 12 weeks will be used for the muscle CSA analysis. Sarcopenia, reflected as loss of muscle CSA, is known both to predict toxicit y from and to develop on VEGF receptor TKI therapy. Therefore, sarcopenia may contribute to decline in cardiopulmonary function.38‐40"
22,page_22,"Pro00072588: Exercise Testing & Sunitinib 2/1 vs. 4/2 (ASSET) Duke Cancer Institute Page 22 of 65 CONFIDENTIAL PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING/FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY Chair‐Stand Test provides a reliable and valid indicator of functional performance of lower body strength in generally active, community ‐dwelling older adults.41 Jones et al. examined the test‐retest reliability and construct validity of the 30‐second chair stand as a measure of lower body strength in 70 adults over 60 years of age (in comparison to a two maximum leg press test). There was a high correlation between chair ‐stand performance and maximum weight ‐adjuste d, leg‐press performance for both men and women (r = .78 and .71, respectively) supporting the criterion ‐related validity of the chair stand as a measure of lower body strength. Chair ‐Stand Test performance decreased significantly across age groups in decades ‐ from the 60s to the 70s to the 80s ‐ and was s ignificantly lower for participants reporting low levels of exercise behavior compared to participants reporting higher levels of exercise behavior. To date, the Chair‐ Stand Test has not been assessed in patients with mRCC. However, this test, in combination with the Timed Get Up and Go and 6M WD, is widely established as the gold standard for assessment of functional performance in older adults and will complement the performance ‐based primary outcome of cardiopulmonary function (VO 2peak). Timed Up and Go is field ‐based test that assesses a person’s mobility. Specifically, the TUG measures the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. This test has been found to be feasible in the majority of old er adults.42 Scores of 10 seconds or less indicate normal mobility, 11 – 20 seconds are within normal limits for frail, elderly, and disabled subjects, and greater than 20 seconds suggests that further examination is required. To indicate normal vs. below ‐normal performance, a recommended, practical cut‐off value for the TUG is 12 seconds.43 TUG performance decreases with the presence of mobility impairments.43 To our knowledge, the TUG test has not been assessed in patients with mRCC. This test, in combination with other functional performance measures, is widely established as the gold standard for assessment of functional performance in older adults and will complement the performance ‐based primary outcome of cardiopulmonary function (VO 2peak). 6‐Minute Walk Distance (6MWD): Six‐minute walk testing (6MWT) is a simple, clinically feasible, and objective assessment of functional capacity that is practical even in severely deconditioned clinical populations (e.g., chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and organ transplant recipients). 6MWT is a robust predictor of mortality in non‐ca ncer settings;44‐47 only three studies to date have investigated the prognostic importance of 6MWT in the oncology setting.48,49 Specifically, Kasymjanova et al. investigated the association between 6MWD and survival in 64 subjects with inoperable non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 48 Relative to <400 m, a 6MWD ≥400 m was associated with a 56% reduction in the risk of death after adjustment for important covariates. Similarly, in recent work among 118 subjects with histologically confirmed metastatic NSCLC, Jones et al. found that compared with subjects achieving a 6MWD <358.5m, the adjusted hazard ratio (H R) for all‐cause mortality was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.34 to 1.07) for a 6MWD of 358.5 – 450 m, and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.93) for a 6MWD >450 m.50 Interestingly, further work by the same group demonstrated that 6MWD was not an independent predictor of prognosis in 243 subjects with grade III/IV recurrent malignant glioma,49 suggesting that 6MWD may not be an appropriate clinical tool for objectively assessing physical functioning in all cancer populations. PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES END POINTS (FACIT‐F, FKSI‐19, Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire) Sunitinib treatment causes fatigue and worse QOL; however, the changes that occur with sunitinib on schedule 2/1 an d 4/2 have not been prospectively described. Therefore, we propose to describe the changes that occur in this setting. Because fatigue is a patient reported outcome (PRO) of interest, we will evaluate it using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT ‐F) questionnaire. The FACIT ‐F measures severity and impact of fati gue on functioning and health ‐related quality of life (HRQL) experienced in past seven days [Cella, 2002]. It has been used previously to evaluate fatigue with anti‐angiogenesis treatments, including assessments for sunitinib [Motzer, 2005; Beaumont, 2006; Motzer, 2013]. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy ‐Kidney Symptom Index ‐19 (FK SI‐19) is a disease ‐specific measure that measures disease and"
23,page_23,"Pro00072588: Exercise Testing & Sunitinib 2/1 vs. 4/2 (ASSET) Duke Cancer Institute Page 23 of 65 CONFIDENTIAL treatment ‐related symptoms specifically in renal cancer patients [Rosenbloom, 2007; Rosenbloom, 2008; Rao, 2008]. It includes patient self‐reports on experience of symptoms in the past seven days such as lack of energy, pain, bone pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, blood in urine, etc. FKSI‐19 has been used in a contem porary trial of sunitinib in mRCC.12 Finally, because it will be important for interpretation of our data to understand activity levels in both arms, we will evaluate leisure time exercise habits with the simple Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire. DEPRESSION (HADS) Depression will be evaluated as described previously using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). 51 Fatigue may be difficult to distinguish versus depression in patients with cancer.52 Understanding the prevalence of depression is necessary to evaluate the FACIT ‐Fatigue and other related measures because there are high, positive correlations between fatigue and depression. EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS Blood for use in the plasma angiome multiplex ELISA will be collected at the same time points as the cardiopulmonary function studies for corre lation with primary and secondary endpoints as described previously.53 Samples will be processed in the Phase I Biomarker Laboratory at Duke (Director: Andrew Nixon, PhD), Molecular Reference Laboratory for the Alliance Oncology Cooperative Group, a national clinical trial research group sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. In cancer patients on therapy, circulating angiogenic factors may be modulated by exercise training durin g systemic therapy.54 Therefore, angiogenic biomarker signatures may also predict changes in exercise capacity with therapy. Changes in Daily Physical Activity will be recorded in a subset of patients (up to 16 total, on either arm) using Bluetooth ‐enabled fitness trackers (Garmin Ltd) paired with the patients’ smartphones. Physical activity will be reported in steps per day. Thi s will allow real‐time continuous evaluation of a measure of physical functioning that could be scalable to outpatient oncology clinics. We have shown the feasibility of transferring daily step counts from the patient’s device to the investigator through setting up an on‐line account with a data transferring service known as Self‐Generated Healt h Information exchange (SGHIx, https://sghix.org ) in a previously IRB approved protocol (Duke Pro00063108, unpublished data). Self‐Generated Health Information Exchange (SGHIx) is a web based health information platform (https://app.sghix.org/ ), developed and managed by Promantus Inc., which specializes in providing a service for patients to set up an account where they can securely integrate their own health data into one platform. Patients can decide who, including their physicians, has access to their own patient generated health data. Access to data can be turned on and off by the patient through this web service. SGHIx was selected as it gives patients the pr ivacy to determine how and when others have access to their patient data. Changes in Blood Pressure will also be recorded in the same subset of patients using Bluetooth ‐enabled blood pressure cuffs (iHealth, Inc.) paired with the patients’ smartphones. Blood pressure will be reporte d in mmHg on a daily basis. This will allow real‐time continuous evaluation of BP, which is both a pharmacodynamic marker of benefit and a key toxicity that may contribute to declines in VO 2peak. Blood pressure data will also be transferred through SGHIx as detailed in the previous paragraph. 5.6 Definition of Evaluable Subjects For the primary analysis of change in VO 2peak, patients with measurements at baseline and after 12 weeks are evaluable. 5.7 Early Study Termination This study can be terminated at any time for any reason by the Duke PI‐sponsor. If this occurs, all subjects on study should be notified by the appropriate study personnel as soon as possible. Additional procedures"

STUDY DRUG: SUNITINIB 6.1 Names, Classification, and Mechanism of Action Sunitinib (Sutent®) is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including platelet ‐derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR α and PDGFR β), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms‐like tyrosine kinase ‐3 (FLT3), colony ‐ stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF ‐1R), and the glial ce ll line‐derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). 6.2 Packaging and Labeling SUTENT, an oral multi ‐kinase inhibitor, is the malate salt of sunitinib. Sunitinib malate is described chemically as Butanedioic acid, hydroxy ‐, (2S)‐, compound with N‐[2‐(diethylamino)ethyl] ‐5‐[(Z)‐(5‐fluoro ‐1,2‐dihydro ‐2‐ oxo‐3H‐indol ‐3‐ylidine)methyl] ‐2,4‐dimethyl ‐1H‐pyrrole ‐3‐carboxamide (1:1). The molecular formula is C22H 27FN4O2 ∙ C4H6O5, and the molecular weight is 532.6 Daltons. The chemical structure of sunitinib malate is: Sunitinib malate is a yellow to orange powder with a pKa of 8.95. The solubility of sunitinib malate in aqueous media over the range pH 1.2 to pH 6.8 is in excess of 25 mg /mL. The log of the distribution coefficient (octanol/water) at pH 7 is 5.2. SUTENT (sunitinib malate) capsules are supplied as printed hard ‐shell capsules containing sunitinib malate equivalent to 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg of sunitinib together with mannitol, croscarmellose sodium, povidone (K‐25), and magnesium stearate as inactive ingr edients. The orange gelatin capsule shells contain titanium dioxide and red iron oxide. The caramel gelatin capsule shells contain titanium dioxide, red iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, and black iron oxide. The yellow gelatin capsule shells contain titanium dioxide and yellow iron oxide. The white printing ink co ntains shellac, propylene glycol, sodium hydroxide, povidone, and titanium dioxide.

Note: There is no Safety Follow Up Visit in this study because the vast majority of patients are expected to continue sunitinib beyond Day 85 per standard of care (see Ta ble 3. Schedule of Events ). A subject is considered off study when he/she has completed the End of Treatment Visit. All subjects discontinuing study drug for any reason will have an End Of Treatment Visit approximately 30 days after their last dose of study drug or prior to initiation of cytotoxic or i nvestigational therapy, whichever occurs first. Reasonable effort should be made to contact any subject lost to follow‐ up during the course of the study in order to complete study ‐related assessments and retrieve any outstanding data and study drug. Following unsuccessful telephone contact, an effort to co ntact the subject by mail using a method that provides proof of receipt should be attempted. Such efforts should be documented in the source documents. The end of the study will occur when the last enrolled subject has completed his/her End of Treatment Visit. A database lock will occur when the da ta has been cleaned to the specifications in the data quality plan. The database will then be frozen, and no further changes will be permitted. 8.8 Early Withdrawal of Subject(s) 8.8.1 Criteria for Early Withdrawal(s) Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time.

Note: See Section 7.1, Inclusion Criteria . 8.9 Study Assessments 8.9.1 Medical History Medical history, such as previous treatments, procedures, and conditions, will be collected during the screening period. 8.9.2 Physical Exam Evaluations should be performed by the same evaluator throughout the study whenever possible. Weight will be recorded at every visit. Height will be recorded at screening visit only. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated at every visit. Vital signs include temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. A complete physical examination is required at the Scree ning, Day 1, Day 29‐37, and Day 85 visits. A brief symptom ‐directed physical examination should be performed at all other clinic visits. 8.9.3 Evaluations Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) Exercise Capacity will be assessed using a symptom ‐limited CPET on a motorized treadmill with expired gas analysis to determine VO 2peak , according to guidelines for clinical populations.55 All CPET data will be recorded as the highest 30 second value elicited during the CPET. During exercise, heart rate and rhythm will be monitored continuously using a 12‐lead ECG. Equipment with similar technical specifications will be used across the study sites to ensure reasonably accurate and precise results. Rest an d Exercise 2‐D and 3‐D Echocardiography Resting left ventricular (LV) function will be assessed by LVEF using 2‐dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and 3‐dimensional echocardiography (3DE), as well as by global longitudinal strain (GLS) using 2‐ dimensional speckle‐ tracking echocardiography (2D‐STE) as previously described.37 After resting assessments, subjects will complete cardiopulmonary exercise testing as above with stress 2DE immediately post ‐CPET. Skeletal Muscle Function Muscle Cross‐Sectional Area (CSA) will be assessed using standard ‐of‐care CT scans. Slice ‐O‐Matic (Tomovision, Magog, QC, Canada) software will be used to measure muscle cross ‐sectional area and adipose tissue (subcutaneous, visceral) cross ‐sectional area by analysis of axial CT cross ‐sectional images at the time points described (see Table 3. Schedu le of Events ), as has been done previously.56 Average muscle and adiposity measurements will be made between 2 separate axial image cuts from each CT scan at the level of L3 by two separate reviewers who will be trained by a radiologist. The major muscles measured near L3 will include the rectus abdominis, latissimus dorsi, external and internal oblique, psoas ma jor, erector spinae, transversospinalis, and quadratus lumborum. Muscle Strength of the upper and lower body will be assessed as a one‐repetition maximum (1‐RM). A 1‐RM is defined as the greatest resistance that can be moved through the full range of motion in a controlled manner. This dy namic strength assessment will be conducted using the following exercises:"
35,page_35,"Pro00072588: Exercise Testing & Sunitinib 2/1 vs. 4/2 (ASSET) Duke Cancer Institute Page 35 of 65 CONFIDENTIAL leg press, chest press, and row. The heaviest weight lifted while adhering to the strict technique and form will be used to score the assessment. A certified exercise physiologist or trained designee will conduct this assessment in a controlled environment. Mean percentage of age and sex‐predicted muscle strength will be ob tained from available normative data. Muscular Endurance of the upper and lower body will be assessed as the number of repetitions to fatigue at 70% of the 1‐RM. The same exercises and methods will be used as in the 1‐RM determination detailed above. Subjects will continue until technique, te mpo, volition, or inability to complete two consecutive repetitions cause finality (per discretion of the exercise physiologist or trained designee). Physical Functioning/Functional Capacity Physical Functioning/Functional Capacity will be assessed using the following assessments: Chair‐ Stand Test, Timed Up and Go, and 6‐Minute Walk Distance outcomes as described previously.57 41,58,59These measures will complement the exercise capacity measure. Chair‐Stand Test: The 5‐repetition Chair‐ Stand Test measures the time taken to complete 5 repetitions of the sit‐to‐stand maneuver. All sit‐to‐stand maneuvers will be performed from a chair without an arm rest at 43 cm in height and 47 .5 cm in depth. Standardized instructions will be provided as follows: “By the count of 3, please stand up and sit down as quickly as possible for 5 times. Place your hands on your lap, and do not use them throughout the procedure. Lean your back against the chair's bac krest at the end of every repetition.” Note: Timing will start when the subject's back left the backrest and will be stopped once the back touched the backrest. Timed Up and Go: Subjects will be required to stand up from a chair with armrests, walk 3 meters (9.8 feet), turn aro und, return to the chair, and sit down. Note: The time taken to complete this task will be measured in seconds with a stopwatch.59 6‐Minute Walk Test: The 6‐minute Walk Test will be conducted according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) to determine the 6MWD. 60 Subjects will be instructed to cover the longest distance possible in 6 minutes under the supervision of an exercise physiologist or trained designee.

A trained staff member will help the patie nt set up this account, which will allow the patient to send their activity tracker and blood pressure data electronically directly to the investigators.  The patients will be recommended to monitor their activity and blood pressure on a daily basis, but the patient will have full autonomy regarding usage of these devices as well as the data they will wish to share with the investigators thro ugh the online data transferring website SGHIx.  All patient health data from SGHIx will be downloaded by the investigators or study personnel and transferred to the study’s Medidata RAVE database. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING The PI is responsible for the identification and documentation of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). At each study visit, the PI or trained designee must assess, through non‐suggestive inquiries of the subject or evaluation of study assessments, whether an AE or SAE has occurred."
37,page_37,"Pro00072588: Exercise Testing & Sunitinib 2/1 vs. 4/2 (ASSET) Duke Cancer Institute Page 37 of 65 CONFIDENTIAL 9.1 Adverse Events (AEs) An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject receiving study drug and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. For this protocol, the definition of AE also includes worsening of any pre‐existing medical condition. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and un intended or worsening sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of sunitinib, whether or not related to use of the sunitinib. Abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the PI’s judgment) should not be recorded as AEs. Note: Laboratory value changes that require t herapy or adjustment in prior therapy are considered adverse events. All non‐serious adverse events will be collected from the time of first dose of study drug until the End of Treatment Visit. Serious adverse events that are related to study procedures are recorded from the time the informed consent form is signed until th e End of Treatment Visit (or screen failure). These AEs must be recorded in the subject’s medical record and adverse events case report form. AEs will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. If CTCAE grading does not exist for an AE , the severity of the AE will be graded as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), life‐threatening (4), or fatal (5). Attribution of AEs will be indicated as follows:  Definite: The AE is clearly related to the study drug or exercise testing.  Probably: The AE is likely related to the study dr ug or exercise testing.  Possible: The AE may be related to the study drug or exercise testing.  Unlikely: The AE is doubtfully related to the study drug or exercise testing.  Unrelated: The AE is clearly NOT related to the study drug or exercise tes ting. 9.1.1 AEs of Special Interest “Fatigue” and “generalized muscle weakness” (regardless of site) are AEs of special interest. Care should be taken to appropriately identify, grade, and note the attribution of these AEs throughout the study. Note: There is no special reporting requirement for these AEs. 9.1.2 Expected AEs with Exercise Testing (CPET) Anticipated (expected) side‐ effects associated with a symptom ‐limited cardiopulmonary exercise test include:  Fatigue  Muscle soreness  Joint pain  Lower back pain  Leg cramps Unanticipated but possible side‐ effects that are rare, but serious include:  Cardiovascular: angina, AV blocks, bradycardia, edema, hypotension, palpitations, rebound hypertension, shock, syncope  Arrhythmias  Myocardial ischemia  Sudden cardiac death  Cerebrovascular accident 9.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) An AE is considered “serious” if in the opinion of the investigator it is one of the following outcomes:"

Subset of SAEs Reportable for this Study . Because the Pfizer Product used in this Study is a mature marketed product with a well‐ established safety profile, only SAEs that fit into any of the following categories need to be reported to Pfizer: (1) a death, regardless of whether it is considered related to treatment with the Pfizer Product, (2) a non‐fatal SAE that occurs du ring the reporting period and that is assessed by the Principal Investigator as both related to treatment with the Pfizer Product and unexpected for that Product, (3) an SAE assessed by the Principal Investigator as related to the Pfizer Product that occurs after the SAE reporting period, or (4) an otherwise reportable eve nt as described in paragraph B., below. An event should be considered ""related"" to the Pfizer Product if a relationship is at least a reasonable possibility, and ""unexpectedness"" should be based upon a single safety reference document identified by the Principal Investigator and documented in association with the study. B. E xposure During Pregnancy, Exposure During Lactation, Occupational Exposure, and Lack Of Effect . Even though there may not be an associated SAE, exposure to the Pfizer Product during pregnancy, exposure to the Pfizer Product during lactation, and occupational exposure to the Pfizer Product are reportable, and lack of effect of the Pfizer Product may also be reportable. 9.2.1 Reporting of SAEs Serious adverse events, whether or not considered drug related, should be reported within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, using the provided DCI SAE Report Form and the SAE Report Review Form (Site Assessment). These documents should be sent to:  The DCI Safety Desk – fax: (919) 681‐93 57; phone: (919) 681‐9538; email: dcccsafe@dm.duke.edu Note: If the DCI Safety Desk cannot be reached within 24 hours, the Principal Investigator should be contacted:  Dr. Michael Harrison, phone: (919) 668‐4615; pager: (919) 684‐ 8111; email: michael.harrison@duke.edu The initial report for each SAE or death should include at minimum the following information: • Protocol # and title • Patient initials, study identification number, sex, age • Date the event occurred • Description of the SAE • Dose level and cycle number at the time the SAE occurred • Description of the patien t’s condition • Indication whether the patient remains on study"

Upon receipt of the DCI SAE Report form by the DCI Safety Desk, the PI will be notified and be required to complete the PI assessment of the DCI SA E Report Review Form. The DCI Safety Desk will, in turn, report the event to Pfizer if the SAE is felt to be at least possibly related to sunitinib using the DCI SAE Report Form. The Reportable Event Fax Cover Sheet provided by Pfizer must also be included with each SA_E submitted. The SAE documentation, including the DCI SAE Report Form and available source records, should be faxed to Pfizer per the instructions on the SAE cover sheet. The following minimum information is required for this documentation and report: • Study number/IIT regulatory identifier • Subject number, sex, and age • Report date • SA E description (event, seriousness of the event) • Causal relationship to the study drug Follow‐ up information for the event should be sent promptly (within 7 days) as necessary. Fax and Phone numbers to report SAEs to Pfizer: Fax: Toll‐Free (local): 1 866 997‐8322 (Clinical Trial, Compassionate Use , IIR reports) Tel: 800 752‐ 9737 (toll‐free) ONLY for technical support if fax number is not working 9.3 Procedure in Case of Pregnancy Sunitinib is Pregnancy Category D. Sunitinib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. As angiogenesis is a critical component of embryonic and fetal development, inhibition of angiogenesis following administration of sunitinib should be expected to result in adverse effects on pregnancy. In animal reproductive studies in rats and ra bbits, sunitinib was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic. Subjects receiving sunitinib are advised to use 2 acceptable methods of birth control (one of which must include a condom as a barrier method of contraception) starting at the time of screening and continuing throughout the course of treatment and for at least th ree months after sunitinib is discontinued. If, during the conduct of the clinical trial, a male subject impregnates his partner, OR a female subject becomes pregnant, the subject should report the pregnancy to the Investigator. With the permission of the pregnant partner, the Investigator should report the pregnancy to Pfizer as an SA E within 24 hours of awareness of the event. The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of the pregnancy, last menstruation, estimated fertility date, pregnancy result, and neonatal data, etc., should be included in this information. With the permission of the pregnant partner, the Investigator should repo rt the outcome of the pregnancy (independent of outcome, e.g., full‐term delivery, pre‐term delivery, spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomaly [including anomaly in a miscarried fetus, etc.]) in accordance with the same reporting procedure as for SAEs (see Section 9.2.1 ). The date of ou tcome of the pregnancy,"

Informed consent will need to be obtained from the pregnant partner to document her permission to disclose this information to Pfizer. 9.4 Safety Oversight Committee (SOC) The Duke Cancer Institute SOC is responsible for annual data and safety monitoring of DUHS sponsor ‐ investigator Phase I and II, therapeutic interventional studies that do not have an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The primary focus of the SOC is review of safety data, toxicities, and new information that may affe ct subject safety or efficacy. Annual safety reviews include, but may not be limited to, review of safety data, enrollment status, stopping rules if applicable, accrual, toxicities, reference literature, and interim analyses as provided by the sponsor ‐investigator. The SOC in concert with the DCI Monitoring Team (see Section 10.1 fo r Monitoring Team description) oversees the conduct of DUHS cancer ‐ related, sponsor ‐investigator therapeutic intervention and prevention intervention studies that do not have an external monitoring plan, ensuring subject safety and that the protocol is conducted, recorded and reported in accordance with the protocol, standard operating procedures (SOPs), Good Clinical Practice (GCP) , and applicable regulatory requirements. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 10.1 DCI Monitoring Team The Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) Monitoring Team will conduct monitoring visits to ensure subject safety and that the protocol is conducted, recorded, and reported in accordance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, good clinical practice, and applicable regulatory requirements. As specified in the DCI Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, the DCI Mo nitoring Team will conduct routine monitoring after the third subject is enrolled, followed by annual monitoring of 1 – 3 subjects until the study is closed to enrollment and subjects are no longer receiving study interventions that are more than minimal risk. Additional monitoring may be prompted by findings from monitoring visits, unexpe cted frequency of serious and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns and may be initiated upon request of DUHS and DCI leadership, the DCI Cancer Protocol Committee, Duke Clinical Trials Quality Assurance (CTQA), the Safety Oversight Committee (SOC), the Sponsor ‐Investigator, the site’s Principal Investigator, or the IRB. All study doc uments must be made available upon request to the DCI Monitoring Team and other authorized regulatory authorities, including, but not limited to, the National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute, and the FDA. Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain confidentiality during study monitoring. 10.2 Data Management and Processing 10.2.1 Study Documentation Study documentation includes, but is not limited to, source documents, case report forms, monitoring logs, appointment schedules, study team correspondence with sponsors or regulatory bodies/committees, and regulatory documents that can be found in the DCI‐mandated “Regulatory Binder” that includes, but is not limited to, signed protocol and amendments, approved and signed informed cons ent forms, FDA Form 1572, CAP and CLIA laboratory certifications, and clinical supplies receipts and distribution records. Source documents are original records that contain source data that is all information in original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluatio n of the trial. Source documents include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X‐rays , subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the"

When possible, the original record should be retained as the source document. However, a photocopy is acceptable provided that it is a clear, legible, and an exact duplication of the original document. 10.2.2 Case Report Forms (CRFs) The electronic CRF will be the primary data collection document for the study and will be updated in a timely manner following acquisition of new source data. Only the research staff members listed on the delegation of authority log are permitted to make entries, changes, or corrections in the CRF. An a udit trail will be maintained automatically by the electronic CRF management system (eCRF). All users of this system will complete user training, as required or appropriate per regulations. 10.2.3 Data Management Procedures and Data Verification Completeness of entered data will be checked automatically by the eCRF system, and users will be alerted to the presence of data inconsistencies. Additionally, queries may be issued by the study data manager or project leader. Missing or implausible data will be queried for completion or correction (i.e., confirmation of data, correcti on of data, and completion or confirmation that data is not available, etc.). The database will be reviewed and discussed prior to database closure, and will be closed only after resolution of all remaining queries. An audit trail will be kept of all subsequent changes to the data. 10.2.4 Study Closure Following completion of the studies, the PI will be responsible for ensuring the following activities:  Data clarification and/or resolution  Accounting, reconciliation, and destruction/return of used and unused study drugs  Review of site study records for completeness  Shipment of all remaining laboratory samples to the designated laboratories (i.e., Nixon Lab at Duke ) STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS All statistical analysis will be performed under the direction of the statistician designated in key personnel. Any data analysis carried out independently by the investigator must be approved by the statistician before publication or presentation. 11.1 Analysis Sets The intent ‐to‐treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized patients. The modified intent ‐to‐treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized patients who have both a baseline and after week 12 evaluation. In the ITT analyses and the modified ITT analyses patients will be analyzed according to the study arm to which they were randomized. The modified ITT p opulation will be the primary analysis population. The per‐protocol population will consist of all randomized patients with both baseline and after week 12 measurements for the primary endpoint and prior to any analysis: have been deemed compliant and properly evaluated fo r efficacy per investigator, satisfied all inclusion and exclusion criteria, and correctly assigned treatment. The safety population will be all patients with at least one safety evaluation."

Mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will be displayed by treatment arm for continuous variables. Categorical variables will be summarized by counts and percentages for each arm. 11.3 Treatments Compliance with sunitinib will be described, for each treatment arm, by the number and percent of intended doses taken (dose intensity). Deviations from the planned sunitinib schedule (i.e., 4/2 vs. 2/1) will be presented by numbers and percent of patients. In addition, the number and percent of patients having delays or dose re ductions will be displayed by treatment arm. Numbers of patients discontinuing treatment and reasons for discontinuation will be displayed for each treatment arm. Numbers of patients failing to complete full follow‐ up (through week 12) and reasons for loss to follow‐ up will be displayed for each treatment arm. 11.4 Primary Objective The primary objective is to estimate the change in VO 2peak at after 12 weeks from baseline in treatment ‐naïve mRCC patients treated with sunitinib on schedules 4/2 and 2/1 separately. 11.4.1 Variable The primary endpoint is the change in peak oxygen uptake (VO 2peak) from week 1 to through week 12 in each group. 11.4.2 Statistical Hypothesis, Model, and Method of Analysis The primary analysis will be checking if there is a significant change in peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak) from baseline to through week 12 for each schedule, using a paired t‐test. The primary analysis will be done for complete cases, (i.e., patients with VO 2peak measured at baseline and after week 12) in the ITT population. 11.5 Secondary and Exploratory Objectives For subjects with VO 2 peak measures at week 4 or week 5, descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of VO 2peak changes from baseline to week 4 and to week 5 will also be reported to assess early effects of each sunitinib schedule. Descriptive statistics for other secondary and exploratory endpoints will also be reported for each sunitinib schedule. In addition, a random effects model will be used to assess the effe ct of different sunitinib schedules on the VO 2 peak change. In the model repeated measurements of VO 2 peak change at week 4, 5 and through week 12 from baseline are outcomes, schedule indicator (0 for schedule 4/2, 1 for schedule 2/1) is chosen as the main factor, baseline VO 2 peak value and patient characteristics are other included covariates. Similarly, random effects models with other continuous repeated measures (i.e., resting and stress cardiac function and muscle strength) as dependent variables will also be used to analyze the schedule effects. Sensitivity analyses will be performed for the primary endpoint and key secondary en dpoint using Last Value Carried Forward (LOCF) methods. The intent of this sensitivity analysis is to assay the robustness of results observed in the modified ITT population. Eligibility rate, acceptance rate and adverse event rate will be reported descriptively. Eligibility rate is defined as the number of subjects eligible for the study divided by th e number approached for the study (i.e., screen fail rate)."
43,page_43,"Pro00072588: Exercise Testing & Sunitinib 2/1 vs. 4/2 (ASSET) Duke Cancer Institute Page 43 of 65 CONFIDENTIAL Acceptance rate is defined as the number of patients agreeing to participate divided by total number randomized. Rates of adverse events, classified by CTCAE v4.0, will be displayed by body system and preferred term for each arm. For analysis of the plasma angiome multiplex ELISA data, correlations among analytes will be evaluate d by Spearman analysis. Analyte levels at baseline and changes on‐treatment will be correlated with baseline VO 2peak and changes in VO 2peak, respectively. Descriptive statistics and graphical reporting of group and individual patient data will be used to report changes in step counts and blood pressure over time (daily monitoring). We will also determine if there is any association between steps/day and measurements of VO 2peak and association between steps/day and blood pressure measurements of VO 2peak. 11.6 Sample Size Calculation The primary purpose of this study is to check if changes in cardiopulmonary function (VO 2peak) in patients from baseline to through week 12 is significant for each sunitinib schedules. This is a pilot study in which 15 evaluable patients per arm will be randomized with equal probability to either the sunitinib 4/2 or 2/1 schedule. The estimated variance based on a previous pilot study is 3. 2 (Lee W. Jones, PhD; unpublished data). Assuming 1) the same variance at baseline and 12 weeks, and 2) no correlation between the two VO 2peak measurements at baseline and 12 weeks, based on 2‐sided, paired t‐test with 15 patients, the VO 2peak mean difference of 2.0 ml kg‐1 min‐1 from baseline to after 12 weeks can be detected with 80% power and significance level 0.05. If we assume a correlation of 0.20 between the two VO 2peak measurements, then the VO 2peak mean difference of 1.8 ml kg‐1 min‐1 from baseline to after 12 weeks can be detected. Note: Because VO 2peak typically declines by only about 1% per year in adults, this magnitude of decline is believed to be clinically significant. Because 1) the primary endpoint is mean difference in VO 2peak at after 12 weeks) 30 total patients are required for adequate evaluation, patients who are not able to undergo CPET for determination of VO 2peak at after 12 weeks will be replaced. We estimate a 20% dropout rate so that 36 patients will need to be accrued in order to have 30 total evaluable patients (15 evaluable in each arm). ADMINISTRATIVE AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 12.1 Regulatory and Ethical Compliance This protocol was designed and will be conducted and reported in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable federal, state, and local regulations. 12.2 DUHS Institutional Review Board and DCI Cancer Protocol Committee The protocol, informed consent form, advertising material, and additional protocol ‐related documents must be submitted to the DUHS Institutional Review Board (IRB) and DCI Cancer Protocol Committee (CPC) for review.

56,page_56,"Pro00072588: Exercise Testing & Sunitinib 2/1 vs. 4/2 (ASSET) Duke Cancer Institute Page 56 of 65 CONFIDENTIAL APPENDIX F Recommendations for Management of Hypertension The pathogenesis of hypertension induced by angiogenesis inhibitors is likely to be multi ‐factorial. VEGF and VEGFR ‐2 are involved in the proper maintenance, differentiation, and function of endothelial cells. Arterial hypertension is characterized by reduced nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis, activation of the renin ‐angiotensin ‐ aldosterone system (RAAS), increased vasoconstriction, and microvas cular rarefaction of arterioles and capillaries. Microvascular rarefaction in hypertension is partly due to impaired angiogenesis. Hypertension observed with anti‐ angiogenic agents is thought to be due to decreased bioavailability of endothelium ‐derived NO, which is a potent vasodilator, as a result of reduced endothelium function by anti‐angiogenesis. A. Control of Hyperten sion Prior to Study Entry For subjects presenting with hypertension, their blood pressure (BP) must be adequately controlled to <150/90 mmHg prior to the first dose of study medication. This can be achieved by adjusting the existing anti‐hypertensive medications or adding new one (see below for permitted anti‐hypertensive medications). B. Control of Hyperten sion during Study Treatment In event hypertension is worsened or emerged during study treatment; the management of hypertension should include two parts: 1. Dose modification of study medication, including interruption, reduction, re‐challenge, or discontinuation of study medication (see Table 1 for guidelines and algorithm) 2. Mana gement of hypertension with anti‐hypertensive medications The following antihypertensive medications are permitted by the protocol but should be used with caution:  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers: felodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine, nimodipine, nitrendipine, amlodipine, nisoldipine, and isradipine  Angiotensin II blockers: losartan and irbesartan  Beta ‐blockers: carvedilol, metoprolol, propafenone, propranolol, and timolol  Non ‐dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers: diltiazem and verapamil Based on consensus of experts in the field, we recommend the use of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine) and ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril) as the first line and second line of therapy, respectively, for treatment‐ related hypertension. The use of non‐dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil are not encourage d. The Duke PI should be contacted if there is any concern or need for clarification."
57,page_57,"Pro00072588: Exercise Testing & Sunitinib 2/1 vs. 4/2 (ASSET) Duke Cancer Institute Page 57 of 65 CONFIDENTIAL APPENDIX G Urine Protein Creatinine Ratio (UPC) Clinical meaning of UPC There is a good correlation between the ratio of urine protein to creatinine concentrations in a random urine sample and the amount of protein excreted in a 24‐hour urine collection period. The creatinine excretion is fairly constant throughout the day regardless of changes in urine flow rat e:  Men excrete 20 mg to 25 mg of creatinine/kg of body weight/day  Women excrete 15 mg to 20 mg of creatinine/kg of body weight/day  Normal protein excretion is <100 mg to 150 mg/24 hours  The UPC ratio is roughly equal to the 24‐hour urine pr otein excretion in g/day Calculating (UPC) UPC ratio = (Urine protein mg/dl) / (urine creatinine mg/dl) = numerically equivalent to gm protein excreted in urine over 24 hours  Example: Patient has a urine protein = 90 mg/dl and urine creatinine = 30 mg/dl. UPC ratio= (90 mg/dl) / (3 0 mg/dl) = 3  Result UPC is 3 (correlates to roughly 3 grams protein excretion in a 24‐hour period) Units for UPC Ratio Note: Both the protein concentration and the creatinine concentration must be expressed in the same units (mg/dL or g/L) to perform the UPC calculation. (Un its will cancel out, such as protein mg/creatinine mg or as protein gm/creatinine gm) If protein was expressed in mg/dL and creatinine expressed in µmol/L, the UPC ratio would be in mg/µmol, thus, conversion of the units is required (see below): From To Conversion Factor Conventional Units: mg/dl SI Units: µmol/l Multiply by 88.4 SI Units: µmol/l Conventional Units: mg/dl Divide by 88.4 Reference: Xin G, Wang M, Jian L, Xu F, Wang H.
