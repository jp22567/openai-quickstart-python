14,page_14,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 15 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 1 Background and Rationale 1.1 Background and Scientific Rationale Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and is associated with $56 billion in health care costs in the United States annually. Episodic exacerbations are the major source of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs due to asthma. These events are particularly common in at risk urban children and adolescents with asthma. Importantly, exacerbations lead to progressive loss of lung function 3,4 which contributes to increasing asthma severity over time . Moreover, it has recently been shown that a significant number of children with mild to moderate asthma at early school age progress to a pat tern of fixed obstructive lung disease by early adulthood. 5 Thus, it is a major unmet need to prevent asthma exacerbations, particularly in exacerbati on-prone children. Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 clinical tr ial is designed to determine whether an intervention that is directed towards a phenotype-defined population of urban children and adolescents with difficult- to- control, exacerbation-prone asthma will improve disease management by preventing exacerbations. For a significant number of asthma patients, guidelines -directed treatment does not achieve disease control, suggesting the need, and potential benefit, for treatment(s) that are personalized to the phenotype of these patients. This trial is informed by t he DAIT NIAID -sponsored Inner -City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) 2 trial, Protocol ICAC-19, titled “ Asthma Phenotypes in the Inner City ”, 6-8 and based on these observations and others in the literature9, the presence of peripheral blood eosinophils in patients with difficult -to-contro l asthma, despite appropriate guidelines -directed care, is a biomarker for asthma exacerbations and increased morbidity. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeting eosinophils with the addition of the anti -IL-5 monoclonal antibody, mepolizumab, will prevent exacerbations and, as a consequence, reduce overall morbidity, improve asthma control, and quality of life. To date, phenotype-directed trials using biologic agents have been performed primarily in adults. Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 is designed to test whether this approach is effective in urban children and adolescents with difficult- to-control, exacerbation -prone asthma. From a public health perspective, the proposed trial will inform clinical guidelines for care of children at EPR3 Step 4 care and above, where there is currently a paucity of data to guide treatment decisions. The information will not only be useful in the inner -city population but also for the overall management of difficult -to-control, exacerbation - prone asthma in the pediatric age group. This trial will serve as a model for future phenotype -directed protocols for difficult -to-control, exacerbation -prone asthma in at -risk urban youth. Finally, our focus on underlying mechanisms using whole genome transcrip tomics of nasal airway and peripheral blood will provide insight to mechanisms by which eosinophils and IL -5 contribute to exacerbations. Furthermore, the transcriptomic characteristics of exacerbations that persist despite anti -IL5 therapy will provide potential new therapeutic targets for the treatment of this difficult -to-control, exacerbation -prone asthma phenotype. Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 is a randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, parallel-group, multi - center trial of the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab adjunctive therapy for 12 months in urban asthma patients aged 6 -17 years with difficult -to-control, exacerbation -prone asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype (defined by a peripheral blood eosinophil count ≥150 cells/μ l)."

A number of risk factors for exacerbations with respiratory infections have been identified including underlyin g allergic disease , allergic inflammation and a T 2 sputum cell profile11. The mechanisms underlying a reduction in asthma exacerbations associated with mepolizumab treatment 14 are unknown, and a greater understanding of mechanisms responsible for this effect will improv e our understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations15. Because IL -5 is an important survival factor for eosinophils, the reduction in exacerbations is commonly thought to reflect the depletion in airway eosinophils, but this begs the question as to how airway eosinophils predispose to asthma exacerbations. We hypothesize that eosinophil products activate epithelial cell production of chemoattractants for other inflammatory cell types, such as mast cells and CD4+T lymphocytes. Based on this hypothesis, we expect that IL -5 inhibition will have broad effects on cellular inflammation in the airway. In particular, we anticipate that anti -IL-5 treatment will decrease airway mast cells and airway T 2 inflammation16. A major unmet need in asthma care is to improve outcomes of disease control in patients with more severe disease that is not responsive to current therapy17. We have observed a pattern of treatment response in urban children where, despite intensive efforts to prevent asthma morbidity with asthma counseling18, cockroach allergen home mitigation19, and optimized guidelines -based asthma management including hi gh-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting beta -agonists ( LABA) , and omalizumab20,21, exacerbations still occurred frequently and disease control was not always achieved. 48% of 400 ICAC participants who were managed for one year with guidelines-based care (i.e., the control participants in the ICAC Asthma Control Evaluation (ACE) 21 and DAIT NIAID -sponsored clinical trials (IND #100, 210) – Protocol ICAC -08/09, titled “Inner -City Anti -IgE Therapy in Asthma (IC ATA) ” 20) had at least one asthma exacerbation requiring a course of systemic corticosteroids, and 24% of the control treated patients in ICATA had at least two exacerbations. Importantly, exacerbations have been associated with progressive loss of lung function over time 3,22. Given the existing shortcomings in the effectiveness of current treatments for a significant proportion of children and adolescents with asthma, particularly those in urban environments , a new approach for their management is needed to improve disease control and reduce morbidity, focusing on exacerbations. One consideration in selecting a treatment in high-risk children and adolescents with difficult-to -control asthma is feasibility and a conveniently measurable marker to predict an effective response, i.e. high blood eosinophils. Mepolizumab meets these criteria and can be given monthly in a subcutaneous injection. Moreover, novel immune biologics are not necessarily good candidates for children/adolescents unless they have been well tested in older participants and their efficacy and safety demonstrated. Although a developing array of immune- based therapeutics may also be reasonable candidates for a phenotypic biomarker -directed approach to difficult asthma in at -risk urban youth, they are not sufficiently advanced at this time."

In an initial clinical trial, Leckie et al 24,25 found mepolizumab significantly reduced periphera l blood and sputum eosinophils, but did not block either the late phase response to antigen or the post -challenge increase in airway hyper - responsiveness. These results were a major surprise and raised the possibility that eosinophils, despite their much -recognized relationship to multiple features of asthma, may not have a major pathophysiological role in in this disease. When Flood-Page et al 10 tested mepolizumab in a large population of patients with moderate -to-severe asthma, lung function, symptoms and exacerbations did not improve. There was, however, a trend towards reduced exacerbations in a subpopulation of patients. At the same time, Green et al 26 compared treatment by British Thoracic Society guidelines to the addition of extra ICS aimed at the reduction of sputum eosinophils. The reduction in sputum eosinophils was associated with a decrease in the frequency of exacerbations. This relationship to the prevention of exacerbations was further confirmed by Haldar et al 25 and Nair et al 27 who evaluated mepolizumab in patients with severe asthma who required high doses of ICS and, in most cases, systemic prednisone, for disease control, but yet had frequent exacerbations and, importantly, persistent sputum and peripheral blood eosinophils. In a one-year treatment with mepolizumab, Haldar et al 25 found the frequency of exacerbations decreased by approximately 50% (Figure 4). Nair et al 27 found similar effects with mepolizumab. No changes in asthma symptoms, need for rescue treatment, or lung function measures were noted in either trial. Pavord et al 14 substantiated these findings with mepolizumab in a large trial. More recently, two additional trials demonstrated similar efficacy for exacerbation prevention using subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab, a more patient friendly route of administration than the intravenous administration in earlier trials 2,28,29. Therefore, the phenotype- profile in asthma where mepolizumab has been found to be effective is: difficult-to -control asthma with frequent exace rbations and the presence of eosinophils despite ongoing ICS treatment, with the primary outcome being prevention of exacerbations. Since mepolizumab effectively reduces exacerbations and also leads to a reduction in airway area as assessed by high -resolut ion computerized tomography scans after one year of treatment 26, it is intriguing to suggest that mepolizumab in school -age children and adolescents, who are exacerbation-prone, has the potential to prevent progressive loss of lung function and disease progression with time. 1. What information can be used to select urban children and adolescents with difficult- to-control asthma for a trial with mepolizumab? A meta -analysis of mepolizumab in adult patients with severe Figure 4. Mepolizumab reduces asthma exacerbations"
17,page_17,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 18 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 asthma and persistent eosinophilia revealed significant reductions in the risk for exacerbation across seven trials (OR 0.30 95% CI 0.13 to 0.67, p=0.004) 30. Studies of mepolizumab in adults have identified consistent benefit in exacerbation -prone participants whose peripheral blood eosinophil counts are ≥150 cells/μl2,29. A post-hoc analysis of the relationship between blood eosinophilia and asthma exacerbations in the Protocol s ICAC -08/09 ICATA trials demonstrated that elevated peripheral blood eosinophils at randomization were significantly associated with an increased risk of exacerbations. In these analyses, the optimum cut -point for eosinophils was 340 cells/ μl (52% vs. 33% over the 12 month treatment period; p=0.0003: Table 1.4). Interestingly, and important in the selection of an intervention most likely to be effective in children with uncontrolled asthma, was the finding that exacerbation rates remained high (43%) even in children treated with omalizumab. Thus, even with conv entional guidelines -based asthma management, including omalizumab, patients with peripheral blood eosinophilia continue to have frequent exacerbations. These findings suggest that an alternative therapeutic agent than omalizumab may be the best intervention. Given the effect of mepolizumab on exacerbations and its safety profile, mepolizumab is an ideal choice. Additional analyses of the Protocol ICAC -19 APIC study population characteristics at study screening demonstrate that the typical characteristics utilized in adult mepolizumab trials [eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/μl, ≥2 exacerbations in the prior year, and requirement for high level controller therapy (6 -11 years: fluticasone DPI 250 mcg BID or equiva lent, 12 and above: fluticasone/salmeterol DPI 250/50 mcg BID or equivalent)] identifies urban youth at high risk for exacerbation. Children meeting these characteristics had a 70% risk of exacerbation during the Protocol ICAC-19 APIC 12 month follow up despite guidelines -based care and good adherence with medications . 2. What are potential advantages of mepolizumab in this population? Mepolizumab is administered as a fixed subcutaneous dose of 100 mg every 4 weeks for patients aged 12 years and above ; 40 m g every 4 weeks for patients aged 6 to 11 years. These doses are consistent with the approved dosing per the Package Insert ( September 2019 ). The use of mepolizumab will allow us to include children who were not eligible for ou r previous omalizumab studies (ICAC -08/09/20). For example, i n DAIT- Sponsored Protocols ICAC-08/09 ICATA , 35% of children and adolescents identified with exacerbation- prone asthma were ineligible for enrollment due to their weight and/or total serum IgE level. In fact, more Table 1.4. Association between Blood Eosinophils at Randomization and Exacerbations during the Protocols ICAC-08/09 ICATA Double Blind Treatment Phase.

Of not e, a post hoc analysis of the DREAM (Mepolizumab for Severe Eosinophilic Asthma) study suggests that this subgroup of patients with high body mass indices (BMIs ) may be particularly responsive to mepolizumab29. Further, in the presence of elevated eosinophils, adult patients with and without aeroallergen sensitization responded similarly to mepolizumab31. In the same analysis, mepolizumab responses were similar across quartiles of total serum IgE31. Thus, it is possible that mepolizumab may be particularly effective in patients who do not fit the current omalizumab dosing paradigm, and have the potential to meet an important unmet need for this group of approximately 50% of urban youth with difficult to control, exacerbation prone asthma. 2 Study Hypotheses/ Objectives 2.1 Hypotheses The primary research question of this study is whether mepolizumab will lead to a reduced rate of asthma exacerbations in urban children and adolescents (ages 6 -17) with difficult-to -control, exacerbation-prone asthma an d peripheral blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μl . We hypothesize that targeting eosinophils with the addition of the anti -IL-5 monoclonal antibody, mepolizumab, will prevent exacerbations and, as a consequ ence, reduce overall morbidity and improve asthma control . We will also explore the mechanistic hypothesis that IL-5 inhibition will have broad effects on T2 inflammation in the airways. 2.2 Primary Objective(s) The primary objective of this study is to determine whether mepolizumab, in addition to guidelines - based care, will reduce the rate of asthma exacerbations compared to guidelines -based care alone. 2.3 Secondary Objective(s) Secondary objectives are: 1. To determine whether mepolizumab will lead to an improved C omposite Asthma Severity I ndex (CASI)1 2. To determine whether mepolizumab will improve quality of life as assessed by the physician- patient global assessment2 3. To determine whether mepolizumab improves lung function as assessed by spirometry and impulse oscillometry 4. To determine whether mepolizumab increases the time to first asthma exacerbation 5. To separately determine whether mepolizumab reduces the rate of exacerbations in study participants who do not fit the FDA -approved dosing table (see Appendix C ) for omalizumab therapy and in study participants who fit the FD A-approved dosing table for omalizumab therapy 6.

To measure levels of antibody to mepolizumab 3 Study Design 3.1 Description of Study Design Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 is a multicenter, double- blind, placebo -controlled, randomized trial of mepolizumab adjunctive therapy for the prevention of asthma exacerbations in urban children and adolescents 6 to 17 years with e xacerbation -prone asthma and peripheral blood eosinophilia. Approximately 290 participants will be randomized 1:1 to one of two study arms: 1) guidelines -based asthma treatment + placebo , or 2) guidelines -based asthma treatment + mepolizumab. All participa nts will be followed for one year. There will be a Screening Visit followed by a 4-week run -in period. After the run- in, children who continue to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms and receive their first injection. Participants will receive monthly injections of either 40 mg or 100 mg of mepolizumab/placebo administered subcutaneously , according to their age. Participants 6 to 11 years of age and weighing ≥40 kg who were enrolled in Protocol ICAC -30 under the previous versions of the protocol and initially assigned a 100 mg dose will have their dose reduced to 40 mg. Participants who receive the 40 mg dose at randomization will increase to the 100 mg dose if they become 12 years old during the study. All parti cipants will have Evaluation and Management (E&M) visits every 3 months where their asthma will be assessed and adjustment s made to their medications based on asthma guidelines. Participants will be asked to monitor and report cold symptoms . Participants will come to the clinic at the time of a cold, up to three times , for collection of blood and nasal secretions for associated mechanistic studies ."
20,page_20,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 21 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 Participants will also be asked to come into the clinic following an asthma exacerbation for collection of blood and nasal secretions for associated mechanistic studies , assessments of airway physiology, and to collect information for ongoing asthma management. Figure 3.1. Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Study Design 3.2 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the number of asthma exacerbations during the 12 -month treatment period. Exacerbations will be defined as a prescription of a course of systemic corticosteroids by a clinician, initiation of a course of systemic corticosteroids by a participant, or as a hospitalization for asthma. If a participant initiates and completes a course of systemic corticosteroids without clinician involvement, this course will be counted only if the study clinician agrees the treatment was warranted, and it meets the following dosag e: the course for prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone will be at least 20 mg daily dose for 3 of 5 consecutive days. The course for dexamethasone will be at least a 10 mg single daily dose. If a corticosteroid burst for the treatment of an asth ma exacerbation is prescribed by a non - ICAC clinician, it will be counted regardless of dose. 3.3 Secondary Endpoint(s )/Outcome(s) 1.

Other biomarkers (banking plasma, banking nasal sample, RNA, DNA) 3.5 Stratification, Randomization, and Blinding /Masking Randomization will be performed using a validated system created by the DAIT S tatistical and Clinical Coordinating Center (SACCC) called RhoRAND TM that automates the random assignment of treatment groups to study ID numbers. The randomization scheme will be reviewed and approved by a statistician at the DAIT SACCC. Participa nts will be randomized using a 1 :1 ratio of active study drug and control (placebo) participants. A covariate adaptive randomization algorithm developed by Pocock an d Simon (1975) 32 will be used to maintain a balance between treatment arms with respect to site, number of previous exacerbations (2 or 3+) , peripheral blood eosinophils ( < or ≥400 cells/ μl), BMI (< or ≥95th percentile for age) , total serum IgE (< or ≥540 kUA/L ) and treatment dose (40 mg or 100 mg). This strategy was chosen to enhance our ability to balance the distribution of covariates that are known to be highly associated with our primary endpoint (e.g., number of previous exacerbations and peripheral blood eosinophils) as well as covariates that determine if a participant fits the FDA -approved do sing tables for omalizumab therapy (e.g., BMI and total serum IgE), which is related to Secondary Objective 5. Randomization data will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized persons, until the time of unblinding. W hen the study has b een completed, the data files verified, and the protocol deviations determined, the investigational agent codes will be broken and made available for data analysis. The clinical site’ s research pharmacy will dispense the study drug as per the randomization schedule provided by RhoRANDTM. The injections will be administered by trained clinical research staff . Prior to injection, an unblinded site pharmacist will confirm the expiration date, the dose, and randomization assignment. The product will remain blinded to blinded clinical research staff and the participant. 3.5.1 Procedure for Unblinding/Unmasking Unblinding must be approved by the DAIT NIAID Medical Monitor unless an immediate life t hreatening condition has developed and the Medical Monitor is not accessible. If unblinding is performed through RhoRANDTM, a notification will be sent to the protocol chair , the DAIT NIAID Medical Monitor, and the DAIT SACC C team of the unblinding event as soon as unblinding occurs. Otherwise, t he site principal"

The emergency unblinding will also be reported to the NIAID Allergy and Asthma Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ). A full account of the event will be recorded, including the date and time of the unblinding, the reason for the decision to unblind, and the name of the individual who made the decision to unblind and the names of the DAIT NIAID Medical M onitor and others who were notified. The reasons for unblinding of a participant’s treatment will be included in the final clinical study report. Unblinding the study due to an approved interim analysis, final analysis, or study termination will require written approval from the DAIT NIAID Medical Monitor . 4 Selection of Participants and Clinical Sites/Laboratories 4.1 Rationale for Study Population The population selected for this trial is urban asthma patients aged 6-17 years with difficu lt-to -control, exacerbation-prone asthma and a peripheral blood eosinophil count ≥150 cells/ μl. Previous DAIT NIAID - sponsored inner-city asthma clinical trials have shown that high proportions of children who meet Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 inclusion criteria continue to experience exacerbations despite receiving guidelines -based asthma management and maximum levels of treatment with inhaled steroids.7,8 Omalizumab is a n effective add -on treatment, but up to 50% of children and adolescents identified with difficult -to-control, exacerbation -prone asthma may be ineligible for omalizumab due to their high weight , high (or low) total serum IgE level, or lack of aeroallergen sensitization. Given the existing shortcomings in the effectiveness of current treatments for a significant proportion of children and adolescents with asthma, a new approach for their management is needed to improve disease control and reduce morbidity, focusing on exacerbations. 4.2 Inclusion Criteria 1.

These reactions generally occur within hours of administration, but in some instances can have a delayed onset (i.e., days). In controlled clinical trials, 2 serious adverse reactions of herpes zoster occurred in participants treated with mepolizumab compared with none in placebo. Varicella vaccination or history of varicella is required prior to randomization. Very common adverse reactions in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma (incidence greater than or equal 10%) include headache and subcutaneous injection site reaction (such as pain, erythema, swelling, itching or burning sensation ). Per the current IB for mepolizumab, the common adverse events are back pain, nasopharyngitis , urinary tract infection , nasal congest ion, eczema, and abdominal pain upper . The incidence of AEs was similar for the placebo group as compared to the mepolizumab group regardless of the route of administration (SC or IV) with the exception of a higher rate of injection site reactions with SC administration of mepolizumab (8%) compared with placebo (3%) 33. 5.2 Risks of Investigational Product or Intervention C ited in Medical Literature Other side effects from Nucala ® 10 have been reported. The MENSA trial2 was a randomized, double- blind, double -dummy study of 576 patients aged 12 -82 years old randomized to 75 -mg mepolizumab administered intravenously, 100 -mg mepolizumab administered subcutaneously, and placebo. The overall frequency of adverse events was similar across the three treatment groups. The most frequently reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis (24% given mepolizumab intravenously, 17 % given mepolizumab subcutaneously, 24% given placebo) and headache ( 24%, 20% , and 17 %). The incidence of adver se events related to a study drug was 17%, 20% and 16%. The incidence of injection -site reactions was more frequent in the subcutaneous -mepolizumab group (9%) than in the intravenous -mepolizumab and placebo groups (3% in both). The incidence of serious adverse events (including asthma -related events) was 7%, 8%, and 14% 2. The DREAM study 14 was a mu lticenter, double-blind, placebo -controlled trial of 621 patients aged 12 -74 years ol d randomized to placebo, 75 mg mepolizumab, 250 mg mepolizumab and 750 mg mepolizumab administered intravenously . The overall frequency of serious adverse events was similar across treatment groups. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache (17% given placebo, 21% given 75 mg mepolizumab, 21% given 250 mg mepolizumab, and 21% given 750 mg mepolizumab) and nasopharyngitis (15%, 22%, 22%, and 19%). The most frequently reported drug-related adverse event was infusion -related reaction (eg, non-allergic reactions), which was reported by 6% given placebo, 5% given 75 mg mepolizumab, 8% given 250 mg mepolizumab, and 12% given 750 mg mepolizumab. Hypersensitivity dee med to be possibly related to investigational product was reported by 2% given placebo, none given 75 mg mepolizumab, <1% given 250 mg mepolizumab, and 1% given 750 mg mepolizumab 14."
26,page_26,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 27 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 5.3 Risks of Other Protocol Specified Medications 5.3.1 Oral Corticosteroids Oral prednisone will be dispensed to each participant at the beginning of the study for treatment of asthma exacerbations as per the participant’s Asthma Action Plan (see Section 7.1.1.4 ). Oral corticosteroids can cause hoarseness, sore throat, and yeast infection of the mouth or throat if taken in high doses for lengthy periods of time. In addition, they can cause weight gain, growth delay, bruising of the skin, cataracts, and glucose intolerance. These effects are more likely if the medicine is taken at very high doses for extended periods of time. These side effects are not anticipated in this study because of the length of time (4 days on any occasion) that oral corticosteroids will be taken. 5.4 Risks of Study Procedures 5.4.1 Allergy Skin Testing Allergy skin testing is routinely performed in the management of asthma and allergic diseases. Skin testing will be completed by clinical research staff trained and certified to perform the procedure in accordance with the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP to maxi mize safety. If a participant is allergic to any of the allergens, redness, swelling, and itching of the skin may occur and last for 1 to 2 hours. These symptoms could occur up to 1 or 2 days after the skin test. A study clinician may provide a topical cor ticosteroid or oral antihistamine to treat these symptoms. There is also a very rare chance that the participant may have asthma symptoms or faint during the test. A medical provider trained in treating anaphylaxis will be available to provide immediate treatment in the event that a participant experiences a systemic allergic reaction. Stopping antihistamines before skin testing may make allergy (but not asthma) symptoms worse. Participants will be told they can take their medications if they need them, b ut the test will need to be rescheduled. To date, aeroallergen skin prick test procedures, conducted according to our MOP by trained and certified clinical research staff on thousands of children, have NEVER resulted in a systemic adverse reaction. Further, performance of such allergen evaluation is consistent with national asthma guidelines and provides direct benefits to both children and their families/caretakers. The results of the skin tests are provided to families, as well as relevant educational mat erials for environmental control. 5.4.2 Blood Collection The risks associated with a blood draw include possible pain from the stick, as well as bleeding, bruising, and infection of the skin. Lightheadedness and fainting rarely occur. To minimize these risks, a clinical staff member who is trained to draw blood from children will collect the samples. Additionally, clinical staff may apply a topical anesthetic to the skin before the blood draw to reduce the discomfort of the stick. Side effects from topical anesthetics include erythema, burning, paleness at the skin site, edema, and alterations in temperature. Reactions are mild and transient. There is a potential for cutaneous allergic reactions to topical anesthetics. Topical anesthetics are routinely used for us ual care venipunctures to minimize discomfort. The amount of blood to be collected is within the NIH pediatric guidelines. 5.4.3 Pulmonary Function Testing ( Spirometry and Impulse Oscillometry)"
27,page_27,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 28 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 Pulmonary function measurements will be performed by trained and cer tified clinical research staff according to A merican T horacic Society standards as performed routinely in usual care as part of subspecialist management of asthma. Pulmonary function tests can cause coughing or lightheadedness, which will go away shortly a fter the test is finished. Participants may be asked to withhold their asthma medications for 8 -24 hours before the procedure s depending on the medication. Withholding of asthma medications before testing may cause a worsening of asthma symptoms. These medications and withholding instructions are specified in the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP. Participants will be informed that they can take their asthma medications if needed. If participants do take their medications, the procedure will only be rescheduled as desc ribed in the Protocol ICAC-30 MOP. The albuterol that is given during reversibility testing can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, nausea, headache, and a jittery or nervous feeling. These symptoms usually resolve in less than an hour. 5.4.4 Exhaled Nitric Oxide Measurement Trained and certified clinical research staff will measure exhaled nitric oxide. This test is minimal risk and well tolerated. Rarely, dizziness may occur, which goes away as soon as the test is finished. 5.4.5 Nasal Sample Collection Trained and certified clinical research staff will obtain nasal mucus and nasal lavage samples from participants according to the Protocol ICAC-30 MOP. There are no known risks to collecting a nasal mucus sample. If a participant is unable to come to a col d visit (Section 8.11) or an exacerbation visit (Section 8.12) , he/she will be asked to collect a nasal swab sample at home. The nasal swab collection may cause localized discomfort. Rarely, mild epistaxis may occur. There is a risk of irritation if the liquid reagent in the nasal swab collection tube comes in contact with the skin. It is unknown whether the collection of the nasal swabs will increase the risk of infection to household members. Because we do not know if there is an increase d risk of infection transmission, the study will provide gloves and masks for each participant as a protection to those assisting with nasal swab collection at home . Nasal lavage may be associated with some transient discomfort due to the <10 second breath hold and the feeling of fluid in the nares. A very rare potential complication of nasal lavage is acute bacterial sinusitis (sinus infection). The nasal lavage procedure is considered minimal risk, and is often referred to as a nasal wash or nasal irrigation. A varie ty of over-the-counter products (such as the neti -pot filled with a saline solution) have been widely available for home use to safely flush out nasal passages and alleviate both nasal congestion and even sinusitis symptoms. In fact, the American Academy o f Otolaryngology -Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has just issued new national guidelines recommending home irrigation of the nose with such saline solutions (as an alternative to antibiotic use), due to its ability to thin the mucus in the nose, promote drainage, and reduce inflammation as an effective intervention for both acute and chronic sinusitis. We are proposing to conduct this minimal risk procedure in the clinic, but to save and process this nasal drainage for analysis."
28,page_28,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 29 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 The study clinician may us e their discretion as to whether to administer a nasal decongestant prior to the nasal collections. The nasal decongestant may be associated with temporary discomfort such as burning, stinging, sneezing, or an increase in nasal discharge. The nasosorption procedure may produce mild discomfort such as a tickle and/or tearing of the eyes. If a participant is unable to come to a cold visit (Section 8.11) or an exacerbation visit (Section 8.12), he/she will be asked to perform the nasosorption procedure at home. It is unknown whether the nasosorption procedure will increase the risk of infection to household members. Because we do not know if there is an increased risk of infection transmission, the study will provide gloves and masks for each participant as a protection to those assisting with the nasosorption procedure at home . 5.4.6 Sputum Induction Sputum induction may result in wheezing, coughing or chest tightness. Participants will be pre- medicated with albuterol to minimize this risk. 5.4.7 Nasal Epithelial Cell C ollection The risks associated with the nasal cell collection procedure include discomfort or pain, transient nosebleed, sneezing, tearing of the eyes, runny nose, and postnasal drip. 5.4.8 Questionnaires There is a possibility that participants and caretakers may find the questions too personal. Participants and caretakers may refuse to answer any questions that make them feel uncomfortable. 5.5 Potential Benefits Whereas the participant’s asthma may or may not improve while in this study, p articipants may directly benefit from study participation by receiving study -based asthma assessments and care from an asthma specialist. Participants will receive information about their spirometry and allergy skin testing and relevant asthma education consistent with recommendations in the national asthma guidelines for patients with asthma. Furthermore, these participants will receive close monitoring and direct management of asthma exacerbations on a 24/7 basis throughout the study. Participant families will receive contact num bers for the study site and a tailored asthma action plan and education. A supply of prednisone will be provided in concert with this management. 6 Investigational Agent 6.1 Investigational Agent : Mepolizumab Mepolizumab (SB-240563) is the investigational agent and will be provided to the clinical research sites by the IND Sponsor (DAIT NIAID). Mepolizumab will be obtained by the IND Sponsor free of charge from the manufacturer ( The Glaxo -Smith Kline Research and Development Ltd., Brentford, Middlesex, UK). 6.1.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa) that blocks interleukin -5 (IL -5) from binding to the IL -5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits signaling, resulting in the reduction in production and survival of eosinophils."
29,page_29,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 30 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 Mepolizumab for injection (100 mg/vial) is supplied as a sterile, white to off -white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder. Mepolizumab is presented in a 10 mL Type I clear glass, stoppered , single -use vial. The drug product must be stored in a refrigerator at a temperature of 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F), protected from light. 6.1.2 Dosage, Preparation, and Administration Mepolizumab is licensed for add -on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma at a dose of 100 mg every 4 weeks and is available as a powder for solution for subcutaneous (SC) injection. In the United States, t he approved dose of N ucala® for children age 12 years and above is 100 mg administered once every 4 weeks by subcutaneous injection into the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen 34. For children between 6 and 11 years of age, the approved dose is 40 mg every 4 weeks. Mepolizumab for injection (100 mg/vial) is r econstitute d in the vial with 1.2 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, preferably using a 2 - or 3-mL syringe and a 21 -G needle. The reconstituted solution will contain a concentration of approximately 100 mg/mL mepolizumab. Participants assigned to the 100 mg treatmen t group will receive 1.0 mL of reconstituted mepolizumab . Participants assigned to the 40 mg treatment group will receive 0.4 mL of reconstituted mepolizumab . The reconstituted solution should be kept at refrigerated or controlled room temperature (up to 2 5°C). It should be used as soon as possible and any unused solution remaining after 8 hours should be discarded. Complete reconstitution instructions are available in the GSK Investigator’s Brochure for mepolizumab. 6.2 Placebo Placebo for mepolizumab will be 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) for injection. Supplies of normal saline for injection will be obtained locally by the clinical site research pharmacists. 6.3 Drug Accountability Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) , the investigator will maintain adequate records of the disposition of the investigational agent, including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispensed (participant -by-participant accounting), and a detailed accounting of an y drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed. Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by the study site. A drug -dispensing log will be kept current for each participant. This log will contain the identification of each part icipant and the date and quantity of drug dispensed. All remaining unused investigational product will be returned to the sponsor (DAIT, NIAID) or sponsor’s representative after study termination, or destroyed with the permission of the sponsor in accordan ce with applicable law and study site procedures. If investigational product is to be destroyed locally, the investigator will provide documentation in accordance with sponsor’s specifications. All records regarding disposition of the investigational prod uct will be available for inspection by the clinical trial monitor. 6.4 Assessment of Participant Compliance with Investigational Agent"
30,page_30,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 31 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 As participants will receive their mepolizumab/placebo injections in the clinic, compliance will be monitored by assessing the number of completed and missed clinic visits. 6.5 Toxicity Prevention and Management Mepolizumab /placebo doses will not be modified. Protocol Section 8.5 describes safety measures to monitor potential signs and symptoms post injection. 6.6 Premature Discontinu ation of Study Participation Study participation may be prematurely discontinued for any participant for any of the reasons identified in Section 11.2 Participant Stopping Rules and Withdrawal Criteria . Participants who are prematurely discontinued will fo llow end of study procedures as described in Section 11.4 Follow-up After Early Study Withdrawal. Study participation may also be prematurely discontinued for any participant if the study clinician believes that the study treatment is no longer in the best interest of the participant. 6.7 Premature Discontinuation of Investigational Product Participants who are discontinued from investigational product for any reason after receiving at least one injection, and who agree to remain in the study, will have an altered visit schedule. These participants w ill be seen in clinic every 3 months for asthma management and evaluation of protocol defined outcomes and endpoints (i.e. Visits 3, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 14 and cold and exacerbation visits). The participants will not a ttend the monthly protocol defined injection visits which do not involve outcome evaluation and asthma management. These participants will not receive any injections of the investigational product during the visits they do attend. During the visits the pa rticipant attends, they will undergo all other scheduled procedures, evaluations, and blood draws. 7 Other Medications 7.1 Concomitant Medications 7.1.1 Protocol -mandated All participants will receive asthma step care according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (Expert Panel Report 3 [EPR- 3], National Asthma Education and Prevention Program [NAEPP], 2007). Treatment will be supervised by a study clinician. The study clinician will prescribe initial appropriate concomitant asthma therapies (se e Section 7.1.1.1 ) and will provide a written Asthma Action Plan for the participant at Visits 0, 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 (see Section 7.1.1.4 ). The regimen will then be adjusted as necessary at those visits throughout the duration of the trial based on the pri nciples of the EPR-3 guidelines (see Table 7.1.1.2a, below). The study clinician will prescribe the appropriate step controller therapy according to the participant’s insurance/health maintenance organization guidelines. The preferred controller steps and alternate equivalent medications may be modified or updated based on changes in standard clinical practice, discontinuation of current medications, or the introduction of new medications. For the standardized treatment of asthma exacerbations, the clinica l research staff will provide oral prednisone and written instructions for use. Montelukast may be prescribed by study clinicians if the participant was already"
31,page_31,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 32 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 taking the medication prior to study enrollment . Montelukast will not affect the algorithm for prescribing asthma treatment. All participants are required to have medical insurance at randomization that will cover, at least in part, the costs of their asthma medications. It is likely, however, that some participants may lose this coverage during the time that they are in the study. To maintain participant safety and avoid a loss of these participants to the study, Protocol ICAC-30 MUPPITS -2 will fund the cost of these participants’ asthma medications during the remainder of the study or until the participant regains insurance coverage during the study. Medications will be prescribed in the same manner using the same algorithms as all insured participants. Each research site will develop plans to use local pharmacies in a cost efficient and timely manner. This design is in place to mimic the support typical insured participants receive, i.e. they receiv e a prescription and have to fill it at a pharmacy. To limit the time that Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 is required to fund the cost of asthma medications for a participant who has lost coverage, each research site will develop a plan for evaluation of insur ance options and referral to appropriate support systems to obtain coverage for medication costs. In addition to addressing potential insurance from employers and governmental sources, this may include free clinics and support programs available through ph armaceutical firms. 7.1.1.1 Initial Regimen During Visit 0, the study clinician will determine the appropriate asthma control regimen that will be prescribed for the participant. Along with the participant’s medical history and physical examination results, the medication regimen is determined by the participant’s symptoms, number of systemic corticosteroid bursts in the past 6 months, percent- predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), and current level of asthma controller therapy. First, the study clinician will determine the highest “control level” of the participant’s morbidity across the 4 categories in Table 7.1.1.1 a. For example, if the participant has 8 days with symptoms (control level 2), 1 night with symptoms (control level 1), is at 75% pr edicted FEV 1 (control level 3), and has 0 systemic steroid bursts, (control level 1), then the participant is at control level 3 because that is the highest of these 4 categories. Table 7.1.1.1 a Asthma Symptoms for Determining Run -in Asthma Medication Regi men Control Level Maximum of 1) # days with asthma symptoms/ two weeks and 2) # days with rescue albuterol or levalbuterol use/ two weeks* Maximum of 1) # nights of sleep disruption due to asthma/ 2 weeks and 2) # nights use of albuterol or levalbuterol fo r awakening / 2 weeks* FEV 1 (% pred)** Courses of systemic steroids in the last 6 months*** 1 0-3 days 0-1 night ≥ 85 0 2 4-9 days 2 nights 80 - < 85 1 3 10-13 days 3-4 nights 70 - < 80 2 4 14 days 5-14 nights < 70 >2"

If a participant initiates and completes a course of systemic steroids without clinician involvement, this course will be counted only if it meets the following dosage: the course for prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone will be at least 20 mg daily dose for 3 of 5 consecutive days. The course for dexamethasone will be at least a 10 mg single daily dose. If a corticosteroid burst for the treatment of an asthma exacerbation is prescribed by a non-ICAC clinician, it will be counted regardless of dose. Next, the study clinician will determine the current level of controller therapy that the participant is using. Table 7.1.1.1b shows the asthma regimens that will be used during the treatment phase of Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2. If the participant is currently on one of the therapies below, then the step level of that therapy will be noted. Otherwise, the study clinician must refer to the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP for equivalency tables for other asthma therapies. From the information in the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP, the study clinician will determine the corresponding step level of therapy that the participant is currently using. For example, if the participant is currently taking Flovent® Diskus® 250 mcg twice per day (bid), then he/she is receiving Step 3 therapy. Table 7.1.1.1b Asthma Regimen by Step Level of Therapy Step Medication Equivalent* 0 No controller medication; albuterol or levalbuterol prn 1 fluticasone 50 mcg bid 2 fluticasone 100 mcg bid 3 fluticasone 250 mcg bid 4 fluticasone 250 mcg bid plus LABA 5 fluticasone 500 mcg bid plus LABA bid = twice per day; LABA = long -acting beta agonist *Equivalent medication covered by participant’s insurance formulary – see Protocol ICAC -30 MOP. Based on the participant’s current control level (from Table 7.1.1.1 a) and the participant’s current step level of therapy (from Table 7.1.1.1b and the Protocol ICAC-30 MOP), the study clinician will find the corresponding row in Table 7.1.1.1 c below that includes both the current regimen and the current control level. The last column of that row gives the corresponding regimen as a step level, which refers back to Table 7.1.1.1 b. The study clinician will prescribe this regimen. Study eligibility in terms of treatment step level will be as follows: • For participants ages 6 to 11 years, who have a requirement for at least Step Level 3 (defined in Table 7.1.1.1 b) at Visit 0 • For participants ages 12 years and older, who have a requirement for at least St ep Level 4 (defined in Table 7.1.1.1 b) at Visit 0"
33,page_33,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 34 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 Continuing the example from above, since the participant is taking Step 3 therapy and is at control level 3, the regimen assigned would be Step 4 (fluticasone 250 mcg bid with LABA from Table 5.2b).

In addition to the controller regimen assigned above, all participants will be prescribed albuterol by metered-dose inhaler beta -agonist or nebulizer (per clinician discretion) to be used as needed and will be provided oral prednisone to be used as per protocol – see Section 7.4 and the Protocol ICAC-30 MOP. The study clinician will prescribe enough medication to last until the next E&M visit. If a participant is not eligible to continue, the study clinician may prescribe an appropriate treatment regimen based on clinical judgment. 7.1.1.2 Study Period Treatment Regimen (Visits 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13) At Visits 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 participants’ asthma medication regimen will be adjusted based on symptoms, albuterol/levalbutero l use, FEV 1, recent exacerbations, and their current level of therapy. Except at Visit 1, p articipants will be stepped down from controller medications at each visit for which their control level is equal to 1. At Visit 1, it is not appropriate to step do wn a participant’s treatment"
34,page_34,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 35 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 after 4 weeks of observation during the assumption care. As such, participants will not be stepped down at Visit 1. At Visit 1, a participant may be stepped up as per the protocol algorithm. Participants will undergo pre-bron chodilator spirometry and an assessment of symptoms, rescue bronchodilator usage, recent exacerbations and medication adherence. Bronchodilator use as a preventive measure prior to exercise will not count toward the assessment of rescue bronchodilator use. Based on these data, a study clinician will determine the participant’s current control level from Table 7.1.1.2 a below. The control levels originated from the published national guidelines, Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR -3, NA EPP, 2007). For all participants, the highest control level for days with symptoms or albuterol/levalbuterol use, nights with symptoms or albuterol/levalbuterol use, percent personal best FEV 1, and exacerbation history will be determined by the study clinician. The day and night symptoms, albuterol/levalbuterol use, adherence to prescribed asthma controller medications by self-report, and exacerbation history will be determined from questionnaires. The FEV 1 personal best is defined in the Protocol ICAC-30 M OP. If the quality of the spirometry maneuver at the current visit is unacceptable according to the technician’s judgment, FEV 1 in Table 7.1.1.2a will not be used, and the control level will be based on day and night symptoms, albuterol/levalbuterol use, and exacerbation history. For example, if a participant has 0 days with symptoms (control level 1), 4 nights with symptoms (control level 3), FEV 1 at 85% of personal best (control level 1), and 1 exacerbation (control level 2), then the participant’s overall control level is 3 because that is the maximum value of control levels 1, 3, 1, and 2.

35,page_35,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 36 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 Based on the overall control level and the participant’s estimated level of adherence, the study clinician will use Table 7.1.1.2b b below to determine how the participant’s current therap y should be modified. At E&M Visits, the participant will be considered to have acceptable adherence if he/she reports having taken 50% or more of the prescribed doses in the last 2 weeks. Participants with unacceptable adherence will not be stepped up in the same way as those with acceptable adherence. Continuing with the same example, since this participant is at control level 3 and assuming he/she has acceptable adherence, the study clinician would recommend a 2 -step increase in therapy (or an increase to Step 5 if on Step 4 or maintenance on Step 5 if already on Step 5).

He/she will base the treatment on factors such as symptoms, albuterol use, spirometry, adherence, and the participan t’s current level of therapy; however, the participant’s treatment will not be stepped down at Visit 14. The participant’s care will then be transferred back to their primary care provider ( PCP) and/or asthma specialist. 7.1.1.4 Asthma Action Plan Clinical researc h staff will provide a written Asthma Action Plan consistent with NAEPP guidelines for the participant at Visits 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 , and 14 . This plan describes a Green, Yellow, and Red Zone for the participant based on his/her symptoms. In the Green Zone, the participant has no symptoms of an asthma episode and is directed to use his/her usual asthma medications. In the Yellow Zone, the participant is experiencing asthma, allergy, or cold symptoms, and is directed to increase rescue medication use until the symptoms have been resolved. In the Red Zone, the participant is having persistent symptoms that cannot be controlled. The participant is instructed to contact a study clinician OR go to the emergency department (ED) if unable to contact a study clinician. 7.1.1.5 Asthma Education As part of the meeting at Visits 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 14 with a clinical research staff member for asthma education, participants will be educated on topics related to asthma. These topics include background on asthma as a disease, use of the Asthma Action Plan (see Section 5.5), adherence to medications, using medications at school (when applicable), and allergen and irritant avoidance. Handouts will be provided and the education content will be tailored to each participant. For example, the allergen avoidance education will be based on the participant’s aeroallergen skin test/serum IgE results. The participant will receive education about the allergens to which he/she is sensitive. The informatio n contained in the handouts will be based on the EPR-3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma and on experience from previous ICAC clinical trials. The involvement of the caretaker in these sessions depends on the age and maturity of the pa rticipant. 7.1.2 Other permitted concomitant medications During the study , maintenance medications, aside from those excluded in Section 4.3 , Exclusion Criteria, will be permitted. 7.2 Prophylactic Medications Not applicable. 7.3 Prohibited Medications 1. Allergen immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous ) 2. Anti-IgE therapy 3. Any investigational drug 4. Additional medications listed in the Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 MOP"

To achieve as much uniformity in approach as possible across clinical sites, these plans will be pre -printed with specific albuterol dosing for the Yellow and Red zones. 7.4.1 Definition and Management of Acute Exacerbations Consistent with NAEPP 2007 guidelines, study clinicians caring for participants in the Protocol ICAC-30 MUPPITS -2 study will start a course of corticosteroids for severe and/or unre sponsive exacerbations of asthma. For the purposes of the proposed analyses, an asthma exacerbation is defined as a prescription of a course of systemic steroids by a clinician or initiation of a course of systemic steroids by a participant or a hospitalization to prevent a serious asthma outcome. If a participant initiates and completes a course of systemic steroids without clinician involvement, this course will be counted only if the study clinician agrees the treatment was warranted and it meets the fol lowing dosage: t he course for prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone will be at least 20mg daily for 3 of 5 consecutive days. The course for dexamethasone will be at least a 10 mg single daily dose. Study c linicians will strongly consider initiati on of corticosteroids if: • Albuterol is needed by inhaler (with or without a spacer) or by nebulization for more than 6 individual treatments in 24 hours; or • Moderate -severe wheeze, cough, shortness of breath, and/or chest tightness or pain occurs for at least 5 of the preceding 7 days; or • Symptoms of wheeze, cough, shortness of breath, and/or chest tightness or pain severe enough to place a participant in his or her “Red Zone” on their Asthma Action Plan (see Section 7.1.1.4 ) do not significantly improve after 3 doses of albuterol. (In such situations, in addition to the initiation of oral corticosteroids, the study clinician should consider directing the participant to the nearest ED.); or • There is an unscheduled visit for acute asthma care requiring repeated doses of albuterol (clinician office, urgent care, ED); or • Hospitalization is needed for asthma. Permissible drugs for systemic corticosteroid treatment of asthma exacerbations include: prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone. The course for prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone will be 2 mg/kg/day as a single daily dose for 4 days with a maximum dose of 60 mg per day. The course for dexamethasone will be 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg/day as a single daily dose for 2 days with a maximum dose of 16 mg per day. Failure to respond to initial treatment will result in additional evaluation and possible hospitalization for further management. This management approach has been applied to previous ICAC clinical trials and is consistent with asthma specialist usual care practices. 8 Study Procedures 8.1 Study Procedures"
38,page_38,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 39 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 8.1.1 Vital Signs and Growth Parameters Height (using a calibrated stadiometer) will be measured at clinic visit s as part of spirometry. Respiratory rate and temperature, along with a chest auscultation will be obtained at clinic visit s as part of the targeted pulmonary exam. The following vital signs and growth parameters will be collected at asthma evaluation and management visits (Visits 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 14 ) unless otherwise noted: • Weight in kilograms • Pulse rate • Blood pressure 8.1.2 Medical History and Physical Examination The participant’s medical history will be obtained, and a study clinician will perform a physical examination at Visit 0. The study clinician will perform a targeted pulmonary examination and current asthma symptom assessment at the other evaluation and management study visits. Additional examinations may be completed at the remainder of the visits at the study clinician’s discretion. Significant findings that are present prior to the start of the study must be included on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Significant findings that meet the definition of an adverse event (AE) must also be recorded on the AE form. If the participant is currently ha ving an asthma exacerbation or other symptoms that the study nurse or study clinician feel may compromise the participant’s ability to complete the study procedures safely, a physical exam may be performed and the study visit may be rescheduled. If the study clinician observes any AEs during the study visit, a targeted physical exam may be performed. Additional details regarding AE assessment are outlined in Section 12, Safety Monitoring and Reporting . 8.1.3 Aeroallergen Skin Testing The participant’s atopic status will be assessed with skin prick tests to assess allergy to dust mites, cockroaches and various other aeroallergens. The allergens chosen include those that are likely to cause sensitization in people living in urban environments . Participants will be asked to stop taking antihistamines for 5 days prior to the visit at which the skin test is performed to limit interference with the results of the skin test. Skin testing will be done by the prick technique using the Greer Pick system (Greer; Lenoir, NC). Testing will be performed by certified clinical research staff according to the instructions in the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP. Tests will be read after 15 minutes by measuring the wheal for each antigen and for the controls. Acceptable skin testing completed a s part of a participant’s participation in other ICAC protocols within 12 months will meet the requirement for this procedure. In this situation, the skin testing results documentation from the previous study will be added to the participant’s study file, and the skin testing procedure will not be repeated. The national asthma guidelines have emphasized that exposure of patients who have asthma to allergens to which they are sensitive has been shown to increase asthma symptoms and precipitate asthma exacerb ations. They further state that the clinician should evaluate the potential role of"
39,page_39,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 40 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 allergens, particularly indoor inhalant allergens via medical history and skin testing, and then assess the significance of positive tests in the context of the patient’s m edical history. Patients who have asthma at any level of severity should: reduce, if possible, exposure to allergens to which the patient is sensitized and exposed; know that effective allergen avoidance requires a comprehensive approach; and (3) be provi ded with relevant educational materials for control of environmental factors. For over 20 years, study clinicians with the DAIT NIAID -sponsored National Cooperative Inner -City Study (1991-1997), the DAIT NIAID -sponsored Inner -City Asthma Study (1994-2001), the DAIT NIAID -sponsored Inner -City Asthma Consoritium1 (ICAC1) (2002-2009), ICAC2 (2009-2014), and now ICAC3 as of 2015, have applied the recommendations from the asthma guidelines as best practices and “usual care” for children with asthma, especially as relevant to children residing in our inner -cities. These asthma specialists believe that participants and their families who enroll in our studies can receive direct benefit from the conduct of environmental histories, aeroallergen skin tests, and provision of education about personal allergen triggers and measures to avoid them. Seminal publications from the first study in 1997 reported that the enrolled study children who were both allergic to cockroach allergen and highly exposed had significantly higher rates of asthma hospitalization and asthma morbidity. Subsequent research has confirmed these observations and extended our knowledge on the extent of allergen sensitization in the inner -city environment, risks to these children, and successful interventions to mitigate these risks. For example, in the Protocol ICAC -07 Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma birth cohort study (URECA), children were aeroallergen skin prick tested as per the procedures we describe for Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2. By age 3, 44% of the Protocol ICAC -07 URECA cohort (n=418) were sensitized, primarily to cockroach, mouse, dog, dust mite, and cat. There were statistically significant odds ratios of the relationship between allergic sensitization and recurrent wheeze. Each of the ICAC1, ICAC2, and now ICAC3 trials have incorporated aeroallergen skin prick testing procedures as an evaluation that provides direct value to both children and their families. Feedback from parents and caretakers consistently confirm this value. These standardized procedures, performed by trained and certified clinical research staff , have now been safely performed in thousands of participating children in all inner -city studies with no reports of systemic adverse events. 8.1.4 Measurement of Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide Measurement of FeNO will be obtained (if location of visit allows) prior to spirometry. Exhaled nitric oxide will be measured following American Thoracic Society guidelines for FeNO assessment. 27 This procedure is detailed in the Protocol ICAC-30 MOP. 8.1.5 Measurement of Pulmonary Function Spirometry and impulse oscillation spirometry will be conducted following the ATS and European Respiratory Society guidelines. For children under 8 years of age, ATS Preschool Guidelines will be used for spirometry acceptance evaluation. This procedure has been successfully implemented in previous DAIT NIAID -sponsored ICAC trials . Details regarding pulmonary function testing (PFT) are provided in the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP. All PFTs will be performed by certified clinical research staff. Participants may be asked to stop taking some asthma medications 8 -24 hours before the visit (depending on the type of medication) to limit their interference with the results of the pulmonary function testing. These medications and withholding instruction s are specified in the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP ."
40,page_40,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 41 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 8.1.6 Questionnaire Assessments Questionnaires administered by site staff will collect inclusion/exclusion criteria information, participant contact information, demographic characteristics, asthma and allergy history and medication use, asthma exacerbation history, asthma symptoms and health care utilization, cold symptoms, concomitant medications, AE information, and primary care provider (PCP) contact information. 8.2 Clinical and Research Laboratory Evaluations and Specimen Collection 8.2.1 Blood Sample Collection Blood will be collected by peripheral venipuncture for transcriptomics, to preserve DNA/ RNA, to assess a complete blood count ( CBC) and differential and blood chemistry, as well as total and allergen -specific serum IgE . With the participant’s consent, blood will be stored for use in the future for unplanned tests. Blood volume will be indicated in the informed consent document along with any possibility for a repeat blood draw, if needed. An eosinophil value obtained as part of a participant’s participation in another ICAC protocol within 6 months of the screening visit will determine the requirement for Protocol ICAC - 30 MUPPITS -2 eligibility. Table 8.2.1 CBC and Blood Chemistry Components CBC (and differential ) Blood Chemistry Platelets BUN Hema tocrit CO2 Hem oglobin Creatinine Erythrocytes Glucose Leukocytes Serum chloride Monocytes Serum potassium Eosinophils Serum sodium Basophils Bilirubin Neutrophils Aspartate aminotransferase Lymphocytes Alanine aminotransferase 8.2.2 Nasal Sample Collection Nasal mucus samples will be collected as per the Protocol ICAC-30 MOP for respiratory virus/bacteria assessment. If a participant is unable to come to an exacerbation visit (Section 8.12), he/she will be asked to collect the nasal mucus sample at home. Training and supplies will be provided to the participant by the site staff. If a participant is unable to come to a cold visit (Section 8.11) or exacerbation visit (Section 8.12) , he/she will be asked to collect a nasal swab sample at home. Training and supplies will be provided to the participant by the site staff as per the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP . As per the Protocol ICAC-30 MOP, nasal lavage samples will be collected by instilling preservative -free buffered saline into the nostrils and allowing fluid to return passively into collection specimens. If the nostrils are occluded, a nasal decongestant may be administered at the discretion of the study clinician. Samples will be split and processed for both cell differentials and RNA extraction. Site clinical research staff who are trained , study -authorized, and certified will perform the nasal lavage and processing procedure as specified in the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP."

The sample will be obtained using the size-appropriate single use Nasosorption™ FX·i device (Hunt Developments , UK) consisting of a synthetic absorptive matrix strip (SAM) attached to an applicator handle. Details of the nasosorption sample collection and processing procedures are described in the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP . If a participant is unable to come to a cold visit (Section 8.11) or an exacerbation visit (Section 8.12), he/she will be asked to perform the nasosorption procedure at home. Training and supplies will be provided to the pa rticipant by the site staff. 8.2.3 Urine Pregnancy Testing All females who have reached menarche will be required to have a urine pregnancy test before completing study activities. If the result is positive, the participant will not undergo any procedures. Resul ts of all pregnancy tests will be given to the participant or caretaker as per site -specific guidelines and relevant state laws. 8.2.4 Urine Cotinine Urinary cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine) will be measured to determine exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. A urine sample will be collected following procedures described in the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP. The urine sample will be stored long-term for future research in the field of asthma. Participants will be asked to give permission for long-term storage and future use during the consent process. 8.2.5 Induced Sputum Sputum will be induced by inhalation of hypertonic saline solution using the method that was used in the Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) 35. Safety monitoring per spirometry and symptom report will be performed during and after sputum induction. Slides will be read at a central site for cellular determinations. Sputum cells will be processed for CyTOF analysis and RNA and DNA isolation for expression and epigenetic studies. Sputum supern atants will be collected, aliquoted, and stored pending further analysis. This procedure will be performed in a subset of children ≥10 years of age. 8.2.6 Nasal Epithelial Cell Collection Nasal epithelial cell samples will be obtained by using a cytology brush. A trained study clinician will conduct the procedure. The inferior turbinate of one nasal passage will be sampled to obtain an adequate number of epithelial cells for mRNA and DNA isolation. The sampled area will be observed for hemostasis. Procedural details and instructions for processing the samples are included in the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP. This procedure will be performed in a subset of children ≥10 years of age. 8.3 Recruitment The research site may use any Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved means to identify potential participants. Examples include hospital, clinic, or emergency department admission records; study clinicians’ specialty clinic records; and advertising (in public locations and on the radio). Potential participants wil l be screened and recruited using a standardized questionnaire that collects contact information and inclusion/exclusion criteria information. Participants may be recruited by phone or in person. Retention methods involve a number of different approaches. We will use an appointment reminder system that consists of phone calls several days and one day prior to scheduled appointments for"
42,page_42,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 43 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 confirmation. To facilitate telephone contact with participants whose phone service may change during the study, up to three telephone contact numbers (relatives, neighbors, friends) will be collected for each participant. This has proven to be an effective strategy in previous DAIT NIAID -sponsored ICAC trials . Those who have no obvious characteristics making them ineligible and who are interested will be invited to the clinic for a Screening Visit. 8.4 Screening/Baseline Visit This research study will be explained in lay terms to the parent/legal guardian of each potential participant. Written informed consent and Health Insuran ce Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization will be obtained from all parents/legal guardians at the beginning of this visit and before the child undergoes any screening study procedures . Children age 12 years and older will sign a written assent form. When the informed consent has been signed, the participant is considered enrolled in the study and will be assigned a unique participant number . Study procedures will be stopped, and the participant will be deemed ineligible for the study at a ny point during the Screening Visit if and when he/she fails to meet eligibility criteria. The purpose of the screening period is to confirm eligibility to continue in the study. After the consent (and assent, if applicable) is signed , participants will u ndergo screening study procedures as listed below: • Vital signs (see Section 8 .1.1) • Urine collection for pregnancy test for female participants who have reached menarche (see Section 8.2.3 ) • Medical history and a physical examination by study clinician (see Section 8 .1.2) • Concomitant medication assessment (see Sections 8 .1.6 and 7.1 ) • Questionnaires (see Section 8 .1.6) • Weight and height measurement, using a calib rated stadiometer (see Sec tion 8 .1.1) • Spirometry (see Section 8 .1.5) • Assignment of asthma medication regimen by study clinician (see Section 7.1.1 ) • Blood sample collection (see Section 8 .2.1.1) o CBC with differential o Blood chemistry o Total and allergen-specific IgE • Asthma co unseling (see Section 7.1.1 ) (not completed if participant is a screen fail) • AE assessment (see Section 12 ) Participants will also undergo skin prick tests (see Section 8.1.3) to a panel of allergens detailed in the Protocol ICAC -30 MOP to characterize t he study population. Participants who have valid skin test results within the previous year under another ICAC protoco l will not need to be re -tested. Clinical research staff may choose to perform the skin prick tests at Visits 2, 3, or 4 instead of Screening. Participants may be re-screened per study clinician discretion. Participants who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for re -screening: • Have a known, pre-existing clinically important lung condition other than asthma • Have known, pre-existing, unstable liver disease"
43,page_43,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 44 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 • Have a known immunodeficiency disease • Have other conditions that could lead to elevated eosinophils such as hypereosinophilic syndromes, including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis • Will not allow the study c linician, an asthma specialist, to manage their disease for the duration of the study or who are not willing to change their asthma medications to follow the protocol • Have a k nown history of allergic reaction to previous biologic therapy for asthma If total eosinophil counts were measured as a part of a CBC with differential in a previous ICAC protocol, total eosinophil results will be used to determine eligibility if drawn within 6 months of the Screening Visit. If values are not available from a previous ICAC protocol, total eosinophil counts obtained at Visit 0 will be used to determine eligibility. If a participant fails eligibility due to total eosinophil count only, the study clinician may choose to redraw total eosinophil counts one additional time for re -screening. 8.5 Randomization At this study visit, p articipants will be re -assessed to confirm they continue to meet study eligibility criteria. The study clinician will adjust the participant’s asthma medications as necessary according to the treatm ent algorithm (see Section 7.1.1. 2), write an appropriate prescription, and provide a new asthma action plan (see Section 7.1.1.4 ). At Visit 1, it is not appropriate to step down a participant’s treatment after 4 weeks of observation during the assumption of care. As such, participants will not be stepped down at Visit 1. At Visit 1, a participant may be stepped up as per the protocol algorithm. Participants will receive basic asthma education (see Section 7.1.1.5 ). Other assessments completed at this vi sit include: • Targeted pulmonary exam (see Section 8.1.2) • Spirometry and IOS with reversibility (see Section 8 .1.4), • Exhaled nitric oxide (see Section 8.1.4) • Urine cotinine (see Section 8 .2.4) • Urine pregnancy test, where indicated (see Section 8 .2.3) • Nasal mucus sample collection (see Section 8.2.2) • Nasal lavage (see Section 8.2.2) • Blood sample collection (see Section 8 .2.1) o CBC with differential o Blood markers (plasma/DNA/RNA) o Antibody to drug • Questionnaires (see Section 8 .1.6) • Assignment of asthma medication regimen by study clinician (see Section 7.1.1) • Asthma education/counseling (see Section 7.1.1.5) After they have been found eligible for randomization, participants will be randomized (see Section 13.3) and receive their first injection of mepolizumab/placebo."
44,page_44,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 45 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 Before each injection, participants will be screened for evidence of an ongoing allergic reaction or worsening of asthma. If a participant is unable to receive the study drug injection that day, the injection will be rescheduled . Injections must be at least 14 days apart. The injection will be administered by trained clinical research staff. Clinical research staff may apply a topical anesthetic to the skin before the injection to reduce the discomfort of the stick. During all dosing visits, a medical provider trained in treating anaphylaxis will be available to provide immediate treatment in the event that a participant experiences an allergic reaction. Participants will remain at the clinic for observation for at lea st 60 minutes after the first 3 injection s, after which a 30 minute wait period will be required. 8.6 Visit 2 (Week 8) At this visit, the following procedures and assessments will be performed: • Urine pregnancy test, where indicated (see Section 8.2.3) • Vital signs (see Section 8.1.1) • Lungs assessment • Study drug administration • AE assessment (see Section 12) • Concomitant medication assessment (see Sections 8.1.6 and 7.1.2 ) • Nasal mucus sample collection (see Section 8 .2.2) • Allergen skin testing (see Section 8.1.3) if not performed at a previous study visit or in another ICAC protocol within 12 months 8.7 Visit 3 (Week 12) At this visit, the following procedures and assessments will be performed: • Urine cotinine (see Section 8.2.4) • Urine pregnancy test, where indicated (see Section 8.2.3) • Vital signs (see Section 8.1.1) • Lungs assessment • Study drug administration • AE assessment (see Section 12) • Concomitant medication assessment (see Sections 8.1.6 and 7.1.2 ) • Nasal mucus sample collection (see Section 8 .2.2) • Nasal lavage (see Section 8.2.2) • Blood sample collection (see Section 8 .2.1) o CBC with differential o Blood chemistry o Blood markers (plasma/DNA/RNA) o Antibody to drug • Exhaled nitric oxide (see Section 8.1.4) • Allergen skin testing (see Section 8.1.3) if not performed at a previous study visit or in another ICAC protocol within 12 months"

If the site staff are notified by the participant, his/her family, an ED, a hospital, or clinic that the particip ant was seen for an unscheduled visit elsewhere, the site staff will contact the participant within 2 weeks of discharge to obtain an update on the participant’s clinical status. A follow-up visit at the study center will be scheduled if needed. For detai ls on the management plan, please refer to Section 7.1 and the Protocol ICAC-30 MOP. Participants who are at Control Level 4 at a study visit will either be seen in the clinic or will receive a follow-up phone call within 1 -2 weeks of the visit to check the status of their symptoms. Participants prescribed systemic corticosteroids who do not have an exacerbation study visit will receive a follow -up phone call within 1 -2 weeks of the visit to check the status of their symptoms. If systemic corticosteroids were prescribed by a non-ICAC clinician and the participant does not come in for a study exacerbation visit, the participant will be seen in the clinic or will receive a follow -up phone call within 1 - 2 weeks to check the status of their symptoms. If this prescribing is uncovered more than two weeks after ini tiation of the corticosteroids, and the participant is doing well at the time of notification, then no follow up phone call is required. Participants who have 2 exacerbations within a 1 -month period mu st be seen in a face -to-face visit to determine if continuation in the study is in the best interest of the participant. 8.14 Visit Windows Mepolizumab/placebo injections should be scheduled as close as possible to the every 4 week target date.

All reasons for withdrawal will be captured on the appropriate electronic case report form ( eCRF). 11.4 Follow-up after Early Study Withdrawa l Participants who withdraw or are dropped from the study between visits will be contacted by phone and will be invited to the study center for a final assessment. This assessment will include: • Urine pregnancy test, where indicated (see Section 8.2.3) • Ques tionnaires (see Section 8.1.6) • AE assessment (see Section 12) • Concomitant medication assessment (see Sections 8.1.6 and 7.1.2 ) • Vital signs (see Section 8.1.1) • Spirometry (see Section 8.1.5) • Targeted pulmonary exam (see Section 8.1.2 ) • Assignment of asthma medication regimen by study clinician (see Section 7.1.1 ) • Asthma education/counseling (see Section 7.1.1.5 ) • Blood sample collection (see Section 8.2.1) o CBC with differential o Blood chemistry Procedures contraindicated by the medical co ndition of the participant will not be conducted at the discretion of the study clinician. For participants who refuse to come to the clinic, the final clinical assessment as described above may be conducted over the phone. Besides this visit, no further f ollow- up will be made, except for participants who are discontinued due to pregnancy or SAEs. These participants will be contacted to determine the outcome of the pregnancy or the SAE. Refer to Section 12.6 for more information on AE reporting for pregnanc y. 11.5 Study Stopping Rules Study enrollment will be temporarily suspended pending expedited review of all pertinent data after the occurrence of one death or SAE which is unexpected and related to the investigational agent."

The FDA wi ll be notified if stopping rules are met and also on resumption of the study. The study may be terminated by the IND sponsor ( DAIT NIAID ) or the NIAID Allergy and Asthma DSMB upon review of any observations, events, or new information that merits such acti on. 12 Safety Monitoring and Reporting 12.1 Overview This section defines the types of safety data that will be collected under this protocol and outlines the procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and reporting those data. Adverse events that are classified as serious according to the definition of Health Authorities must be reported promptly (per Section 12.5, Reporting of Ser ious Adverse Events and Adverse Events ) to the IND sponsor ( DAIT NIAID ). Appropriate notifications will also be made to site Principal I nvestigators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), and appropriate H ealth Authorities. Information in this section comp lies with ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, ICH Guideline E -6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, 21CFR Parts 312 and 320, and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute , Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version [ enter 4.0 or correct version applicable to trial ] : http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 12.2 Definitions 12.2.1 Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence, or worsening of an undesirable or unintended sign, symptom, laboratory finding or disease that occurs during participation in the trial , whether or not considered related to the participant’s participation in the research (modified from the definition of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on Harmonis ation E-6 Guideline s for Good Clinical Practice) (f rom OHRP ""Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Other s and Adverse Events (1/15/07)"" http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2 ) AEs that occur due to a study procedure will be collected and recorded. The following clinical situations, when associated with study procedures, are defined as adverse events and will be recorded on the AE CRF. These situations do not limit the Principal Investigator from reporting to the Study Sponsor (DAIT NIAID) any other events, associated or not with these procedures, as AEs. • Study therapy regimen : mepolizumab administered by the subcutaneous route • Study mandated procedures : AEs that occur due to a study procedure will be collected and recorded.

For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to sugges t a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)). 12.2.2 Unexpected Adverse E vent An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” when its nature (specificity), or severity, or rate of occurrence is not consistent with applicable product information as described in the safety information provided in the current GSK Investigator’s Brochure for mepolizumab . “Unexpected” also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse react ions that are mentioned in the current GSK Investigator’s Brochure for mepolizumab as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation (21 CFR 312.32(a) ). 12.2.3 Serious Adverse Event An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or the IND s ponsor (DAIT NIAID), it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)): 1. Death. 2. A life -threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the Principal I nvestigator or IND S ponsor , its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization. 4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. 5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect. 6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or requ ire hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Elective hospitalizations , hospit alizations for pre-existing conditions that do not worsen during the course of the trial, or hospital admissions for the purpose of conduct of protocol mandated procedures are not to be reported as an SAE unless hospitalization is prolonged due to complica tions."
53,page_53,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 54 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 Exacerbations of asthma are ordinary, anticipated complications of asthma observed in patients receiving standard of care. An asthma exacerbation that requires hospitalization and is determined to be a SAR (Section 12.2.1.1 ) will be considered a SAE. All other asthma hospitalizations will not be considered SAEs and will be entered only on the appropriate CRFs. The date of onset of the asthma exacerbation SAE will be the date of hospital admission and the date of resolution will be the discharge date. The underlying condition will be followed as per protocol. 12.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E-6: Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and applies the following standards: • Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (published September 2007) for local reactions to study procedures. • Grading System of Severity of Anaphylaxis adapted , from the grading scale of Brown et al. (36) for anaphylaxis and systemic reactions to study procedures. • National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (published June 14, 2010) for all other reactions.

To be considered anaphylaxis, the event must involve at least two organ systems (e.g. not be simply a skin reaction). All anaphylaxis events, regardless of severity grade, will be recorded as Adverse Events and will be graded according to Table 12.3.1c Grading System of Severity of Anaphylaxis, adapted from the grading scale of 36Brown et al.

This document (referred to herein as the NCI-CTCAE manual) provides a common langu age to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events. The NCI -CTCAE has been reviewed by the Principal Investigators and has been deemed appropriate for the participant population to be studied in this protocol. Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the NCI - CTCAE manual: Grade 1 = mild adverse event Grade 2 = moderate adverse event Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event Grade 4 = life -threatening or disabling adverse event Grade 5 = death Events Grade 1 or higher will be recorded on the appropriate AE electronic case report form for this study. For grading an abnormal value or result of a clinical or laboratory evaluation (including, but not limited to, a radiograph, an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram etc.), a treatment -emergent adverse event will rely on clinical judgment of the study clinician to determine if the value is an adverse event.

For serious adverse events, all requested information on the AE/SAE eCRF will be provided. The following minimal criteria must be included in the initial SAE eCRF: • AE Term • Study Drug Treatment • Relationship to study drug • Reason why the event is serious However, unavailable details of the event will not delay submission of the known information. As additional details become available, the AE/SAE eCRF will be updated and submitted. 12.5.2 Reporting to FDA After an adverse event requiring 2 4 hour reporting (per Section 12.5.1, Reportin g of Serious Adverse Events to S ponsor) is submitted by the Principal Investigator and assessed by the IND sponsor ( DAIT NIAID ), there are two options for DAIT NIAID to report the adverse event to the FDA: annual reporting and expedited safety reporting. 12.5.2.1 IND Annual Reporting DAIT NIAID will include in the IND A nnual Report to the FDA all adverse events classified as: • Serious, expected, suspected a dverse reactions (see Section 12.2.1.1, Suspected Adverse Reaction, and Section 12.2.2, Unexpected Adverse Event). • Serious and not a suspected adverse reaction (see Section 12.2.1.1, Suspected Adverse Reaction). • Pregnancies. Note that all adverse events (not just those requiring 24-hour reporting) will be reported in the IND Annual Report. 12.5.2.2 Expedited Safety Reporting This option, with 2 possible categories, applies if the adverse event is classified as one of the following: Category 1: Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction [SUSAR] (see Section 12.2.1.1, Suspected Adverse Reaction and Section 12.2.2 , Unexpected Adverse Event and 21 CFR 312.32(c)i). The sponsor shall report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. The sponsor shall report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and th e adverse event, such as: 1. A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, or Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)"
59,page_59,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 60 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 2. One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly ass ociated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture) 3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group Category 2: Any findings from studies that suggests a significant human risk The sponsor shall report any findings from other epidemiological studies, analyses of adverse events within the current study or pooled analysis across clinical studies or animal or in vitro testing (e.g. mutagenicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity) that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug that would result in a safety -related change in the protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure, or other aspects of the overall conduct of the study. DAIT NIAID must notify the FDA and all participating Principal Investigators of expedited Safety Reports within 15 calendar days; unexpected fatal or immediately life -threatening suspected adverse reaction(s) shall be reported as soon as possible or within 7 calendar days. 12.5.3 Reporting of Adverse Events to IRBs All Principal I nvestigators must report adverse events, including expedited reports, in a timely fashion to the Central IRB in accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines.

Monitoring of the pregnant participant shall continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy. The investigator shall report to the DAIT SACCC and the IND sponsor (DAIT NIAID ) all pregnancies within 1 business day of becoming aware of the event using the Pregnancy eCRF. All pregnancies identified during the study shall be followed to conclusion and the outcome of each must be reported. The Pregnancy eCRF shall be updated and submitted to the DAIT SACCC when details about the outcome are available. Information requested about the delivery shall include: • Gestational age at delivery • Birth weight, len gth, and head circumference • Gender"

In addi tion, the DAIT NIAID Medical Monitor shall review and make decisions on the disposition of the SAE and pregnancy reports received by the DAIT SACCC (See Sections 12.5 and 12.6). 12.8.2 DSMB Review 12.8.2.1 Planned DSMB Reviews The NIAID Allergy and Asthma Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) shall review safety data at least yearly during planned DSMB Data Review Meetings. Data for the planned safety reviews will include, at a minimum, a listing of all reported AEs and SAEs. The DSMB will be informed o f an Expedited Safety Report as determined by the DAIT NIAID Medical Monitor . An SAE which the DAIT NIAID M edical M onitor determines to be an unexpected safety risk will be sent to the DSMB immediately. 12.8.2.2 Ad hoc DSMB Reviews In addition to the pre-scheduled data reviews and planned safety monitoring, the DSMB may be called upon for ad hoc reviews. The DSMB will review any event that potentially impacts safety at the request of the protocol chair or the IND sponsor ( DAIT NIAID ). In addition, occurrences descr ibed in Section 11.5 Study Stopping Rules will trigger an ad hoc comprehensive DSMB Safety Review . After review of the data, the DSMB will make recommendations regarding study conduct and/or continuation. A temporary halt in enrollment and study treatment will be implemented if an ad hoc DSMB safety review is required. 13 Statistical Considerations and Analytical Plan"
61,page_61,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 62 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 13.1 Overview The primary research question of this study is whether mepolizumab will lead to a reduced rate of asthma exacerbations in urban children and adolescents with difficult -to-control, exacerbation -prone asthma and peripheral blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μl. This objective will be addressed using a multicenter, double-blind, placebo -controlled, randomized trial of mepolizumab adjunctive therapy for the prevention of asthma exacerbations in urban children and adolescents ages 6 to 17 years with difficult -to-control, exacerbation -prone asthma and peripheral blood eosinophilia. 13.2 Endpoints/Outcomes The primary endpoint is the number of asthma exacerbations between randomization and the end of participant follow -up or 12 months since randomization , whichever comes first. Exacerbations will be defined as a prescription of a course of systemic corticosteroids by a clinician, initiation of a course of systemic corticosteroids by a participant, or as a hospitalization for asthma. If a participant initiates and completes a course of systemic corticosteroids without clinician involvement, this course will be counted only if the study clinician agrees the treatment was warranted, and it meets the following dosage: the course for prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone will be at least 20 mg daily dose for 3 of 5 consecutive days. The course for dexamethasone will be at least a 10 mg single daily dose. If a corticosteroid burst for the treatment of an asthma exacerbation is prescribed by a non -ICAC clinician, it will be counted regardless of dose. Key secondary endpoints include: 1. Asthma burden, as measured by a composite score (CASI) of asthma sympto ms, medication usage, and exacerbation risk measured at Visits V1, V4, V7, V10, V13 and V14. 2. Patient reported outcomes, as measured by physician -patient global asse ssment tool measured at Visit V14. 3. Lung function, as assessed by spirometry measured at Visit V1, V4, V7, V10, V13, and V14 and IOS measured at Visit V1, V4, and V13. 4. Time between randomization and first asthma exacerbation or the end of participant follow - up, whichever comes first. Participants that do not have an asthma exacerbation will be right- censored at the end of follow -up. 13.3 Measures to Minimize Bias To minimize bias, randomization will be performed using a validated system created by the DAIT SACCC that automates the random assignment of treatment groups to study ID numbers. The rando mization scheme will be reviewed by a statistician at the DAIT SACCC and locked after approval. Participa nts will be randomized using a 1 :1 ratio of active and control (placebo) participants. A covariate adaptive randomization algorithm developed by Pocock and Simon (1975) 32 will be used to maintain a balance between treatment arms with respect to study site, number of previous exacerbations (2 or 3+) , peripheral blood eosinophils (< or ≥400 cells/ μl), BMI ( < or ≥95th percentile for age) , total serum IgE (< or ≥540 kUA/L) and treatment dose (40 mg or 100 mg) . This strategy was chosen to enhance our ability to balance the distribution of covariates that are known to be highly associated with our primary endpoint (e.g., number of previous exacerbations and peripheral blood eosinophils) as well as covariates that determine if a participant fits the FDA-approved dosing tables for omalizumab therapy (e.g., BMI and total serum IgE), which is related to Secondary Objective 5."
62,page_62,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 63 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 13.4 Analysis Plan 13.4.1 Analysis Populations The following groups of participants will define samples for endpoint analysis: • Modified Intent -to-treat (ITT) sample: All participants who are randomized and receive at least one dose of study treatment. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment arm to which they were randomized, regardless of the medication they actually received . • Safety sample: All participants who are randomized and receive at least one dose of study treatment. Participants will be analyzed according to the medication they actually received, regardless of the treatment arm to which they were randomized. Non-treatment emergent adverse events (e.g., any adverse event that occurs before the first injection) will be summarized in all participants who are enrolled, while treatment emergent adverse events (e.g., any adverse event that occurs on or after the first injection) will be summarized in the safety sample . • Per-protocol (PP) sample: All participants who are randomized, received the correct medication and dosage to which they were randomized, do not have a major protocol deviation and cannot have missed 3 or more consecutive injections or 4 or more scheduled injections. 13.4.2 Primary Analysis of Primary Endpoint (s)/Outcome (s) The primary analysis will compare the rate of exacerbations during the treatment period using a negative binomial model applied to the modified intent-to -treat sample. The model will include an offset term to account for differential follow -up among participants. To account for adaptive randomization, the model will also be adjusted for study site, number of exacerbations in year prior to study (2 or 3+), peripheral blood eosinophils (< or ≥400 cells/ μl), BMI (< or ≥95th percentile for age) , total serum IgE (< or ≥540 kUA/L) and treatment dose (40 mg or 100 mg) . Such a model will allow us to estimate the adjusted relative rate and corresponding 95% CI between t he mepolizumab and placebo arms. A two -sided significance level of 0.05 will be used for this analysis. The reduction of the dose of mepolizumab from 100 mg to 40 mg in children 6 to 11 years of age and >40 kg will not affect the primary outcome as data from the GSK -sponsored pediatric trial 200363, NCT02377427 is therapeutically equivalent. 13.4.3 Supportive Analyses of the Primary Endpoint (s)/Outcome (s) Analyses for the primary endpoint may be supported by several analyses. One disadvantage of a covariate ad aptive randomization strategy is that Type I error may be inflated in certain circumstances (e.g., time trends). Consequently, r ather than adjusting the model for the variables used in the adaptive randomization as discussed in Section 13.4.2 , a permutation test will be used for inference instead as it involves fewer assumptions. Under a permutation model, the observed relative rate between the mepolizumab and placebo arms will be assessed with reference to all possible permutations that the treatment arms could have been assigned to participants."
63,page_63,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 64 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 Rather than adjusting the model for the variables used in the adaptive randomization, the model will instead adjust for study site (as a random or fixed effect), number of exacerbations in year prior to study (2, 3 or 4+), BMI percentile (treated as a continuous variable) , total serum IgE (treated as a continuous variable and log -transformed, if appropriate) peripheral blood eosinophils (treated as a continuous variable and log -transformed, if appropriate ), and treatment dose ( 40 or 100 mg) . To test if the effect of mepolizumab on the rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period is modified by particular sub -groups, separate negative binomial models of the rate of asthma exacerbations during th e treatment period will be developed to test the two -way interac tion between treatment arm and: • Indicator for whether or not a participant fits the FDA -approved dosing table for omalizumab therapy • BMI percentile at baseline (continuous or categorical) • Peripheral blood eosinophils at baseline (continuous or categorical and log -transformed, if appropriate) • Bronchodilator responsiveness at baseline (continuous or categorical) • Number of exacerbations in year prior to study (2, 3 or 4+) • Total serum IgE at basel ine (continuous or categorical and log -transformed, if appropriate ) • Dose at baseline ( 40 mg or 100 mg) • FeNO (continuous or categorical) at baseline • Nasal ECP at baseline To test if the effect of mepolizumab on the rate of asthma exacerbations during the t reatment period is modified by both number of exacerbations in year prior to study as well as peripheral blood eosinophils, a separate negative binomial model of the rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period will be developed to test the three-way interaction between treatment arm, peripheral blood eosinophils (treated as either a piecewise linear spline or non-linear spline and log-transformed, if appropriate) and number of exacerbations in year prior to study (2, 3 or 4+). 13.4.4 Analyses of Secondary and Other Endpoint (s)/Outcome(s) Generalized linear mixed models will be used to model CASI and lung function during the treatment period. A generalized logit model will be used to analyze the physician -patient global assessment at Visit 14. Kapl an-Meier curves and a Cox PH model will also be used to model the time to first asthma exacerbation during the treatment period. As with the primary analyses, generalized linear mixed models, the generalized logit model, as well as the Cox PH model will include treatment arm as the primary exposure but will also adjust for study site, number of exacerbations in year prior to study (2 or 3+), peripheral blood eosinophils (above or below 400 cells/ μl), BMI (above or below 95th percentile for age) and total serum IgE (above or below 54 0 kUA/L) to account for adaptive randomization. To determine if mepolizumab reduces the rate of asthma exacerbation in participants who do not fit the FDA-approved dosing table for omalizumab th erapy or alternative ly, if mepolizumab reduces the rate of asthma exacerbation in participants who fit the FDA -approved dosing table, a separate negative"
64,page_64,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 65 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 binomial model similar to that used for the primary analysis will be applied to all participants in th e modified intent-to -treat sample in each of the 2 sub -groups . Because the goal of this objective is to estimate the effect of mepolizumab on the rate of asthma exacerbation in each sub-group, rather than compare these two effects using an interaction test, these effects will be reported regardless of the results obtained from the interaction test, which will be performed as part of the supportive analyses for the primary endpoint (see Section 13.4.3). Safety will be summarized by arm in the safety sample by the number and percentage of serious and non-serious adverse events stratified by grade and relationship to treatment as well as the number and percentage of participants who have a serious and non -serious adverse event stratified by grade and relationship to treatment. Levels of antibody to mepolizumab will be analyzed in the safety sample using generalized linear mixed models as stated above in the mepolizumab arm only. 13.4.5 Analyses of Exploratory Endpoint (s)/Outcome (s) To determine whether mepolizumab impr oves other important clinical outcomes, including rate of virus - induced asthma exacerbations, ACT/cACT scores, maximum number of asthma symptom days or bronchodilator response, negative binomial models, generalized linear mixed models, generalized logit models, Kaplan -Meier curves and Cox PH models will be applied as appropriate to each endpoint in a manner similar to that described in Sections 13.4.2 to 13.4.4. To identify immunologic pathways in the airways and peripheral blood that are characteristic of exacerbations prevented with and persistent despite anti -IL5 therapy, general linear models appropriate for RNA -sequencing count data will be used. Between group comparisons will be treated as a two independent group comparison and within group comparis ons will use a mixed effect model with individual as a random effect. For comparisons where we are testing whether the two groups behave differently with a cold, an exacerbation, or over time, a general linear model will be created adding in these variable s as main effects in the model and interaction terms between each effect. The general linear models will be expanded to include cell enumeration data as additional variables. Similarly, other salient variables (eg virus PCR data, collection site, collection time) that explain heterogeneity seen in the gene expression pattern, will be added to the model as appropriate. When relevant, predefined genes and gene sets of interest identified through Protocol ICAC -29 MUPPITS -1 results or previously published data will be tested separately without stringent multiple testing correction. Gene expression differences will be assigned to specific cell types using gene expression deconvolution algorithms appropriate for bulk cell population expression data. Predefined subgroups including PCR virus results, age, sex, race/ethnicity, obesity, timing of onset of asthma exacerbation relative to onset of cold symptoms, systemic corticosteroid use, season, nasal corticosteroid use, tobacco smoke exposure, and eNO will also be co mpared. 13.4.6 Descriptive Analyses Descriptive analyses will be reported separately for mepolizumab and placebo arms. Continuous baseline measures will be reported 1) means (or geometric means) with 95% confidence intervals, or 2) median with first and third quartiles, as appropriate. Categorical baseline and demographic characteristics and study disposition will be reported as frequencies and proportions. 13.5 Interim Analyses"
65,page_65,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 66 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 13.5.1 Interim Analysis of Efficacy Data No formal interim analys is of efficacy data will be per formed for this study. 13.5.2 Interim Analysis of Safety Data The DSMB will receive periodic safety reports on enrolled participants. However, no form al interim analysis of safety data will be conducted. 13.5.3 Futility Analysis No formal futility analysis will be perf ormed for this study. 13.6 Statistical Hypotheses All primary and secondary objectives will be based on two -sided superiority tests. For instance, the null and alternative hypotheses for the primary objective are: H0: The rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period in the mepolizumab arm is equal to the rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period in the placebo arm. Ha: The rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period in the mepolizumab arm is not equal to the rate of asth ma exacerbations during the treatment period in the placebo arm. Additionally, S econdary Objective 5 will separately determine whether mepolizumab reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations in the sub -group of study participants who do not fit the FDA -appr oved dosing table for omalizumab therapy and in study participants who fit the FDA -approved dosing table for omalizumab therapy . In this case, the null and alternative hypotheses for this objective are: H0: The rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period in the mepolizumab arm is equal to the rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period in the placebo arm in study participants who do not fit the FDA -approved dosing table for omalizumab therapy. Ha: The rate of asthma exacerbations d uring the treatment period in the mepolizumab arm is not equal to the rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period in the placebo arm in study participants who do not fit the FDA -approved dosing table for omalizumab therapy. H0: The rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period in the mepolizumab arm is equal to the rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period in the placebo arm in study participants who fit the FDA -approved dosing table for omalizumab therapy. Ha: The rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period in the mepolizumab arm is not equal to the rate of asthma exacerbations during the treatment period in the placebo arm in study participants who fit the FDA -approved dosing table for omalizumab thera py. 13.7 Sample Size Considerations Based on Pavord et al , 14 the esti mated relative rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations between 75 mg, 250 mg, and 750 mg Mepolizumab arms and the Placebo arm was 0.52, 0.61, and 0.48 respectively. In Protocol ICAC-19 APIC, we found that among 9 4 enrolled participants that wer e difficult - to-treat at screening, had at least 2 exacerbations in the previous year at screening and peripheral blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μl , the rate of asthma exacerbations per patient –year was approximately 1.43"
66,page_66,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 67 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 with an associated dispersion parame ter of 0.47. Assuming that we will observe a relative rate similar to that seen in Pavord et al (2012) of 0.60 and that the event rate in the placebo arm is assumed to be 1.20 asthma exacerbations per patient -year with corresponding dispersion parameter of 0.50 in both arms, a total sample size of 256 participants (128 participants per arm) is required to detect such a relative rate with 90% power, based on a two -sided significance level of 0.05 and the work outlined in Zhu & Lakkis ,39 using maximum likelihood (method 3) for estimating the variance under the null hypothesis. Assuming approximately 20% of randomized participants do not meet criteria for modified intent-to -treat and are not replaced, we originally proposed to enroll 320 participants (160 participants per arm). However, o ur observed po st-randomization dropout rate has been lower than expected (11 %), and therefore the sample size was revised to 290. Secondary Objective 5 will also determin e if mepolizumab reduces the rate of asthma exacerbation in participants who do not fit the FDA -app roved dosing table for omalizumab therapy and in participants who fit the FDA -approved dosing table for omalizumab therapy. In Protocol ICAC-19 APIC participants meeting Protocol ICAC-30 MUPPITS -2 eligible criteria, approximately 50% of participants did not fit the FDA-approved dosing table for omalizumab therapy and so we would expect approximately 128 participants (64 participants per arm) in each of these sub-groups in Protocol ICAC-30 MUPPITS -2. Assuming an event rate in the placebo arm of 1.20 and dispersion parameter of 0.50 in both arms, such a sample size would allow us to detect a relative rate between arms of 0.53 with 80% power. 14 Identification and Access to Source Data 14.1 Source Data Source documents and source data are considered to be the original documentation where participant information, visits consultations, exami nations and other information are recorded . Documentation of source data is necessary for the reconstruction, evaluation and validation of clinical findings, observations and other activities during a clinical trial. All clinical site laboratory reports, spirometry reports, and any paper and electronic CRFs will be maintained as source data. 14.2 Access to Source Data The Principal I nvestigators and site staff will make all source data available to the IND sponsor ( DAIT NIAID ), as well as to the FDA. Authorized representatives as noted above are bound to maintain the strict confidentiality of medical and research information that may be linked to identified individuals. 15 Protocol De viations 15.1 Protocol Deviation Definitions 15.1.1 Protocol Deviation The Principal Investigators and site staff will conduct the study in accordance to the protocol; no deviations from the protocol are permitted . Any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures constitutes a protocol deviation. As a result of any deviation, corrective actions will be developed by the site and implemented promptly."
67,page_67,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 68 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 15.1.2 Major Protocol Deviation A protocol violation is a deviation from the IRB -approved protocol that may affect the participant 's rights, safety, or well -being and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data. In addition, protocol violations include willful or knowing breaches of human subject protection regulations, or policies, any action that is inconsistent with the NIH Human Research Protection Program’s research, medical, and ethical principles, and a serious or continuing noncompliance with federal, state, local or institu tional human subject protection regulations, policies, or procedures. 15.1.3 Non-Major Protocol Deviation A non-major protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures of a research protocol that does not have a major impact on the participant's rights, safety or well-being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data. 15.2 Reporting and Managing Protocol Deviations The Principal I nvestigator has the responsibility to identify, document and report major and non -major protocol deviations as directed by the study S ponsor . However, major and non -major protocol deviations may also be identified during site monitoring visits or during other forms of study conduct review. Upon determination that a protocol deviation (major or minor) has occurred, the study staff will a) notify the Principal Investigator (P I), b) notify the DAIT SACCC, and c) complete the Protocol Deviation form. The Protocol Deviation form will document at a minimum the date the protocol deviation ( PD) occurred, the date PD identified, a description of event, whether the deviation result ed in SAE/AE, the signature of PI, report to Central IRB, and documentation of a corrective action plan. The DAIT SACCC and the IND sponsor ( DAIT NIAID ) may request discussion with the PI to determine the effect of the protocol deviation on the study participant and his/her further study participation, the effect of the protocol deviation on the overall study, and corrective actions. The PI will complete and sign the Protocol Deviation form and submit it to the DAIT SACCC and to the Central IRB, per IRB regulations. Major protocol deviations will be reported to the DSMB by the DAIT NIAID Medical Monitor at the Medical Monitor’s discretion . 16 Ethical Considerations and Compliance with Good Clinical Practice 16.1 Quality Control and Quality Assurance The Principal Investigator is required to keep accurate records to ensure that the conduct of the study is fully documented. The Principal Investigator is required to ensure that all CRFs are completed for every participant entered in the trial. The sponsor is responsible for regular inspection of the conduct of the trial, for verifying adherence to the protocol, and for confirming the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of all documented data. The CRFs will be completed online via a web-based electronic data capture (EDC) system that has been validated and is compliant with Part 11 Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Study staff at the site will enter information into the electronic CRFs, and the data will be stored remotely at a central database. Data quality will be ensured through the EDC system’s continuous monitoring of data and real-time detection and correction of errors. All elements of data entry (i.e., time, date, verbatim text,"
68,page_68,"Inner -City Asthma Consortium Confidential Page 69 of 78 Protocol ICAC -30 MUPPITS -2 Version 9.0 01/11/21 and the name of the person performing the data entry) will be recorded in an electronic audit trail to allow all changes in the database to be monitored and maintained in accordance with federal regulations. 16.2 Statement of Compliance This clinical study will be conducted using good clinical practice (GCP), as delineated in Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance , and according to the criteria specified in this study protocol. Before study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by the Central IRB. Any amendments to the protocol or to the consent materials will also be approved by the Central IRB before they are implemented. The Principal Investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, and/or the ICH E6 . 16.3 Informed Co nsent Process The consent process will provide information about the study to a prospective participant and parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and will allow adequate time for review and discussion prior to his/her decision. The P rincipal Investigator or designee listed on the FDA 1572 will review the consent and answer questions. The consent designee must be listed on the delegation log and have knowledge of the study. The prospective participant and parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be told that being in the trial is voluntary and that he or she may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. All participants (or their legally acceptable representative) and parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will read, sign, and date a consent form before undergoing any study procedures. Assent will be obtained as per instruction by the Central IRB. Consent materials will be presented in participants’ primary language. A copy of the signed consent form will be given to the participant. The consent process will be ongoing. The consent form will be revised when important new safety information is available, the protocol is amended, and/or new information becomes available that may affect participation in the study. 16.4 Privacy and Confidentiality A participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the trial . Each participant will be assigned a unique identification number and these numbers rather than names will be used to collect, store, and report participant information. Site personnel will not transmit documents containing personal health identifiers (PHI) to the study sponsor or their representatives. 17 Publication Policy Presentations and publication of the results of this trial will be governed by the ICAC Publication Policy ."

We hypothesize that targeting eosinophils with the addition of the anti -IL-5 monoclonal antibody, mepolizumab, will prevent exacerbations and, as a consequence, reduce overall morbidity and improve asthma control . Study Objectives The primary objective of the study is to determine if phenotype - directed use of mepolizumab reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations as defined by the need for systemic corticosteroid treatment in urban children and adolescents (ages 6 -17) with difficult -to-control exacerbation -prone asthma and peripheral blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μl . Secondary objectives a re: 1. To determine whether mepolizumab will lead to an improved Composite Asthma S everity Index (CASI) 1 2. To determine whether mepolizumab will improve quality of life as assessed by the physician -patient global assessment2 3. To determine whether mepolizumab improves lung function as assessed by spirometry and impulse oscillometry 4. To determine whether mepolizumab increases the time to first asthma exacerbation 5. To separately determine whether mepolizumab reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations in study participants who do not fit the"

GENERAL ANALYSIS AND REPORTING CONVENTIONS The following analyses and reporting conventions will be used: Categorical variables will be summarized using counts (n) and percentages (%) and will be presented in the form “n (%).” Percentages will be rounded to one decimal place. If a count is 0, 0% will be shown for the percentage. Continuous variables will be summarized using sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, first and third quartiles, minimum (min), and maximum (max), as appropriate. The mean will be reported at one more significant digit than the precision of the data, the standard deviation will be reported at two more significant digits than the precision of the data, and first and third quartiles, minimum, maximum, and median will be reported at the same precision as the data. The median will be reported as the average of the two middle numbers if the dataset contains an even number of observations. Test statistics including t, z, and χ2 test statistics will be reported to two decimal places. P-values will be reported to three decimal places if greater than or equal to 0.001. If less than 0.001, the value will be reported as “<0.001.” A p-value can be reported as “1.000” only if it is exactly 1.000 without rounding. A p-value can be reported as “0.000” only if it is exactly 0.000 without rounding. Each data listing will be sorted by treatment arm and subject identifier (ID) unless otherwise noted. If departures from these general conventions are present in the specific evaluations section of this SAP, then those conventions will take precedence over these general conventions."

A covariate adaptive randomization algorithm developed by Pocock and Simon (1975)4 was used to maintain a balance between treatment arms with respect to study site, number of previous exacerbations (2 or 3+), peripheral blood eosinophils (< or ≥400 cells/μl), BMI (< or ≥95th percentile for age), total serum IgE (< or ≥540 kUA/L) and treatment dose (40 mg or 100 mg). This strategy was chosen to enhance the ability to balance the distribution of covariates that are known to be highly associated with our primary endpoint (e.g., number of previous exacerbations and peri pheral blood eosinophils) as well as covariates that determine if a participant fits the FDA -approved dosing tables for omalizumab therapy (e.g., BMI and total serum IgE). 7.3. Measures of Treatment Adherence The number of completed injections will be determine d for each participant, and divided by the total number of expected injections ( up to 13) given the amount of time in the study. The proportion of completed injections will be summarized by treatment arm and overall . Each injection , injection dose , baselin e age, age at clinical visit, and weight will be list ed by participant ID, visit, and by treatment arm."

Overview of Efficacy Analysis Methods 8.1.1. Multicenter Studies Although this is a multicenter study, the data is intended to be collected and analyzed as a whole. There are too few participants enrolled in the study relative to the number of sites to perform formal analyses stratified by site . 8.1.2. Assessment Time Windows Mepolizumab/placebo injections were scheduled as close as possible to the every 4-week target date as outlined in the Schedule of Events (Section 15.1) . Any data collected outside of a visit window will still be included in any analyses of the scheduled visit. At the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic, the following procedures were restricted, and were site-specific: Impulse oscillometry , spirometry, FeNO, nasal lavage samples, nasal blow samples, nasal epithelial cell collection, and sputum samples. Exacerbat ion visits were conducted only via telephone and c old visits were suspended. If participants were unable to come into the study center for visits, the visits were conducted via telephone . 8.1.3. Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity Adjustment for multiplic it y will n ot be performed for the primary or secondary endpoints. 8.2. Primary Endpoint 8.2.1. Computation of the Primary Endpoint For participant s who complete d the study, t he primary endpoint is the number of asthma exacerbations between randomization and the end of participant follow -up (Visit 14) , or four weeks from the final injection --whichever comes first. For participants who terminate d from the study early , the primary endpoint is number of exacerbations between randomization and their last know n completed visi t. Exacerbations are defined as a prescription of a course of systemic corticosteroids by a clinician, initiation of a course of systemic corticosteroids by a participant, or as a hospitalization for asthma. If a participant initiated and completed a cour se of systemic corticosteroids without clinician involvement, this course will be counted only if the study clinician agrees the treatment was warranted, and it meets the following dosage: the course for prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone will be at least 20 mg daily dose for 3 of 5 consecutive days. The course for dexamethasone will be at least a 10 mg single daily dose. If a corticosteroid burst for the treatm ent of an asthma exacerbation was prescribed by a non-ICAC clinician, it was counted regardless of dose ."

Primary Analysis of the Primary Endpoint The primary analysis will compare the rate of exacerbations during the treatment period using a negative binomial model applied to the mITT sample. The model will include an offset term to account for differential follow -up among participants. To account for adaptive randomization, the model will also be adjusted for study site, number of exacerbations in year prior to study (2 or 3+), peripheral blood eosinophils ( < or ≥400 cells/ μl), BMI (< or ≥95th percentile for age) , total serum IgE (< or ≥540 kUA/L) and treatment dose (40 mg or 100 mg) . Such a model will allow us to estimate the adjusted relative rate and corresponding 95% CI between the mepolizumab and placebo arms. A two-sided significance level of 0.05 will be used for this analysis. Although t he primary version of the primary analysis will be conducted on the mITT sample , the same analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed for the PP population. 8.2.3. Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Analysis At the time of the COVID -19 pandemic and subsequent quarantine period, observable exacerbation rates decreased relative to observed rates in the pr ior years of the study. In order to account for the unknown effects of the pandemic on the primary endpoint, the exacerbation rate will be analyzed using the same model as specified in sectio n 8.2.2, but only including participants who were randomized, received at least one injection, and who had at least one follow -up visit prior to March 16 , 2020. For participants who me t this definition, only exacerbations that occurred between randomization and March 1 6, 2020 will be analyzed in the model. A ll subsequent exacerbations and follow -up time will be censored after March 1 6, 2020. The offset variable used in the model will be defined as the length of time, in years, from randomization to the end of a participant’s follow -up, or March 16 , 2020, whichever occurs first. The same analysis will be applied to the PP population. 8.2.4. Secondary Analyses of the Primary Endpoint Analyses for the primary endpoint may be supported by several analyses. One disadvantage of a covariate adaptive randomization strategy is that Type I error may be inflated in certain circumstances (e.g., time trends). Consequently, rather than adjusting the model for the variables used in the adaptive randomization as discussed in Section 8.2.2, a permutation test will be used for inference instead as it involves fewer assumptions. Under a permutation model, the observed relative rate between the mepolizumab and placebo arms will be assessed with reference to all possible permutations that the treatment arms could have been assigned to participants, or up to 5000 iterations . Rather than adjusting the model for the variables used in the adaptive randomization, the model will instead adjust for study site (as a random or fixed effect), number of e xacerbations in year prior to study (2, 3 or 4+), BMI percentile (treated as a continuous variable), total serum IgE (treated as a continuous variable and log-transformed, if appropriate) peripheral blood"
99,page_99,"ICAC {Statistical Analysis Plan - Protocol #} Page 22 of 35 Version Date: 2021-04-01 Version: 1.0 PROPRIETARY — © 2019 Rho, Inc. eosinophils (treated as a continuous variable and l og-transformed, if appropriate), and treatment dose (40 or 100 mg). 8.3. Secondary Endpoints 8.3.1. Endpoint 1 Variable: Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI) at Visits 4, 7, 10, 13, and 14. Analysis: A generalized linear mixed model will be used to model CASI during the treatment period. The model will include a fixed effect for treatment arm as the primary exposure but will also adjust for baseline CASI, study site, number of exacerbations in year prior to study (2 or 3+), peripheral blood eosinophils (above or below 400 cells/ μl), BMI (above or below 95th percentile for age) and total serum IgE (above or below 540 kUA/L) to account for adaptive randomization. Visit will be treated as a categorical variable in the model, and an interaction term between treatment arm and visit will be used to estimate the least square mean CASI for each treatm ent arm for each timepoint of measurement. The difference in least square mean, the corresponding 95% CI and the p-values will be provided for the comparison of mepolizumab vs placebo. The model will be fit using restricted maximum likelihood, and each fixed effect will be tested using an F -test statistic, the Kenward -Roger approximation for the degrees of freedom, an unstructured covariance matrix, and a two-sided significance le vel of 0.05. If the model assuming an unstructured covariance matrix does not converge, other covariance structures, such as a spatial power covariance structure, will be considered. Descriptive statistics including the number of participants, mean, and st andard deviation will also be presented. This analysis will be conducted on the mITT population. As sites were restricted to limited visit assessments due to COVID-19, lung function assessments were not performed and FEV1 (% predicted), a domain of the CASI score , was not collected. In these cases, the last know n FEV1 (% predicted) value, from Visit 4 or onward, will be used to calculate a participant’s CASI at subsequent visits . Additionally, sites were discouraged from stepping down participants’ asthma controller therapy during the pandemic, another domain of the CASI score, which could bias the results towards the null. 8.3.2. Endpoint 2 Variable: Quality of life, as measured by physician -patient global assessment , at Visit 14 Analysis: A general ized logit model will be used to analyze the physician-patient global assessment at Visit 14 for the mITT population. The model will include treatment arm as a fixed effect as the primary exposure but will also adjust for study site, number of exacerbations in year prior to study (2 or 3+), peripheral blood eosinophils (above or below 400 cells/ μl), BMI (above or below 95th percentile for age) and total serum IgE (above or below 540 kUA/L ). A table will summarize the observed quality of life measurements, as recorded in the CRF at Visit 14, by treatment arm. No imputation of missing data will be used for participants who were not assessed for quality of life measurements at Visit 14."

Endpoint 3 Variable: Lung function as assessed by spirometry and impulse oscillometry Analysis: A generalized mixed model as described in section 8.3.1 will be used to analyze each spirometry and impulse oscillometry parameter, separately, at each visit where the lung function was collected for the mITT population. It is noted that lung function data was not collected during the limited assessment visits during the COVID -19 pandemic and is considered missing completely at random. No imputation of missing data will be used in the analysis of lung function data. 8.3.4. Endpoint 4 Variable: Time to first asthma exacerbation Analysis: Kaplan -Meier curves and a Cox PH model will also be used to model the time to first asthma exacerbation during the treatment period. The Cox PH model will include treatment arm as the primary e xposure but will also adjust for study site, number of exacerbations in year prior to study (2 or 3+), peripheral blood eosinophils (above or below 400 cells/ μl), BMI (above or below 95th percentile for age) and total serum IgE (above or below 540 kUA/L) . The analysis will be conducted for the mITT population i gnoring the COVID -19 intercurrent event 8.3.5. Endpoint 5 Variable: Rate of exacerbations (mepolizumab vs. placebo) during the treatment period for participants in the mITT sample who do not fit the FDA -approved dosing table for omalizumab therapy and for participants who do fit the FDA -approved dosing table. Analysis: A negative binomial model, as specified in section 8.2.2, will be used to estimate the effect of mepolizumab on the rate of exacerbation , as compared to the placebo group, in the omalizumab -e ligible and omalizumab -ineligible sub -groups . A treatment and a treatment by omalizumab -eligibility interaction term will be used to estimate the exacerbation rates. 8.3.6. Endpoint 6 Variable: Adverse Events Analysis: Safety will be summarized treatment arm in the safety sample by the number and percentage of serious and non-serious adverse events stratified by grade and relationship to treatment as well as the number and percentage of participants who have a serious and non- serious adverse event stratified by grade and relationship to treatment. See Section 9 for further details and definitions. 8.4. Other Endpoints 8.4.1. Exploratory Analysis of the Primary Endpoint"

Overview of Safety Analysis Methods The safety analyses will be perfo rmed in the safety population defined in Section 5. Safety assessment summaries will include: • AEs, defined in Protocol Section 12.2.1. • Suspected Adverse Reactions (SARs), defined in Protocol Section 12.2.1.1. • Unexpected Adverse Event, defined in Protocol Section 12.2.2 • AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug • AEs leading to discontinuation from study • Serious adverse events (SAEs), defined in Protocol Section 12.2.3. • Deaths • Clinical laboratory results • Vital signs Adverse events w ere collected from the time of consent until a participant completes study participation or until 30 days after he/she prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent) or is withdrawn from the study. For this analysis, a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) will be defined as any AE not present prior to the initiation of study drug or any AE already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study drug. TEAEs will be summarized in the safety population. Partial dates wi ll be imputed for the purposes of defining TEAEs as follows: • For a missing start day where the month and year are present, the start day will be set to the first day of the month, unless: 1) the first day of the month is before the date of administration o f study drug and the month and year are the same as the month and year of the date of administration of study drug; and 2) the end date is on or after the date of administration of study drug or the end date is completely missing, in which case the start day will be set to the day of administration of study drug. • For a missing start day and month where the year is present, the start day and month will be set to January 1 st, unless: 1) January 1st is before the date of administration of study drug and the year is the same as the year of the date of administration of study drug; and 2) the end date is on or after the date of administration of study drug or the end date is completely missing, in which case the start day and month will be set to that of the dat e of administration of study drug."

Unless otherwise specified, a data listing for all measurements in Section 9 will be provided for the safety population and sorted in order of treatment arm, participant ID, and time of assessment (e.g., visit, time, and/or event). 9.2. Adverse Events All AEs will be classified by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term, according to a standardized thesaurus (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]). MedDRA V20.0 or later will be used to classify all AEs. The severity of AEs will be classified, as applicable, using the following criteria and complies with ICH Guid eline E-6: Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice : • Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (published September 2007) for local reactions to study procedures. • Grading System of Severity of Anaphylaxis adapted, from the grading scale of Brown et al. (3) for anaphylaxis and systemic reactions to study procedures. • National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (published June 14, 2010) for all other reactions. (This document is referred to herein as the “NCI -CTCAE manual.”) The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study therapy regimen or study procedure(s) will initially be determined by the study clinician and recorded on the appropriate AE/SAE eCRF. Fi nal determination of attribution for safety reporting will be determined by DAIT NIAID. The relationship of an adverse event to study therapy regimen or procedures will be determined using the descriptors and definitions provided in Table 12.3.2 of the protocol . Overall summary tables will be developed using the safety population to report the number of events and the number and percentage of participants having at least one treatment -emergent event in the following categories: • AEs • AEs by maximum grade for each of the following: • Skin Testing • Anaphylaxis"

If a participant experiences the same AE on multiple occasions, the event will be counted once for each occurrence when reporting the number of AEs. When reporting the number of participants experiencing the events, a participant will only be counted once if they experience an event within the particular SOC or preferred term. Percentages will be based on the number of participants in the safety population. Similar summaries will be generated for SARs (defi ned in Protocol Section 12.2.3), AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, and AEs leading to study withdrawal separately. Data listings will be provided separately for AEs, SARs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, and cases of COVID -19. 9.3. Deaths, Serious Adverse Events SAEs will be listed and summarized in the same manner described in Section 9.2. Separate displays listing death, including time to death and primary cause of death, will also be created. 9.4. Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Clinical laboratory measurements will be performed at Screening and at various visits throughout the study and include a complete blood count with differential (CBC). Results will be converted to standardized units where possible. For numeric laboratory results, descriptive statistics of laboratory values will be presented for each treatment arm and overall. For categorical laboratory results, the number and perc entage of participants reporting each result will be presented for each treatment arm and overall.
