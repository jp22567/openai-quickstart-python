Amendment 02 23-FEB-2017 Corrected the wording of exclusion criterion #5, which stated the opposite of what was intended and to provide more detail and clarity where needed. Amendment 03 10-APR-2017 Removed the option to cross over from the etoposide/platinum/saline placebo arm to pembrolizumab treatment to improve the interpretation of the long -term benefit. Amendment 04 02-JUN-2017 Removed the requirement for unblinding treatment assignment after documentation of progressive disease (PD) because the option to cross over to pembrolizumab was removed and, with it, the need to unblind. Amendment 05 01-SEP-2017 Clarified exclusion criterion #4 regarding brain metastases to ensure that no subjects with brain metastases are enrolled in the study . Amendment 06 30-NOV-2017 Updated the dose modification guidelines for pembrolizumab to include information regarding the treatment of myocarditis; revised the requirements for survivalfollow-up to allow for more frequent data collection; added a Day8 visit during Cycles 1 through 4 to allow for more frequent safety monitoring."

Amendment 08 07-DEC-2018 the assumption for median PFS in the control arm was changed to 4.3 months basedon external datapublished from other clinical trials; and the power and efficacy bound calculations were updated to reflect the change in PFS median assumption and an alpha spending approach. Amendment 09 23-APR-2019 Updated criteria for the final OS an alysis to be a minimum of 294 events, or 31 months from study start, whichever occurs later to ensure sufficient follow-up time for the final OS analysis.

The final analysis will use the remaining Type I error not spent at earlier analyses, regardless of the number of events observed at the final analysis. The p-value bounds at second interim and final analy sis will be calculated by considering the correlation between the test statistics as determined by the actual number of OS events at the previous and current analysis.”To clarify that the alpha spending is event based,and not subjectedto change,if the actual number of events at the final analysisexceeds the targeted number of events at final anal ysis."

Subjects who experience documented progressive disease (PD) verified by blinded independent central review will have the option to remain on study and continue receiving the originally assigned trial treatment for a total of 35cycles at the discretion ofthe investigator (Section 7.1.5.5 ). Subjects who stop trial treatment after receiving 35 administrations of trial treatment for reasons other than PDor intolerability may be eligible for the Second Course Phase, up to 17 additional administrations of pembrolizumab (approximately 1 year),upon experiencing disease progression (Section 7.1.5.4). Subjects in the saline placebo arm are not eligible for the Second Course Phase. After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for the occurrence of AEsand spontaneously reported pregnancy (Section7.2). Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than PDwill have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until experiencing PD confirmed by the site per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) orper RECIST version 1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)as assessed by BICR, initiating a non- study cancer treatment, withdraw ing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up.

Approximately 430subjects will be randomized (1:1) to either pembrolizumab +EP or placebo+EP.Randomization will be stratified by type of platinum therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score (0or1), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)measurement (≤or > upper limit of normal [ULN])at baseline.Positive tumor programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression will not be required for enrollment; however, subjects’ tumors will be screened for PD-L1 expression. An overview of the trial design is depicted in Figure 1. Prior to randomization, the investigator will determine whether the subject will receive cisplatin or carboplatin. Subjects are allowed to switch from cisplatin to carboplatin if the Randomization Ratio 1:1"

Subjects willcontinue to receive treatment withpembrolizumab or placebo Q3W for up to an additional 31cycles(up to 35cyclestotal)or until occurrence of one or more treatment discontinuation criteria:disease progression as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) confirmed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumorsversion 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)(modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ), intolerable toxicity or unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator decision to withdraw the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasonsrequiring cessation of treatment. After randomization, subjects will be evaluated with radiographic imaging to assess response to treatment; treatment -based decisions should be made by the investigator based on immune-related RECIST (irRECIST)(Section 4.2.3.5).All imaging obtained on study will be submitted forBICRusing RECIST 1.1 for verification of progressive disease ( PD)and for determination of objective response rate (ORR) and progression -free survival (PFS).Adverse event monitoring will be ongoing throughout the trial and AEs will be graded forseverity according to the guidelines outlined in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0(CTCAE 4.0) . After verification of PD as assessed byBICR per RECIST 1.1(modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ), subjects will have the option to remain on study and continue receiving the originally assigned trial treatment for a total of 35cycles at the discretion of the investigator, provided they are deemed to be benefiting and are clinically stable (Section7.1.2.7.6).Alternatively , subjects may choose to receive treatment withan appropriate second-line (2L) therapy as determined by the investigator. At the discretion of the investigator and in consultation with the Sponsor, subjects assigned to the pembrolizumab arm who complete 35treatment administrations may be eligible for retreatment with open-label pembrolizumab monotherap y at the time of radiographic disease progression (verified by BICR), provided that no other systemic therapy for SCLC has been administered .This retreatment is calledthe Second Course Phase(Section6.2and Section 7.1.5. 5).Subjects in the saline placebo arm are not eligible for the Second Course Phase.Treatment assignment will be unblinded for those subjects who meet all criteria for"

After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for a minimum of 30 days for AE monitoring even if the subject started non-studyantineoplastic treatment . Serious adverse events (SAEs)will be documented for up to 90 days following cessation of the Sponsor’s product, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates non-study cancer treatment , whichever is earlier. After this period, anySAEs considered to be related to the trial treatment must be reported.Subjects will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status, until initiating a non-study cancer treatment, experiencing disease progression or death, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. After documented disease progression or the start of non-study cancer treatment ,subjects will have contactwith study personnel by telephone until death, withdrawing consent, or becoming lostto follow-up.The Sponsor may request survival status to be assessed at additional time points and entered into the database during the course of the trial.For example, survival status may be requested prior to, but not limited to, external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviews,as well as atinterim and/or final analy ses. This trial has dual primary endpoints: 1) PFS as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1 modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ and 2) overall survival (OS). Trial results will be considered positive if the hypothesis test for either one of these primary endpoints is successful. Efficacy also will be evaluated using ORR (key secondary endpoint)and duration of response (duration of response [DOR]; secondary endpoint) as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1 modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ(Details are provided in the Site Imaging Manual).

Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades [1]. Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes(TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies [2] [3] [4] [5] [6][7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19][20] [21][22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . In particular, the presence of CD8+ T cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T-cells to FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long -term survival in solid malignancies such as ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded ex vivo and re infused, inducing durable objective tumor responses in cancers such as melanoma [38] [39]. The programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on"
22,page_22,"Product: MK-3475 22 Protocol/Amendment No.: 604-09 MK-3475-604-09FinalProtocol 23-Apr-2019 Confidentialthe cell surface of activated T cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. The PD-1 receptor (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily member related to CD28 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or programmed cell death-ligand 2 [PD-L2]) [40] [41]. The mechanism by which PD-1 down modulates T -cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA -4, as both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins [34] [42]. The PD-1 receptor was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes, including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B- cells, regulatory T cells, and natural killer cells [43] [44]. The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors [42] [45] [46] [47]. Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV-and IgC-like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either ligand to PD-1 inhibits T-cell activation triggered through the T-cell receptor. Expression of PD-L1 occurs at low levels on various non hematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, whereas expression of the PD L2 protein is only detectable on antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments. Immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs is thought to be controlled by PD-L2, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral tissues [45]. Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were shown to express abundant levels of this T-cell inhibitor. High expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells (and to a lesser extent, expression of PD -L2) has been found to correlate with poor prognosis and survival in various cancer types, including renal cell [48], pancreatic [49], hepatocellular [50], and ovarian [51]. Furthermore, PD-1 may also regulate tumor-specific T-cell expansion in subjects with melanoma [52]. The prognostic implications of PD-L1 expressio n in advanced tumors are being investigated further in ongoing epidemiologic studies. Because the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion, it is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention .Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, preventing attenuation of the immune system. Pembrolizumab clinical trials are ongoing in a number of advanced cancer types, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), head and neck cancer, urothelial cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, gastric cancer ,and hematologic malignancies. For study details, refer to the IB. Information on Other Trial -related Therapy Etoposide/Platinum Therapy Standard first-line(1L)treatment for the vast majority ofpatients with SCLC, regardless of stage, involves combination chemotherap y with etoposide plus cisplatin or carboplatin. The etoposide/cisplatin regimen was tested in SCLC because this combination produced synergistic activity in preclinical systems.In addition, both agents could be given at full doses because of less myelosuppression with cisplatin. The first report of demonstrated"
23,page_23,"Product: MK-3475 23 Protocol/Amendment No.: 604-09 MK-3475-604-09FinalProtocol 23-Apr-2019 Confidentialactivity with the combination dates back to 1979[53].Subsequent randomized trials compared etoposide/cisplatin to cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and an anthracycline [54] [55] [56].Less myelosuppression occurred with etoposide/cisplatin, and, whengiven with radiation, patients experienced less esophagitis and interstitial pneumonitis. Retrospective analyses and meta-analyses also support the superiority of a cisplatin -or carboplatin- containing regimen for SCLC [57] [58] [59]. As a result, EPis now the standard 1L chemotherap y regimen for SCLC.Severalrandomized studies evaluating etoposide and cisplatin compared with other regimens have shown consistent results for this doublet with response rates of 45% to 60%, median time to progression of 5 months ,and median OS of 10 months [60] [61]. Notably, emerging data from recent global trials evaluating novel treatments in SCLC demonstrated a lower median PFS of approximately 4.3 to 4.4 months in the EPcontrol arm, yet median OS remains consistent at approximately 10.3 to 10.9 months [62] [63]. Carboplatin has been substituted for cisplatin in SCL C chemotherapy regimens in an effort to decrease non-hematologic toxicities. Randomized trials comparing cisplatin and carboplatin suggest that these compounds may have similar efficacy.One such study was conducted by the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group, which randomized 147 patients with either limited or extensive disease to receive etoposide 100 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 3 and cisplatin 100mg/m2 or carboplatin 300 mg/m2 on Day1 of each cy cle [64]. Concurrent radiation was also administered to responding patients starting with the third cycle.Response and survival were similar in the 2 arms. Nausea, vomiting, nephrotoxicity , and neurotoxicity were significantl y lower in the patients who received carboplatin, as was Grade4 leukopenia. Unfortunatel y, the sample size was inadequate to confirm equivalent efficacy.A subsequent meta-analysis evaluated individual subject data from 4 randomized trials with a total of 663 patients and found that median OS, median PFS,and response rates were similar in the cisplatin and carboplatin arms.While hematologic toxicities were higher in patients treated with carboplatin, non-hematologic toxicities were increased in patients treated with cisplatin [65].Based on these data, etoposide /carboplatin can be considered an appropriate 1L regimen to treat SCL C, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate cisplatin. Multiple randomized studies have evaluated whether continuation beyond 4to 6cycles of chemotherap y is necessary .Overall survival is not improved if patients receive additional cycles of the same regimen used for induction [66] [67], maintenance oral etoposide or sunitinib after an etoposide -containing 1Lregimen [68] [60] [69], or consolidation with different chemotherapeutic regimens after 4cycles of EP [70] [71].Treatment beyond 6 cycles of chemotherap y isnot recommended for ES-SCLC by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network[72], the European Society of Medical Oncology Guidelines [73], orthe American Society of Clinical Oncology [74]. Recent trials in this patient population have administe red 4cycles of therapy [60] [61] [63] . Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Brain metastases are common in SCL C. Approximately 18% of patients have central nervous system involvement at diagnosis [75],and another 20% to 25% of patients develop brain metastasis during the course of their disease, thelikelihood increasing with lengthening"
24,page_24,"Product: MK-3475 24 Protocol/Amendment No.: 604-09 MK-3475-604-09FinalProtocol 23-Apr-2019 Confidentialsurvival [76] [77]. At postmortem examination, brain metastases are found in up to 65% of patients who had SCL C[78]. In a meta-analysis of almost 1,000 patients in 7 trials between 1977 and 1995, patients were evaluated with andwithout PCI after initially obtaining a complete response [79]. Prophylactic cranial irradiation doses ranged from 24 to 40 Gy in most patients.Three-year survival ratesincreased from 15% without PCIto almost 21% withPCI.Additional findings included a significantly decreased probability of brain metastases and increased likelihood of disease-free survival. Higher doses of radiation appeared to be more effective in preventing brain metastases, but had no impact on survival. A trend toward a decreased risk of brain metastases was observed when PCI was administered earlier. A survival benefit with PCI in patients with ES-SCLC who had a response to chemotherap y was demonstrated in anEORTC randomized trial (N=286)[80].Significantly , addition of PCI therapyimprovedthe rate of 1-year freedom from symptomatic brain metastases from 14.6% to 40.4% and improved the1-year survival ratefrom 13.3% to 27.1%. Various fractionation schemes were used;the most common were 20Gy in 5fractions and 30 Gy in 10fractions. Thetrial did not mandate pre-treatment brain imaging to rule out clinically occult brain metastases, which has raised the question of whether the observed survival benefit was due to treatment of patients who already had detectable brain metastases. Regardless, the results of the EORTC trial established PCI as a standard consideration for all patients with ES-SCLCwho achievea response to initial therapy.Yet, the American Society of Clinical Oncology Guidelines note that this may be subject to change upon final publication of a recently conducted study in Japan.The study randomized 163 patients with ES-SCLC who responded to 1L therapy to either PCI (25 Gy in 10fractions) or observation andfailed to demonstrate a survival advantage for PCI [74]. More recently, standard-dose versus higher-dose PCI has been evaluated after complete response (CR)in patientswith limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC)in an Intergroup trial [81].Seven hundred twenty patients were randomized to either 25Gy in 10 fractions or 36 Gy delivered in 18 daily fractions of 2Gy or 24 twice-daily fractions of 1.5 Gy.There was no significant difference in incidence of brain metastases between the standard-dose group and the high-dose group.The OS was significantl y worse in the higher- dose group, further establishing 25 Gy in 10fractions as the standard dose of PCI for patients with LS-SCLC. Prophylactic cranial irradiation is associated with AEssuch as fatigue, hair loss, and decreased quality of life [73].Long-term survivors have neurologic and intellectual impairment ,as well as abnormalities on computed tomograph y (CT)imagingthat may be related to PCI[82] [83],which for some, causes reluctance to propose this treatment. Consequently , PCIguidelines recommend that patients who proceed with PCI have a good performance status and adequate neurocognitive functioning, and that a full discussion occurs between the patient and phy sician, especially in extensive stage disease [73] [72] ."
25,page_25,"Product: MK-3475 25 Protocol/Amendment No.: 604-09 MK-3475-604-09FinalProtocol 23-Apr-2019 Confidential Rationale Rationale for the Trial and Selected Subject Population Small cell lung cancer remains a worldwide public health problem; it isa major cause of cancer mortalityandisstrongly associated with tobacco exposure [84] [85].While in the United States there has been a decline in prevalence of tobacco use resulting in a gradual decrease in SCLC incidence over the past decades, SCLC still accounts for 14% of all lung cancers, withapproximately 30,000 patients diagnosed annually [86] [87].Approximately 275,000 patients worldwide are diagnosed with SCLC annually [84] [85]. Small cell lung canceris an aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy with a unique natural history characterized by a short doubling time, high growth fraction, and early development of widespread metastases. Although a chemotherapy -and radiation-sensitive disease, SCLC typically recurs rapidly after primary treatment, with only 6% of patients surviving 5 years from diagnosis. Treatment of SCLC is notable for the lackof major developments; nearly4 decades afterthe introduction of an EPdoublet, therapeutic options have remained virtually unchanged, with correspondingl y little improvement in survival rates. Radiation therapy is administered to patients with LS-SCLC, whose cancer is confined to th e chest in a single tolerable radiation field. Patients with L S-SCLC orES-SCLC who achievea response to 1Lplatinum-based therapy generally are offered PCI, which has been shown to decrease the risk of intracranial recurrence and improve OS[79] [80]. Additional efforts at improving outcomes with 1Ltherapy for SCLC patients have been unsuccessful. Examples include the use of irinotecan instead of etoposide (in Western countries), alternating multi- drug combinations, addition of a third chemotherapeutic drug to etoposide and cisplatin, and prolonging the number of cy cles of etoposide and cisplatin or carboplatin [88]. First-line treatment for SCLC yields optimal tumor response rates as high as 60%to 80%, which unfortunately translates to cure in only approximately 20% of patients with LS-SCLC [89].Essentially all patients with ES-SCLC, and the majority of patients with LS-SCLC, suffer relapse within months of completing initial therapy.The strongest predictor of outcome for patients with relapsed SCL C is the duration of remission. Patients with sensitive disease,who maintain a response to initial treatment for 3 months or more,have aresponse rate to additional chemotherap y of about 25%and a median survival of about 6monthsfrom the time of relapse.In contrast, those patients with refractory disease who either have no response to initial therapy or progress within 3months, rarely benefit from additional treatment, with response rates <10% and median survival of 4 months. Topotecan is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agent for recurrent or progressive SCLC, based on the resultsof three Phase 3 trials [90] [91] [92].There are no accepted regimens for patients whose disease has progressed after 1Land 2Ltreatments for SCLC.This is in stark contrast to the progress that has been made in the treatment of NSCLC,thus underscoring the critical need for more effective therapies in SCL C."
26,page_26,"Product: MK-3475 26 Protocol/Amendment No.: 604-09 MK-3475-604-09FinalProtocol 23-Apr-2019 ConfidentialWhenconsidering new approaches to 1L treatment of SCLC,the dramatic initial tumor response to an EPregimen seen inthe large majority of SCLC patients must be acknowledged; however, in nearl y all cases ,the tumors become resistant to this treatment. Several lines of evidence support modulation ofimmune response in SCLC as a treatment modality.The disease is associated with immunogenic effects, evidenced by the prolonged survival of patients with autoantibodies (ie, anti-Hu) and neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes [93].The expression of major histocompatibility complex antigens is reduced in SCLC and this may play a role in this tumor’s ability to escape immune surveillance [94] [95].Interestingly, effector T-cells associated with cytolytic responses are significantl y higher in the peripheral blood of patients with LS-SCLC compared to those with ES-SCLC and in long term disease-free survivors relative tothose with recurrent disease [96].More recently, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, a major target of anti-tumor immunotherap y, has been interrogated in SCLC utilizing immunohist ochemistry (IHC) and RNA-expression to evaluate the presence of PD -L1 in primary and metastatic tumor tissue as well as in TILs[97] [98] [99][100] [101].In general, 50%to 80% of tumor specimens were PD-L1-positive (ie, >5% of cells in the specimen expressed PD-L1).In several of these reports, when other patient characteristics and treatment outcome swere considered, patients with PD -L1-positive tumors had a longer OS,and higher PD-L1 expression strongly correlated with limited-stage disease[98] [99] [100][101].However, each of these studies utilized different types of specimens, as well as antibodies. Mutational burden appears to be an important determinant of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. In a recent study analyzing tumor mutational burden in NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab, higher mutational burden was associated with improved objective response, durable clinical benefit,and prolonged PFS[102].The association between response to PD-1 inhibitors, mutationalburden, and tobacco exposure may have important implications for SCLC,as this disease is strongly associated with smoking and has a markedly elevated mutation burden, as highlighted previously. KEYNOTE -028 is a Phase 1b multi-cohort study of pembrolizumab forthe treatment of PD-L1-positive,advanced solid tumors including SCLC.Of the 147 subjects with evaluable ES-SCLC biopsyspecimens who were screened, 42 (29%) hadPD-L1-positivetumorsand, of these, 24 previously treated subjects wereeventually enrolled. Notably, 21 patients (87.5%) were in need of third-line or greater therapy.The patients were treated with pembrolizumab monotherap y for up to 2years.Median duration of follow-upwas 9.8months (range: 0.5to 24.0).The ORR was 37.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18.8to 59.4) and included 1CR and 8PRs.Median DOR was 9.0months (range: 1.9to 19.9+). Median PFS was 1.9 months(range: 1.7to 5.9) and at 6 and 12 months ,29.8% and 24.8% of subjects were alive and progression-free , respectively .Median OS was 9.7months (95% CI 4.1to not reached);66.0% and 35.7%of subjects were alive at 6 and 12months, respectivel y.Treatment -related AEs were reported for 66.0% of subjects, including 2subjects with Grades 3to 5 treatment -related AEs.No new safety concerns were identified [103].These results demonstrate that pembrolizumab monotherapy has meaningful anti- tumor activity in heavily pre-treatedsubjects with PD-L1-positiveSCLC.In contrast, studies of topotecan as 2Ltreatment of SCLC demonstrated response rates of approximately 18%,"
27,page_27,"Product: MK-3475 27 Protocol/Amendment No.: 604-09 MK-3475-604-09FinalProtocol 23-Apr-2019 Confidentialmedian survival of 6 months, and duration of response of 7.5months[104] [105] [106] [107]. Based on this information, i ncorporating pembrolizumab treatment inthe 1Lsetting in SCL C patients may lead to further improvement in outcomes. Recently, Langer and colleagues reported results from KEYNOTE -021 Cohort G, a Phase 2 randomized trial comparing pembrolizumab /pemetrexed/ carboplatin with pemetrexed/carboplatin alone for the treatment of subjects with newly diagnosed NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 tumor expressio n [108].The ORR was 55% in the pembrolizumab/pemetrexed/carboplatin arm compared with 29% in the pemetrexed/ carboplatin alone arm(p=0.0016), and responsesoccurred 1month earlier in the pembrolizumab/pemetrexed/carboplatin arm.The improvement in response wasobserved in subjects withtumors of all PD-L1 expression levels.Progression -free survival was improved for the pembrolizumab/pemetrexed/carboplatin arm compared withthe pemetrexed/ carboplatin alone arm (13 months versus8.9 months, respectively ; p=0.0102). These data indicate that pembrolizumab with chemotherap y has the potential to be an effective 1L treatment for SCLC and potentially may be a regimen that can change outcomes in this disease. Based on the previously mentioned data and a critical need for new therapies in SCLC, we are undertaking this worldwide, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3, parallelgroup, multi-site, double-blind trial of pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy (EP) in subjects with ES-SCLC who have not previously received sy stemic therap y. Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen /Modification Rationale for the Dose of Pembrolizumab The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this trial is 200 mg Q3W.Based on the totality of data generated in the Keytruda®development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose of pembrolizumab across all indications regardless of tumor type.As outlined below, this dose is justified by : oClinical data from 8randomize d studies demonstrating flat dose-and exposure- efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks(Q2W), oClinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit-risk, including improvement in OS at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications, an d oPharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred from PK data) and tumor (inferred from physiologicall y based PKanalysis [PBPK]) at 200 mg Q3W . Among the 8 randomized dose-comparison studies, a total of 2262 subjects with melanoma or NSCLC were enrolled, covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously treated, PD-L1 enriched, and all-comers) and different treatment settings (monotherap y and in combination with chemotherapy ).Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W (KEYNOTE -001 B2, KEYNOTE -001 D, KEYNOTE -002, KEYNOTE -010,and"
28,page_28,"Product: MK-3475 28 Protocol/Amendment No.: 604-09 MK-3475-604-09FinalProtocol 23-Apr-2019 ConfidentialKEYNOTE -021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q2W (KEYNOTE -001 B3, KEYNOTE -001 F2,and KEYNOTE -006).All of these studies demonstrated flat dose-and exposure-response relationships across the doses studied representing an approximate 5-to 7.5-fold difference in exposure. The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed-dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied.Subsequently , flat dose-exposure-response relationships were also observed in subjects with other tumor types, including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming 200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose independent of the tumor ty pe. These findings are consistent with the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, which acts by interaction with immune cells, and not via direct binding to cancer cells. Additionally , pharmacology data clearly show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W.First, PK data inKEYNOTE -001 evaluating target-mediated drug disposition conclusively demonstrated saturation of PD-1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W.Second, a PBPK analysis was conducted to predict tumor PD-1 saturation over a wide range oftumor penetration and PD-1 expression. This evaluation demonstrated that pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD -1 saturation in both blood and tumor. Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body weight andother subject covariates on exposure, has shown that fixed dosing provides similar control of PK variability as weight-based dosing, with considerable overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by these PK characteristics, and given that a fixed dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose was selected for evaluation across all pembroliz umab protocols. Rationale for Use of Comparator/Placebo The use of saline placebo in combination with standard chemotherapy will ensure the objectivity of investigator- assessed progression ,as well as any decisions to interrupt/discontinue therapy . Rationale for Efficacy Endpoints Primary Efficacy Endpoints Primary: This trial has dual primary endpoints of PFS and OS. PFS is an acceptable measure of clinical benefit for a randomized Phase 3 trial that demonstrates superiorit y of a new antineoplastic therapy, especially if the magnitude of effect is large and the therapy has an acceptable risk-benefit profile.PFS, as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1(modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ),will be used to determine the dates of progression as this methodology is accepted by regulatory authorities. Images read by BICR blinded to treatment assignment can minimize bias in the response assessments. In addition, final determination of radiologic PD will be based on the BICR assessment of progression , rather than local site investigator/radiology assessment. Expedited assessment by the BICR in"

Notably, PFS has demonstrated strong potential surrogacy for OS in 1Ltreatment of ES-SCLC and may be a good alternative endpoint to OS in this disease [109]. Overall survival has been recognized as the gold standard for the demonstration of superiority of a new antineoplastic therap y in randomized clinical studies. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The key secondary efficacy endpoint of this study isORR assessed by BICRusing RECIST1.1modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.Additionally , DORassessed by BICR according to RECIST1.1modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organis a secondary endpoint . Safety Endpoints The incidence of AE/SAEs (including fatal SAEs), immune-related AEs, laboratory abnormalities, and rates of dose interruption and discontinuation due to AEs are important endpoints for safety and tolerability evaluations. Patient Reported Outcomes The EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13 will be used to investigate :(1) quality of life and (2) disease-related symptoms. These questionnaires are not purely efficacy or safety endpoints because they are affected by both disease progression and treatment tolerability . EQ-5D-5L is an exploratory endpoint that will be used to calculate health utilities for health economic models. EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed to assess the quality of life of subjects with cancer.It has been translated into 81 languages , validated, and used in more than 3000 studies worldwide. It contains 5 functioning scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea, and pain) and additional single symptom items.It is scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2 =a little, 3= quite a bit, 4 =very much).The EORTC QLQ- C30 instrument also contains 2 global scales that use 7-point scale scoring with anchors (1=very poor and 7 =excellent). The EORTC QLQ-LC13, a supplemental lung cancer-specific module, comprises multi-item and single-item measures of lung cancer-associated symptoms (ie, coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and pain) and sideeffects from chemotherap y and radiation (ie, hair loss, neuropath y, sore mouth, and dysphagia). It is scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2 =a little, 3=quite a bit, 4 =very much) and has been translated into 64 languages and validated. The EQ-5D-5Lis a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. The EQ-5D-5L will provide data for use in economic models and analyses including developing"

Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems . Immune-related RECIST Immune-related RECIST is RECIST 1.1 adapted to account for the unique tumor response seen with immunotherapeutics as described byNishino et al[110].The assessment of unidimensional target lesions and response categories per irRECIST are identical to RECIST1.1.However, Merck has implemented an adaptation related to new lesions, non-targetlesions,and tumor burden assessment in order to confirm radiographic progression. Immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab may produce anti-tumor effects by potentiating endogenous cancer-specific immune responses. The response patterns seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typical time course of responses seen with cytotoxic agents, and can manifest a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions.Thus, standard RECIST 1.1 maynot provide anaccurate response assessment forimmunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab. Based on an analysis of patients with melanoma enrolled in KEYNOTE -001[111], 7%of evaluable patients experienced delayed or early tumor pseudo-progression. Of note, patients who had progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 but not by irRECIST ,had longer OS than patients with PDby both criteria.Additionally , the data suggest that RECIST 1.1 may underestimate the benefit of pembrolizumab in approximately 15% of patients. These findings support the need to apply a modification to RECIST 1.1 that takes into account the unique patterns of atypical response toimmunotherap y and enable treatment beyond initial radiographic progres sion. Local site investigators will use irRECISTto assesstumor response and progression and to make treatment decisions. For further information on irRECI ST, see Section 7.1.2. 7.6. Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research Cancer immunotherapies represent an important and novel class of anti-tumor agents. However, the mechanism of action of these exciting new therapies is not completel y understood and much remains to be learned regarding how best to leverage these new drugs in treating subjects.Thus, to aidfuture subjects, it is important to investigate the determinants of response or resistance to cancer immunotherapy as well as determinants of AEs in the course of our clinical trials.These efforts will identify novel predictive/pharmacod ynamic biomarkers and generate information that will better guide"

Investigations may include but are not limited to: Germline (blood) genetic analyses (eg, single nucleotide polymorphism analyses, whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing ):This research will evaluate whether genetic variation within a clinical trial population correlates with response to the treatment(s) under evaluation. If genetic variation is found to predict efficacy or AEs, the data might inform optimal use of therapies in the patient population. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate germline DNA variation across the genome in order to interpret tumor-specific DNA mutations. Finally, microsatellite instability may be evaluated as this is an important biomarker for som e cancers (ie, colorectal cancer). Genetic (DNA) analyses from tumor: The application of new technologies, such as next generation sequencing, has provided scientists the opportunity to identify tumor-specific DNA changes (ie, mutations, methylation status, microsatellite instability ). Key molecular changes of interest to immuno-oncology drug development includethe mutational burden of tumors and the clonality of T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. Increased mutational burden (sometimes referred to as a‘hyper-mutated’ state) may generate neo-antigen presentation in the tumor microenvironment. In order to conduct this type of research, it is important to identify tumor-specific mutations that occur across all genes in the tumor genome. Thus, genome-wide approaches may be used for this effort.Note that in order to understand tumor-specific mutations; it is necessary to compare the tumor genome with the germline genome. Microsatellite instability may also be evaluated as this is an important biomarker for some cancers (ie, colorectal cancer). Tumor and blood RNA analyses: Both genome-wide and targeted messenger RNA expression profiling and sequencing in tumor tissue and blood may be performed to define gene signatures that have a correlation to clinical response to treatment with pembrolizumab or other immunotherapies. Pembrolizumab induces a response in tumors that likely reflects an inflamed/immune phenotype.Specific immune-related gene sets (such as those capturing interferon -gamma transcriptional pathways) may be evaluated and new signatures may be identified. Individual genes related to the immune system may also be evaluated (eg, IL-10). MicroRNA profiling may also be pursued. Proteomics and IHC using blood and tumor: Tumor and blood samples from this study may undergo proteomic analyses (eg, PD-L1 IHC).PD-L1 protein level in tumor sections, assessed by IHC, has been shown to correlate with response to pembrolizumab in subjects with NSCLC, and anin vitro diagnostic device has been developed for usewith pembrolizumab in NSCLC. Preliminary data indicate that this association may also be true in additional cancer types (ie, triple-negative breast cancer, head and neck cancer,and gastric cancer).Since many tumor or blood-derived proteins maycorrelate with response to pembrolizumab, tumor tissue may be subjected to proteomic analyses using a variety of platforms including, but not limited to,immunoassays andliquid chromatograph y/mass"

Other blood derived biomarkers : In addition to expression on the tumor tissue, PD-L1 and other tumor-derived proteins can be shed from tumor and released into the blood.Assays such as enzyme-linked immunoassay smeasure these proteins in serum.The correlation of such expression with a response to pembrolizumab therapy maylead to identification of new approaches forusingpredictive biomarkers in blood, representing a major advance from today’s reliance on assessing tumor biomarkers. This research would serve to develop such assays for future clinical use . Future Biomedical Research The Sponsor will conduct Future Biomedical Research on specimens consented for future biomedical research during this clinical trial. This research may include genetic anal yses (DNA), gene expression profiling (RNA), proteomics, metabolomics (serum, plasma) and/or the measurement of other analytes, depending on which specimens are consented for future biomedical research. Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere in the protocol (as part of the main trial) and will only be conducted on specimens from appropriatel y consented subjects. The objective of collecting /retaining specimens for Future Biomedical Research is to explore and identify biomarkers that inform the scientific understanding of diseases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that subjects receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccineat the correct time. The details of this Future Biomedical Research sub-trial are presented in Section 12.2 –Collection and Management of Specimens for Future Biomedical Research. Benefit/Risk It cannot be guaranteed that subjects in clinical trials will directly benefit from treatment during participation ,as clinical trials are designed to provide information about the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine. As described in Section 4.2.1,KEYNOTE -028 demonstrated that pembrolizumab monotherap y has meaningful anti-tumor activity in heavily pre-treated subjects with PD-L1-positive SCLC.Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy hassignificant clinical activity as 1Ltherapy in subjectswith advanced NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression, as shown in KEYNOTE -021 CohortG(Section 4.2.1).Considering the high unmet medical need for new and tolerable treatment options in subjects with newly diagnosed ES -SCLC, the anti-tumor activity and the favorable safety profileof pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherap y regimens for other solid tumors, a combination of PD -1 blockade pluschemotherap y is a promising therapeutic strategy and the benefit-risk assessment for subjects included in this trial is considered to be favorable."

Supportive Care Guidelines Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the treating investigator. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEswith potential immunologic etiology are outlined along with the dose modification guidelines in Section 5.2.1.2.1 , [Table4].Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or IV treatment with corticosteroids, as well as additional anti- inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care.The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.

Individual trial procedures are described in detail below. It may be necessary to perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by the investigator. Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the investigator and or the Sponsor for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject. In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations. Administrative Procedures Informed Consent The investigator or qualified designee must obtain documented consent from each potential subjector each subject’s legally acceptable representative prior to participating in a clinical trialor Future Biomedical Research.If there arechanges to the subject’s status during the trial (e.g.,health or age of majority requirements ), the investigator or qualified designee must ensure the ap propriate consent is in place. 7.1.1.1.1 General Informed Consent Consent must be documented by the subject’s dated signature or by the subject’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature on a consent form along with the dated signature of the person conducting the consent discussion. A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participation in the trial. The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s approval/favorable opinion in advance of use. The subject or his/her legally acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the trial. The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature or by the subject’s legall y acceptable representative’s dated signature.

Assessing and Recording Adverse Events An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical productand which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol- specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol- specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor’s product, is also an adverse event. Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantl y in frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typical crying in infants and children and onset of menses or menopause occurring at a ph ysiologically appropriate time. Sponsor's product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, diagnostic agent or protocol-specified procedure, whether investigational (including placebo or active comparator medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by or distributed by the Sponsor for human use. Adverse events may occur during clinical trials, or as prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal. Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adve rse event. All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/ randomization must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. From the time of treatment allocation/ randomization through 30days following cessation of treatment, all adverse events must bereported by the investigator. Such events will be recorded at each examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is described in Section 7.2.3.1. The investigator will make every attempt to follow all subjects with non- serious adverse events for outcome. Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC)data entry guidelines. Paper reporting procedures can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent)."

No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab . In the event of overdose, pembrolizuma bshould be discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of Sponsor's product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met. If a dose of Sponsor's product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported by the investigator within 24 hours to the Sponsor either by electronic media or paper. Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines. Paper reporting procedures can be found in the I nvestigator Trial File Binder (or equival ent). Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered AEs, it is the responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneousl y reported to the m) that occurs during the trial . Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/ randomization must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial orare the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. Pregnancies and lactations that occur from the time of treatment allocation/ randomization through 120days following cessation of Sponsor’s product,or 180days after last dose of chemotherapeutic agents,or 30days following cessation of trial treatment ifthe subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, mustbe reported by the investigator. All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy . Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported."

Specificall y, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is disease progression of the cancer under stud y. The Sponsor will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to ensure the safety of the subjects in the trial. Any suspected endpoint which upon review is not progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to global safety as a SAE within 24 hours of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under study. Evaluating Adverse Events An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4. Any adverse event which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of grade recorded on the adverse event case report forms/worksheets. All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness. For studies in which multiple agents are administered as part of a combination regimen, the investigator may attribute each adverse event causality to the combination regimen or to a single agent of the combination. In general, causality attribution should be assigned to the combination regimen (i.e., to all agents in the regimen). However, causality attribution may be assigned to a single agent if in the investigator’s opinion, there is sufficient data to support full attribution of the adverse event to the single agent."

Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediate ly life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation or hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL. Grade 4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE Seriousness A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of Sponsor’s product that: †Results in death ; or †Is life threatening; orplaces the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or †Results in a persiste nt or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation.

Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse eventfor collection purposes. An overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non -serious event of clinical inter est and must be reported within 24 hours. Other important medical events that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse eve nt when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously (designated above by a †). Duration Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, indicate the app ropriate length of time and units Action taken Did the adverse event cause the Sponsor’s product to be discontinued? Relationship to Sponsor’s ProductDid the Sponsor’s product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor’s product caused the adverse event will be provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done.

Safety Endpoints Safety measurements are described in Section 4.2.3.3and Section 7.Safety and tolerabilit y will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs.Safety parameters to be analyzed include, but are not limited to, AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, and laboratory changes. Furthermore, specific events will be collected and designated as ECIs as described in Section 7.2.3. Analysis Populations Efficacy Analysis Populations The analyses of primary efficacy endpoints are based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (ie, subjects will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized). Details on the approach to handling missing data are provided in Section8.6. Safety Analysis Populations The All Subjects as Treated (ASaT)population will be used for the analysis of safety data in this study.The ASaT population consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 1dose of study treatment. Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment they actually received. For most subjects, this will be the treatment group to which they are randomized. Subjects who take incorrect study treatment for the entire treatment period will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment actually received. Any subject who receives the incorrect study medication for 1cycle,but receives the correct treatment for all other cycles will be analyzed according to the correct treatment group and a narrative will be provided for any events that occur during the cycle for which the subject is incorrectly dosed. At least 1 laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained subsequent to at least 1 dose of study treatment is required for inclusion in the analysis of each specific parameter.

Methods related to exploratory objectives will be descri bed in the sSAP. Efficacy results that will be deemed to be statistically significant after consideration of the Type I error control strategy are described in Section 8.8. Nominal p- values will be computed for other efficacy analyses, but should be interpreted with caution due to potential issues of multiplicity . Progression-f ree Survival The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS curve in each treatment group.The treatment difference in PFS will be assessed by the stratified log-rank test (based on the stratification factors defined in Section 5.4).A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitu deof the treatment difference (ie, the hazard ratio [HR]) between the treatment arms.The HRand its 95% CIfrom the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (See Section 5.4) will be applied to both the stratified log -rank test and the stratified Cox model. Since disease progression is assessed periodicall y, PD can occur any time in the time interval between the last assessment where PD was not documented and the assessment when PD is documented. For the primary analysis, for the subjects who have PD, the true date of disease progression will be approximated by the date of the first assessment at which PD is objectively documented as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1 modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, regardless of discontinuation of study drug.Death is alway s considered as a confirmed PD event. In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per modified RECIST 1.1 by central imaging vendor , we will perform 2 sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules. The first sensitivity analysis is the same as the primary analysis except that data for any subject whomisses more than one disease assessment (with or without a subsequent death or progression) are censored at the last disease assessment prior to missing visits.The second sensitivity analysis is the same as the primary analysis except that it considers discontinuation of treatment or initiation of an anticancer treatment subsequent to discontinuation of study-specified treatments, whichever occurs later, to be a PD event for subjects without documented PD or death. If a subject meets multiple criteria forcensoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest will be applied.The censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses are summarized in Table11."

The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach (Table14).The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. Safety parameters or AEs of special interest that are identified a priori constitute “Tier 1” safety endpoints that will be subject to inferential testing for statistical significance with p-values and 95% CIs provided for between-group comparisons. Other safety parameters will be considered Tier 2 or Tier 3. Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% CIs provided for between-group comparisons; only point estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. Adverse events of special interest (AEOSIs) that are immune-mediated or potentially immune-mediated are welldocumented and will be evaluated separately ; however, these events have been characterized consistently throughout the pembrolizumab clinical development program and determination of statistical significance is not expected to add value to the safety evaluation. Further, pembrolizumab added to platinum doublets studied thus far havenot been found to impact safety, and in an ongoing Phase 1clinical trial, the chemotherapeutic regimen used here with pembrolizumab has not led to increased toxicity"

Additionally , there are no known AEs associated with subjects with SCLC for which determination of a p-value is expected to impact the safety assessment. For these reasons, there are no events of interest that warrant inferential testing. Therefore, there are no Tier I events in this study . Adverse experiences (specific terms as well as system organ class terms) that are not pre-specified as Tier -1 endpoints will be classified as belonging to ""Tier 2"" or ""Tier 3"", based on the number of events observed. Membership in Tier2 requires that at least 10%of subjects in any treatment group exhibit the event; all other AEsand predefined limits of change will belong to Tier 3. The threshold of at least 10% was chosen for membership in Tier 2 because subjects enrolled in this study are in critical condition and usually experience various AEsof similar types regardless of treatment, events reported less frequently than in 10% of subjects would obscure the assessment of the overall safety profile and add little to the interpretation of potentially meaningful treatment differences. In addition, Grades3 to 5 AEs (≥5% of subjects in one of the treatment arms) and SAEs (≥5% of subjects in one of the treatment arms) will be considered Tier2 events.For Tier 2 events, 95% CIswill be provided for between-treatment differences in the percentage of subjects with events; these analyses will be performed using the Miettinen and Nurminen method [116], an unconditional, asymptotic method.Because many 95% CIs may be provided without adjustment for multiplicity , the CIs should be regarded as a helpful descriptive measure to be used in safety review, not a formal method for assessing the statistical significance of the between -treatment differences . For laboratory parameters, the number and percentage of subjects with increases from baseline in laboratory test toxicity grades based on the highest post-baseline toxicity grade and shift of toxicity grade from baseline to the worst post-baseline toxicity grade will be summarized by treatment arm.

For a single-center trial, the Protocol CI is the principal investigator. In addition, the Sponsor must designate a principal or coordinating investigator to review the trial report that summarizes the trial results and confirm that, to the best of his/her knowledge, the report accuratel y describes the conduct and results of the trial [Clini cal Study Report (CSR) CI]. The Sponsor may consider one or more factors in the selection of the individual to serve as the Protocol CI and or CSR CI (e.g., availabilit y of the Protocol/CSR CI during the anticipated review process, thorough understanding of clinical trial methods, appropriate enrollment of subject cohort, timely achievement of trial milestones). The Protocol CI must be a participating trial investigator. Compliance with Trial Registration and Results Posting Requirements Under the terms of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA) of 2007 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) clinical trial Directive 2001/20/EC, the Sponsor of the trial is solely responsible for determining whether the trial and its results are subject to the requirements for submission to http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu or other local registries. Merck, as Sponsor of this trial, will review this protocol and submit the information necessary to fulfill these requirements. Merck entries are not limited to FDAAA or the EMA clinical trial directive mandated trials. Information posted will allow subjects to identify potentially appropriate trials for their disease conditions and pursue participation by calling a central contact number for further information on appropriate trial locations and trial site contact information.

By entering his/her electronic signature, the investigator confirms that all recorded data have been verified as accurate. Detailed information regarding Data Management procedures for this protocol will be provided separately. Publications This trial is intended for publication, even if terminated prematurel y. Publication may include any or all of the following: posting of a synopsis online, abstract and/or presentation at a scientific conference, or publication of a full manuscript. The Sponsor will work with the authors to submit a manuscript describing trial results within 12 months afterthe last data become available, which may take up to several months after the last subject visit in some cases such as vaccine trials. However, manuscript submission timelines may be extended on OTC trials. For trials intended for pediatric-related regu latory filings, the investigator agrees to delay publication of the trial results until the Sponsor notifies the investigator that all relevant regulatory authority decisions on the trial drug have been made with regard to pediatric-related regulatory filings. Merck will post a synopsis of trial results for approved products on www.clinicaltrials.gov by 12 months after the last subject's last visit for the primary outcome, 12 months after the decision to discontinue development, or product marketing (dispensed, administered, delivered or promoted), whichever is later. These timelines may be extended for products that are not yet marketed, if additional time is needed for analysis, to protect intellectual property, or to comply with confidentiality agreements with other parties. Authors of the primary results manuscript will be provided the complete results from the Clinical Study Report, subject to the confidentiality agreement. When a manuscript is submitted to a biomedical journal, the Sponsor's policy is to also include the protocol and statistical analysis plan to facilitate the peer and editorial review of the manuscript. If the manuscript is subsequently accepted for publication, the Sponsor will allow the journal, if it so desires, to post on its website the key sections of the protocol that are relevant to evaluating the trial, specifically those sections describing the trial objectives and hypotheses, the subject inclusion and exclusion criteria, the trial design and procedures, the efficacy and safety measures, the statistical analy sis plan, and any amendments relating to those sections. The Sponsor reserves the right to redact proprietary information. For multicenter trials, subsequent to the multicenter publication (or after public disclosure of the results online at www.clinicaltrials.gov if a multicenter manuscript is not planned), an investigator and his/her colleagues may publish their data independentl y. In most cases, publication of individual trial site data does not add value to complete multicenter results, due to statistical concerns.

Introduction A. Purpose Merck, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of subject safety is the overriding concern in the design of clinical trials. In all cases, Merck clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national regulations and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. B. Scope Such standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by Merck irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (e. g., contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials which are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials which are n ot under the control of Merck. II.Scientific Issues A. Trial Conduct 1.Trial Design Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of Merck or comparator products. Alternatively, Merck may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine subject preferences, etc. The design (i.e., subject population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial. Research subjects must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 2.Site Selection Merck selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate subjects, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous performance in Merck trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated by Merck personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the trial. 3.Site Monit oring/Scientific Integrity Trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of Good Clinical Practice. Merck reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness and consistency. Data are verified versus source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per Merck policies and procedures, if fraud, misconduct or serious GCP -non-Compliance are suspected, the issues are promptly investigated. When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees notified and data disclosed accordingly. B. Publication and Authorship To the extent scientifically appropriate, Merck seeks to publish the results of trials it conducts. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing. In such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues of multiplicity. Merck’s policy on authorship is consistent with the requirements outlined in the ICH-Good Clinical Practice guidelines. In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. Merck funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications."
136,page_136,"Product: MK-3475 136 Protocol/Amendment No.: 604-09 MK-3475-604-09FinalProtocol 23-Apr-2019 ConfidentialIII. Subject Protection A.IRB/ERC review All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB/ERC before being initiated at each site. Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the IRB/ERC prior to implementation, except that changes required urgently to protect subject safety and well-being may be enacted in anticipation of IRB/ERC approval. For each site, the IRB/ERC and Merck will approve the subject informed consent form. B.Safety The guiding principle in decision-making in clinical trials is that subject welfare is of primary importance. Potential subjects will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local standard of care. Subjects are ne ver denied access to appropriate medical care based on participation in a Merck clinical trial. All participation in Merck clinical trials is voluntary. Subjects are enrolled only after providing informed consent for participation. Subjects may withdraw from a Merck trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them. C.Confidentiality Merck is committed to safeguarding subject confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or representative) and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential medical records that might identify the research subject by name. D.Genomic Research Genomic Research will only beconducted in accordance with informed consent and/or as specifically authorized by an Ethics Committee. IV.Financial Considerations A.Payments to Investigators Clinical trials are time-and labor-intensive. It is Merck’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of Merck trials. Merck does not pay incentives to enroll subjects in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments ma y be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts. Merck does not pay for subject referrals. However, Merck may compensate referring physicians for time spent on chart review to identify potentially eligible subjects. B.Clinical Rese arch Funding Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by Merck, and that the investigator or sponsoring institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local IRB/ERC may wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, publications resulting from Merck trials will indicate Merck as a source of funding. C.Funding for Travel and Other Requests Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (e.g.,to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be consistent with local guidelines and practices including, in the U.S., those established by the American Medical Association (AMA). V. Investigator Commi tment Investigators will be expected to review Merck’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. * In this document, ""Merck"" refers to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. and Schering Corporation, each of which is a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition.1 b.Pharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics as related to drug response.2 c.Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence of variations in DNA sequence on drug response.2 d.DNA: Deox yribonucleic acid. e.RNA: Ribonucleic acid. 2.Scope of Future Biomedical Research The specimens consented and/or collected in this trial as outlined in Section 7.1.3.4will be usedin various experiments to understand: The biology of how drugs work Biomarkers responsible for how a drug enters and is removed b y the body Other pathway s drugs may interact with The biology of disease The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development and/or drug/vaccine development. It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations with the greatest need. All specimens will be used by the Sponsoror those working for or with the Sponsor . 3. Summary of Procedur es for Future Biomedical Research a.Subjects for Enrollment All subjects enrolled in the clinical trial will be considered for enrollment in the Future Biomedical Research sub -trial. b.Informed Consent Informed consent for specimens (i.e., DNA, RNA, protein, etc.) will be obtained during screening for protocol enrollment from all subjects or legal guardians, at a trial visit by the investigator or his or her designate.

Consent forms signed by the subject will be kept at the clinical trial site under secure storage for regulatory reasons. A template of each trial site’s approved informed consent will be stored in the Sponsor’s clinical document repository . c.eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens Documentation of subjectconsent for Future Biomedical Research will be captured in the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs). Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified will be destroy ed. d.Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s) Collection of specimens for Future Biomedical Research will be performed as outlined in the trial flow chart. In general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for Future Biomedical Research, these will usually be obtained at a time when the subject is having blood drawn for other trial purposes. 4. Confidential Subject Information for Future Biomedical Research In order to optimize the research that can be conducted with Future Biomedical Research specimens, it is critical to link subject' clinical information with fu ture test results. In fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical trial data to the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing subject characteristics like gender, age, medical history and treatment outcomes are critical to understanding clinical context of analy tical results. To maintain privacy of information collected from specimens obtained for Future Biomedical Research, the Sponsorhas developed secure policies and procedures. All specimens will be single-coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below . At the clinical trial site, unique codes will be placed on the Future Biomedical Research specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain any personally identifying information embedded within it. The link (or key) between subject identifiers and this unique code will be held at the trial site. No personal identifiers will appear on the specimen tube. 5.Biorepository Specimen Usage Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for analyses using good scientific practices. Analyses utilizing the Future Biomedical Research specimens may be performed by the Sponsor, or an additional third party (e.g., a university investigator) designated by the Sponsor. The investigato r conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the specific scope of anal ysis outlined in this sub- trial. Future Biomedical Research specimens remaining withthe third party after specific analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor ."

Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research Subjects may withdraw their consent for Future Biomedical Research and ask that their biospecimens not be used for Future Biomedical Research. Subjects may withdraw consent at any time by contacting the principal investigator for the main trial. If medical records for the main trial are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently , the subject's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to main study use only. If specimens were collected from study participants specificall y for Future Biomedical Research, th ese specimens will be removed from the biorepository and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator confirming withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the subject of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or already performed prior to the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research trial data and results. No new analyses would be generated after the request is received. In the event that the medical records for the main trial are no longer available (e.g., if the investigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main trial records) or the specimens have been completel y anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the subject’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be pr ocessed. 7. Retention of Specimens Future Biomedical Research specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential analysis for up to 20 years from the end of the main study. Specimens may be stored for longer if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions have been adequatel y addressed. Specimens from the trial site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to the Sponsor-designated biorepository . If a central laboratory is not utilized in a particular trial, the trial site will ship directly to the Sponsor-designated biorepository . The specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility which operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destroyed according to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the biorepository database. 8.Data Security Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated trial administrator research personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highly secure, and is accomplished using network security policies and practices based on international standards to protect against unauthorized access."

Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Subjects No information obtained from exploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the subject, family, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the subject include: Lack of relevance to subject health, limitations of predictive capability , and concerns regarding misinterpretation. If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to rapidly report this information to doctors and subjects. Subjects will not be identified by name in any published reports about this study or in any other scientific publication or presentation. 10. Future Biomedical Research Study Population Every effort will be made to recruit all subjects diagnosed and treated on Sponsorclinical trials for Future Biomedical Research . 11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research For future biomedical research, risks to the subject have been minimized. Risks include those associated with venipuncture to obtain the whole blood specimen. This specimen will be obtained at the time of routine blood specimens drawn in the main trial. The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies and procedures to address subject data privacy concerns. Data privacy risks are largely limited to rare situations involving possible breach of confidentiality . In this highly unlikely situation there is risk that the information, like all medical information, may be misused. 12.Questions Any questions related to the future biomedical research should be e-mailed directly to clinical.specimen.management@merck.com. 13.References 1.
