STUDY BACKGROUND
2,page_2,"3 Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) results from the disruption of normal blood transportation, whether the disruption occurs in the superficial or deep venous system, the perforating veins or any combination of these1. When the perforator valves become compromised, pressure in the calf mus cle contraction increases and blood begins to flow through the compromised perforator veins into the superficial venous system resulting in venous hypertension or varicose veins1. Varicose veins are known as common venous incompetence in the lower extremi ties and appear as dilated, elongated, or winding superficial veins2. Venous pressure in the lower legs results from damaged deep, superficial and or perforating veins and over time this can lead to changes in the skin such as hyperpigmentation, edema, and can lead to ulceration2. It is essential for individuals to have regular contraction of the calf musculature as it controls lower extremity venous return2. The calf muscle pump function is known as the “peripheral heart” for its crucial role in an individ ual’s calf muscle pump function4. Once there is long -term weakness in the calf musculature the blood flow to the lower extremity slows down and increases the risk for a deep venous thrombosis2. With many theories leading to the valve reflux being the main cause of varicose veins there has been no evidence to show that if the compromised primary valve initiates the process of varicose veins or if the dilat ation or weakening of the vein walls and collagen composition is the cause. CVI is a highly reported chr onic medical condition in the United States and the Western world1. In the United States alone over 2.5 million individuals are affected by chronic venous disease with prevalence ranging in geographical locations1,3. Beebe -Dimmer et al (2005) reported that over a wide variety o f countries from 1942 - 2003 the prevalence of varicose veins varied from 2% to 56% in men and from <1% to 73% in women. However, in 2017 a decrease was reported that prevalence of CVI varied from <1% to 40% in women and from <1% to 17% in men3. CVI impacts countries financial status as wound care alone in the United States allots for 3 billion dollars annual ly3. There are many factors that put individuals at risk for the development of chronic venous insufficiency, such as, advancing ag e, family history of venous disease, ligament laxity, prolonged standing, increased BMI, smoking, sedentary life style, lower -extremity trauma, prior venous thrombosis, the presence of an arteriovenous shunt, some hereditary conditions, high levels of estr ogen and pregnancy1,5,6,7-20."
3,page_3,"4 Once diagnosed , treatment for CVI is a conservative management by reducing symptoms and prevent ing progress of the disease and secondary complications21. Initial conservative treatments consist of leg elevation, exercise ther apy and compression to improve oxygen transport to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, decrease edema, reduce inflammation, and compress any dilated veins22. It is recommended that individuals with CVI maintain an ideal body weight or reduce their weight, i f overweight, and maintain an overall healthy lifestyle19. Exercise is a recommended form of therapy for individuals with CVI as it can help improved calf muscle pump function23. In a clinical setting CVI is diagnosed through the use of the CEAP classification. The CEAP scoring is made up of four clinical components, (C)clinical signs, (E)Etiology, (A) Anatomy and (P)Pathophysiology. Each component of the CEAP classification have numerical subcomponents of their own. Within the clinical settings there are eight subcomponents, (C0) no visible or palpable signs of venous disease, (C1) telangiectasia/reticular veins, (C2) varicose veins, (C3) edema, (C4) Pigmentation or eczema, (C5) healed venous ulcer, (C6) active venous ulcer24. In the etiology ther e are four subcomponents, (Ec) congenital, (Es) secondary, (En) etiology not specified24. The anatomy component of the CEAP classification is broken down into four subcomponents, superficial venous system (As), perforating veins (Ap), deep venous system (A d) and anatomy not specified (An) 24. The pathophysiology component is made up of four subcomponents, venous reflux (Pr), venous obstruction (Po), venous reflux and obstruction (Pr,o) and reflux not specified (Pn) 24. In regards to this study a CEAP score of C2, C3 and C4 will be included within the inclusion criteria. The C2 clinical classification is identified as varicose veins which are subcutaneous dilated veins 3mm or more. Edema or C3 is common among individuals with chronic venous insufficiency due to the increased volume of fluid in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, venous edema is commonly found in the ankle24. C4 is divided into two categories, C4a is known as pigmentation or eczema where the skin will have a brown/darkening pigmentation due to t he hemosiderin deposition a result from the discharge of red blood cells typically occurring in the ankle region24. Eczema is typically located near the varicose veins and begins as an erythematous dermatitis and has the potential to progress as blisters24. C4b or"
4,page_4,"5 lipodermatosclerosis (LDS) is localized chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the lower extremities24. 2. STUDY RATIONALE Compression leg garments have become the mainstay for conservative management of CVI. It was found that treatment with a 30 -to 40 -mmgHg compression stocking results in improvement in pain, swelling, skin pigmentation, activity and well -being if compliance of 70% -80% is acheived21. Compression therapy is the first line of treatment that is implemented for individuals with chronic venous insufficiency21. Individuals with CVI face a number of complications, such as, muscular dysfunction, limited ankle range of motion (ROM ) and diminished calf"
5,page_5,"6 muscle pump function23. Exercise therapy has been shown to improve calf muscle pump function and symptoms and may provide additional therapeutic benefits23. It has been reported that structured exercise has the ability to improve ankle joint range of motion, calf muscle strength and cal f muscle pump function. However, the majority of structured exercise programmes strictly focus on the lower trunk and lower leg strengthening. Focusing on one aspect of the body only when participating in structured exercise has the potential to be harming to an individual’s kinetic chain and posture. A combination of upper and lower body structured exercise as well as, ankle join range of motion and a walking regimen has the potential to have a significant impact on an individ ual’s calf muscle pump functio n and avoid these potentially harmful side effects of lower body exercise programmes Structured Exercise and Calf Muscle Pump Function in CVI Padberg, Johnston and Sisto (2004) conducted a study hypothesising that structured exercise would improve calf mu scle pump function, calf muscle strength and venous hemodynamic in patients with chronic venous insufficiency. All patients were clinically diagnosed with advanced CVI and a CEAP score of 4,5,6 all determined through a duplex ultrasound scanning23. Patient s with an ulceration greater than 4 cm in diameter, painful ulceration, active local infection, recognized noncompliance, absence of objective evidence of a venous cause, uncompensated cardiorespiratory insufficiency, ABI less than 0.7, and recent venous t hrombosis were excluded from the study23. A total of 77 patients were screened for the study, 46 participants were excluded, there was a total of 30 trial subjects and a total of 28 participant data was analysed23. Patients underwent air plethysmography (APG) to evaluate reflux volume, outflow, and calf pump function as well as ankle isokinetic dynamometer. Investigators used a Biodex System 2 multi -joint and rehabilitation system to obtain data for calf torque, work, power and range of motion23. Ankle p lantar flexion and extension were tested on the Biodex twice, one week apart at two separate speeds, slow (60 degrees per second) with full ankle dorsiflexion and fast (120 degrees per second) with full ankle plantar flexion23. All patients completed five repetitions at the slow speed and fifteen repetitions at the fast speed, all tests were replicated from Sisto et al and Holback et al23. Measurements collected were the average of all"
6,page_6,"7 contractions for peak torque, peak torque per unit of body weight, maxim al repetition work, total work, average power, and maximal range of motion23. All patients underwent functional and quality of life assessment through the administration of the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Survey, CIVIQ, the physical function terms of the SF -36 Health Survey, the functional independence measure, Craig Handicap and reporting techniques, and older American resources to test for function in daily life23. All questionnaires were administered at 0 (baseline) and 6 -months (completion of the study) 23. Participants were then randomly allocated into two unblinded groups; the control group or the therapy (experimental) group.. Participants randomized into the exercise prescription group received 3 - months of supervised exercise therapy followed by 3 -months of unsupervised exercise therapy. At baseline, 3 months and 6 months clinical examinations, APG, and isokinetic dynamometry were performed23. The supervised exercise programme consisted of lower limb and trunk stretching and strengthening, active gravity strengthening and resistance weights in two session each week each lasting for approximately one hour23. All exercise programmes and prescriptions were individualized by the physiotherapist. Exercise training focused on the strengthening of lower leg, speci fically, calf musculature and progression was monitored by repetitions, sets and weights throughout the duration of the exercise programme. In each session uphill treadmill walking was incorporated in the supervised training programme and participants were encouraged to continue uphill walking in the final 3-months of unsupervised exercise training. Compliance to the exercise programme was documented by the number of days the participants attended the supervised exercise sessions and in the unsupervised exe rcise phase the number of days of exercise completed or not23. Patients in the usual care control group underwent baseline measurements at 0 and again at 6 months. The control group was monitored monthly to confirm and ensure participants were using their compression stockings23. Upon completion of the 6 -month programme participants in the control group had the opportunity to take on the 6 -month supervised exercise therapy as wait-listed participants23. Padberg, Johnston and Sisto (2004) compared the experi mental group with the control group and found that the ejection fraction ( EF) increased significantly (P<.026) and the residual volume fraction ( RVF) decreased significantly ( P<.029)23."
7,page_7,"8 After 6 -months it was reported that there was no significant change in venous clinical severity score and outflow fraction or obstruction23. When compared to the control group, the exercise group improved their mean peak torque per unit body weight as well as slow and fast peak torque23. A univariate ANOVA was perfomed con trolling baseline values found a difference for slow speeds ( P<.053) and fast speeds (P<.033 ) 23. However, when compared at 6 -months there was no significant difference between the two groups for other Biodex measurements23. Between the two groups there were no significant differences observed in QOL, functional or perceived impairment23. The structured exercise group experienced improved calf muscle pump function and dynamic calf muscle strength after 6 -months23. Calf muscle strength was improved at both speeds slow and fast when normalized to body weight23. Padberg, Johnston and Sisto (2004) stated that direct physical conditioning of the calf musculature may prove beneficial for patients with or without alternative management options for severe CVI. The primary limitation faced in this study was the low number recruited to the study, 30 instead of planned 60, which was the target number of participants. Within the two individual groups there were limitations of their own; there was a nonsignificant patt ern of greater medical comorbidity and greater musculoskeletal complications in the experimental group23. From the research conducted it is suggested to have a greater sample size and a multisite study to confirm and clarify the effects of physical therapy on CVI, the effects on QOL, and benefit for the particiapants23. Effects of isokinetic on calf musculature in patients with CVI Ercan et al (2017) conducted a study observing the change of ankle joint range of motion, muscle strength values of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion measured with an isokinetic dynamometer, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scored, EQ -5D quality of life scale, and venous return time in individuals clinically diagnosed with CVI after a 12-week exercise intervention29. There was a total of 27 patients included in the study, 23 female and 4 male, five patients left the study due to inadequate compliance with the exercise programme as a result 22 patients were included in a statistical analysis29."
8,page_8,"9 All patients were diagnosed with a CEAP 3 and 4 determined by the patients’ medical history and findings from a physical examination, Doppler ultrasonography and photo -plethysmography ( PPG ) testing29. Patients with painful ulcer venous ulceration, active local infections, the patient incompatibi lity during the test, non - compensatory heart and lung failure, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, vasodilator treatment, orthopaedic disorders of the ankle, and any systemic disease were excluded29. Before and after the 12 -week exercise programme all p atients had their ankle joint range of motion assessed, quality of life and PPG testing all baseline measurements were employed in the same order29. The structured exercise programme consisted of an isokinetic exercises for the calf musculature for three days a week for 12 -weeks29. The exercise programme was made up of range of motion exercises (10 reps X 3 sets), thera -band exercises (10 reps X 3 sets, flexion -extension -internal and external rotation), isokinetic exercise (three different speeds 60 , 90, 120 for 10 repetitions for 3 sets), stability exercise on balance board (10 -minutes), treadmill walking (60% HR max for 20 - minutes), intermittent pneumatic compression (JOBST for 20 -minutes) 29. Ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion were tested at speed s of 60 -120/s in concentric/concentric mode all tests were applied in a prone position at a range of motion of 15  dorsiflexion and 40  plantarflexion29. PPG measurements for all patients included in the study were conducted by a cardiovascular surgeon. VAS scoring was used to determine the severity of the patients CVI and the EQ -5D quality of life survey was used to understand the effect CVI has on the individuals quality of life29. Ankle joint range of motion measurements were measured by a metal goniom eter prior to isokinetic muscle strength measurements29. Before participating in the muscle strength test patients underwent submaximal warming exercises on the cycle ergometer for 10 minutes, followed by stretching exercises for five minutes29. Peak torqu e and total work values of ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion were measured by isokinetic testing29. As mentioned there were 27 patients included in the study; at the end of 12 - weeks five patients were excluded due to inadequate compliance to the exerc ise programme leaving 22 patients for statistical analysis. An dependent t-test was performed found a significant increase ( p<0.05) in the participants venous return times ( VRT) 29. Ankle ROM increased significantly ( p<0.05) as well as an increase in"
9,page_9,"10 peak torque ( PT), PT/BW, total work done in PF and DF and a significant decrease in agonist/antagonist ratio through isokinetic measurement ( p<0.05) 29. Ercan et al (2017) found that the 12 -week at home exercise programme decreased participants VAS values and a significant increase in EQ -5D quality of life scale( p<0.05) 29. However, the study failed to positively impact participants calf muscle pump function in regards to venous reflux. After 12 -weeks of structured calf muscle exercise participants experienced improved ankle ROM, improved muscular strength, overall improved QOL, improved VRT and reduction of pain29. After 12 -weeks of structured exercise it was reported, exercise has a positive impact in the treatment of venous insufficiency29. Isokinetic testin g is necessary and highly beneficial when evaluating muscle performance. Measurements are obtained by the machine performing kinematic analysis of movements and comparing both sides of the extremity through agonist/antagonist muscle strength and the work c apacity and endurance of muscle movement29. Manual muscle testing does not provide accurate and reliable values, this form of testing only establishes the force which occurs at a certain point of movement. Data such as work, force, and endurance are immeas urable, it was reported a 23% -31% deficit was found in isokinetic knee testing in patients who reportedly had normal values in manual testing29. Isokinetic testing is a musculoskeletal performance system that has the ability to compute reliable quantitativ e data and provide the option to save the patients data to evaluate the disease progression or improvement29. Isokinetic testing is highly beneficial to this study and patient population as it assists in the evaluation of muscular strength in which can aid in the improvement of calf muscle pump function and ankle ROM which can also contribute to the improvement of calf muscle pump function in individuals with CVI. Adequate ROM is as important in healthy individuals as it is in individuals with CVI. With lon g periods of inactivity muscles tend to shorten, resulting in tightness of the muscle. ROM is then negative affected by these tight muscles restricting the joint from reaching the full range. Ercan et al (2017) stated that the slightest change in ROM has t he potential for greater hemodynamic changes. It is reported that a change of 1.5 cm in ankle rotation axis leads to 8.3% increase in extension PT30. There is a positive correlation between an individual with CVI and their ROM and the"
10,page_10,"11 stage of venous dise ase they may be experiencig31. It is recommended for individuals with CVI to incorporate ankle exercises into their daily lives as they can be highly beneficial to ROM improvement and calf muscle contracion29. It is important for individuals participating in a new exercise intervention that the exercise technician incorporates all movements that an individual will experience in a day, such as, bending and lifting, single leg movements, pushing, pulling and rotation. Both studies discussed did not incorporat e an upper -body movement or intervention. An exercise intervention should include all the daily movements mentioned above it and it should also include the appropriate open -chain and close - chain movements to ensure the body is moving and growing in unison. By incorporating upper and lower body exercises, aerobic exercise and range of motion into an exercise programme the individual will receive a well balance approach to exercise and maintain proper posture and alignment within their kinetic chain. The “Strength From Within” (SFW) programme incorporates upper and lower body exercise both assisted and non -assisted as well as open -chain and closed - chain movements. This is a 12 -week at home based structured resistance exercise programme which has the a bility to be modified to different exercise intensities and individual abilities. Participants will have the choice of how many repetitions they complete for each exercise, if they need to be sitting or standing for certain exercises and when in their day they want to complete the exercises. The SFW programme consists of a total of twenty exercises made up of upper and lower body exercises both sitting and standing. Participants will be asked to complete lower body exercises on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and upper body exercises Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and Sunday as a rest and recovery day. Incorporated with resistance programme are ankle ROM exercises, a warm -up and cool -down, and a walking protocol. This exercise intervention is a full body at hom e resistance and aerobic programme that has the potential to improve calf muscle pump function, venous clinical severity score, calf muscle strength, greater ankle range of motion, overall physical strength and quality of life."

18,page_18,"19 All patients will complete a Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR -Q) prior to participating in the trial. The PAR -Q is designed to determine if physical activity is safe for individuals or if they may need medical clearance from a physician. If a patient fails to complete or pass the PAR -Q they will be ineligible for participation in the trial. 6.11 SF -36 Short Form Health Survey All patients will complete the SF -36 Short Form Health Survey at baseline and at the completion of the 12 -week exerci se programme. The SF -36 Short Form Health Survey is utilized to evaluate an individual’s quality of life. 6.12 Venous Clinical Severity Score All patients will complete the Venous Clinical Severity Score at baseline and upon completion of the 12 -week study. The Venous Clinical Severity Score will be used to characterized the severity of the patients’ chronic venous insufficiency and to monitor any progression made . 6.13 Calf Muscle Pump Function: Duplex Ultrasound Scanning All patients will undergo a comprehensive duplex ultrasound scanning to determine the nature and extent of venous reflux. The duplex ultrasound will be conducted by Professor Sherif Sultan during a clinical appointment. A repeat of objective measures will be repeated at the completion of their 12 -week. 6.14 Biodex Measurements -Isokinetic Testing All patients will undergo lower limb isokinetic (concentric/concentric) testing u sing a using a Biodex Multi -joint System33,34. All Biodex testing will be conducted based of evidence based clinical protocols provided by Biodex. Biodex measurements will consist of knee flexion/extension and ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. For kn ee flexion/extension patients will undergo a bilateral isokinetic 3 speed evaluation to establish goals and monitor progress33. Patients will move through full range of motion with a percent range of 100 and will be evaluated at three speeds and three repetitions33. At 60/second the patient will complete 5 repetitions, at 180 / seconds the patient will complete 10 repetitions and at 300 /second the patient will complete"
19,page_19,"20 15 repetitions33. Ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion will be measured with a bilateral isokinetic 2 speed evaluation at 5 repetitions at 60 /second and 10 at 120/second34. Testing will be administered at baseline and at the completion of the 12-week exercise programme; data will be collected and recorded on calf torque, calf work, calf power, plantarflexion range of motion and dorsiflexion range of motion. 6.15 Functional Ambulatory Measurements : 6-minute walk test: All patients will complete a 6 -minute walk test on an even/flat 25m ground supervised by a trained exercise technic ian. Participants will be instructed to walk for 6 minutes at a moderate comfortable rate. 6.16 Physical Activity Measurements Muscle Endurance Testing All patients will complete muscular endurance for all major muscles. Patients will be asked to complete a series of upper and lower body exercises testing their muscular endurance within 30 seconds. All patients will complete as many repetitions as they can in 30 seconds at a speed they are comfortable preforming at. Muscular endurance testing will be condu cted at baseline and upon the completion of the 12 - week structured exercise programme. The muscular endurance testing consists of single leg balance on each leg, step overs, sit to stand, push press, single arm right bicep curl, single arm left bicep curl, and single arm right triceps extension and single arm left triceps extension at a moderate rate or intensity. 6.17 Strength From Within Exercise Programme - All patients will receive the structured exercise programme, and the “Strength From Within Book let”, a resistance band, a recording booklet, a walking information leaflet, ankle range of motion exercises, a warm -up and a cool -down. The Strength From Within booklet provides a descriptive linguistic and visual demonstration of proper technique and saf ety for all exercises. The at home resistance exercise programme consists of a total of twenty standing and sitting exercises divided into upper and lower body. Patients will participate in the Strength"
20,page_20,"21 From Within structured exercise programme for 12 -weeks by choosing their own 5 upper body exercise and 5 lower body exercise per week from the Strength From Within booklet. Patients are able to have a combination of standing and sitting exercises to accommodate their ambulatory needs. Patients will complet e lower body exercises on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and complete upper body exercises Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday; Sunday is a rest and recovery day. To further the individualistic aspect of the programme patients will be deciding their own repetitio ns from a range of eight to twelve, however, the exercise technician will be contacting the patients each week to monitor and implement repetition progression. Progression will be implemented if the patient is able to complete two full weeks of the same re petition count. Built into the exercise programme there will be a dynamic warm -up and static -stretching cooldown, both lasting for five minutes. Ankle range of motion exercises using the resistance band will be included in the exercise programme to be comp leted on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Patients will be completing three sets of ten ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion with a resistance band. All exercise will be demonstrated and practiced with participants to ensure proper technique and safety. In c ombination with the Strength From Within programme, patients will participate in a 12 -week walking protocol. Each walking protocol will be individualized at the first meeting following the 6 -minue walk test. Patients’ walking progression will be determined biweekly based on the patients’ experience and response to the protocol. Patients will receive a walking protocol recording sheet to fill in the minutes walked each day and the total duration each week. The exercise technician will be referring to the May o Clinic 12 -week walking protocol for guidance. Participants will be contacted each week by telephone or personal interaction. Regular weekly check in will be done to know the improvement and status of the participant and to possibly adjust the repetitions and sets to be completed that week accordingly. Upon completion of the study participants will be contacted 3 -months after their completion date. Participants will be contacted be telephone and be asked to participate in a short questionnaire on their adh erence to the exercise programme after their 12 -weeks finished. At the 12 -week meeting the study researcher will collect the participants recording booklet in order to evaluate and measure adherence/compliance to the structured exercise programme. Particip ants have the"
21,page_21,"22 right to deny participation in the follow -up questionnaire, if they wish to do so appropriate documentation will be completed to ensure missing data is accounted for. If the study researcher cannot get in touch with the participant on the fir st attempt to contact the study researcher will call once more a week later. If the study researcher cannot get in contact with the participant after the second attempt the study researcher will not contact that participant again 7. TRIAL OUTCOMES MEASURES 7.1 Primary Outcome Measures This trial was to determine the effect of a 12-week at home structured exercise and aerobic programme in patients with chronic venous insufficiency. The primary outcome measures is the effect a 12-week at hom e structured exercise and aerobic programme has on muscle pump function, venous clinical severity score and calf muscle strength in an individuals with chronic venous insufficiency. 7.2 Secondary Endpoints"
22,page_22,"23 The following endpoints will be measured : 1. Ankle Joint Range of Motion 2. Overall physical strength 3. Exercise Capacity 4. Quality of life 8 TRIAL OUTCOME ASSESSMENT Trial outcomes will be recorded on a baseline measurement form developed by the supervising ex ercise technician. 8.1 Evaluation of Other Primary and Secondary Outcomes Remaining primary and secondary outcomes will be determined by the blinded trail assessor through data collected. 10 STATISTICAL APPROACH Graphical and numerical summaries will be provided for all resp onse variables of interest. For categorical variables, test of association will be performed to test for any associated between factors of interests. Chi squared test (using a significance level of 0.05) will be used if the underlying assumption relating t o the expected values are deemed appropriate, otherwise Fisher Exact Test will be employed. For binary variables, comparisons of proportion based on the Normal approximation of the Binomial distribution will be used as necessary. P -values will be reported for those comparisons of specific interest as opposed to comparing all levels of all variables. And post intervention scores will be compared. Baseline characteristics of the participants and physical activity levels will be compared from week one of the s tudy, to week 12 the completion of the study. Duration of the obtaining baseline data and final data will be measured. An ANVOA will be performed to analyse change over time. The outcomes will be found by using a paired t test. Mean baseline values will be computed from both duplex ultrasound screening and Biodex. Treatment effects will be estimated by an analysis variance (ANOVA)."

42,page_42,"43 PARTICIPANT INFORMED CONSENT Effect of Structured Exercise in Individuals with Chronic Venous Insufficiency Date : 26.10.2017 Introduction: You are invited to participate in our research study. This research study aims to examine if a special exercise programme, called “Strength from within” can improve calf muscle strength and function, overall physical strength , movements of the ankle joint and have a positive impact on quality of life. This study is being done as we know that improvement in calf muscle strength can improve the flow of blood in veins in patients with varicose veins. Therefore, we want to see if our exercise programme carried out at home can also benefit patients with varicose veins. During this study, you will complete a questionnaire regarding your quality of life (at the beginning and end of the study) and answer questions on symptoms you may have due to your varicose veins. Measurements will be taken of your calf muscle strength and function, overall physical strength and movements of the ankle joint by the study researcher. These measures will be taken again at the end of the study (week 12). If you have any further questio ns do not hesitate to ask. Procedure : You will be shown how to do the exercises by the study researcher and asked to carry this out 6 days a week at home at a time that suits you. Clear instructions and demonstration of the exercises will be given to you at the start of the study. Also, a programme of which exercises and how much you exercise will be provided to you according to your capabilities. You will also be given the exercise brochure called “Strength from within” which shows all exercises and how to do these. Finally, you will be asked to keep a record of your exercises during the study. The study researcher will contact you each week at a time that suits you to check on your week’s exercise plan and make adjustment for the next week. The study researcher will keep a record of your exercise pla n for each week. Benefits and Risks for participants: The findings of this study will be presented to the team of the healthcare professionals involved at the Galway Clinic and University Hos pital Galway. This research may help improve your calf muscl e strength and function, reduce symptoms of varicose veins, overall physical strength and have a positive impact on your quality of life. Other benefits your may have from doing exercises in this study are lower ing your risk of cardiovascular disease, stre ss reduction, possible weight loss , reduced cholesterol levels, reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and lowering of your blood pressure. The structured exercise programme does not exceed international recommendations and guidelines for adults by the American College of Sport’s Medicine. With any exercise, there is the possibility that abnormal responses could occur. While these risks are low for this type of exercise, they can include: unexpected changes in blood pressure, irregular heart rate, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle cramps, muscle soreness, or joint injury, and in rare cases, a cardiac event. Investigators will have evaluat ed you using"
43,page_43,"44 a pre -study health screening to ensure that you do not have a health condition where exercise is contraindicated. Risks will be minimize d through an exercise plan which contains a standard exercise protocol , with a warm -up and cool -down at the start and end of each exercise session carried out by you . Participants are instructed to stop the program if they are having any abnormal responses and contact the principal investigator. Compensation : No tangible compensation will be given. Confidentiality : Any information obtained during this study, which could identify you will be kept confidential. Information may be published in professional/scientific journals or at professional meetings, however your identity will be kept strictly confidential by a coded procedure. Right to Refuse or Withdrawal : I understand that it is my responsibility to notif y the researcher if I experience any abnormal responses during or following the program. I will do what I think is safe for myself and will not exceed these limits. I understand that I have the right to refuse to participate or withdraw from participation of this study at any time without penalty. I know I may change my mind about being in the study or withdraw from the study after it begins. If the study design or use of the data changes I will be informed and consent be revised.
