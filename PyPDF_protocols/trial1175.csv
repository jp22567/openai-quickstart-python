4,page_4,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 5 of 69 Statistical Methods Baseline demographic and clinical data will be described between treatment and placebo study arms as mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables and compared using Student’s T -test. Whereas discrete variables will be represented as a number and (%) and compared using the χ2 or Fisher’s exact test, as applicable. The time course of continuous variables will be presented using standard descriptive summary statistics calculated at each scheduled measuring time point and the last individual measuring time point. Moreover, standard descriptive summary statistics will be calculated for the change (absolute or percent) from baseline to each scheduled measuring time point after baseline and the last individual measuring time point. The primary endpoint of this study is the change in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure from baseline to end of treatment period (defined as average of pulmonary artery diastolic pressure measurements between weeks 8 -12). This will be analyzed using a repeated measures model incorporating a within -patient covariance structure to estimate the effect of treatment , and adjusted for diabetes status . A sample size of 28 patients for each group will achieve 80% power with α=0.05 to detect a 20% difference in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure between the emp agliflozin 10 mg and placebo groups averaged over four repeated measures (weeks 8 through 12) assuming the following: 1) between -patient standard deviation = 6; 2) Within patient correlation between adjacent time points: 0. 7; 3) PA diastolic pressure in the intervention arm of the trial will achieve a plateau by week 9 for the treatment group . Thus , the proposed sample size is 60 patients (30 per arm with 1:1 randomization ratio) . Of note, participation of patients with and without Type 2 diabetes is allo wed, but proportion of patients with diabetes may be capped at no more than 67% (40 patients) of the entire cohort. Statistical significance will be defined using two -sided tests with α=0.05, unless otherwise specified. All statistical analyses will be per formed by the Department of Biostatistics using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina)."

11,page_11,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 12 of 69 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background and Significance The prevalence of both heart failure and type 2 diabetes or prediabetes are reaching epidemic proportions globally and in the United States.1 In a post hoc analysis of PARAGIDM -HF - a contemporary clinical trial of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), even among patients who reported no known history of T2DM, 49% had prediabetes, and 21% had unrecognized T2DM based on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) criteria.2 In recent clinical trials, HF has emerged as the most common cardiovascular (CV) complication of T2DM, exceeding the incidence of myocardial infraction or stroke.3 In addition to being common, incident HF is also arguably the most morbid cardiovascular complication of T2DM, with survival of less than 25% over 5 years among older T2D patients.4 The intersection of T 2DM, prediabetes and HF is quickly becoming a public health crisis, and despite these alarming statistics, remarkably little is known on the optimal strategies of managing patients with prediabetes, T2DM and HF. To date, no single class of glucose -lowering medications has been specifically tested for safety in heart failure patients. Furthermore, several existing classes of glucose -lowering medications present potential safety issues, specifically in terms of volume overload and hospitalizations for heart f ailure. Foremost among these classes are thiazolidinediones (TZDs)5-7 and, possibly, dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP -4), according to results of the SAVOR and EXAMINE clinical trials.8,9 Other classes of glucose -lowering medications (insulin and sulfonylureas) may lead to weight gain and hypoglycemic events10, which potentially impact heart failure symptoms. As a result, evidence -based recommendations are currently unavailable for optimal type 2 diabetes or prediabetes management in patients with heart failure. Sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT -2i) appear to be the most promising therapy to date for patients with HF. While they produce relatively modest HbA1c reduction, SGLT -2i exhibit a novel, entirely insulin -independent mode of action throug h increased urinary excretion of glucose.11 SGLT -2i may represent a transformational treatment for patients with HF and T2DM, as they are the first class of glucose -lowering agents ever to demonstrate a robust benefit for reducing HF hospitalizaions.11-13 The EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial randomized 7,020 patients with T2DM and established CV disease to 10 or 25 mg of empagliflozin vs. placebo. After a median 3.1 years, significantly fewer patients in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group experienced t he primary outcome of MACE (10.5% vs. 12.1%), CV -related death (3.7% vs. 5.9%), or all -cause death (5.7% vs. 8.3%).13 There was no difference in outcomes between the10 and 25 mg doses of empagliflozin, with both dosage being statistically significantly sup erior to placebo for primary and secondary endpoints. 13 Though the trial was predominantly of diabetic patients with coronary artery disease (with only 10% of patients having known history of HF at baseline), the majority of the benefit appeared to be due to the highly significant reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure (a 35% relative risk reduction), and prevention of HF -related and arrhythmia -related deaths. The relative risk reduction in HHF was statistically similar between those with and with out a history of HF; however, since overwhelming majority of patients did not have HF at baseline, this appeared to represent primarily a HF prevention effect.14"
12,page_12,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 13 of 69 Supporting a class effect for SGLT -2i benefit on hospitalizations for HF, are similar results in the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS Program). The CANVAS Program was a combination of CANVAS, the original canagliflozin cardiovascular safety trial, which was used to gain FDA approval in 2013, and a separate CANVAS -R trial, which was combined with CANVAS for the purpose of demonstrating cardiovascular benefit. The CANVAS program enrolled a total of 10,142 patients with established CVD (65%) or at high risk of CV events (35%), randomized to canagliflozin (100 mg or 300 mg) or place bo.15 The primary outcome (nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, or CV -related death) occurred significantly less frequently with canagliflozin than with placebo (26.9 vs. 31.5 per 1000 patient -years).12 While the reduction in CV and all -cause death wi th canagliflozin vs. placebo did not reach statistically significance, patients in the pooled canagliflozin arm experienced a significant 33% relative risk reduction in HHF.12 Real world data from a large multi -national non -interventional study, which com bined data from well-established registries across 6 countries also supports the notion of a class benefit for SGLT -2i and HF outcomes. The CVD -REAL study analyzed over 300,000 T2DM patients and compared the HF outcomes in patients being newly initiated on SGLT -2is versus those being started on other glucose lowering medications. The main analysis (matched 1:1 using propensity score methodology), demonstrated a 39% relative risk reduction in HF hospitalizations associated with SGLT -2i use vs. other glucose -lowering drugs.16 These reductions were also observed for the outcome of total HF events, and were consistent in patients with and without established HF.17 While the excitement surrounding SGLT -2is as potential therapeutic class for the management of HF is warranted, many questions remain unanswered. It is unclear if the reduction in heart failure hospitalizations seen with SGLT -2is to date – which is primarily a signal for HF prevention, will also translate to a clinical benefit in patients with establis hed HF, including patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Also given that patients without diabetes (including those with prediabetes) would also be expected to have some degree of glucosuria with SGLT -2i treatment, and that the CV benefits of SGLT -2i appear to be unrelated to either baseline HbA1c or change in HbA1c, it is possible that the potentially beneficial effects of SGLT -2i on reducing HHF may translate to those without T2DM.18Additionally , the mechanism s of action (MOA) through which SGLT -2 inhibitors may produce a benefit on HF remain unclear, and need further clarification. While the change in hemodynamic status (reflected by pulmonary artery pressure s) is a critically important predictor of HF symptoms, HF hospitaliza tions and mortality19,20, no data currently exist in regards to the impact of SGLT2i on these parameters in patients with HF. One of t he key reason s for this lack of data is the inability (until now) to reliably and non -invasively monitor pulmonary artery pressure in patients with T2DM and HF. CardioMEMS (Figure 1), a wireless hemodynamic monitoring system, approved in both U.S. and Europe for management of patients with symptomatic HF, is the first means to obtain hemodynamics wirelessly21. CardioMEMS is d elivered through a catheter -based system and permanently implanted in the pulmonary artery. It is powered externally and has a pressure sensor (uses nanometer deflections) to provide continuous stream of hemodynamic data (Figure 2) through a wireless commu nication with a home receiver. The hemodynamic data is streamed to the physician through a secure database. Management using CardioMEMS hemodynamic data has been shown, in the CHAMPION trial22-24, to decrease hospitalizations for NYHA class III heart failu re patients compared to management based on clinical information without CardioMEMS. Based on its effectiveness in decreasing hospitalizations in HF"
13,page_13,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 14 of 69 patients and excellent safety profile, many patients have already had the CardioMEMS system implanted for H F management. Based on the existing epidemiologic data, and based on data from the CHAMPION trial, at least half of these HF patients likely have diabetes. This presents a unique and previously unavailable opportunity to better understand the impact of empagliflozin on the hemodynamic profile of patients (with or without T2DM ) and HF, and provide key mechanistic insights into the empagliflozin effects on prevention of HF hospitalization and reduction in CV mortality seen in EMPA -REG Outcomes study13. Given the known link between filling pressures and risk of HF hospitalizations, further investigation in this field has substantial mechanistic and clinical importance. Therefore, we propose to perform a pilot randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effects o f empagliflozin on filling pressures (pulmonary artery pressure s) in patients (with or without type 2 diabetes ) that have chronic heart failure. Figure 1: CardioMEMS device. Figure 2: Sample of CardioMEMS PA pressure continuous wave 1.2 Research Hyp othesis Treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg daily for 12 weeks will produce greater reductions in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure as compared with placebo in patients with chronic heart failure. 1.3 Rationale for conducting this study This is a Phase IV study that will present a unique and previously unavailable opportunity to better understand the impact of empagliflozin on the hemodynamic profile of patients with HF, and provide key mechanistic insights into the empagliflozin effects on prevention of HF ho spitalization and reduction in CV mortality seen in EMPA -REG Outcomes study ."
14,page_14,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 15 of 69 1.4 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment Empagliflozin is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , therefore patients enrolled in the study that have type 2 diabetes will have a n established indication for empagliflozin therapy. Although empagliflozin is currently not approved in patients without diabetes, when empagliflozin is used either as monotherapy or in addition to metformin, it does not cause excess hypoglycemia as compar ed with placebo. No additional safety issues (beyond those observed with empagliflozin in patients with Type 2 diabetes) are anticipated in patients without diabetes treated with empagliflozin . Of note, several large cardiovascular outcome trials are curre ntly evaluating various SGLT -2i as potential therapies for HF , and include patients with and without diabetes.25-27 Moreover, we will target patients with previously implanted CardioMEMs pulmonary artery pressure monitor for a clinical indication unrelated to the study, thus avoiding exposure of patients to an invasive procedure for the purpose s of the study. Accordingly, we consider the benefit/risk balance to patients enrolled in the study to be similar to that encountered in the usual clinical practice, with no additional ethical concerns. 1.4.1 Risk Category Considering empagliflozin ‘s mechanism of action, the previous clinical experien ce with empagliflozin , the study’s design featu res (includi ng the inclusion, exclusion, and discontinuation criteria), and the planned safety procedures, participation in this study presents a minimal and thus acce ptable risk to the individual patients that will be included. 1.4.2 Potential Risks The potential risks assoc iated with empagliflozin that have been identified based upon the mechanism of action, the preclinical results, and the clinical experien ce to date, as well as precau tions included in the Phase III program t o monitor and/or minimize these risks, are included in the empagliflozin prescribing information. 28 In the overal l pooled analysis in the phase III clinical studies, 17.3 % of patients discontinued the drug due to adverse events. In clinical Phase III studies, events suggestive of genital fungal infections were reported in higher proportion of empagliflozin -treated pa tients than the placebo group and this can be explained by increased urinary glucose . Overall there were no imbalances of liver function test paramet ers between em pagliflozin and placebo in Phase III studies. Due to the diuretic effect of empagliflozin , volume depletion (dehydration, hypovol emia and/or hypotension) is a potenti al concern. In the clinical program, from which subjects who in the judgment of inves tigator may be at risk of dehydr ation or volume depletion were e xcluded, very few serious events related to volume depletion were reported , and they were equal ly distributed between empagliflozin and placebo groups. In the EMPA -REG Trial – the largest large empagliflozin study to date - there was no difference in hypovolemia events between empaglifloz in and placebo. Of note, all patients in this stud y will have symptomatic heart failure and elevated pulmonary artery pressures at baseline, which will further minimize the risk of hypovolemic adverse events. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Dec 4th 2015 reported a warning for sodium -glucose cotransporter -2 (SGLT2) inhibitors which may lead to ketoacidosis , a serious condition where the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones that may require hospitalization. At the time of thi s report there were 73 cases of acidosis reported as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), ketoacidosis, or ketosis in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors , only 4 patients were on empagliflozin .29 DKA, a subset of ketoacidosis or ketosis in diabetic patients, is a type of acidosis that usually develops when insulin levels are too low or during prolonged fasting. DKA most commonly occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes and is usually accompanied by high blood sugar levels. The F DA reported cases were not"
15,page_15,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 16 of 69 typical for DKA because most of the patients had type 2 diabetes and their blood sugar levels, when reported, were only slightly increased compared to typical cases of DKA. Factors identified in some reports as having potentially triggered the ketoacidosis include d major illness, reduced food and fluid intake, and reduced insulin dose. The risk of euglycemic DKA is estimated to be very low in this study (given the small sample size , short duration of treatment , and the fact that patients without diabetes are likely not at risk for DKA ) and provided that EMPA -REG study showed no difference in DKA incidence between the Empagliflozin and the placebo arms, and a recent meta analysis of all SGLT -2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 DM, showed no significant increase in t he risk of DKA.29 Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution all patients will be provided with home urine ketone testing kits and patients will be monitored for symptoms of DKA during in -person visits and study -related phone calls . Patients will be ins tructed to self -test for urine ketones and directed to the closest emergency department if the urine ketone test is more than mildly positive. The instances of DKA (if any) will be closely monitored as AE of special interest by the study investigators, as well as the Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. In addition, all patients that have T2D in this study will continue taking glucose -lowering medications (other than open -label SGLT -2 inhibitors) as bac kground therapy . These drugs are wide ly used anti-hyperglycemic treatment s and will be prescribed according to the approved label. Moreover, the FDA also reported a warning for SGLT2 inhibitors that might lead to serious urinary tract infections. However in the Phase III clinical studies, and in t he more than 7000 patient EMPA -REG Outcome Trial,13 there was no difference in urinary tract infections overall - or complicated urinary tract infection s specifically - between empagliflozin and placebo, both occurring at low rate. The US FDA has issued a more recent safety alert in regards to SGLT2 -inihibtors and potential risk for acute kidney injury. However, in the large randomized EMPA -REG outcome trial, there was no difference in acute kidney injury between empagliflozin and placebo, and patients tre ated with empagliflozin experienced significantly better renal outcomes long term. Similarly, data from other SGLT -2 inhibitor trials have confirmed no difference in acute kidney injury, and the long term nephroprotective benefits of SGLT -2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 DM.30 We plan to monitor renal function carefully in the EMBRACE -HF study, and doubling of serum creatinine is a safety variable that is being carefully ascertained; fur thermore, all patients in EMBRACE -HF Trial are volume overloaded a t baseline given the requirement for significantly elevated PA diastolic pressure , and therefore should be at low risk for hypovolemic events. Additionally all patients will have invasive hemodynamic monitoring as a part of their routine clinical care, whi ch should decrease a possibility of significant volume depletion and acute kidney injury due to pre -renal etiology. The Independent Safety and Data Monitoring Committee will also be reviewing safety data continuously . Thus, the benefits and risks associate d with the background medication and comparator t reatment are well established and presented in their respective appro ved prescribi ng information. No stu dy procedure will put patients at a risk b eyond those ordinari ly encounte red during the performa nce of routine medical examinations or routine tests. 1.4.3 Protection against Risks This study has b een designed with appropria te measures in place so as to monitor and minim ize any of the potenti al health risks to participating patients. This i ncludes careful monitor ing of patient’s vital signs and laboratory values, and the temporary and if necessary permanent discontinuation of investigational product in individual patients in whom a potential health risk or a laboratory abnormality of clinical concern has been iden tified. Further, in order to ensure the s afety of all patients participating in this study, an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (IDSMC) will be formed that will continuously review safety data , including the incidence of serious adverse ev ents"
16,page_16,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 17 of 69 (SAEs), and conduct assessments to ensure the ongoing safety of study patients. The IDSMC responsibilities, authorities, and procedures will be documented in a n IDSMC charter. The personnel involved in the clinical study at will remain blinded to these analyses and will have no knowledge of the results presented to the IDSMC . 1.4.4 Benefit to Patients All patients will cont inue taking their active background thera py; although a direct benefit from randomiz ed treatment cannot be assu red as one half of patients will receive placebo, those with type 2 diabetes randomized to empagliflozin may obtain better glucose control. In this study, the dose of empagliflozin 10 mg once daily was chosen to provide efficacy in improving heart failure symptoms and biomarkers, while mitigating the potential for AEs, based on previous clinic al experience. In addition, among patients randomized to active drug, empagliflozin is expected to help maintain better glucose control (among those w ith type 2 diabetes ), decr ease bo dy weight (or p revent weight gain) as well as help lower blood press ure especial ly in patients with elevated baseline blood pressure. All patients are also expected to recei ve some benefit in the form of increased medical care/attention when participating in study procedures, which includes at least 5 clinic visits with at least 5 physical examinations and at least 4 phone call visits over the 13-week study. 1.4.5 Informed Consent and Alternatives to Patients All prospective participants will be informed of the possible risks and benefits associated with this study, and their consent will be received prior to performing any study-related activity. Wh en a prospective participant elects to not particip ate in the study or to withdraw from the stu dy, other medications are available to treat their heart failure , and the patient will not be disadvant aged in any way. 1.4.6 Conclusion Considering the pre -clinical and clinical experience with empagliflozin and the precautions included in the study prot ocol, participation in this study presents a minimal and th us acceptable risk to patien ts who meet the inclusion /exclusion criteria and consent to take part in the study. For additional details on benefits and risk, pl ease see the empagliflozin prescribin g information . 2 STUDY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of empagliflozin 10 mg daily , as compared with placebo, on hemodynamic parameters (pulmonary artery diastolic pressure) in patients with heart failure (HF) (reduced or preserved ejection fraction, isch emic or non -ischemic etiology) . 2.1 Primary Objective To compare the change in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure from baseline to end of treatment period (defined as average of pulmonary artery diastolic pressure measurements between weeks 8 -12) between empagliflozin and placebo . 2.1.1 Secondary Objectives 1.

24,page_24,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 25 of 69 For physicians : Since the primary endpoint of the study is the change in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, p hysicians will be encouraged to limit medication changes for the study patients. Changes of heart failure medicati ons (and specifically diuretics) should directed by the medical need s of the patients, and patients safety is priority, however, we will encourage using clinical judgment and avoiding frequen t medications changes during this 3- month study. The recommended algorithm for medication adjustments is outlined in Section 5.6.7 5.2 Patient enrollment and randomization The Principal Investigator or delegate will:  Obtain signed informed consent from the potential participants before any study specific procedures are pe rformed  Determine pa tient eligibility  Assign potential patients a sequential enrollment number in the form of Site ID and enrollment number i.e.: XXX-XX  Assign enrolled patient a unique randomization code using Sharp Clinical Interactive Voice and Web Resp onse Systems (IVR/IWR). If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then their enrol lment number cannot be reused. Patients can only be randomized into the study once. 5.3 Procedures for randomization Sharp Clinical Services will provide a state -of-the-art Clinical Interactive Voice and Web Response Systems (IVR/IWR).

There can be no exceptions to this rule."
25,page_25,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 26 of 69 The following steps should be taken in the event that a patient, who does not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, is found to have been inadvertently randomized in the study:  The investigator should inform the study team physician immediately. Ensuring patient safety must always be th e number one priority .  Study treatment must be discontinued in all cases where continued treatment is deemed to pose a safety risk to the patient. After a discussion between the study team physician and investigator, a decision may be reached that the pati ent should discontinue study medication. The rationale for discontinuing study medication must be clearly documented. The patient should remain in the study for follow -up in accordance with defined study procedures including follow -up on endpoints through the end of t he study consistent with the FAS principle .  In those cases where continuation of study therapy is judged not to present a concern related to safety and disease management, the rationale for continuing study therapy must be clearly documented. T he patient should continue follow -up in accordance with defined study procedures. 5.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding the study 5.5.1 Methods for ensuring blinding The treatment allocation in this study will be double blind. Empagliflozin (10 mg) tablets and matching empagliflozin placebo tablets will be provided , identical in appearance and with the same number , size, and packaging of tablets. Each bottle will be labe led with a unique bottle ID number that will be used to assign the treatment to the patient b ut will not indicate treatment allocation to the investigator. No member of the extended study team at , the CEC, or personnel at investigational centers will have access to the randomization scheme during the conduct of the study, with the exception of the Sharp Clinical Services , and the Biostatistics department at . The IDSMC will have access to the individual treatment codes and will be able to merge these with the collected study d ata while the study is o ngoing . The IDSMC will review safety data on a periodic basis, including the incidence of AEs, and conduct safety assessments to ensure the ongoing safety of study patients. The IDSMC responsibilities, authorities, and procedures wi ll be documented in a IDSMC charter. The personnel involved in the clinical study at will remain blinded to these analyses and will have no knowledge of the results presented to the IDSMC . 5.5.2 Methods for unblinding the st udy Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment allocation for each randomized patient, will be available to the investigator(s) or pharmacists from the Sharp Clinical IVR/IWR system . Routines for this will be described in the Sharp Clinical IVR/I WR system user manual that will be provided to each study site. The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment. The physician or delegate ) should be consulted whenever possible prior to the investigator breaking the blind.

The investigational product empagliflozin and matching placebo will be taken orally. The investi gational prod uct should be taken once daily in the morni ng and at appro ximate ly the same time of the day during the study period. Nevertheless prior to each office visit (except for the screening visit) , patients with established type 2 diabetes should be instructed not to take any glucose -lower ing medi cation in the morning and all patients should abstain from all food and bever ages for 6 hours; however, drinking water is allowed. On the day of an office visit, investigational product and other concomit ant medi cations will be taken in the morning, after completion of cer tain required study proced ures. 5.6.3 Drug Dispensing Scheme At randomization , three (3) bottle s of empagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo will be dispensed , with each bottle containing 30 tablets. 5.6.4 Duration of treatment The control group will receive placebo administered orally once daily for 12 weeks plus standard of care. The tr eatment group will receive empagliflozin 10 mg administered orally once daily for 12 weeks plus standard of care . Subjects will participate for a total of 13 weeks. 5.6.5 Labeling Labels will be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local regulatory guidelines. The labels will fulfill GMP Annex 13 and US FDA requirements for labeling. The label will include at least the following information:"

The study medication label and empagliflozin prescribing information , which will be provided to sites by the study Sponsor as part of the study start -up package, specify appropriate storage , which is additionally outlined in Appendix C. 5.6.7 Medication Adjustment Protocol Since the medications used to treat heart fail ure (including diuretics, afterload re duction medication, etc.) can affect pulmonary artery pressures (the study’s primary endpoint), we encourage the investigators to only make changes in medical treatment when absolutely necessary for patient safety . To demonstrate the true effect of empagli flozin on pulmonary artery pressure s, investigato rs are encouraged to adhere to the clinical pulmonary artery pressure monitoring protocol and medication adjustment protocol (detailed below) to avoid extreme variations in treatments across patients/investi gators and sites. This protocol is adapted from the CHAMPION trial protocol20 and clinical experience : Pulmonary artery clinical monitoring protocol: Patients randomized in the EMBRACE -HF Trial will have pulmonary artery measured twice daily for 2 weeks between screening and randomization visits (to establish a pre -randomization baseline), twice daily during the 12 week treatment period, and twice daily during week 12 and week 13 (immediately after treatment discont inuation). Investigators are directed to clinically evaluate pulmonary artery pressures no more frequently than twice a week following randomization; and use pulmonary artery diastolic pressure averaged over the previous 7 calendar days (~14 previous measu rements) to guide management; the only exception will be the first evaluation after random ization, which will use averaged pulmonary artery diastolic pressure over the previous 3 -4 days. These averaged pulmonary artery diastolic pressure measurements will be compared with the patient’s pre -randomization baseline (itself an averaged measurement over the 2 weeks between screening and randomization), and the difference between these measurements will be used to guide clinical decision making as follows:"
28,page_28,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 29 of 69 Hemo dynamic -Guided Care Strategy Optivolemic patient Patients with minimal HF congestive symptoms , minimal evidence of poor perfusion , and no significant change in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure from pre -randomization baseline (defined as no increase or decrease in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure of >6 mmHg for those with pre -randomization average PA diastolic pressure of <30 mmHg; for those with pre -randomization average PA diastolic pressure of ≥30 mmHg, no significant change in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure will be defined as no increase or decrease of ≥20% ). For patients who meet the above guidelines, investigators are directed to make no changes in medical therapy. Hypervolemic Patients were considered to be hypervolemic if the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure increases by >6 mmHg compared with pre-randomization baseline values (for those with pre -randomization baseline of <30 mmHg) or by ≥20% (for those with pre -randomization baseline of ≥30 mmHg) and/or if congestive symptoms are present. Hypervolemic Treatment Recommendations Investigators a re instructed to add or increase diuretic (and appropriate electrolyte replacement) by an increase or addition of a loop diuretic, change to another loop diuretic, add a thiazide diuretic (with caution), or institute IV doses of loop diuretic in the office setting. Serum electrolyte evaluation with change in baseline medication is required for safety and reassessment of pulmonary artery pressure by using the HF pressure measurement system at least every 2 -3 days until optivolemic status is restored. If diuretic strategies are not successful in restoring pressures to baseline, investigators are asked to add or increase nitrate therapy along with attempting to reeducate patients in salt intake and fluid restriction. If patients developed signs and symptoms of poor perfusion in addition to being hypervolemic the investigators are instructed to consider hospitalization if clinical evidence suggested need for IV diuretics, telemetry monitoring, or other IV therapeutic agents, such as inotropes. Investigators have the option to consider invasive hemodynamic monitoring for determination of cardiac output if indicated. Hypovolemic Patients are considered hypovolemic if pulmonary artery diastolic pressure decreases by > 6 mmHg compared with pre -randomization baselin e values (for those with pre -randomization baseline of <30 mmHg) or by ≥20% (for those with pre -randomization baseline of ≥30 mmHg) and/or those with evidence for poor perfusion in the absence of signs and symptoms of congestion. Hypovolemic Treatment Recommendat ions Patients with hypovolemia are treated by lowering or discontinuing diuretics or, if on a thiazide diuretic with loop diuretic, by lowering or discontinuing the dose of thiazide with adjustment of electrolyte"
29,page_29,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 30 of 69 replacements. The investigator should also consider liberalization of oral fluid restriction and salt restriction. If the patient has postural hypotension, vasodilator dosage is to be held or lowered, especially if hypotensive when sitting or supine. If the patient ha s worsening renal function, th e ACE/ARB dose should be held or lowered, especially if hypotensive while supine. If patients have signs and symptoms of poor perfusion in addition to being hypovolemic, the investigator should consider admission if clinical evidence suggests need for IV fluid repletion, telemetry monitoring, or the use of IV therapeutic agents. The investigator also has the option for invasive hemodynamic monitoring for determination of cardiac output if indicated. The detailed recommendations for hemodynamic -guided care strategy are outlined in the Figure below. Glucose -lowering medications adjustment protocol (only for patients with established T2D) : For patients with established T2D and HbA1c if ≤ 7.0% and receiving insulin at baseline, it is recommended to reduce total daily insulin dose by 20%. For patients with established T2D and HbA1c if ≤ 7.0% and receiving sulfonylurea at baseline, it is recommended to reduce total daily sulfonylurea dose by 50%, or discontinue sulfonylurea in patients receiving the minimal dose of sulfonylurea at baseline. 5.7 Concomitant and post -study treatments 5.7.1 Recording of concomitant medication Detailed recording of all concomitant medications will be made at screening, randomization , and all subsequent visits. It will include a ll medication changes , but glucose lowering (in patients with established T2D) and heart failure medications (including every change in diuretic regimen) in particular ."
30,page_30,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 31 of 69 5.8 Treatment Compliance The administration of study medication should be recorded . All stops re-start s of study medication prescribed by the investigator should be recorded. In addition, any non -prescribed temporary stops (>1 week) of study medication should be recorded. Missed doses of empagliflozin or placebo blinded study medication should not be taken . If a dose is missed the next regularly scheduled dose should be taken and should not be doubled. Patients are instructed to transmit CardioMEMs sensor readings twice a day per protocol. All missed opportunities to transmit data should be recorded and re viewed each phone and office visit. 5.8.1 Accountability The study medication provided for this study will be used only as directed in the study protocol. The study personnel will account for all study medication dispensed to and returned from the patient. Patie nts will be asked to bring all unused study medication and empty packages to the site at each office visit. The investigator or delegate will record the number of returned tablets and make an assessment regarding patient treatment compliance. Any patient f ound to be noncompliant would be counseled on the importance of taking their study medication as prescribed. Any study medication deliberately or accidentally destroyed must be recorded. Any discrepancy between dispensed and returned study medication shoul d be explained. The investigator will retain the returned medication until the termination of the Clinical Study. Then the investigator will return any unused medication to Sharp Clinical Services for destruction of all unused study medication. is responsible for confirming the investigator or delegate has recorded the quantities of returned and unused tablets at a patient level before medication is returned to Sharp Clinical Services . Patients who are transmitting Card ioMEMs sensor readings as instructed will be counseled on the importance of transmitting this information. 5.9 Discontinuations of study medication Patients should be discontinued from study medication in the following situations: 5.9.1 General discontinuation crite ria 1. Patient decision. The patient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment. 2. Adverse Events, i.e., any clinical AE, l aboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the investi gator, indicat es that continued participat ion in the study is not in the best interest of the patient. 3. Severe non-compliance to protocol as judged by the investi gator and/or . 4. Risk to patients as jud ged by the invest igator. 5. Incorrectly enro lled patients. 6. Patient lost to follow -up. 5.9.2 Study -specific discontinuation criteria  Doubling of serum creatinine above the baseline value confirmed by a repeated measure ment within one wee k.  Recurrent severe hypoglycemic events, defined as ≥2 severe events (a severe hypoglycemic event is defined as symptomatic event requiring external assistance due to severe impairment in consciousness or behavior with resolution of event with administration of glucose,"
31,page_31,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 32 of 69 glucagon or other corrective action and a capillary or plasma glucose value <54 mg/dL ). This definition should be appli ed after possible contributing factors (eg, excessive p hysical activi ty, dietary and medication factors ) have been excluded or addressed by the investigator.  Occurrence of diabetic ket oacidosis (DKA )  Pregnancy confirmed by a positive pregnancy test or otherwise verified. 5.9.3 Procedures for permanent discontinuation of a patient from study medication Patients permanently discontinuing study medication should be given conventional therapy, i f applicable, and should continue routine care visits with their primary physician . A patient that decides to discontinue study medication will always be asked about the reason(s) for their desire to discontinue study medication and the presence of AEs (if any). These data will be ascertained and documented by the investigator . AEs will be followed up and the patient should return all study medications. It is essential to collect as much data as possible for all patients throughout the study and especially all potential endpoint events. Discontinuation from study medication is not the same as complete withdrawal from the study (withdrawal of consent), which has a direct impact on the potential validity of all study data, and should be avoided wherever possi ble. 5.9.4 Patient agrees to undergo the Premature Treatment Discontinuation Visit and then continue in - person study visits The patient agrees to undergo the Premature Treatment Discontinuation Visit (PTDV) and then continue in -person study visits according to p lan. This is the preferred option and patients who discontinue study medication will always be asked if they agree to this approach. If agreed, as above, the patient will undergo their PTDV at the next scheduled office visit after the study medication is stopped. The patient will continue attending subsequent study visits according to schedule (Table 1 ). 5.9.5 Patient refuses to continue in -person study visits but agrees to undergo modified follow -up If the patient refuses to continue in -person study visits, but agrees to undergo modified follow -up, the in-person PTDV visit should be performed as soon as possible after the study medication is stopped. All subsequent visits until the end of study date will be done as modified follow -ups (eg, regular telephone cont acts, a contact at study closure, or other means) in order to ascertain whether any endpoints or safety events had occurred. Such a patient has not withdrawn his/her consent or withdrawn from the study. 5.9.6 Patient refuses any form of follow -up If the patient refuses any form of follow -up, he/she officially withdraws from the study and may also decide to withdraw consent. This decision must be documented . At the end of the study, vital status on all such patients will be collected from publicly available source s, in accordance with local regulations. 5.9.7 Restart of study medication Whenever possible, restart of randomized study medication should be encouraged, even if a PTDV was previously completed. 5.9.8 Study Closure Visit All randomized patients should return for thei r study closure visit (visit 8) as soon as possible, but no later than 1 week after the previously scheduled visit 7. If a patient is unable to attend the study closure visit in person, telephone contact should be made to ascertain endpoint and AE informat ion. At the study closure visit , physicians caring for the patient will decide which medication the patient should receive as part of his/her ongoing clinical care."
32,page_32,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 33 of 69 5.10 Withdrawal from study Patients are at any time free to withdraw from the study (i .e., disco ntinue study medication permanently and withdraw from visit assessments), without prejudice to further treatment (withdrawal of consent). Withdrawal of consent from the study must be ascertained and documented by the investigator . Such patients will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. The reason for permanent discontinuation of treatment with the study medication and the date of the last intake of the study medication must be documented . 5.10.1 Patients permanently discontinuing from study medication should be given conventional therapy, if applicable, and should always be asked to continue to attend protocol visits If the patient denies any additional protocol follow -up and officially withdraws consent from the study one of the alter natives a) to c) should be followed:  At the time of discontinuation of treatment and withdrawal of consent from continued assessment the patient should, if possible, undergo the PTDV. The patient should return all study medication  If the patient does not a gree to this option (which must be documented), a modified PTDV (eg, a telephone contact) should be arranged. The approach taken should be documented. The patient should return all study medication  If the patient does not agree to a) or b) this must be doc umented in the patient’s medical record. The patient should return all study medication. To ensure validity of study data, it is very important to collect as much data as possible throughout the study and especially vital status (dead or alive) at the SCV. The investigator or delegate will therefore attempt to collect information on all patients’ vital status from publicly available sources at the SCV, in accordance with local regulations, even if informed consent has been withdrawn completely. 5.11 Study commi ttees 5.11.1 Steering Committee A steering committee will be formed and composed of PIs from each participating site . A publication plan will be developed with input from this committee. 5.11.2 Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CEC) An independent CEC will be ap pointed and will adjudicate all heart failure hospitalizations. The committee members will not have access to individual treatment codes for any patient or clinical efficacy and safety event. The precise responsibilities and procedures applicable for the C EC will be detailed in a separate CEC charter. 5.11.3 Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee ( IDSMC) An independent DSMC will be appointed . The IDSMC will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of the patients in the study by assessing the safety of the intervention during the study, and for reviewing the overall conduct of the clinical study. The IDSMC will have access to the individual treatment codes and will be able to merge these with the collected study data while the study is ongoing."

The site Principal I nvestigator will ensure that data are r ecorded in the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) and will ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA). Data will be entered in the eCRF using the REDCap Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system by trained personnel at the study site. When data have been entered, reviewed, edited, and source data verification has been performed , as appropriate , by an representative, the data will be frozen to prevent further editing. The site Principal Investigator will be notified to sign the eCRF electronically . A copy of the eCRF data will be archived at the study site. 6.2 Data Collection at enrollment and follow -up TABLE 3 Laboratory variables Visit S 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Week -2 0 2d* 1 3 6 9 12 13 HbA1c X X X X Glucose ** X X X BNP X X X X NTproBNP X X X X Urine albumin creatinine Ratio X X X Urine Pregnancy Test X X X X CBC X X X Renal Panel *** X X X X X *days after randomization ** included in the renal panel *** the renal panel includes albumin, BUN/Creatinine Ratio (calculated), calcium, carbon dioxide, chloride, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (calculated), glucose, phosphate (as phosphorus), potassium, sodium, urea nitrogen"

Remind patients about importance to transmit CardioMEMs pressures twice a day. 6.4 Vital signs 6.4.1 Pulse and blood pressure One pulse measurement will be taken after the patient has been sitting and resting for at least 5 minut es and before blood samples are taken. The pulse measurement will be follow ed by three blood pressure (BP) measurements separated by at least 1 minute each. All three BP readi ngs should be recorded. At screening, the seated BP will be recorded three times in both the left and the right arms. All three measur ements should be made in one arm before transf erring the cuff to the oth er arm. The arm with the highest mean seated BP readings will be the one used for all subs equent readings. The average of the three BP readings will be used for study analyses. BP readi ngs should be taken while the patient is in a comfortable seated position with the arm supported at the level of the heart. All readin gs should be recorded. Ideally, blood pressure should be measured with the same machine, at the same time of day, and by the same personnel at each visit. 6.4.2 Orthostatic blood pressure At visits whe re orthostatic BP and pulse are collected, supine and standing measurements should be made after the seated BP and pulse measu rements have been made, using the same arm that was used for t he seated BP measurements. All readings should be recor ded. Ideally, blood pressure should be measured with the same machine, at the same time of d ay, and by the same personnel at each visit. 6.4.3 Supine BP and pulse The supine BP and pulse must be measured prior to the standing BP and pulse. After the p atient rests in the supine position for at least 5 minut es, supine BP and pulse will be determined from three replicate measu rements obtained at least 1 mi nute apart. All three read ings must be record ed. For s tudy analyses, the aver age of the three BP and pulse readings will be used. 6.4.4 Standing BP and pulse After the supine BP and pulse measurements are obt ained, the patient will stand for 2 to 3 minutes. After this time, the BP will be measu red with the arm supported at the level of the h eart. Standing BP and pulse will be determined from three replicate measurements obtained at least 1 minute apar t. All 3 read ings must be re corded. For stu dy analyses, the average of the three BP and pulse readings will be used. If a new occurrence of previous ly absent orthostatic hypotension is demonstrated, it should be recorded as AE. The investigator may consid er reducing concomitant anti- hypertensive medi cation to alleviate signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. 6.5 Six Minute Walk Test The 6MWT is a practical simple test that requires a 100 -ft hallway but no exercise equipment or advanced tra ining for technicians. Walking is an activity performed daily by all but the most severely impaired patients. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). It evaluates the glob al and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism. It does not provide specific infor mation on the function of each of the different organs and systems involved in"
38,page_38,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 39 of 69 exercise or the mechanism of exercise limitation, as is possible with maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The self -paced 6MWT assesses the submaximal level of functional c apacity. Most patients do not achieve maximal exercise capacity during the 6MWT; instead, they choose their own intensity of exercise and are allowed to stop and rest during the test. However, because most activities of daily living are performed at submax imal levels of exertion, the 6MWD may better reflect the functional exercise level for daily physical activities. 31 6.6 Collection of Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) The KCCQ (see appendix B) is a disease -specific health status instrument comp osed of 23 items that quantify the domains of physical limitation, symptoms, self -efficacy, social limitation, and quality of life limitation from heart failure. The overall summary score and all domains have been independently demonstrated to be valid, re liable, and responsive to clinical change. Scores range from 0 to 100. The KCCQ overall summary score, a small but clinically meaningful change is considered to be ≥ 5 points.32 The patients will fill in PRO ( KCCQ ) paper form under the supervision of the site staff. 6.7 Laboratory assessment s Blood and urine samples for dete rmination of clinical chemist ry, hematolo gy and urinalysis testing will be taken at the times indicated in the Study Plan (see Table 1). Any additional laboratory safety samples taken at the investigator ’s discretion will be analy zed locally. 7 BIOLOGICAL SAMPLING PROCEDURES 7.1 Volume of blood The total volume of blood that will be drawn from each patien t for this study is listed in Table 4 below. The collection of additional samples is performed locally at the discretion of the investigator and recorded in the eCRF as appropriate, thus requiring additional sample volumes.

The Investi gator should make an assessment of any clinical ly significant abno rmalities in the laborato ry reports. The labo ratory reports should be signed, dated and retained at the study site as s ource data for lab oratory variables. The clinical chemist ry, hematolo gy, and urinalysis samples w ill be disposed after analyses. 8 SAFETY 8.1 Definition of adverse events (AE) An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, including an exa cerbation of a pre-existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a pharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 8.2 Definitions of serious adverse event (SAE) A serio us adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately life - threatening, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, requires or prolongs patient hospitalisation, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect, or is t o be deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Patients may be hospitali zed for administrative or social reasons during the study (e.g. days on which infusion takes place, long distance from home to site,). These and other hospitali zations planned at the beginning of the study do not need to be reported as a SAE in case they have been reported at screening visit in the source data and have been performed as planned. 8.2.1 Classification of Death Deaths will be sub -classified by CV and non -CV primary cause. CV death includes sudden cardiac death, death due to acute MI, death due to heart failure, death due to a cerebrovascular event, death due to other CV causes (e .g., pulmonary embolism, aortic disease, CV intervention), and deaths for which there was no clearly documented non -CV cause (pre sumed CV death). Additionally, CV deaths will be sub -classified by coronary heart diseases death (CHD death) and non-CHD death. CHD death includes Sudden Cardiac Death, Death due to Acute MI, and the subset of Death due to other CV Causes that are secondar y to a coronary revascularization procedure. 8.2.2 Universal classification of Myocardial Infarction (MI) The Third Universal MI definition33 will be used as study specific MI criteria. 8.2.3 Definition of Stroke Stroke is defined as an acute episode of neurologic dys function attributed to a central nervous system vascular cause. Stroke should be documented by imaging (eg, CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan). Evidence obtained from autopsy can also confirm the diagnosis. Stroke will be sub classified, whe n possible, as either: 8.2.4 Primary ischemic stroke Primary ischemic stroke is defined as an acute episode of focal brain, spinal, or retinal dysfunction caused by an infarction of central nervous system tissue and documented by imaging. A primary ischemic stro ke may also undergo hemorrhagic transformation (i .e., no evidence of hemorrhage on an initial imaging study, but appearance on a subsequent scan)."
40,page_40,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 41 of 69 8.2.5 Primary hemorrhagic stroke Primary h emorrhagic stroke is defined as an acute episode of focal or global brain , spinal, or retinal dysfunction caused by non -traumatic intraparenchymal, intr aventricular, or subarachnoid hemorrhage as documented by neuroimaging or autopsy. Microh emorrhages (<10 mm) evident only on MRI are not considered to be a hemorrhagic stroke. S ubdural and epidural bleeding wi ll be considered intracranial h emorrhage, but not strokes. 8.2.6 Unclassified stroke Stroke with unknown etiology will be classified as unclassified stroke if the type of stroke could not be determined by imaging or other means. 8.2.7 Hospitalizations for heart failure In the event that a patient is hospitalized for heart failure over the course of the study, source documents will be obtained to adjudicate events . See appendix A for detailed information. 8.3 Definitions of adverse events of special interest (AESI) The term AESI relates to any specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on kn owledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the Pharmacovigilance Department of within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs. Patients with AESIs need to be followed up appropriately, regardless of the origin of the laboratory data (e.g. central, local etc.). The Investigator should consider which, if any, concomitant therapies should not be taken during evaluation. Discontinued treatments can be reintroduced per Investigator discretion. The follow ing are considered as AESIs: 8.3.1 Acute kidney injury (Decreased renal function) Defined by a creatinine value showing a ≥ 2 fold increase from baseline and is above the ULN , consistent with the RIFLE criteria for stage 2 acute kidney injury. For the AESI “ acute kidney injury ” the Investigator shall collect an unscheduled laboratory sample for creatinine as soon as possible and initiate follow -up laboratory tests of creatinine according to medical judgment . 8.3.2 Metabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis and d iabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) Postmarketing cases show an association between sodium -glucose cotransporter -2 (SGLT2) inhibitor use and the development of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis accompanied by elevation in urine or serum ketones , frequently in the setting of only mildly elevated glucose levels (euglycemic DKA) . Investigators are strongly encouraged to instruct p atients and caregivers about the signs and symptoms of keto acidosis, such as tachypnea or hyperventilation, anorexia, abdominal pain, nause a, vomiting, lethargy, or mental status changes ; evaluate for the presence of ketoacidosis in patients experiencing such signs or symptoms – using provided urine ketone testing kits; discontinue study medication and advice patients to go to the nearest eme rgency department"
41,page_41,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 42 of 69 if keto acidosis is confirmed; and take appropriate measures to correct the keto acidosis and to monitor glucose levels. Investigators are also strongly encouraged to avoid concomitant risk factors potentially predisposing to DKA, including carbohydrate -restricted diets and marked reductions in insulin dose during the study among patients with established type 2 diabetes and receiving insulin at baseline (above and beyond reductions in insulin dose specified in the study protocol for patient s with established type 2 diabetes) ). Advise patients to alert you and seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms consistent with DKA such as: nausea, vomit ing, abdominal pain, confusion, change in breathing pattern and unusual fatigue or sleepiness. In case of metabolic acidosis ketoacidosis and DKA, further investigations should be done according to the medical judgement and the clinical course until a diagnosis is made and/or the patient is recovered. DKA is defined by the diagnostic criteria in the table below, and as defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) .34 Investigators should note that not all criteria in the table below need to apply for the diagnosis of DKA, and clinical judgment should also be taken into considera tion. Due to its mechanism of action, empagliflozin may potentially modify the clinical presentation of DKA which may occur at lower plasma glucose levels than stated in the table below. Diagnostic criteria for DKA: DKA Mild Moderate Severe Plasma glu cose (mg/dL) >250 >250 >250 Arterial pH 7.25-7.30 7.00-7.24 <7.00 Serum bicarbonate (mEq/L) 15-18 10 to <15 <10 Urine ketones* Positive Positive Positive Serum ketones* Positive Positive Positive Effective serum osmolality (mOsm/kg)** Variable Variabl e Variable Anion gap*** >10 >12 >12 Alteration in sensoria or mental obtundation Alert Alert/drowsy Stupor/coma * Nitroprusside reaction method ** Calculation: 2[measured Na (mEq/L) + glucose (mg/dL)/18 *** Calculation: (Na+) – (Cl- + HCO3 -) (mEq/L) 8.3.3 Volume Depletion Empagliflozin has a modest diuretic effect. The risk of volume depletion is enhan ced when two diuretics are used in com bination and in patients that otherw ise are at risk for vo lume depletion. Ther efore, caution should be exercised when administeri ng to patients at risk for volume depletion due to co-existing conditions or concomitant medication s, such as loop diuretics. These patients should be carefully mon itored for volume status, electro lytes, and renal function, and encouraged to self -monitor weight during the study ."
42,page_42,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 43 of 69 8.3.4 Severe Hypoglycemia All severe hypoglycemic events, (defined as symptomatic event requiring external assistance due to severe impairment in consciousness or behavior with resolution of event with administration of glucose, glucagon or other corrective action and a capillary or plasma glucose value <54 mg/dL), must be documented and reported. 8.3.5 Non -Traumatic Lower limb Amputation There is no evidence to date that use of empagliflozin impacts the risk of non -traumatic lower limb amputations. This AESI is being collected for surveillance of non -traumatic lower limb amputation events across the current clinical trials of empagliflozin. 8.4 Recording of adverse events 8.4.1 Collection of Adverse Events AEs and SA Es (including hospitalizations for heart failure) will be recorded from Screening thro ughout the treatment period and includi ng the follow -up period (Visit 8). All AEs/SAEs are to be recorded by the site. SAEs, DAEs , AEs of Special Interest and non -seriou s AEs will be captured in the e -CRF. Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre -existing conditions will be recorded as an (S)AE in the e -CRF. Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results will be recorded as an ( S)AE in the e -CRF , if they are judged clinically relevant by the investigator. SAEs and AESI are defined in section 8. A drug adverse event (DAE) is an adverse event which leads to premature and permanent discontinuation of study medication. Information about all urgent outpatient heart failure visits will also be recorded by the site and captured in the e -CRF. 8.4.2 Follow-up of unreso lved Adverse Events Any AEs that are unreso lved at the patient’s last visit in the study are followed up by the investi gator for as lo ng as medical ly indicated. retains the right to request addition al information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessa ry. The requ irement to follow -up is not int ended to delay database lock or production of the clinical study report. Both these activiti es should proceed as plann ed with ongoing AEs if necessa ry. Any follow -up of ongoing AEs/ SAEs after database lock will be repor ted to , who will no tify the appropriate regulatory authorities of and study drug manufacturer. 8.4.3 Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE;  AE (verbatim)  Date when t he AE start ed and stopped  Maximum intensity  Whether the AE is serio us or not  Investigator causality rating against the Invest igational Product (yes or n o)"
43,page_43,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 44 of 69  Action taken with regard to investi gational product  Outcome In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:  Date AE m et criteria for serious AE  Date Invest igator became aware of serious AE  AE is serious due to  Date of hospitalization  Date of disc harge  Probable cause of death  Date of death  Autop sy performed  Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)  Causality assessment in relation to Other medication  Descr iption of AE The intensity of the AE should be judged based on the following :  Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom (s) which is/are easily tolerated  Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity  Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or p erform usual activiti es It is important to distin guish between serious and severe AEs. Severi ty is a measure of intensi ty. An AE of sev ere intensi ty need not necessarily be conside red serious. For example, nausea that persists for sev eral hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limit ed degree of disability may be conside red a mild stroke but would be a SAE. 8.4.4 Causal Relationship of Adverse Event The Investigator will assess causal relationship betw een Investigational Product and each Adverse Event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consi der that there is a reasonab le possibili ty that the event may have been caused by the invest igational product ?’ Medical judg ment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant h istory. Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms. Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product administered and the AE. No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product administered and the AE. For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other med ication and study proced ures. Note that for SAEs that could be assoc iated with any study procedu re the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’."
44,page_44,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 45 of 69 8.4.5 Adverse Events based on signs and sy mptoms All AEs spontaneous ly reported by the patient or reported in response to the open question from the study personne l: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?’, or revealed by observation will be collected. When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is prefe rred (when poss ible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not general ly part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.4.6 Adverse Events based on exa minations and tes ts The results from protocol mandated laboratory test and vital signs will be summarized in the clinical study report. Deterioration as com pared to baseline in protocol -mandated laborat ory values and vital signs will only be reported as AEs if they are clinically significant, fulfill any of the SAE criter ia or are the reason for disco ntinuation of treatment with the investigational product, or require the patient to receive specific corrective therapy. If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign/symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result /vital sign will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporti ng inv estigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia versus low h emoglobin value). In the absen ce of clinical signs or symptoms, clinical ly relevant deteriorations in non-mandated measu rements will be reported as AE( s). Any new or aggravated clinical ly relevant abno rmal medical findi ng at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be report ed as an AE. 8.5 Reporting of ser ious adverse events All AEs/ SAEs have to be reported to , whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product. The site investigator is responsible for informing the ir local IRB as per local requirements . Investig ators and other cent er personnel must inform appropriate representatives via the web based data capture (WBDC) system of any SAE that occurs in the course of the study within 1 day (i .e., immediately but no later than the end of the n ext business day) of when he or she becomes aware of it. Follow -up information on SAEs must also be reported by the Investigator within the same time frame. An automated email alert will be sent to the designated representative, when the page with SAE information is saved in WBDC system by the Investigators or other site personnel. If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel reports by fax an SAE to the appropriate repr esentative. A paper back - up SAE report is used for this purpose. The same reporting time frames still apply. The investigator is responsible for completing the eCRF as soon as the system becomes available again. The representative w ill work with the Investigator to compile all the necessary information and ensure that all the necessary information is provided to within one calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within five calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs."

Data will be entered in the WBDC system at the study site. Trained site staff will be responsible for entering data on the observations, tests and assessments specified in the protocol into t he WBDC system . Data entered in the WBDC system will be immediately saved to a central database and changes tracked to provide an audit trail. The data will then be source data verified, reviewed/queried and updated as needed. The Principal Investigator is responsible for electronically signing the eCRF. Data queries will be raised for inconsistent, improbable or missing data. All entries to the study database will be available in an audit trail. The data will be frozen and then locked to prevent further editing. When all data have been coded, validated, signed, and locked, a clean file will be declared. Any treatment revealing data may thereafter be added and the final database will be locked. A copy of the eCRF will be archived at the study site when the s tudy has been locked. 12 STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE DETE RMINATION 12.1 Description of analysis sets 12.1.1 Efficacy analysis set Intention to treat (ITT) is defined as a ll patients who have been randomized to study treatment , received at least one dose of study medication and completed at least one CardioMeMs transmission after randomization . The ITT data set will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and exploratory endpoints. 12.1.2 Safety analysis set All patients who receive d at least 1 dose of r andomized em pagliflozin or placebo, and for whom post -dose data are available, will be included in the safety analysis set. Throughout the safety results sections, erroneously treated patients (eg, those randomized to empagliflozin but actually given place bo) will be accounted for in the actual treatment group. If a patient received study drug from the wrong kit for only a part of the treatment duration and then switched to another, the associated actual treatment group for that patient will be the treatmen t group the patient had the longest exposure to. 12.2 Methods of statistical analyses Randomization will be stratified by diabetes statu s (diabetes vs. no -diabetes). All analyses will be on the ITT unless otherwise specified. Baseline demographic and clinical data will be described between treatment and placebo study arms as mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables and compared using Student’s T -test. Whereas discrete variables will be represented as a number and (%) and compared using the χ2 or Fisher’s exact test, as applicable ."
50,page_50,"EMBRACE -HF Protocol v2.0 Page 51 of 69 The time course of continuous variables will be presented using standard descriptive summary statistics calculated at each scheduled measuring time point and the last individual measuring time point. Moreover, sta ndard descriptive summary statistics will be calculated for the change (absolute or percent) from baseline to each scheduled measuring time point after baseline and the last individual measuring time point. Due to the large number of study sites and the e xpected low number of patients per site it will not be appropriate to explore site effects. Statistical si gnificance will be defined using two -sided tests with α=0.05 , unless otherwise specified . All statistical analyses will be performed by the Department of Biostatistics using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, Nor th Carolina). 12.2.1 Primary endpoint The primary endpoint of this study is the change in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure from baseline to end of treatment period (defined as average of pulmonary artery diastolic pressure measurements between weeks 8 -12). This will be analyzed using a repeated measures model incorporating a within -patient covariance structure to estimate the effect of treatment. Primary endpoint will be analyzed in the entire patient cohort, and then within the subgroups of patients with an d without diabetes (as pre -specified subgroup analyses). 12.2.2 Secondary endpoints The following secondary endpoints have been identified: 1.

Change in Hemoglobin A1c from baseline to follow -up (defined as average of measurements at 6 and 12 weeks) , evaluated separately in patient with and without type 2 diabetes Continuous variable comparisons will be analyzed using the same repeated measures method as the primary analyses. Treatment and time interaction will be included to model the effect patterns. T he mean change within each treatment group will be calculated with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for each time point . Dichotomous outcomes will be analyzed using logistic regression including a fixed effect for treatment; odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. Secondary endpoints will be analyzed in the entire patient cohort, and then within the subgroups of patients with and without diabetes (as pre -specified subgro up analyses). 12.2.3 Exploratory endpoints The following exploratory endpoints have been identified: 1. Change in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure between week 12 and week 13 2. Change in mean pulmonary artery pressure between week 12 and week 13 3.

All cause death 2. Cardiovascul ar death 3. Non -fatal myocardial infarction (MI) 4. Stroke 5. Acute kidney injury (defined as doubling of serum creatinine based on the RIFLE criteria) 6. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). AEs of special interest will include diabetic ketoacidosi s (DKA), volume depletion (defined as hypotension, syncope, orthostatic hypotension or dehydration) , severe hypoglycemic events , and non-traumatic lower limb amputations . Safety data will be summarized descriptively and presented by treatment group. 12.2.5 Analy sis for safety Safety analyses will be done periodically during the study and reported to the IDSMC.

Empagliflozin has been well tolerated at doses of up to 800 mg/day in single dose testing in healthy volunteers35 and up to 100 mg/day in repeat dose testing for 8 days in healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes36. If an overdose is suspected, monitoring of vital functions as well as treatment , as appropriate , should be performed. If an overdose occurrence meets the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event , then it must be reported as Serious Adverse Event . 13.3 Pregnancy Any pregnancy during the course of this study should be recorded . Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an Adverse Event unless there is a suspicion that the investigation al product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, the patient should be discontinued, the investigational product should be stopped and then investigators o r other site personnel must inform appropriate immediately but no later than the end of the next business day of when he or she becomes aware of it. 14 REFERENCES 1.

Heart failure hospitalizations should remain delineated from urgent visits. A Heart Failure Hospitalization is defined as an event that meets ALL of the following criteria:  The patient is admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of heart failure  The patient’s length -of-stay in hospital extends for at least 24 hours (or a ch ange in calendar date if the hospital admission and discharge times are unavailable)  The patient exhibits documented new or worsening symptoms due to heart failure on presentation, including at least ONE of the following: o Dyspnea (dyspnea with exertion, d yspnea at rest, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) o Decreased exercise tolerance o Fatigue o Other symptoms of worsened end -organ perfusion or volume overload  The patient has objective evidence of new or worsening heart failure , consisting of at least T WO physical examination findings OR one physical examination finding and at least ONE laboratory criterion), including: o Physical examination findings considered to be due to heart failure, including new or worsened:  Peripheral edema  Increasing abdominal d istention or ascites (in the absence of primary hepatic disease)  Pulmonary rales/crackles/crepitations  Increased jugular venous pressure and/or hepatojugular reflux  S3 gallop  Clinically significant or rapid weight gain thought to be related to fluid retent ion o Laboratory evidence of new or worsening heart failure , if obtained within 24 hours of presentation, including:  Increased B -type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/ N -terminal pro -BNP (NT - proBNP) concentrations consistent with decompensation of heart failure ( such as BNP > 500 pg/mL or NT -proBNP > 2,000 pg/mL). In patients with chronically elevated natriuretic peptides, a significant increase should be noted above baseline.  Radiological evidence of pulmonary congestion  Non -invasive or invasive diagnostic eviden ce of clinically significant elevated left - or right -sided ventricular filling pressure or low cardiac output. For example, echocardiographic criteria could include: E/e’ > 15 or D -dominant pulmonary venous inflow pattern, plethoric inferior vena cava with minimal collapse on inspiration OR"
