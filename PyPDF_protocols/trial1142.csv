Page 2 of 99 CONF IDENTIAL VV-RIM -00038275 -2.0 Approved - 23 Feb 2018 GMT -5:00 Amendment 3 AMENDMENT HISTORY The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the affected sections: Change Secti on Changed 1. Moved the following endpoint from other secondary to key sec ondary endpoints: Proportion of patients with improve ment (reducti on) of we ekly average of daily peak Prurit us NRS ≥3 from baseline to week 16 Rationale: The sp onsor will co nduct a p ost-hoc respo nder analysis to determine the relevant threshold for the adolescent p opulation. The sponsor believes that an improvement in Pruritus NRS by 3 points may be clinically relevant especially in a pediatric population; hence, this endpoint has been prespecified in the protocol. 2. Added the following endpoint to the list of other endpoints: Time to onset of effect on pruritus as measured by proportion of pa tients with improve ment (reduct ion) of we ekly average of daily peak Prurit us NRS ≥3 from basel ine during the 16-week treatment period Rationale: The sponsor believes that this endpoint is clinically relevant; hence, sh ould be prespecified in the protocol. 3. Made changes to the statistic al hierarc hy for multiplicity control. Rationale: The o rder of testing for certa in endpoints was re-arranged based on further internal revi ew and discuss ions. This was bas ed on revi ew of the pow er calculation assumptions and the p erceived clinical relev ance of t he endpoints. Synopsis, Se condary endpoints Secti on 8.2.2 Secondary Endp oints Section 9.5.2.3 Multiplicity Consideratio ns Table 3 Statistical Hierarc hy for Multiplicity Control Revision was made in Inclusion Criterion #8 for clarification purpose based on clarifica tion letter previously sent to investigators, regulatory authorities, ethic committees and independent review boards.

Page 3 of 99 CONF IDENTIAL VV-RIM -00038275 -2.0 Approved - 23 Feb 2018 GMT -5:00 Amendment 2 The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the affected sections: Change Secti on Changed Added an exclusion criterion #9 of “Treat ment with crisab orole within 2 wee ks prior to the baseline visit.” Crisaborole was recently approv ed in the US for the treatment of mild to moderate AD in patients 2 years and older. This exclusion criterion has been added to ensure that patients will be completely washed off this topical t herapy before baseline assess ments and to minimize any carr y-over effects into the treatment period. This will minimize any confounding of efficacy asses sment for the study drug. Section 4.2.2 Exclusion Criteria Revised exclusion criteria # 19: Creati ne phosphokinase (CPK) > 2.5× ULN to Creati ne phosphokinase (CPK) >5× ULN. The criterion f or temporary discontinuation of drug f or elevated CPK levels (section 5.4.2.2 of protoco l) has also been modified accordingly. Increases in CPK levels which are transient and n ot clinically si gnificant are well known after strenuous exercise, especially in adolesc ent patients. Moreover, based on data gathered from studies with dupilumab in adult patients and in pediatric patients (R668- AD-1412), th ere is no ev idence that dupilumab per se has any impact on CPK levels in blood. The drug is not expect ed to have such an effect based on its mechani sm of action. The sponsor believes t hat this should be the optimal threshold which w hile ens uring patient safety will n ot be o verly restricti ve and not negatively impact patient recruitment and retenti on during the study. This would ensure that pediatric patients are not unnec essarily deprived of a potentially use ful therapy for a disease with high unmet medical nee d. Secti on 4.2.2 Exclusion Criteria Secti on 5.4.2.2 Reas ons for Temporary Disco ntinuation of Stu dy Drug Corrected the expellable volume for 200 mg to 1.14 mL instead of 1.0 mL. Secti on 5.1 Investi gational and Refere nce Treat ments Clarified the text indicating where moisturizers should be applied by the deletion of the following text in the third sentence “on the area(s) of nonlesional sk in des igated for such assess ments” Section 5.2 Background Treatme nt Added the medicati on crisaborole to the list of prohibited agents because it is a treatment for atopic dermatitis and would interfere with the efficacy evaluation. Crisaborole has been a dded to the list of prohibited medications to pr event any confounding of efficacy assessment for the study drug. Section 5.7.1 Prohibited Me dications and Procedur es"

Page 4 of 99 CONF IDENTIAL VV-RIM -00038275 -2.0 Approved - 23 Feb 2018 GMT -5:00 Change Secti on Changed In original version of protocol, there were certain criter ion that were nee ded to be met bef ore patients could be o ffered roll-over into OLE at end of treatment per iod. Patients w ho did not meet these criteria w ould be followed up during the 12 week f ollow up period before t hey were allowed e ntry into OLE. In the amended vers ion, all patients would be offered ent ry into OLE at end of treat ment. The patients who decline OLE will be followed up for 12 wee ks. The primary purpose of the 12 week follow up period was to gather off-treatment efficacy and safety data in pediatric patients. However, this provision is now built in the OLE protocol as pa tients who have been exposed to drug for 52 weeks, and have ac hieved clinical resp onse will be taken off treatment and efficacy/safety will be observ ed in these patients. Moreover, seamless tra nsition into OLE will prevent pediatric patients from devel oping flar es of disease d uring the follow up period. Continuous treatment is also exp ected to minimize the development of ADAs due to treatment interru ption. Secti on 3.1 Study De scription and Duration Secti on 5.8 Continuation of Dupilumab Treat ment in an Open-Label Extens ion Study Added the pro vision: If baseline/day 1 visit occurs within 14 days of screening, hematology and se rum chemistry do not need to be repeated at the baseline/day 1 visit as long as these assess ments were perfor med at the screening visit. This would he lp minimize blood volu mes collected in this pediatric population. Section 6.1 Schedule of Ev ents, Table 1 Removed he matology and chemistry assess ments at we ek 2 and we ek 12. This has been done to minimize the volume of blood collected in a pediatric population. These assess ments would still be being conducted at screening, baseli ne, we ek 4, week 8, week 16, and end of study, which s hould be sufficie nt to allow detecti on of any cli nically si gnificant abnormality in these lab parameters within a reasonable time frame. Moreover, data from dupil umab studies in adult patients and the phase 2 study in pediatric patients (R668-AD-1412) does not suggest that dupilumab has an impact on any of the lab parameters being evaluat ed under serum hematology and chemistry. Section 6.1 Schedule of Ev ents, Table 1 Removed the Pain Assess ment with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from phone visit 16 for accuracy. Section 6.1 Schedule of Ev ents, Table 2 Corrected the text related to the The Total Nasal Sy mptoms Score (TNSS) to state “T he Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) will be used to assess the effect of study drug on symptoms of allergic rhinitis. The summed score will i nclude the following 5 4 nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestio n, nasal itc hing, and sneezin g, and difficulty in sleeping, each rated...” Secti on 6.2.2.9 – Total Nasal Symptom Score Added the Investigator’s Gl obal Assess ment (IGA) scale to the proto col. The scale was already included in the efficacy procedures and in the Study Manual and was added to Appendix 2 for further clarification. Secti on 6.2.2.11 Investi gator’s Global Assess ment"

This will all ow better c haracterizati on of adverse e vents during the study. Deleted the heading “Relati onship of AEs to Study Drug” since the section is also referr ing to relati onship to procedures. Secti on 7.3.2 Evaluation of Causality The list of AESIs has been revised ac ross the dupilumab program in AD and incorporates the data gathered fr om adult phase 3 studies, t he dupilumab risk profile, a nd reg ulatory feedback. This will e nable foc us of pharmacovigilance activities on identified and potential ris ks with this drug. Secti on 7.2.3 Other Events that Req uire Accelerated R eporting As per FDA r equest, added that The Mantel-Fleiss (MF) criteri on will be performed, and if it is not met while using the option C MH (MF) in SAS procedure P ROC PREQ, sensitivity ana lyses including each factor s eparately in CMH test will be conducted.

For continuous endpoints, added that the multiple imputation (MI) with a nalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used “as the primary anal ysis method.” Added the following text to clarify t he methodology: “Patie nts’ efficacy data throu gh week 16 after t he resc ue treatment use will be set to missi ng first, a nd then be imputed by the multiple imputation method. Missing data fr om the FAS will be imputed 40 times to generate 40 c omplete data sets by using the SAS procedure MI following the 2 steps below: Step 1: The monotone missing patte rn is i nduced by Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC) method in MI procedure us ing seed n umber 12345. Step 2: The missing data at su bsequent visits will be imputed using the regression method for the monotone patte rn with seed number 54321 and adjustment for cov ariates including treatment g roups, randomization strata (disease severity, weight group), and rel evant baseline. The week 16 data of each of the 40 co mplete datasets will be analyzed using an analysis of cov ariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, randomization strata ( disease severity, weight group), and relevant baseli ne included in the model, and the SAS MIANALYZE procedure will be used to generate valid statistical i nferences by combining res ults from the 40 analyses using Rubin’s formula.” Deleted the following text: “Missi ng data fr om the FAS w ill be imputed multiple times to generate a c omplete dataset at each imputation by using the MI Statistical Analysis Syst em (SAS) pro cedure. These complete datasets w ill be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment, randomization strata (baseline disease severity and we ight group) and relev ant ba seline included in the model, and the SAS MIANALYZE pr ocedure will be used to generate valid statistical i nferences by combining res ults from these multiple analyses using Rubin’s formula.” Secti on 9.5.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Analysis Synopsis (Statistical Pla n)"

Page 8 of 99 CONF IDENTIAL VV-RIM -00038275 -2.0 Approved - 23 Feb 2018 GMT -5:00 AMENDMENT 1 NOTE: This is the first version of the protocol that will be implemented. The objecti ves of amendment 1 are to: • Add a 200 mg every 2 week (Q2W) regi men (with a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1) to the Q2Wtreatment group. Patients below 60 kg will receive 200 mg Q2W, while patie nts ≥60 kg will recei ve 300 mg Q2W ( with a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1). This weight -adjusted dosing better fulfills the conv entional therapeutic objective to utilize the minimum effective dose. This tiered weight -based approach will reduce difference in exposure levels between patie nts with different body weights. In addition, it will allow assessment of a dose re gimen that involves injection of lower volume of drug product (1 mL). A lower volume injection may be better tolerated by pediatric patients. • Increase sample size from 180 patients to 240 patients. Assu mptions for power calculations in the original protocol were based on phase 2b trial in adults. Since then, results from Phase 3 trials in adults (SOLO) have beco me available in which a higher placebo response was seen. Accordingly, assumptions for power calculations were updated and an increase in sample size is required to keep the study adequately powered for the primary endpoint (Proportion of patients achieving IGA 0/1). Increasing the sample size will enable a more rigorous ass essment of the therape utic profile of dupilu mab in this patient population. • Change duration of treat ment period from 12 we eks to 16 weeks. The treatment duration was increased to enable detection of maximum therapeutic effect of dupilu mab and maximize the likelihood to detect a statistically significant difference versus placebo on the primary endpoint. The study design was originally informed by results from adult phase 2b trial (study R668 -AD-1021), which suggested efficacy of dupilu mab had plateaued at week 12 with no incre mental efficacy between week 12 and week 16. However, rece ntly availa ble results from phase 3 studies in adults showed an increase in efficacy for dupil umab treatment arms between week 12 and week 16. • Revise the fourth bullet point under inclusion criterion number 8 from ""… If docu mentation is inadequate, potential patients may be rescreened after such docu mentation is obtained (ie, patients are shown to fail a 28-day course of mid-to-higher potency TCS [±TCI])"" to ""… If docu mentation is inadequate, potential patients may be offered a course of treat ment with a daily regimen of TCS of medium or higher potency (±TCI as appropriate), applied for at least 28 days during the screening period, or for the maximum duration recom mended by the product prescribing information, whichever is shorter. Patients who de monstrate inadequate response during this period, as defined above, will be eligible for inclusion in the study, following appropriate washout"". The language in original protocol was ambiguous as it suggested that all patients were to be re-screened if they were offered a course of TCS to demonstrate inadequate response. However, there might be some patients who would be able to enroll into the study as part of the initial screening as"
8,page_8,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1526 Amendment 3 Regeneron Pharmaceutic als, Inc. Page 9 of 99 CONF IDENTIAL VV-RIM -00038275 -2.0 Approved - 23 Feb 2018 GMT -5:00 long as they are able to complete the course of TCS within the screening period of 35 days. The revised text serves to clarify this ambiguity. • Revise inclusion criterion number 11 from “Patient either alone or with the help of their parents/legal guardians, as appropriate, must be able to understand and complete study -related questionnaires” to “Able to understand and complete study -related questionnaires”. The objecti ve of making this change is to ensure that patient reported outco me questionnaires are completed by patients alone, as assistance from parents or caregivers might bias the interpretation and response to questions in the instru ment. • Revise exclusion criterion number 2 from “Treat ment with an investigational drug before the baseline visit” to “Treatment with a systemic investigational drug before the baseline visit”, and add another exclus ion criterion (criterion number 3) in this context: “Treat ment with a topical investigational drug within 4 weeks or within 5 half-lives (if known), whichever is longer, before the baseline visit”. The previous exclusion criterion was too restrictive and would have prevented patients who had received topical investigation al agents for AD, at any time prior to screening visit, from being enrolled in this study. The updated exclusion criterion enables such patie nts to be enrolled in this trial, conditio nal upon a 4-week or a period of 5-half- lives wash out for the topical investigation al agent. • Revise exclusion criterion number 4 (old criterion number 3 in the original protocol) from “Treat ment with TCS or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) within 1 week before the baseline visit (patients may be rescreened)” to “Treat ment with TCS or topic al calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) within 2 weeks before the baseline visit (patients may be rescreened)”. The duration of a washout period for TCS and TCIs has been increased to 2 weeks to ensure that patients are completely washed o ff these topical thera pies before baseli ne assess ments and to prevent any carry -over effects from these agents into the treatment period. • Revise exclusion criterion number 12 (old criterion number 11 from the original protocol) from “Active chron ic or acute infection requiring treatment with syste mic antibiotics, antivirals, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before the scree ning visit, or super ficial skin infectio ns within 1 week before the screening visit” to “Acti ve chronic or acute infection requi ring treatment with syste mic antibi otics, antivirals, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before the baseline visit”. The objective of this exclusion criterion in the original protocol was to prevent patients with active infections from recei ving the study drug and to allow a sufficient duration between the resolution of infection and first administration of study drug. Since first administrati on of study drug will take place at baseline and not scree ning, the baseline visit and not the screening visit is the relevant reference time point for the purpose of implementation of this criterion. Data from the phase 3 program in adults has shown that dupilu mab actually reduces the risk of superficial skin infections. Hence, the exclusion criter ion around superficial skin infections was re moved."

Page 10 of 99 CONF IDENTIAL VV-RIM -00038275 -2.0 Approved - 23 Feb 2018 GMT -5:00 • Change exclusion criterion number 18 (old criterion number 17 from the original protoc ol) to exclude patients with laboratory abnormalities at screening consiste nt with Common Terminology Criteria for Adver se Events (CTCAE) grade 2 and above. Changes were made to the exclusionary values for neutrophil count (previously <1000/µl, revised <1500/ µl), serum creatinine value (previously 2mg/dl, revised >1.5 ULN) and serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level (previouly >10 ULN, revised 2.5 ULN) at screening. The criteria for te mporary discontinuation of study drug due to laborat ory abnormalities were updat ed to be consistent with the exclu sion criteria. This change has been made to address a regulatory agency request to make the exclusion criterion around lab parameters more stringent. • Revise exclusion criterion number 22 (old criterion number 21 from the original protocol) from “History of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years before the screening visit” to “History of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years before the screening visit or evidence of such abuse as docu mented by a positive result in laboratory test of alcohol and/or drug panel condu cted at screening”. Excluding patients on basis of an objective lab test will be a more reliable way to assess ongoing alcohol or drug use. Also, added a clarifying note that patients who have a positive drug test due to a presc ription drug being used for medical reasons, will still be eligible for enroll ment into the study. • Revise the schedule of events:  Add a blood sample at week 4, visit 6 for assessment for anti -drug antibody (ADA) to Table 1. This change has been made based on a Health Authority request. It will allow further characterization of the immunogenicity of the study drug.  Add injection training/observation at week 12, visit 14 to Table 1  Add “Assess missed school days” assess ment to Table 1 and Table 2. This patient reported outco me allows evaluation of effect of study drug on school related productivity.  Add “Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)” assess ment to Table 1 and Table 2 and add footnote “k” to Table 1 and footnote “h” to Table 2 to state that “TNSS will be administered only to patients with medical history of allergic rhinitis throughout the screening period (at least 7 days before baseline/day 1) and only for 7 days preceding visit 6, visit 18 (EOT), and visit 21 (EOS).” This patient reported outco me allows evaluation of effect of study drug on sy mptoms of Aller gic Rhinitis, a commonly seen co-morbidity in patients with AD.  Add “Patient Assess ment of Injection Pain Using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)” assess ment to Table 1 and Table 2. This patient reported outco me enables evaluation of tolerability of dupilu mab injections in an adolescent population.  Add “Patie nt/parent(s) or caregiver paper diary training for dosing” to Table 1 and add “Review home ediary” to Table 1 and Table 2"

Data became available recently from a phase 1 study to examine the Effects of Dupilumab on the Pharmacokinetics of Selected Cytochro me P450 Substrates in Adult Patients with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis. The results of this study showed no evidence for a clinically meaningful effect of dupilu mab on the PK of a cocktail of prototypic substrates, indicating that blockade of IL4/13 signaling does not have a clinically relevant effect on the activity of CYP3A, CYP2C19, C YP2C9, CYP1A2 or CYP2D6, in adult patients with moderate to severe AD. • Revise the definition of “total number of patients with treatment-emergent ADA response in ADA assay” from “total number of patients with treatment-emergent ADA response in ADA assay – defined as either a positive response in ADA assay postbaseline when baseline results are negative, or any postbaseline positive response in ADA assay with a titer ≥4-fold over the baseline titer level.” to “total patients with treatment-emergent response – defined as a positive response in the ADA assay post first dose when baseline results are negati ve or missing”.

To be determined Obje ctives The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab as a monotherapy in patients ≥12 years to <18 years of age with moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis (A D). The seconda ry objective of the study is to assess t he safe ty of dupilumab as a monotherapy in patients ≥12 years to <18 years of age with moderate -to-severe AD. Study Design This is a randomized, dou ble-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group s tudy to investigate the efficacy and safety of dupilu mab monoth erapy in pediatric patients with moderate -to-severe AD. T he study population will i nclude patients ≥12 years to < 18 yea rs of age with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease cann ot be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical t reatment is medically i nadvis able (eg, intolerance, o ther important s ide effects or s afety risks). Approximately 2 40 study patients are planned to be randomized to 1 of t he following treatme nt groups: • Dupilumab every 2 we eks (Q2W) treatment group: 200 mg Q2W (patients <60 kg) or 300 mg Q2W (patients ≥60 kg) • Dupilumab every 4 we eks (Q4W) treat ment gr oup: 300 mg Q4W, irrespective of weig ht • Placebo group The study will c onsist of t he foll owing 3 periods: scree ning of up to 5 wee ks, treatment per iod of 16 we eks, and follow-up of 12 we eks. After the parents or legal guardians /patients provide informed consent and informed assent (as a ppropriate), the patients will be assessed for s tudy eligi bility at the screening visit. During the screening period, syste mic and topical treatments for AD will be washed out, as ap plicable, acc ording to the eligibility requirements. Patie nts may be rescree ned once if t hey fail t he scree ning evaluation for reaso ns related to incidental tra nsitory co nditions, unless t he reason f or the screen failure is related to faili ng the disease severity i nclusion criteria.

Additional power calc ulation based on the key seco ndary endpoint “proportion of patients with improve ment (reducti on) of P ruritus NRS ≥4 from baseline to week 16”, with 80 patie nts per gro up, the study will provide: • 97% power at a 0.05 level to detect a difference of 27% in the percentages of patients achieving Pruritus NRS reducti on ≥4 at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 38% and 11% for dupil umab Q2W and placebo, respect ively. • 95% power at a 0.05 level to detect a difference of 25% in the percentages of patients achieving weekly av erage of daily peak Pruritus NRS reducti on ≥4 at week 16, as suming that the percent ages are 36% and 11% for dupilumab Q4W and placebo, respectiv ely. Effica cy Analysis Sets: The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients. Efficacy analyses will be based on the treat ment allocated at randomization (as ra ndomized). The per protocol set (PPS) includes all patients in the FAS except for those who are excluded because of major efficac y-related proto col violations. A major protocol violation is one that may affect t he interpretati on of stu dy results. Analysis Methods: Primary Efficacy Analyses The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by r andomization strata (baseli ne disease sev erity and weig ht group) will be used for analyzi ng the percentage of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 or perc entage of patients with EASI -75 at week 16. All efficacy data, regardless of the patient being on the study trea tment or discontinues the stu dy treat ment but remains in the study, will be used for analysis. S pecifically, if a patient stays in the study until the end of the study planned plac ebo-controlled treat ment period, all efficacy data collected up to the study planned end of treat ment visit will be included in the primary a nalysis, regardless if the patient is on treatment or no t. To ac count for the impact of rescue t reatment on the efficacy effect: For the primary effica cy endpoints (which are binary efficacy endpoints), if res cue treatment is used, the patient will be classif ied as a nonresponder from the time the resc ue is used. If a patient withdraws fr om study, this patient will be counted as a nonresponder"

The Ma ntel-Fleiss (MF) criterion will be perfor med, and if it is not met while using the option CMH (MF) in SAS pr ocedure P ROC PREQ, se nsitivity analyses including each fact or separate ly in CMH test will be conducted. Sensiti vity analysis us ing the last observati on carried forward (LOCF) approach to determine patient’s status at week 16 will be co nducted to assess t he rob ustness of the primary efficacy analysis with reg ards to handling of missing data. The efficacy data will be set to missing after rescue treat ment is used, th en the LOCF method will be used to deter mine pati ents’ s tatus at week 16. In addition, the CMH method adjust ed by randomization strata will also be performed on all obs erved data regardless if rescue treatment is used. A patient with missing data will be cou nted as a non-responder. Other sensitivity analyses may be conducted. Second ary Efficacy Analyses For b inary endpo ints, the secondary eff icacy analysis will use the same approach as that used for t he primary analysis. For continuous endpoints: • The multiple imputation (MI) wi th analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used for analysis. Missing data from the FAS will be imputed 40 times to generate a complete dataset at each imputation by using the MI Statistical Analysis System (SAS) procedure. T hese co mplete datasets will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment, randomization strata ( baseline disease severity and weight group) and relevant b aseline included in the model, and the SAS MIANALYZE pr ocedu re will be used to generate valid statistical i nferences by combining res ults from these multiple analyses using Rubin’s formula. • To ac count for the impact of rescue treatment on the efficacy effect: If a patient receives rescue treat ment, the effica cy data collect ed after rescue treatment is initiated will be treated as missing. • In addition to the MI method descr ibed above, s ensitivity analyses such as ANCOVA model with LOCF, MI method with ANCOVA model on all observed data regardless of resc ue use will be co nducted. Additional details on these sensiti vity analyses will be provided in the statist ical analysis plan (SAP). Multiplicity Consideration A hierarc hical procedure for multiplicity adjustment will be used to control the overall Ty pe-1 error rate at 0.05 for the primary end point and the secon dary endpoints across t he 2 dupilumab dose regimens vs placeb o. Each hypothesis will be formally te sted only if the preceding one is sign ificant at the 2-sided 0.05 signific ance level."

INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 1.1. Introduction Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as ato pic eczema, is a pruritic skin condition characterized by a chronic, relapsing form of skin inflammation, a disturbance of the epider mal-barrier function associated with immune changes in the skin, and a high prevalence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated sensitization to food and environ mental allergens (Bieber 2008 ). Atopic dermatitis is the most common inflam matory skin disease in childhood (Illi 2004). The disease usually presents during early infancy and childhood, but it can persist into or start in adulthood (Kay 1994 ). The disease affects 15% to 30% of children and 2% to 10% of adults in industrialized countries (Bieber 2008). Phase 1 of the International Study of Asth ma and Allergies in Childhood showed a 1-year period prevalence rate as high as 20% in Australia, England, and Scandinavia (Williams 1999 ). Often, AD constitutes the first step of the “atopic march” (progression from one atopic disease to another). Up to 60% of AD patients have conco mitant asthma, allergic rhinitis, or food allergy (Hong 2012 ). The clinical pattern of AD varies with age. Infants typically present with erythe matous papules and vesicles on the cheeks, forehead, or scalp, which are exudative and intensely pruritic. The childhood phase typically occurs from 2 years of age to puberty. Children are less likely to have the exudative lesions of infancy, and instead exhibit more lichenified papules and plaques representing the more chronic disease involving the hands, feet, wrists, ankles, and antecubital and popliteal regions. The adult phase of AD begins at puberty and frequently continues into adulthood. Predominant areas of involve ment include the flexural folds, the face and neck, the upper arms and back, and the dorsa of the hands, feet, fingers, and toes. The eruption is characterized by dry, scaling erythe matous papules and plaques, and the formation of large lichenified plaques from lesional chronicity. The disease has been shown to have a marked impact on the quality of life (QOL) of patients, greater than that seen in other common skin disorders like psoriasis and acne (Lewis -Jones 1995 ). Often severe, pruritus is a universal finding in AD and often results in sleep disruption, irritability, and generalized stress for both the affected patients as well as family members (Kim 2012 ). In addition to causing disco mfort, sleep loss, and psychosocial challenges, AD can impose major financial burdens on families for direct medical care, household accom modations, and missed work ( Su 1997, Verboom 2002, Williams 2005). Atopic dermatitis is caused by a complex interaction of genetics, defects in skin barrier function, environ mental exposure, and immunologic respo nses. Type 2 helper T cell (Th2) mediated immune response is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD. The skin lesions of AD are characterized by increased expression of proinflammation Th2 cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, and by skin infiltration of Th2 cells. The elevated IgE responses and eosinophilia observed in the majority of patie nts with AD reflects an increased expression of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 (Leung 1999 ). Type 2 helper T cell-associated cytokines regul ate importa nt barri er-related functions, such as epid ermal cornific ation and production of antimicrobial proteins. These cytokines inhibit the production of major terminal diffe rentiation"
33,page_33,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1526 Amendment 3 Regeneron Pharmaceutic als, Inc. Page 34 of 99 CONF IDENTIAL VV-RIM -00038275 -2.0 Approved - 23 Feb 2018 GMT -5:00 proteins, such as loricrin, filaggrin, involucrin, and the antimicrobial proteins human beta defensin 2 and 3, which in turn, is associated with development of AD ( Howell 2007, Guttman-Yassky 2011a, Guttman-Yassky 2011b ). The Th2 cytokines also act on keratinocytes and induce production of che mokines, includ ing chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (also known as thy mus and activation -regulated chemokine [TARC]), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 26 (also known as eotaxin -3), which are chemo-attractants for Th2 cells and eosinophils; thus, perpet uating the inflammatory respo nse. Since activation of IL -4 and IL-13 signaling precedes the release of proinflam matory mediators, antagonism of these cytoki nes has the potential to reduce the Th2 response and provide therapeutic benefit. There is currently a high unmet medical need for a safe and effective therapy for AD in children. Nonphar macological manage ment of AD, which includes environ mental control measures (eg, avoidance of antigen and skin irritants) and skin care measures (eg, maintaining the hydration of the skin through the use of emollients) play a supportive role, especially in children with moderate -to-severe disease. Pharmacolog ical manage ment of AD in children is mainly limited to topical therapy with topical corticosteroids (TCS) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs). Topical corticosteroids reduce inflam mation and pruritus, and are useful in controlling acute flares. However, long -term use of TCS in children is not recom mended because of the risk of irreversible skin atrophy, dyspigmentation, acneiform eruptions, and risks associated with syste mic absorption (eg, growth retardation, hypothala mic pituitary axis effects, etc). Topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are also used in AD m any times as an altern ative to or in combination with TCS. However, the use of TCI is frequently associated with skin irritation. Further more, a possible increased risk of malignancy (lymphoma and skin cancers) has been noted for TCIs (refer to products’ US prescribing infor mation). To date, the only syste mic agents approved for the treatment of AD in children are systemic corticosteroids. Other systemic agents are used o ff label (cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil) and lack robust e vidence for the basis of u se. All of these syste mic agents have significant side effects, including stunted growth, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis (corticosteroid s), myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity (methotrexate), nephrotoxicity and hypertension (cyclosporine), and gastrointestinal disturbances and leucopenia (azathioprine). Moreover, a high proportion of patients in which disease is initially controlled by sy stemic agents suffer from relapse soon after therapy is discontinued (Granlund 1995, Sch mitt 2009). As a biologic product that selec tively targets the Th2 inflam matory pathway, dupilu mab is being developed to provide a safe and efficacious alternative treatment for AD patie nts, including children. Dupilu mab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit (IL-4Rα), a component of IL -4 receptors Type I and Type II, as well as the IL-13 Type II receptor syste m. The binding of dupilu mab to IL-4Rα results in the blockade of both IL-4 and IL-13 signal transducti on. Because up-regulation of IL -4 and IL-13 has been implicated as an important inflammatory component of AD disea se progression, dupilumab may be an efficacious alternative AD treat ment. Dupilu mab, given subcutaneously (SC), is currently in clinical trials for multi ple indications, including treatment of moderate -to-severe AD in patients intolerant of, or not adequately controlled with, topical treatments. As of 30 S eptember 2016, 7408 subjects have been enrolled"
34,page_34,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1526 Amendment 3 Regeneron Pharmaceutic als, Inc. Page 35 of 99 CONF IDENTIAL VV-RIM -00038275 -2.0 Approved - 23 Feb 2018 GMT -5:00 into the dupilu mab develop ment program (completed and ongoing studies). This includes 222 healthy volunteers, 4182 patients with AD, 2909 patients with asthma, 60 patients with nasal polyps, and 35 patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. In completed or unblinded studies, 3927 subjects have received dupilu mab: 202 healthy volunteers, 2853 patients with AD, 842 patie nts with asthma, and 30 patients with nasal polyps. Taking into account the number of patients exposed to dupilu mab in blinded studie s, the total number of patients exposed to dupilu mab is over 5000. Further, 1 clinical study with dupilu mab in the pediatric population has been completed at the time of this proto col develop ment; a phase 2a study (R668 -AD-1412) investigating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and exploratory efficacy of dupilu mab in patients aged ≥6 to <18 years with AD. A total of 78 pediatric patients were exposed to dupilu mab at doses of either 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg (single dose, weight dependent), followed by 4 weekly doses of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg (weight -dependent, once a week [QW] regimen). The safety data from this completed study is summarized in section 1.2.3 . An open -label extension study to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of dupilu mab in patie nts aged ≥6 to<18 years with AD (R668 -AD-1434) is currently ongoing. There is a paucity of clinical studies comparing adults and children, with respe ct to the cellul ar and molecular mechanis ms of disease in AD. B ased on si milar clinical presentation and response to treatment, it has been postul ated that these mechanis ms are similar in adults and children. On this basis, some AD medications (eg, pimecrolimus) were granted regulatory approval in adults even though the pivotal clinical trials were largely conducted in pediatric patients. It is expected that the pharmacological activity of dupilu mab will be similar in children and adults. Nonclinical repeat -dose toxicity studies and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have shown a lack of any general or reproductive toxicology and postnatal effects observed with anti - IL-4Rα surrogate antibodies in cyno molgus monkeys and mice. These nonclinical data, together with the clinical safety profile of dupilu mab to date, support the evaluation of dupilu mab in pediatric patients. Additional background information on the study drug and develop ment program can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.2. Rationale 1.2.1. Rationale for Study Design This study is part of the pedia tric clinical develop ment plan for dupilu mab in AD. The primary purpose of the study is to provide data on the use of dupilu mab monotherapy to support registration and labeling for the use of dupilu mab in adolescents with moderate -to-severe AD. The 16-week treatment duration is the same duration as in 2 of the adult pivotal trials (R668 -AD-1416 and R668 -AD-1334). This duration has been chosen because the maximum thera peutic effect for dupilu mab is expected to be achieved by this time. Moreover, the selected dupilu mab dose regi mens will have achieved steady-state concentration before the end of this period. Based on PK s imulations, in the absence of a loading dose, the time to steady -state is expected to be 12 weeks for 300 mg every 2 weeks (Q2 W), and 4 weeks for 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4 W). The use of a loading dose in this study will reduce the time to steady -state for the Q2W regimen, as has been observed in adults, enabling steady -state to be essentially"

Page 36 of 99 CONF IDENTIAL VV-RIM -00038275 -2.0 Approved - 23 Feb 2018 GMT -5:00 achieved after 3 doses. The 12 week follow -up period is based on the expected PK of dupilu mab after the last dose, ie, the time for serum concent rations to decline to nondetectable levels (below the lower limit of quanti fication) in most patie nts. The co-primary endpoints chosen in the study (proportion of patients achieving Investigator’s Global Assess ment [IGA] 0 or 1 and proportion of patients with ≥75% reduction in Ecze ma Area and Severity Index [EASI] from baseline [EASI -75] at week 16) are similar to those used in the adult pivotal studies (R668 -AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416). These endpoints are both investigator -assessed outco me measures of obje ctive AD signs, which are broadly validated in drug develop ment for this indication. Based on pri or discussions with health authorities for the pivotal adult AD studies (R668-AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416), it is expected that different health authorities will request different primary endpoints for this study (Food and Drug Administration [FDA] is expected to request IGA 0/1 as the pri mary endpoint while EMA is expected to request both EASI -75 and IGA 0 /1 as co -primary endpoints). Ecze ma Area and Severity Index has been validated in the pediatric population, including in patients aged 12 to 17 years old in a prior study (Barbier 2004 ). 1.2.2. Rationale for Dose Selection The dose ju stification for adolescent pediatric patients aged ≥12 to <18 years is based on the observed efficacy and safety in the dose r anging study in adult AD patie nts (R668 -AD-1021), the observed efficacy and safety in the phase 3 monotherapy studies in adult AD patients (R668 -AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416), the obser ved PK data, efficacy, and safety results in a pediatric AD study of patients ≥6 to <18 years old (R668 -AD-1412), and the modeling perfor med on the PK data obtained from this pediatric study. The adult dose-ranging study evaluated dupilu mab dose regi mens of 300 mg QW, 300 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q4W, 200 mg Q2W, and 100 mg Q4W versus placebo, administered for 16 weeks. All 5 dose regi mens were efficacious. Efficacy data suggested a dose-respo nse pattern for most efficacy outco me measures, includi ng EASI, IGA, and pruritus scores, for which the corresponding endpoints at week 16 were generally aligned in the same rank order as the total monthly dose and the mean concentrations of functional dupilu mab at week 16. Thus, the 300 mg QW regi men was consistently the most efficacious dose regi men in this study across multiple endpoints, followed closely by the 300 mg Q2W dose regi men. Differences in the efficacy and safety outcomes between the 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W were relati vely small. The 200 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q4W doses also showed good efficacy responses but were numerically inferior to the 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW regimens for the majority of efficacy endpoints. The efficacy of the 100 mg Q4W regimen (100 mg total monthly dose) a ppeared to be sub-optimal. The dose regi mens of 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W provided the most consistent clinical benefit and both had an acceptable safety profile. However, 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W dosing did not show clear differentiation in EASI and IGA changes from baseline in study R668 -AD-1021. More recently, the lack of cle ar differentiation between 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W dosing was further confir med in 2 pivotal studies (R668 -AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416) in adults based on EASI and IGA data. As PK modeling for dupilumab has shown weight to be the most important covar iate influencing exposure, the use of the 300 mg QW regimen in adolescents with low body weight may lead to syste mic exposure greater than"
36,page_36,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1526 Amendment 3 Regeneron Pharmaceutic als, Inc. Page 37 of 99 CONF IDENTIAL VV-RIM -00038275 -2.0 Approved - 23 Feb 2018 GMT -5:00 the maximum exposure that has been tested in adults. Therefore, 300 mg QW is not considered appropriate for adolescents. With the 300 mg Q2W regimen in adolescents ≥60 kg, the simulated exposure in adolescents substantially overlaps with the range of exposu re in individual patients in studies R668-AD-1021 (300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW) and DRI12544 (300 mg Q2W), where no significant safety risk was ide ntified. Hence, the proposed 300 mg Q2W dosing regimen for adolescent patients weighing ≥60 kg is expected to have a significant clinical bene fit with an appropriate safety profile. A similar exposure response to dupilumab treatment is anticipated between adolescent and adult AD patients, supporting dose selection by matching PK exposure with adults, for a clinical efficacy study in adolesce nt patients. Data from R668 -AD-1021 also showed that a dose regimen of 200 mg Q2W was significantly superi or to placebo on key efficacy endpoints. The use of 200 mg Q2W is expected to provide mean expo sure in adolescents <60 kg si milar to that with 300 mg Q2W in adolescents ≥60 kg supporting the use of this regimen in the lower weight cohort. Moreover, the 200 mg dose can be delivered using a 1 mL volume of injection. Since volume of injection has been shown to be an important factor impacting the tolerability of SC inje ctions (Heise 2014 ), a 200 mg injection is expected to be less painful than a 300 mg injection. This might impact compliance and ultimately the therapeutic profile of the drug, especially in a pediatric popu lation. Also, a 1 mL autoinjector device has already been commercialized for other monoclonal anitbodies. Study R668 -AD-1021 demonstrated that efficacy for the 300 mg Q4W regimen was statistically superior to placebo and numerically similar to the 300 mg Q2W and 200 mg Q2W dose regimens. Pharmacokinetic simulation has shown that although this dose regi men is expected to provide lower exposure to the other 2 dupilu mab dose regimens being studied, it should still have sufficient exposure to provide signi ficant clinical bene fit in adolescents. Data gathered from this dose regi men will also enable further PK modeling to better characterize exposure response relationship in pediatric patien ts. A less frequent dosing regimen is expected to enhance compliance, especially in a pediatric population. In study R668 -AD-1412, weekly doses of up to 4 mg/kg SC were shown to be generally well tolerated in pediatric patients aged 6 to17 years old. The exposure for all proposed doses in the current study is expected to be lower in most patients than what was seen with use of repeated weekly doses of 4 mg/kg in the previous study. An advantage of fixed weight -based dosing compared to variable weig ht-based dosing is to allow self-administration using a prefilled syringe. The administration of the loading dose of dupil umab will allow syste mic concentrations to reach steady -state faster, and potentially reduce the time to onset of cli nical effect. 1.2.3. Safety Considerations The safety profile of dupilu mab is not expected to be different between adults and adolescents. Data gathered from the completed R668 -AD-1412 study support this view. R668 -AD-1412 was a phase 2a study to evaluate the PK and safety of dupilu mab in patients aged ≥6 years to <18 years, with moderate -to-severe AD. Dupilu mab administered as single and repeated weekly doses of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg for 4 weeks was gener ally well tolerated in both pediatric age groups included in this study.

Si milarly, there was a higher incidence of TEAEs after administration of repeated weekly doses of 4 mg/kg in both age-groups. Howev er, most of the AEs were mild in intensity, transient in nature, and not related to study drug. There were no new safety signals detected with dupilu mab in this pediatric population. The most common AEs reported after both single doses and repeated weekly doses were Nasopharyngitis and Exacerbation of AD. Standard safety monitoring used in previous trials with dupilu mab is planned to be conducted during this study. An IDMC overseeing the entire dupilu mab clinical development will be in place for the duration of the study to monitor the safety of the patie nts and to provi de the sponsor with appropriate recom mendations in due time to ensure the safety of the patie nts. 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1. Primary Objective The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilu mab as a monotherapy in patients ≥12 years to <18 years of age with moderate -to-severe AD. 2.2. Secondary Object ive The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety of dupilu mab as a monotherapy in patie nts ≥12 years to <18 years of age with moderate -to-severe AD. 3. STUDY DESIGN 3.1. Study Description and Duration This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, parallel -group study to investigate the efficacy and safety of dupilu mab monotherapy in pediatric patients with moderate -to-severe AD. The study population will include patients ≥12 years to <18 years of age with moderate -to-severe AD whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment is medically inadvisa ble (eg, intoleran ce, other important side effects or safety risks). Approxi mately 240 study patients are planned to be rando mized to 1 of the following treatment groups: • Dupilu mab Q2W treatment group: 200 mg Q2W for pati ents <60 kg or 300 mg Q2W for patie nts ≥60 kg • Dupilu mab Q4W treatment group: 300 mg Q4W, irrespective of weight • Placebo group The study will consi st of the followi ng 3 period s: screening of up to 5 weeks, treat ment period of 16 weeks, and follow -up of 12 we eks (Figure 1). After the parents or legal guardian s/patients provide informed consent and infor med assent (as appropriat e), the patients will be assessed for stu dy eligibility at the screening visit. During the scree ning period, systemic and topical treatments for AD will be washed out, as ap plicable,"

Patie nts may be rescreened once if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory conditions, unless the reason for the screen failure is related to failing the disease severity inclusion criteria. Patie nts will be required to apply moisturizers twice daily for at least 7 days before rando mization and continue throughout the study. However, to allow adequate assess ment of skin dryness, moisturizers should not be applied on the area(s) of nonlesional skin designated for such assess ments for at least 8 hours before each clinic visit. Patie nts who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will under go day 1/baseline assess ments and will be rando mized in a 1:1:1 ratio stratified by baseline weight group (<60 kg and ≥60kg; each weight stratum will enroll approximately 120 patie nts) and baseline disease severity (moderate [IGA=3] vs. severe [IGA=4] AD) as follows: • Dupilu mab Q2W treatment group: Patie nts with baseline weight <60 kg will receive Q2W SC injections of 200 mg dupilu mab following a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1. Patients with baseline weight ≥60 kg will receive Q2W SC injections of 300 mg dupilu mab following a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1. • Dupilu mab Q4W treatment group: Patie nts will receive Q4W SC injections of 300 mg dupilu mab following a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1. • Placebo treatment group: Patients will receive placebo matching dupilu mab Q2W (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose). In order to maintain blinding for the study, patie nts in the <60 kg weight stratum will receive, in a 1:1 ratio, either placebo matching 200 mg dupilu mab (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose) or placebo matching 300 mg dupilu mab (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose). In the ≥60 kg weight stratu m, the patients rando mized to the placebo group will receive placebo matching 300 mg dupilu mab (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose). In order to maintain blinding, all patients will receive an injection Q2W from day 1 to week 14. Patie nts will receive placebo injection at the weeks dupilu mab is not given. During the treatment period, patients will have weekly in-clinic visits through week 4, and then in-clinic visits every 4 weeks through week 16 with weekly telephone visits in between the in-clinic visits. Patients and/or parents/caregivers (as dee med appropriate based on age of patient) will be trained on inje cting study drug during in-clinic visit 2 (day 1) to visit 6 (week 4). During weeks in which no in -clinic visit is scheduled, patients will either self-inject study drug or the parent/caregiver will administer study drug to the patie nt. In ca se patients do not want to self-inject and the parent/caregi ver do not want to administer study drug to patient, patients may have the clinic staff administer all the study drug injections in the clinic. Safety, laboratory, and clinical assessments will be perfor med at specified clinic visits, as noted in Table 1. The end of treatment period visit will occur at week 16, two weeks after the last dose of study drug. The co-primary endpoints will be asses sed at this visit. If patients prematurely discontinue study treatment, the patients will be encouraged to stay in the study to have data collected at all remaining scheduled visits until completion of the planned end of study visit."

Patie nt is female of childbearing potential* and sexually active, who is unwilling to use adequate methods of contraception** throughout the duration of the study and for 120 days after the last dose of study drug * For the purpose of this study, any female who h as had her first menstrual period (menarche) and is sexually active will be considered to be of childbearing potential. Female patients who are not of childbearing potential at the start of the study but have the onset of menarche during the course of the study and are sexually active will also have to follow adequate birth control methods to continue participation in the study. ** Adequate methods of contraception include: female sterilization (with docu mented hysterecto my, bilateral oophorecto my or bilateral tubal ligation), hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, or condom + diaphrag m***, or single male partner with docu mented vasecto my. Additional require ments for acceptable contraception may apply in certain countrie s, based on local regulations. Investigators in these countries will be notified accordin gly in a Protocol Clarification Letter***. *** The study may enroll patients from sites in the UK. Double barrier methods (eg, condom + diaphrag m) would not be considered adequate methods of contrace ption for patients enrolled in the UK for the purpose of this study. 4.3. Premature Withdra wal from the Study A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without repercussion. The parent/caregiver has the right to withdraw permission to have the patient participate in the study at any time, for any reason, and without repercussion. The investigator and sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study in the event of an intercurrent illness, AE, treatment failure, protocol violation, cure, and for ad ministrative, or other reasons. An excessive rate of withd rawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided. Patie nts who withdraw prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study assessments per section 6.1. 4.4. Replacement of Patients Patients prematurely discontinued from the study or study treatment will not be replaced. 5. STUDY TREAT MENTS 5.1. Investigational and Reference Treatments Dupilu mab 175 mg/mL: Each 1.14 mL single -use, prefilled glass syringe with snap-off cap delivers 200 mg of study drug (1.14 mL of a 175 mg/mL solution). Dupilu mab 150 mg/mL: Each 2.25 mL single -use, prefilled glass syrin ge with snap-off cap delivers 300 mg of study drug (2.0 mL of a 150 mg /mL solution)"

Patie nts will be rando mized to recei ve 1 of the following treatment regimens: • Dupilu mab Q2W treatment:  Patients <60 kg in baseline body weight: SC injections of dupilu mab, 400 mg loading dose on day 1, then 200 mg Q2W from week 2 to week 14, or  Patie nts ≥60 kg in baseline body weight: SC injections of dupilu mab, 600 mg loading dose on day 1, then 300 mg Q2W from week 2 to week 14 • Dupilu mab Q4W treatment: SC injections of dupilu mab, 600 mg loading dose on day 1, then 300 mg Q4W from week 4 to week 12; in order to maintain the blind, there will be an SC injection of plac ebo in between dupilu mab doses during the week 2 to week 14 dosi ng period so the injection frequency will match the other 2 groups. • Placebo: SC injections of placebo matching dupilu mab Q2W (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose). In order to maintain blinding for the study, patients in the <60 kg weight stratum who are rando mized to the placebo group will receive, in a 1:1 ratio, either placebo matching 200 mg dupilu mab (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose) or placebo matching 300 mg dupilu mab (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose). In the ≥60 kg weight stratu m, the patients rando mized to the placebo group will receive placebo matching 300 mg dupilu mab. In order to maintain blinding, all patients will receive an injection Q2W from day 1 to week 14. Patie nts will receive placebo injection at the weeks dupilu mab is not given. Study drug will be administered per the sched uled descri bed in section 6.1. Subcutaneous injection sites of the study drug should be alternated among the different quadrants of the abdo men (avoiding navel and waist areas), upper thighs, and upper arms so that the same site is not injected for 2 con secutive weeks. To allow for adequate assess ment of pos sible injection site reactions, study drug should be administered only into areas of no rmal-looking skin. Instructions for recording and reporting injection site reactions will be provided in the study reference manual. Patients will have the option to administer study drug (or have a caregiver administer study drug) outside the study site during weeks in which no in-clinic visit is scheduled. The study staff will train the patient/care giver on preparation and administration of study drug on day 1 and will administer the first of the 2 injections required for the loading dose. The patie nt/caregiver will administer the second injection required for the loading dose under the supervision of the clinic staff. The patient/caregiver will administer study drug under the supervision of the clinic staff at visits 4 and 6 (weeks 2 and 4, respectively) and at other in-clinic visits. Patients will be monitored at the study site for a minimum of 30 minutes after the first 3 doses of study drug (visits 2 [day 1], 4 [week 2], and 6 [week 4]); vital signs (sitting blood pressure, heart rate, and respirat ory rate) and AE assess ments will be done at 30 minutes (±10 minutes) post dose.

Patients (or caregivers) who prefer to have the clinic staff administer study drug may choose to have injections administered in the clinic. 5.2. Background Treatment All patients are required to apply moisturizers (emollients) at least twice daily for at least the 7 consecutive days im mediately before rando mization. After rando mization, patients are required to continue to apply moisturizers throughout the study (all 28 weeks where applicable). However, to allow adeq uate assessment of skin dryness, moisturizers should not be applied for at least 8 hours before each clinic visit. All types of moisturizers are permitted, but patie nts may not initiate treatment with prescri ption moistu rizers or moisturizers containing additives during the screening period or during the study. Patients may continue using stable doses of such moisturizers if initiated before the screening visit. 5.3. Resc ue Treatment If medically necessary (ie, to control intolera ble AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD may be provided to study patients at the discretion of the investigator. If possible, investigators are encouraged to consi der rescue initially with topical treatment (eg, medium/high potency TCS) and to escalate to syste mic medications only for patients who do not respond adequately after at least 7 days of topical treatment. Topical calci neurin inhibitors may be used for rescue, alone or in combination with TCS, but the use of TCIs should be reserved for problem areas only (eg, face, neck, intertri ginous and genital areas, etc.). Investigat ors may also consider rescue with crisab orole. Rescue treatment for these topical therapies should be used as per prescribing information and local guidelines. Patients may continue study treatment if rescue consists of topic al medicatio ns. Patients who receive syste mic corticosteroids or syste mic nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs (eg, cyclos porine, methotrexate, mycophenolate -mofetil, azathiopri ne, etc) as rescue medication during the study will be discontinued permanently from the study drug. All patients will be asked to complete the scheduled study visits and assess ments whether or not they complete study treatment and whether or not they receive rescue treatment for AD. Inv estigators should make every attempt to conduct efficacy and safety assessments (eg, disease severity scores, safety laboratory tests) immediately before administering any rescue treatment. An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose, if necessary. For t he purpose of efficacy analysis, patients who receive rescue treatment during the study will be considered treatment failures. 5.4. Dose Modification and Study Drug Discontinuation Rules 5.4.1. Dose Modification Dose modification for an indiv idual patient is not allowed."

Study Drug Discontinuation Patients who per manently discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw from the study will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule. Patients who opt to withdraw from the study will be asked to complete study assess ments, per section 6.1. 5.4.2.1. Reasons for Permanent Disco ntinuation of Study Drug Study drug dosing will be permanently discontinued in the event of: • Anaphylactic reaction or other severe syste mic reaction to study drug • Repeated (2 or more during the course of the study) severe injection site reactio ns that are deemed to be immune mediated* * This is based on investigator’s assess ment. A consultation with the medical monitor can be sought to deter mine the exact etiology of an injection site reaction. • Diagnosis of a malignancy during study • Evidence of pregnancy • Any infection that is opportunistic, such as active tuberculosis and other infections whose nature or course may suggest an immuno -compromised status • Severe laboratory abnormalities:  Neutrophil count ≤0.5× 103/μL  Platelet count ≤50× 103/μL  ALT and/or AST values greater than 3× ULN with total bilirubin >2× ULN (unless ele vated bilirub in is related to confir med Gilbert’s Syndro me)  Confi rmed AST and/or ALT >5× ULN (for more than 2 weeks) NOTE: If the laboratory abnor mality is consi dered causally related to study drug, stu dy treatment will be permanently discontinued. In cases in which a causal relations hip to study drug can be reasonably excluded, (ie, an alternative cause is evident), study treatment will be discontinued but it may be resumed when the laboratory abnor mality is sufficiently normalized. A decision to resume study treatment will be made jointly by the investigator and medical monitor (medical monitor’s written approval is required). • Treat ment with any prohibited conco mitant medication or procedure (section 5.7.1 ) NOTE: The use of TCS, TCI and crisaborole is prohibited during the study. However, these drugs may be us ed as rescue. In that ca se, the study drug will be continued."

Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug Study drug dosing may be temporari ly discontinued in the event of: •Clinic ally important laboratory abnormalities, such as: ALT or AST 3× ULN  Neutrophil count <1.5× 103/µL but >0.5× 103/µL Platelet count ≤100× 103/µL but >50× 103/µL CPK >5× ULN Serum creatinine >1.5× ULN • Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery • An infection that requires parenteral treatment with antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, or antiprotozoal agents, or requires oral treatment with such agents for longer than 2 weeks After the condition leading to suspension of dosing normalizes sufficiently, study treatment may resume at the discretion of the principal investigator in consultation with the medical monitor. A decision to discontinue study drug and/or to reinstitute study treatment should be discussed with the medical monitor. The investigator may suspend study treatment at any time, even without consultation with the medical monitor, if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action and if this is deter mined to be in the patie nt’s best interest. However, the medical monitor should be contacted as soon as possible in any case of study drug discontinu ation. Resu mption of study treatment after temporary disconti nuation should always be discussed with the medical monitor. 5.5. Method of Treatment Assignment Approxi mately 240 patients will be randomized by weight group (<60 kg or ≥60 kg [with approxi mately 120 patients to each weight group]) and by baseline disease severity (moderate [IGA=3] vs. severe [IGA=4] AD) to 1 of the following treatment groups according to a central rando mization scheme provided by an interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee): • Dupilu mab Q2W treatment group s: Patie nts whose baseline weight <60 kg will receive Q2W SC injections of 200 mg dupilumab following a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1. Patients whose baseline weight ≥60 kg will recei ve Q2W SC injectio ns of 300 mg dupilu mab following a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1. • Dupilu mab Q4W treatment group: Patients will receive Q4W SC injections of 300 mg dupilumab following a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1. • Placebo treatment group: Patients will receive placebo matching dupilu mab Q2W (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose). In the <60 kg weight stratu m, since the dose level (ie, 300 mg or 200 mg) won’t be blinded, in order to maintain blinding for the study, the patients in the <60 kg weight stratum who are rando mized to the placebo group will recei ve, in a 1:1 ratio, either placebo matching 200 mg dupilu mab (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose) or placebo matching 300 mg dupilu mab (including"

In t he ≥60 kg weight stratu m, the patients rando mized to the placebo group will recei ve placebo matching 300 mg dupilu mab. 5.5.1. Blinding With the exception of the IDMC members and the provisions in section 5.5.2 , this study will remain blinded to all individuals until the prespecified unblinding to conduct the primary analyses. Blinded study drug kits coded with a medication numbering system will be used. In o rder to maintain the blind, lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to individ uals involved in study conduct. To maintain the blind, all patients will recei ve Q2W injections of dupilu mab or placebo starting at day 1. During weeks in which dupilu mab is not administer ed in the Q4W dosing regimen, patients will receive placebo. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) and drug concentration results will not be communicated to the sites, and the sponsor’s op erational team will not have access to results associated with patient identi fication until after the final database lock. 5.5.2. Emergency Unblinding Unblinding of treat ment assign ment for a patient may be necessary due to a medical emergency, an SAE that is unexpected and for which a causal relationship to the study drug cannot be ruled out, or any other significant medical event (eg, pregnancy). • If unblinding is required:  Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.  Only the affected patient will be unblinded.  The IVRS/I WRS will provide the treatment assignment to the investigat or.  The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee immediately that the patient has been unblinded. 5.6. Treatment Logisti cs and Accountability 5.6.1. Packaging, Labeling, and Storage A medicati on numbering system will be used in labeling blinded investigational study drug. Lists linking medication numbers with product lot numbers will be maintained by the groups (or companies) responsible for study drug packaging. In order to maintain the blind, these lists will not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct. Study drug will be stored at the site ; storage instructi ons will be provided in the pharmacy manual. 5.6.2.

This includes basic skin care (cleansing and bathing, inclu ding bleach baths), emollients (required as background treatment), topical anest hetics, antihistamines, and topical and systemic anti-infective medications for any duration. Medications used to treat chronic disease such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma are also permitted; if there is any question regarding whether a conc omitant medication may be used during the study, the study site should contact the medical monitor. 5.8. Continuation of Dupilumab Treatme nt in an Open -Label Extension Study Patie nts who co mplete the treatment period (week 16) will be offered an opportunity to screen for the open -label extension (OLE) at end of treat ment visit. These patients should complete the end-of-treatment [EOT] visit (as per Table 2) before screeni ng for the OLE. Patients who discontinued prematurely (ie patients who did not complete the protocol -defined end-of- treatment [EOT] visit) cannot screen for the OLE study before the date when the EOT visit (week 16) would have normally occurred. Patie nts who decline to participate in the OLE study will have a 12-week follow -up period. NOTE: Patients who turned 18 years of age during this study will not be eligible to enroll into the pediatric open -label extension study (R668 -AD-1434). In case the drug is not commercially available for patients aged ≥18 ye ars at the time the patient completes this study, these patients may be eligible for, and might have the opportunity to, enroll into the adult open -label extension study (R668 -AD-1225), if the study is still ongoing."

Procedures Performed only at the Screening/Baseline Visit The following procedures will be perfor med for the sole purpose of deter mining study eligibility or characterizing the baseline population: medical history and demographics. 6.2.2. Efficacy Procedures A variety of para meters will be collected during the study to assess efficacy/effective ness of dupilu mab, including measures of AD severity, use of conco mitant treatment for AD, and patient -reported measures of AD sympto ms and QOL. Questionnaires and patient -repor ted assess ments should be administered prior to obtaining investigator assess ments, safety and labora tory assess ments, and study drug ad ministration. Please see study manual for instructions on the administration and use of all patient -reported instru ments (including Pruritus NRS, patient global assess ment of disease, patient global assess ment of treat ment, Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index [CDLQ I], Patient Oriented Ecze ma Measure [POEM], and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]). 6.2.2.1. Patient Assessment of Pruritus Using Numerical Rating Scale The Pruritus NRS is a simple asses sment tool that patients will use to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during a 24-hour recall period. Patients will be asked the following question: For maximum itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being the ‘worst itch imaginable’, how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours ?” Patients will be instructed on using the patient diary to record their Prurit us NRS score at the scree ning and baseline visits. Patie nts will complete the rating scale DAILY throughout the entire study (screening period, treatment period, and follow -up period; see time point in section 6.1). Clinic al sites will check and remind patient to complete the diary at each visit."

Patient Assessment of Pruritus Using Prurit us Categorical Scale The pruritus categ orical scale is a 4-point scale used to assess symptoms that has been used in previous clinical studies of AD, and there is less of a tendency for patients to provide an “average” response than there might be with a 5-point scale (Kauf mann 2006 ). The scale is rated as follows: 0 = absence of pruritu s; 1 = mild pruritus (occasional slight itching/scratching); 2 = moderate pruritus (constant or intermittent itching/ scratching that does not disturb sleep ); and 3 = severe pruritus (botherso me itching/scratching that disturbs sleep). Patients will be instructed on using the patient diary to record their pruri tus categ orical scale score at the screening and baseline visits. Patients will complete the rating scale DAILY throughout the entire study (screening period, treatment period, and follow-up period; see time point in section 6.1). Clinical sites will check and remind patient to complete the diary at each visit. 6.2.2.3. Patient Global Asses sment of Di sease Patie nts will rate their disease based on the 5-level scale as follows: Overall, how would you rate your ecze ma symptoms right now? • No s ymptoms • Mild symptoms • Moderate sympto ms • Severe sympto ms • Very severe symptoms Patie nts will undergo this assess ment at time points according to section 6.1. The assess ment tool is provided in the study reference manual. 6.2.2.4. Patient Global Asses sment of Tr eatment Patients will respond to the following quest ion based on the 5-level scale as follows: Compared to before you started the study, how would you rate your eczema symptoms now? • Much better • A little better • No difference • A little worse • Much worse Patie nts will undergo this assess ment at time points according to section 6.1. The assess ment tool is provided in the study reference manual."

Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index The CDLQI is a validated questionnaire designed to measure the impact of skin disease on the QOL in children (Lewis -Jones 199 5). The aim of the questionnai re is to measure how much a patie nt’s skin problem has affected the patient over a recall period of the past week. To complete the questionnaire, patients need to provide responses to 10 questions (the questions focus on domains such as sy mptoms feelings associated with disease, the impact of the disease on leis ure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and side effects of treatment for the skin disease. The instru ment has a recall period of 7 days. Nine of the 10 questions are scored as follows: • Very much = 3 • Quite a lot = 2 • Only a little = 1 • Not at all = 0 • Question unanswered = 0 Question 7 has an additional possible response ( prevented school), which is assigned a score of 3. The CDLQI for a patie nt is the sum of the score of each question with a maxi mum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the great er the impact is on the QOL. The CDLQI can also be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score of 30. Patie nts will undergo this assess ment at time points according to section 6.1. The CDLQI is provided in the study reference manual. 6.2.2.6. Patient Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease symptoms in children and adults (Char man 2004 ). The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency of these disease symptoms during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease -related morbidity. The question naire will be administered at time points accor ding to section 6.1. 6.2.2.7. Patient -Assessed Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale The HADS is an instrument for screening anxie ty and depression in non-psychiatric populations; repeated administration also provides infor mation about changes to a patient’s emotional state (Zigmond 1983 , Herrmann 1997 ). The HADS c onsists of 14 ite ms, 7 each for anxiety and depres sion symptoms; possible scores range from 0 to 21 for each subscale. The following cut-off scores are recom mended for both subscal es: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depre ssion.

Eczema Area and Severity Index The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD ( Hanifin 2001 ). The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72. Four AD disease characte ristics (erythe ma, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) will each be assessed for se verity by the investigator or designee on a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (severe). In addition, the area of AD involve ment will be assessed as a percent age by body area of head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs, and converted to a score of 0 to 6. In each body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%). The EASI will be collected at time points accor ding to section 6.1. The EASI assess ment tool is provi ded in the study reference manual. 6.2.2.13. Global Individual Signs Score Individ ual components of the AD lesions (eryt hema, infiltration/ papulation, excoriations, and liche nification) will be rated globally (ie, each assessed for the whole body, not by anato mical region) on a 4-point scale (from 0=none to 3=severe) using the EASI severity grading criteria (section 6.2.2.12 ). The Global Individual Signs Score (GISS) will be assessed at time points accor ding to section 6.1. The GISS assess ment tool is provided in the study reference manual. 6.2.2.14. SCORing Atopic Der matitis The SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and severity of AD (European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis 1993 ). There are 3 components to the assess ment: A = extent or affected BSA, B = severity, and C = subjective symptoms. The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area (see section 6.2.2.15 ) and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD calculation). The severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin thickening/lichenification, and dryness) is assessed usi ng the following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points, assigned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calc ulation). Subjective assess ment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the patient or relative on a Visual Analogue Scale, where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessne ss) and 10 is the worst i maginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20. This parameter is assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculation. The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C where the maximum is 103. Patients will undergo this assess ment at time points accor ding to section 6.1. The SCORAD assessment tool is provided in the study reference manual."

When necessary, appro priate ancillary investigations should be initiated. If the abnor mality fails to resolve or cannot be explained by events or co nditions unrelated to the study medication or its administration, the medical monitor must be consulted. • The clinical significance of an abnor mal test value, within the context of the disease under study, must be deter mined by the investigator. Criteria for reporting laboratory values as an AE are provided in section 7.2.5 . 6.2.4. Pharmacokinetic and Antibody Procedures 6.2.4.1. Drug Con centration Measurements and Samples Serum samples for measuring functional dupilu mab concentrations will be collected at time points listed in section 6.1. 6.2.4.2. Anti -Drug Antibody Measurem ents and Samples Serum samples for ADA assess ment will be collected at time points listed in section 6.1. Long term follow -up of patients who are ADA positive at their last study visit (early termination or end of study) and who do not participate in the open -label extension study may be considered based on the overall clinical presentation at that time. 6.2.5. Biomarker Procedures Thymus and activation -regulated chemokine and total serum IgE are markers of Th2 activity as downstream mediators in the IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathway (Wirnsberger 2006 , Takeda 1997 ). These analytes will be assessed as measures of Th2 activity and PD effect of dupilu mab. The results may be used for modeling dupilu mab activity with drug levels in the comparison of dosing regimens. Thymus and activation -regulated chemokine levels have also been closely associated with AD disease activity and severity (Beck 2014 ), and will be evalu ated as an exploratory marker of efficacy. These markers may also be assessed for their potential value in predicting treatment response. Lactate dehydrogenase levels have also been shown to correlate with disease severity and activity in patients with AD (Mukai 1990 ). Patie nts with total serum IgE levels in the normal range may still have antige n-specific IgE in circulation, indicating they are atopic. To further understand atopy in this patient population, region -specific, allergen -specific IgE panels will be perfor med. These markers may be used to understand PD activity, efficacy, and may be also tested for predictive utility."

SAFETY DEFINITIONS, REPORTING, AND MON ITORING 7.1. Definitions 7.1.1. Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnor mal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant chan ge in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger). • Is life-threatening – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. • Requires in-patie nt hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . In-patie nt hospit alization is defined as ad mission to a hospital or an emergency room for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospit al stay that is longer than was origi nally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged due to the develop ment of a new AE as deter mined by the investigator or treating physician. • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions). • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • Is an important medic al event - Important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious outco mes listed above (eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospas m; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or develop ment of drug dependency or drug abuse). Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events. See section 7.2 for more infor mation on recording and reporting SAEs."

Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 7.2.1. Adverse Events The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur from the time the informed consent is signed until the end of study. Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be followed. Infor mation on follow -up for AEs is provided in section 7.2.6. Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG abnor malities are to be recorded as AEs as outlined in section 7.2.5. 7.2.2. Serious Adverse Events All SAEs, regardless of assess ment of causal relationship to study drug must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours. Refer to the study reference manual for the procedure to be followed. Infor mation not available at the time of the initial report must be docu mented in a follow -up report. Substantiating data such as relevant hosp ital or medical records and diagnostic test reports may also be requested. The investi gator must promptly report to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Et hics Com mittee (EC) all unanticipated proble ms involving risks to patients. This includes death from any cause and all SAEs related to the use of the study drug. It is recommended that all SAEs be reported to the IRB/EC, regardless of assessed causality. In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE a fter the patient completes the study, the following will apply: • SAE with an onset within 30 days of the end of study/early termination visit - the SAE will be reported to the sponsor. The investi gator should make every effort to obtain follow-up information on the outco me until the event is consid ered chronic and/or stable. • SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of study/early termination visit - only fatal SAEs and those deemed by the investigator to be drug-related SAEs will be reported to the sponsor. The investi gator should make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome of a drug-related SAE until the event is considered chronic and/or stable."

Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results The criteria for deter mining whether an abnor mal objective test finding should be reported as an AE include: • the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or • the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or • the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of pro tocol-stipulated dose adjust ments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional conco mitant drug treatment, or other therapy Contact the medical monitor in the event the investigator feels that an abnor mal test finding should be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria. Repeating an abnor mal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnor mal test result that is deter mined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnor malities will be assessed acc ording to the scale outlined in section 7.3.1 . 7.2.6. Follo w-up Adverse event infor mation will be collected until the patie nt’s last study visit. Serious ad verse event information will be colle cted until the event is considered chronic and/or stable. 7.3. Evaluation of Severity and Causality 7.3.1. Evaluation of Severity The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale: • Mild: Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning level. It may be an annoyance. Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the patient. • Moderate: Produces so me impairment of funct ioning but is not hazardous to health. It is unco mfortable or an embarrassment. Treat ment for sy mptom may be needed. • Severe: Produces significant impairment of fun ctioning or incapacitation and is a definite hazard to the patient’s health. Treat ment for sy mptom may be given and/or patie nt hospitalized. If a laboratory value is consi dered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of physiological impairment the value indicates."

Evaluation of Causality The relatio nship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by the investigat or, and will be a clinical decision based on all available infor mation. The following question will be addressed: Is there a reasonable possibil ity that the AE may have been caused by the study drug? The possible answers are: Not Related: There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug For a list of factors to consider in assessing the relationship of AEs to study drug, see Appendix 1. The investigator will also assess whether the AEs are related to any study procedures (as listed in Table 1 and Table 2). The sponsor will request infor mation to justify the causality assess ment of SAEs, as needed. 7.4. Safety Monitoring The investigator will monitor the safety of study patients at his/her site(s) as per the require ments of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Any questions or concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion. The sponsor will monitor the safety data from across all study sites. The medical monitor will have primary respo nsibility for the emerging safety profile of the compound. The study monitor will be supported by other depart ments (eg, Pharmacovigilance and Risk Manage ment; Biost atistics and Data Manage ment). Safety monitoring will be perfo rmed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a periodic cumulative aggregate basis. 7.5. Investigator Alert Notification Regeneron (or design ee) will inform all investig ators participating in this clinical trial, as well as in any other clinical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant require ments for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the Investigator’s Brochure, and has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the medicinal/study drug)."

STATISTICAL PLAN This section provides the basis for the SAP for the study. The SAP may be revised during the study to accom modate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned analyses. The final SAP will be issued be fore the database is locked. Analysis v ariables are listed in section 8. 9.1. Statistical Hypothesis The following null hypothesis and alternative will be tested for each dupilumab treatment group: H0: No treat ment difference between dupilu mab and placebo H1: There is a treatment difference between dupilu mab and placebo Baseline weight group (<60 kg and ≥60kg) and disease severity (moderate [IGA=3] vs. severe [IGA=4] AD) will be the 2 strati fication factors for patient randomization and will be accounted for in the statistical modeling for efficacy. 9.2. Justificat ion of Sample Size It is estimated that with 80 patients per group, at the 2-sided 5% significa nce level, the study will have: • 98% power to detect a difference of 28% between dupilu mab Q2W treatment and placebo treatment in the perce ntage of patients who achieve an IGA score 0 to 1 at week 16, assu ming that the percentages are 37% and 9% for dupilu mab Q2W and placebo, respectively. • 88% power to detect a difference of 20% between dupilu mab Q4W treatment and placebo treatment in the perce ntage of patients who achieve an IGA score 0 to 1 at"

Additional power calculation based on the key secondary endpoint “proportion of patients with improvement (reduction) of Pruritus NRS ≥4 from baseline to week 16”, with 80 patients per group, the study will provide: • 97% power at a 0.05 level to detect a difference of 27% in the percentages of patients achieving Pruritus NRS reduction ≥4 at week 16, assu ming that the percentages are 38% and 11% for dupilu mab Q2W and placebo, respectively. • 95% power at a 0.05 level to detect a difference of 25% in the percentages of patients achie ving weekly avera ge of daily peak Pruritus NRS reduction ≥4 at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 36% and 11% for dupilumab Q4W and placebo, respe ctively. The assumptions used for the power calc ulations were estimated based on results from the R668 - AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416 studies (phase 3 studies for adult AD patients), and the R668 -AD- 1021 study (a phase 2b dose -ranging study in adults with AD). Based on the result from the R668 -AD-1021 study, the efficacy profile of dupil umab 200 mg Q2W is similar to dupilu mab 300 mg Q2W. In the absence of data of dupilu mab in pediatric patients with AD, the data observed in the adult studies R668-AD-1334, R668 -AD-1416, and R668 -AD-1021 are used for these sample size calculations. This is a conservative assumption as it is expected that the effect of dupilu mab in child ren will be greater than that seen in adults. Children have disease for a shorter duration than adults and the disease is more Th2 driven in acute phase while it beco mes more type 1 helper T cell in chronic phase (Thepen 1996 , Gittler 2012 ). In addition, children with AD in general respond better to syste mic therapies than adults (Schmitt 2007 ). A recent study compared the differences between activated and polarized T-cell subsets in blood of adult and pediatric patients with AD. The study found t hat AD is Th2 dominated in children while it extends to additio nal helper T cell subsets, particularly Th22, in adults (Czarnowicki 2015)."

Analysis Sets 9.3.1. Efficacy Analysis Sets The full analysis set (FAS) inclu des all rando mized patients. Efficacy analyses will be based on the treatment allocated at randomization (as rando mized). The per protocol set (PPS) inc ludes all patients in the FAS except for those who are excluded because of major efficacy -related protocol violations. A major protoc ol violation is one that may affect the interpretation of study results. All efficacy varia bles will be evaluated on the FAS; the primary endpoint will also be evaluated on the PPS. Analysis on the FAS will be considered to be primary. 9.3.2. Safety Analysis Set The safety analysis set (SAF) inclu des all randomized patients who received any study drug; it is based on the treatment received (as treate d). Treat ment compliance/ad ministration and all clinical safety varia bles will be analyzed using the SAF. 9.3.3. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Sets The PK analysis set includes all rando mized patients who received any study drug and who had at least 1 qualified PK sa mple result following the first dose of study drug. 9.3.4. Analysis S et for Anti -Drug Antibody Data The ADA analysis set includes all treated patients who received any study drug and who had at least 1 non -missing reportable ADA result (either “ADA negative” or “ADA positive”) after the first dose of study drug. 9.4. Patient Disposition The following will be provided: • The total number of screened patients: met the inclusion criteria regarding the target indication and signed the ICF • The total number of rando mized patients: received a rando mization number • The total number of patie nts in each analy sis set • The total number of patients who discontinued the study, and the reasons for discontinuation • A listing of patients treated but not rando mized, patients rando mized but not treated, and patients rando mized but not treated as rando mized • A listing of patients prematurely discont inued from treatment, along with reasons for discontinuation"

Statistical Methods For contin uous varia bles, descriptive statistics will inclu de the following: the number of patients reflected in the calculation (n), mean, standard deviation, median, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), minimum, and maximum. For categ orical or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displayed for ea ch categ ory. 9.5.1. Demography and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treat ment group. 9.5.2. Efficacy Analyses For each dose regimen and all efficacy variables, the analysis will be comparisons of each of the dupilu mab treatment groups with the placebo group. 9.5.2.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis The Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by rando mization strata (baseline disease severity and weight group) will be used for analyzing the percentage of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 or percentage of patients with EASI -75 at week 16. All efficacy data, regar dless of the patie nt being on the study treatment or discontinues the study treatment but remains in the study, will be used for analy sis. Specifically, if a patie nt stays in the study until the end of the study planned placeb o-controlled treatment period, all efficacy data collected up to the study planned end of treat ment visit will be included in the primary analysis, regar dless if the patient is on treat ment or not. To account for the impact of rescue treatment on the efficacy effect: For t he primary efficacy endpoints (which are binary efficacy endpoints), if rescue treatment is used (see section 5.3), the patient will be classified as a nonresponder from the time the rescue is used. If a patient withdraws from study, this patient will be count ed as a nonresponder for endpoints after withdrawal. The Mantel -Fleiss (MF) criterion will be perfor med, and if it is not met while using the option CMH (MF) in SAS procedure PROC PREQ, sensiti vity analyses including each factor separately in CMH test will be conducted. Sensitivity analysis using the last obser vation carried forward (LOCF) approach to determine patient’s status at week 16 will be cond ucted to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis with regards to handling of missing data. The efficacy data will be set to missing after rescue treatment is used, then the LOCF method will be used to deter mine patients’ status at week 16. In addition, the Cochra n-Mantel -Haenszel method adjusted by rando mization strata will also be perfor med on all observed data regardless if rescue treatment is used. A patient with missing data will be counted as a nonresponder. Other sensitivity analyses may be conducted."

Secondary Efficacy Analysis For binary endpoints, the secondary efficacy analysis will use the same approach as that used for the primary analy sis. For continuous endpoints: • The multiple imputation (MI) with analysis of covaria nce (ANCOVA) model will be used as the primary analysis method. Patie nts’ efficacy data through week 16 after the rescue treatment use will be set to missing first, and then be imputed by the multiple imputation method. Missi ng data from the FAS will be imputed 40 times to generate 40 co mplete data sets by using the SAS procedure MI following the 2 steps below:  Step 1: The monotone missing pattern is induced by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method in MI proc edure using seed number 12345.  Step 2: The missing data at subsequent visits will be imputed using the regression method for the monotone pattern with seed number 54321 and adjust ment for covariates including treatment groups, r andomization strata (disease severity, weight group), and relevant baseline. The week 16 data of each of the 40 co mplete datasets will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, randomization strata (disease severity, weight group), and relevant baseline included in the model, and the SAS MIANALYZE pr ocedure will be used to generate valid statistical inferences by combining results from the 40 analyses using Rubin’s formula. • To account for the impact of rescue treatment on the efficacy effect: If a patie nt receives rescue treatment, the efficacy data collected after rescue treatment is initiated will be treated as missing. • In addition to the MI method descri bed above, sensiti vity analyses such as ANCOVA model with LOCF, MI method with ANCOVA model on all observed data regardless of rescue use will be conducted. Additio nal details on se nsitivity analyses will be provided in the SAP. 9.5.2.3. Multipli city Considera tions For multiplicity adjustment, a hierarchical procedure will be used to control the overall Type -1 error rate at 0.05 for the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints across the 2 dupilu mab dose regi mens versus placebo. Each hypothesis will be formally tested only if the preceding one is significant at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level. The following is the preliminary plan for order of testing (Table 3). The final hierarchy will be provided in the SAP that will be finalized prior to databa se lock."

First -Step Analysis A first -step analysis may be perfor med when t he last patient completes 16 weeks of treatment duration in order to expedite the submission to regulatory agencies. No changes in the conduct of the study will be made based on this first-step analysis. The assess ment of pri mary and secondary endpoints specified in section 8.2.1 and section 8.2.2 perfor med during the analysis will be the final analysis of the primary endpoi nt and secondary endpoi nts. Hence, there will be no need for alpha adjust ment due to the first-step analy sis. In order to maintain study integrity (with respect to the post-treatment follow-up visits, safety visits, and analyse s) in the event a decision is made to perform the first-step analy sis, a disse mination plan will be written. This plan will clearly identify the team (including the statistician) that will perfo rm the first-step analysis and all related activities, restrict other clinical team members and other sponsor personnel from access to individ ual patient treatment allocati on and site level analysis results, and ensure that the dedic ated team will not particip ate in the data review or data decisions for the following post treatment analyses. However, the dedicated team can partici pate in the analysis following the final database lock. 9.5.3. Safety Analysis Safety analysis will be based on the SAF. This includes reported TEAEs and other safety infor mation (eg, clinical laboratory evaluat ions, vital signs, and 12-lead ECG results). 9.5.3.1. Adverse Events Definitions For safety variables, 2 observation periods are defined: • The pretreat ment period is defined as the time from signing the ICF to before the first dose of study drug. • The treatment-emergent period is defined as the day from first dose of study drug to end of study. Treat ment-emergent adverse events are defined as those that are not present at baseline or repre sent the exacerbation of a preexisting condition during the treatment-emergent period. Analysis All AEs reported in this study will be coded using the currently available version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDR A®). Coding will be to lowest level terms. The verbatim text, the preferred term (PT), and the primary system organ class (SOC) will be listed. Summaries of all TEAEs by treat ment group will include: • The number (n) and percentage (%) of patient with at least 1 TEAE by SOC and PT • TEAEs by severity (according to the grading scale outlined in section 7.3.1 ), presented by SOC and PT • TEAEs by relationship to treatment (relat ed, not related), presented by SOC and PT Deaths and other SAEs will be listed and summarized by treat ment group."

If the partial date indicates the same month or year of the intake of study medication date, then the start date by the study medication intake date will be imputed, otherwise, the missing day or month by the first day or the first month will be imputed. • No imputations for missing laboratory data, ECG data, vital sign data, or physical examination data will be made. Unscheduled assess ments: • Extra assess ments (laboratory data or vital signs associated with nonprotocol clinical visits or obtained in the course of investigating or managing AEs) will be inclu ded in listings, but not summaries. If more than 1 laboratory value is available for a given visit, the first observ ation will be used in summaries and all observations will be presented in listings."

ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 13.1. Good Clinical Practice Statement It is the responsibility of both the sponsor and the investigator( s) to ensure that this clinical study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that are consistent with the ICH gu idelines for GCP and applicable regulatory require ments. 13.2. Informed Consent The principles of info rmed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP. The ICF/IAF used by the investigator must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor prior to submission to the appropriate IRB/ EC. A copy of the IRB/EC -approved ICF/IAF and docu mentation of approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug will be shipped to the study site. It is the responsibility of the investigator or desig nee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain written infor med assent from each patie nt and written infor med consent from each patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) prior to the patient’s participation in the study and after the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been expla ined to fullest possible extent in language that the patient (if appli cable) and the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can understand. The ICF should be signed and dated by the patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and the same investigator or designee who explained the ICF, and the IAF be signed and dated by the patient (if applicable) and the same investigator or designee who explained the IAF. Local law must be observed in deciding whether 1 or both parents /guardians consent is required. If only 1 parent or guardian signs the consent form, the investigator must docu ment the reason the other parent or guardian did not sign. The patient may also be required to sign and date the ICF or a separate IAF, as deter mined by the IRB/EC and in accorda nce with the local regulations and require ments. • Patie nts/parents or legal guardians who can write but cannot read will have the assent/consent form read to them before writing their name on the form. • Patients/parents or legal guardians who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF read to them in prese nce of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the IAF/ICF to confirm that infor med consent was given. The origi nal IAF/ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient 's study record, and a copy of the signed IAF/ICF must be given to the patient/patient’ s parent(s) or legal guardian(s). If new safety infor mation results in significa nt changes in the risk/benefit assess ment, the ICF/IAF must be revie wed and updated appropriately. All study patients and their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) must be infor med of the new infor mation and provide their written assent (if applicable) or consent if they wish the patient to continue in the study.

Patient Confidentiality and Data Protection The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anony mity of each study patient will be maintained. Patients should be identified by their initials and a patient identificati on number, only, on CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor. Docu ments that will not be submitted to the sponsor (eg, signed ICF/IAF) must be kept in strict confidence. The patient 's and investigator 's personal data, which may be included in the sponsor database, will be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The sponsor s hall take all appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent access to this data by any unauthorized third party. 13.4. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee An appropriately constituted IRB/EC, as described in ICH guidel ines for GCP, must review and approve: • The protocol, ICF/IAF, and any other materials to be provided to the patients (eg, advertising) before any patient may be enrolled in the study • Any amendment or modification to the study protocol or ICF/IAF before implementation, unless the change is necess ary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the patients, in which case the IRB/ EC should be infor med as soon as possible • Ongoing studies on an annual basis or at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk In addition, the IRB/EC should be informed of any event likely to affect the safety of patients or the continued conduct of the clinical study. A copy of the IRB/EC approval letter with a current list of the IRB/EC members and their functions must be received by the sponsor prior to shipment of drug supplies to the investi gator. The approval letter should include the study number and title, the docu ments reviewed, and the date of the review. Records of the IRB/EC review and approval of all study docu ments (including approval of ongoing studies) must be kept on file by the investigator. 14. PROTOCOL AMEND MENTS The sponsor may not imple ment a change in the design or operation of the protocol or ICF/IAF without an IRB/EC -approved amendment. Regu latory approvals will also be obtained where required by local legislation. 15. PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY OR CLOSE -OUT OF A SITE 15.1. Premature Termina tion of the Study The sponsor has the right to terminate the study prematurely. Reasons may include efficacy, safety, or futility, among others. Should the sponsor decide to terminate the study, the investigat or(s) will be notified in writing."

Close -out of a Site The sponsor and the investigator have the right to close -out a site prematurely. Investig ator’s Deci sion The investigator must notify the sponsor of a desire to close -out a site in writing, providing at least 30 days’ notice. The final decision should be made through mutual agree ment with the sponsor. Both parties will arrange the close -out procedures after review and consultation. Sponsor’s Decision The sponsor will notify the investigator(s) of a decision to close-out a study site in writing. Reasons may include the following, among others: • The investigator has received all items and information necessary to perform the study, but has not enrolled any patient within a reasonable period of time • The investigator has violated any funda mental obligation in the study agree ment, including but not limited to, breach of this protocol (and any applicable amendments), breach of the applicable laws and regulations, or breach of any applicable ICH guidelines • The total number of patients required for the study are enrolled earlier than expected In all cases, the appro priate IRB/EC and Health Authorities must be infor med according to applicable regulatory require ments, and adequate consideration must be given to the protection of the patie nts’ interests. 16. STUDY DOCUMENTAT ION 16.1. Certification of Accuracy of Data A declarati on assuring t he accuracy and content of the data recorded on the CRFs must be signed by the investigat or. This certif ication form accompanies each set of CRFs. The signed form will be provided to the sponsor with the final set of CRFs for each patie nt. 16.2. Retention of Records The investigator must retain all essential study docu ments, including ICFs/IAFs, source docu ments, investigator copies of CRFs, and drug accountability records for at least 15 years following the completion or discontinuation of the study, or longer if a longer period is required by relevant regulatory authorities. The investi gator must consult with the sponsor before discarding or destroying any essential study docu ments following study completion or discontinuation. Records must be destroyed in a manner that ensures con fidentiality. If the investigator 's personal situation is such that archiving can no longer be ensured, the investigat or must inform the sponsor and the relevant records will be transferred to a mutually agreed -upon destination."
