In unavoidable circumstances, such as during the COVID -19 public health emergency, exceptions can be made for alternative methods for conducting patient visits and performing l aboratory and imaging assessments. Remote visits may be performed via telehealth or telemedicine as a safety check on subject well -being. Rem ote visits and telemedicine or telehealth must comply with Takeda processes and local health authorities. This will be recorded in the eCRF and in the study records. In extenuating circumstances, such as during the COVID -19 public health emergency, local laboratory results and imaging assessment may be used. Assessments that cannot be completed during the protocol -spec ified window will be considered missing data, and such departures will be recorded in the study records.

Only pseudonymized documents may be shared through a cloud -based system. Videoconferencing may be u sed for remote site data verification, but copying or recording of the video and/or documents (eg ,screen captures) is not permitted. These procedures will be documented in the Monitoring Plan. Table 8.b Revised: Grade 4 CPK elevation (greater than 10.0 × ULN) or recurrence of Grade 3 elevation • Withhold brigatinib until recover y to Grade 1 or less (less than or equal to 2.5 × ULN) or to baseline, then resume brigatinib at next -lower dose (Table 8.a). • If Grade 4 elevation of CPK recurs, permanently discontinue brigatinib.The dose modifications for Grade 4 CPK elevation or recurrence of Grade 3 CPK elevation were changed to align with the Company Core Data Sheet. An analysis of data from Studies AP26113-13-301 a nd AP26113 -13-201 suggested that CPK increases were associated with longer duration of treatment and did not seem to be associated with the frequency of muscular toxicity. In a review of individual patient data from these studies, only 1 patient reported a Grade 3 CPK elevation as well as a Grade 3 muscular toxicity (PT: muscular toxicity). Additionally, many of the 49 patients from these studies with a Grade ≥3 CPK elevation did not report a muscular toxicity event (any grade or Grade ≥3).

Additional details about subgroup analyses will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 1.Safety/tolerability (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] versio n 4.03). 2.HRQOL assessed with the global health status/quality of life (QOL) and other function and symptom from EORTC QLQ -C30 (version 3.0), and EORTC QLQ -LC13. Subject Population: Adult patients with ALK+ NSCLC whose disease has progressed on prior alectinib or ceritinib (with or without prior crizotinib and no more than 3 different systemic regimens as treatment for locally advanced/metastatic disease). Number of Subjects: Approximately 103Number of Sites: The study is planned to be conducted internationally. Dose Level(s): Brigatinib 180 mg QD with a 7 -day lead -in at 90 mg QD. Patients who progressed on brigatinib 180 mg QD dose, did not experience toxicity Grade >2, and signed a separate informed consent will be given the option to receive brigatinib at an increased dose of 240 mg QD.Route of Administration: Oral Duration of Treatment: Patients will continue to be treat ed with brigatinib until they experience objective disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, as assessed by the investigator, or intolerable toxicity.

Globally , lung cancer accounted for 1.6millio n cases and 1.4 million deaths in 2008 [2]. It is the l eading cause of cancer death in the United States (US) and in the European Unio n (EU). In the US, an estimated 234,030 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnose d by end of 2018, and 154,050 deaths due to the disease are estimated to occur [3]. In the EU, lung cancer is ranked as the fourth most frequent cancer; approxi mately 313,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2012 and 268,000 deaths in that year [1]. Five-year survival rates remain low: 17.7% and 13% in the US and Europe, respectively [ 4,5]. In Japan, lung cancer i s ranked as the third most frequent cancer; approximately 113,000 new cases were di agnosed in 2012 and approximately 71,500 deaths in that y ear (Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center, 2017). Most lung cancer cases are diagnosed at advanced stages and about 78% of newly diagnosed patients have regio nal/distant disea se [1] [5]. Historically, l ung cancers have been stratified on the basis of histol ogic criteria and are generally divided into 2 categories: small- cell lung cancer and non –small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC is the most prevalent histologic class, accounting for nearly 85% of all lung cancers [6,7], and includes a number of subt ypes such as adenocarcino ma, squamous -cell carcino ma, large- cell carcinom a, and bronchio loalveo lar carcino ma [8]. In recent y ears, attenti on has turned to stratifying lung cancer pat ients on the basis o f molecular alterations since it has beco me clear that histologically identical tumors are driven by different oncogenes and are therefore likely to respon d different ly to therapeutic intervent ion, such as therapies directed at epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) -mutant, anaplast ic lymphoma kinase -rearranged (ALK+), c -ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) rearranged, or BRAF V600E mutant NSCLC. The focus herein is on N SCLC that contains oncogenic rearrangements in the ALK gene, and the role of brigatinib, a novel small -molecule inhibitor, in the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC. 4.1.2 ALK+ NSCLC ALK is a ty rosine kinase encoded on chromosome 2 and is primarily invo lved in development al processes and expressed at low levels in adults [9]. The first genet ic rearrangement of ALK seen in NSCLC invo lved a fusio n between the EML4 gene and the ALK tyrosine kinase do main (KD). EML4 -ALK has the capacit y to transform fibroblasts grown in culture and as subcutaneous xenografts to induce tumor format ion [10]. Since then, a number of addit ional ALK fusio n partners have been described in NSCLC that are beli eved to resul t in aberrant signaling and oncogenic transformat ion [11,12] . Estimates of the frequency o f ALK rearrangement in the overall populat ion of NSCLC patients range fro m 2% to 7% [13,14] , whi ch represent, on the basis o f proporti onali ty of total popul ations in the US and EU, approximately 7000 to 25,000 ALK+ NSCLC pat ients in the US Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usenew cases in 2012), Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usenew cases in 2012), ung cancer accounted for Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useung cancer accounted for eading cause of cancer death in the Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useeading cause of cancer death in the n (EU).

ALK rearrangements are more commo n among patients wi th adenocarcinom a histol ogy, pati ents who have never smoked, and patients who have wild-type EGFR and Kirsten rat sarcoma virus oncogene [9]. 4.1.3 Current Treatment for ALK+ NSCLC While the standard treatment algorithm for unselected NSCLC patients has historically invo lved front line treatment with chemotherapy, recent clinical trials have demonstrated that patients with ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC respond well to treatm ent wi th the ALK inhibitors (crizotinib, alectinib, and cerit inib). Crizotinib received accelerated approval fro m the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 on the basis o f resul ts from 2single -arm studies [15]. The efficacy of crizotinib has been confirmed in a rando mized study of crizotinib versus chemotherapy [15,16] . ALK -dependent mechanisms o f resistance, observed in approximately 30% of pat ients [17], include the acquisit ion of secondary mutations in ALK that interfere with crizotinib binding, and/or amplificat ion of the ALK fusio n gene. More than 10 secondary mutations in ALK have been associated with crizotinib resistance in pat ients, with the most commo n being L1196M and G1269A [18,19] . The central nervous system (CNS) is the first site of progression in approximately 50% of patients treated with crizotinib [ 20,21] , suggesting inadequate penetration of crizotinib into the brain (ie, pharmaco logic failure) as the primary cause of resistance in these patients. Therefore, an ALK inhibitor that can overcome secondary resistance mutations in ALK, has adequate penetration into the CNS, and is less suscept ible to pharmaco logic failure, m ay be requi red to overcome resistance. Recent ly, 2 other ALK inhibitors, cerit inib [22]and al ectinib [23], have beco me available for NSCLC pat ients with ALK rearrangements. Both dru gs are effect ive in pat ients previously treated with crizotinib. Cerit inib demo nstrated significant ly improved progression- free survival (PFS) versus chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.55) [24] whereas alect inib demo nstrated significant ly improved PFS versus crizotinib (hazard ratio 0.34- 0.47) [25,26] in treatment -naïve ALK+ advanced NSCLC. ALK secondary mutations associ ated wi th clinical resistance to ceri tinib and alect inib have also been ident ified, including L1152R an d F1174C/V for ceritinib, I1171N/T/S for alect inib, and G1202R for both agents [18,27-30] . More r ecent ly, the invest igational agent lorlatinib has been evaluated in a phase 1/2 trial showing responses after ≥1 prior ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (25% [11 of 44] objective response rate (ORR) in patients with 2 prior ALK TKIs and 31% [4 of 13] ORR in patients with 3 prior ALK TKIs).

The alternative treatments for these patients include chemotherapy and checkpo int inhibitors (PD- 1 or PD -L1 antibody). The efficacy of platinum doublet chemotherapy seems not to be impacted by prior TKI treatm ent, but the efficacy was limi ted wi th a response rate of about 30% and median PFS of about 4months[32]. Checkpo int inhibitors have been introduced into the market recent ly as treatment for NSCLC. These agents are particularly effect ivein pat ients whose tumors over -express PD- L1 and have less benefit in pat ients with EGFR m utation or ALK rearrangements [33] , possibly related to l ow m utation burden in this populat ion characteri zed by nonsm oking status [34].

Primary targets are activated mutant forms o f ALK and ROS1, which play important rol es in NSCLC and other cancers. A series o f in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that brigatinib potently inhibited ALK activit y and proliferat ion in ALK+ cell lines and exhibited a greater than 100- fold select ivity over ALK- negat ive lines. In clinical study, brigat inib has an acceptable safety profile at the recommended dose of 90 mg once daily (QD) f or 7 day s, then 180 m g QD, continuously (hereinafter presented as 90 mg QD→180 m g QD). Bri gatinib at this dose level exhibited substant ial efficacy in patients wi th ALK+ NSCLC who had progressed on crizotinib. In 110 patients, the confirmed response rate was 56.4% (62 of 110, 97.5% CI: 45.2, 67.0) by independent revi ew committee (IRC) assessment. The IRC -assessed median duration o f response (DOR) was 15.7 months (95% CI: 12.8, 21.8 event rate: 54.8%) and median PFS was 16.7 months (95% CI: 11.6, 21.4, event rate: 49.1%).

23,page_23,"Brigatinib (AP26113) Study No. 2002 Page 23of 94 Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 4 24 September 2020 4.3 Rationale for the Proposed Study Secon d-generat ion ALK TKIs, including alect inib and cerit inib, have shown efficacy, including durable response to intracranial lesions, and have an acceptable safet y profile in both ALK TKI treatm ent-naïve and pretreated patients. Both alect inib and ceri tinib w ere approved as first- line treatm ent for ALK+ advanced NSCLC in US and European countries. However, resistance to alectinib and cerit inib develops eventually, wit h emergence of secondary resistant mutations detected in approximately 50% of patients [33]. Brigatinib (AP26113) is a novel, synt hetic, orally active ALK TKI. A pre- clinical study [35] revealed that assessed at concentrations relative to the level o f exposure achieved in pat ients at the approved or recommended phase 2 doses , brigatinib was the most potent inhibitor compared with crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib. Brigatinib inhibits 17 clinically and preclinically observed crizotinib -, ceri tinib-and/or al ectinib- resistant ALK m utations. Com pared wi th these 3 ALK TKIs, br igatinib also exhibited superior preclinical act ivity when in vitro potencies were related to steady -state plasma level of each drug achieved in pat ients at the approved dose. Amo ng the 4 ALK TKIs tested, brigat inib was the only TKI to maintain substant ialactivi ty against the most recalcitrant G1202R mutant in vivo. Brigat inib also has act ivity in a mice orthotopic brain model metastasis. In the ALTA study , the 90 m g QD →180 m g QD treatm ent regimen was associated with a higher confirmed ORR and longer PFS, as well as improved intracranial efficacy, as co mpared with the 90 m g QD regimen. Therefore, there appears to be a relationship between dose/exposure and efficacy , which suggests that hi gher brigat inib doses may result in better efficacy. However, higher brigatinib doses/exposures were associated with so me treatment -related Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) (eg, increased creatine phosphokinase [CPK], skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and rash) (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2017/208772Orig1s000TOC.cfm). A 240 mg QD dose of brigatinib was determined to be the highest acceptably tolerated dose in Study AP26113-11- 101. As a result, in the present study , pati ents who progress on brigat inib 180 mg QD will have the option to receiv e brigatinib at an increased dose of 240 mg QD in an effort to provide better mutational coverage. Patients will be allowed to receive only the 240 mg QD bri gatinib dose postprogression if they have not experienced toxicit ies greater than Grade 2 after the 180 m g brigat inib dose. The rati onale for escalat ion to 240 m g QD at disease progression is to provide an opportunit y at progression for treatment at higher exposures of brigat inib that may consequent ly provide clinical benefit through a greater degree of antitumor activity co mpared to 180 mg and/ or to attempt to overcom e potenti al pharmacol ogic resistance at 180 mg QD brigat inib (ie, to increase brigatinib exposure in order to have better activit y against a given ALK KD resistance mutation or for increas ed exposure in the CNS). In study AP26113 -11-101, 10 pati ents were enrolled to receive brigatinib 240 mg QD, of which 1 pati ent experienced a dose -limit ing toxicit y (DLT) of Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation.

Co mmo n TEAEs were similar for patients dosed at 90 mg QD →180 m g QD and 240 m g QD bri gatinib and included gastrointestinal [GI], constitutional, and pulmo nary events. Data from studies AP26113-11-101 and AP261 13-13- 201 indicate the incidence of early onset pulmo nary events (EOPEs) is related to the init ial dose of brigat inib, but EOPEs have not been observed upon dose escalat ion (ie,90mg QD →180 m g QD regimen). Therefore, it is expected that patients who toler ate brigatinib at 180 mg QD and then escalate to 240 mg QD will not have an increased risk of EOPEs after escalat ion. In separate but similar studies, ALK+ patients taking brigat inib after progressing on crizotinib, had a longer median PFS as assessed by I RC (15.6 m onths, 95% CI: 11.1, 21.0, ALTA study , data cut: 29 September 2017) than those taking alectinib (8.9 months, [36] and 7.1 months, [37], both by IRC assessment) or cerit inib (5.7 months, by investigator assessment, [38]). On the basis of nonclinical and clinical data, brigatinib may be efficacious in pat ients who developed resistant mutations to alectinib or ceritinib or those who do not respond to alectinib or ceritinib because of pharmaco logic resistance. This phase 2 study is designed to assess the clinical efficacy and safet y of brigatinib in ALK+ advanced NSCLC pat ients who have progressed on alect inib or cerit inib. 5.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 5.1 Objectives 5.1.1 Primary Objective The primary object ive of the study is to determine the efficacy of brigat inib, as evidenced by confirmed ORR, in patients with ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose disease has progressed on therapy with alect inib or cerit inib. 5.1.2 Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives are: 1.To characterize the durabilit y of efficacy with brigatinib . 2.

The pati ent shall continue to receive the efficacy , safet y, patient report outcome and health resource utilizat ion assessments as in the main study treatm ent phase. 8.4 Dose Modification Guidelines The fo llowing sect ions provide r ecommended dose -modificat ion guidelines for treatm ent-related AEs observed with brigatinib administration. The allowable daily doses of brigat inib in this study are 240 m g (applicable only for patients eligible to increase to 240 mg after disease progressi on), 180 m g, 120 m g, 90 m g, and 60 m g. When pat ients are intolerant of their current dose they will have the option to reduce their dose in accordance with the dose- reduction scheme shown in Table 8.a. Dose interruptions or reductions should be implemented for patients who experience treatment- related AEs, upon clinical judgment of the invest igator. Study drug administrati on m ay be delayed for up to 28 days to allow for improvement or resolution o f the event. Patients may have an interrupti on in therapy for 14 days shoul d em ergency surgery be clinically indicated. NOTE: If brigat inib treatment interruption lasts ≥14 days, and pri or dose was >90 mg QD, patients shoul d resume treatment at 90 mg QD for 7 day s, before escalating dose back to 120 mg QD or 180 mg QD. The dose should not be escalated higher than the prior dose level before treatm ent interruption. If an AE does not resolve to Grade 1 or less after dose interruption for more than 28 day s, the sponsor’s medical mo nitor must be contacted. Re-escalat ion after dose modificat ion for AEs i s discouraged. However, if, in the opinio n of the treating investigator, re -escalat ion is warranted, this must be undertaken after consultation wit h the sponsor. To be a candidate for re- escalat ion, the AE that led to dose modificat ion must not have recurred, and no other AEs of Grade 3 or 4 must have been observed during the preceding 28 day s.

These events were termed EOPEs. In the ALT A study (Study AP26113-11- 201) for bri gatinib, as of 21 February 2017, of 219treated pati ents, there were 14 cases of EOPE (total 6.4%, 14 of 219). All cases occurred at a dose of 90 mg QD. No EOPEs were identified after escalat ion to 180 mg QD in the 90 m g QD→180 m g QD dose group, or after re -initiation following study treatm ent interruption. Median time of EOPE onset was Day 2 (range: 1 -9). Eleven o f these 14 cases were reported as serious adverse events (SAEs). Seven patients had events that were Gr ade ≥3, all of who m perm anent ly discontinued brigat inib because o f these events. One patient had a Grade 5 EOPE (pneumo nia). Pulmo nary events occurring within the first 7 day s of treatment, including, but not limited to, dyspnea, hypoxia, dry cough, chest tightness, and presumpt ive lung infect ion (pneumo nia) shoul d be m onitored and reported.

Reasonable efforts will be made to collect informat ion on all prior cancer therapy received by the pat ient (eg,surgeries, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, bio logics). The informat ion must be obtained from the pati ent’s ori ginal source medical document (eg, medical chart for in -hospi tal care and medical record for outpatient clinic care) and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Palliat ive therapy and supportive care are permitted during the study for manag ement of symptoms and underlying medical condit ions that may develop during the study . Pati ents wi th brain lesio ns requiring local radiotherapy such as SRS are allowed to continue study drug after appropriate interruption, as determined by the investi gator with sponsor agreement; however, for analysis purposes, these patients will be considered to have PD. New ant icancer therapy initiated after radio logical PD is observed shall also be collected in eCRF. The informat ion to be collected may including name of the therapy , start and end dates, best response, and reason for discont inuat ion. Other Therapy Concomitant medicat ions for all ongoing medical history condi tions or AEs m ust be reported from the date the informed consent is signed unt il at least the 30 d ays after last dose, and for all concomitant medicat ions related to serious or study drug -related toxi cities unt il the medicat ion is no longer taken or un til pat ient contact discontinues.Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useigat Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useigatinib Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useinib ographic Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useographic th Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useth high Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use highth highth Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useth highth ics as indicated.

This may include blood and blood products and growth factors as clinically needed. 8.8 Precautions and Restrictions Brigatinib induces CYP3A in vitro and may decrease concentrations of CYP3A substrates. Coadministration of brigat inib wit h CYP3A substrates, including hormonal contraceptives, can resul t in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy of CYP3A substrates. Brigat inib may also induce other enzymes and transporters (eg, CYP2C, Pgp) via the same mechanism responsible for induct ion of CYP3A (eg, pregnane X receptor activat ion). Therefore, addit ional monitoring shoul d be considered for patients receiving substra tes of these enzymes and transporters with a narrow therapeutic index during treatment with brigatinib as their effect iveness may be reduced. Brigatinib is an in vitro inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic cat ion transporter 1 (OCT1), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) and 2K (MATE2K). Patients should be closely mo nitored when brigatinib is coadministered with substrates of these transporters with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin, dabigatran, methotrexate) as their plasma concentrations may be increased. 8.8.1 Pregnancy, Breastfeeding, and Contraception It is not known what effects brigat inib has on human pregnancy or devel opment of the embry o or fetus. Therefore, female pat ients participating in t his study shoul d avoi d beco ming pregnant, and male pat ients should avo id impregnat ing a female partner. Nonsterilized female pat ients of reproducti ve age group and male patients should use effect ive methods of contraception through defined periods during a nd after study treatment as specified below. There are no data regarding the secret ion of brigat inib in human milk or its effects on the breast fed infant or milk production. Because of the potential for adverse react ions in breastfed infants, female pat ients shoul d not breastfeed during treatment with brigat inib and for 1 week following the final dose. Female pat ients must m eet 1 of the fo llowing: Postmenopausal for at l east 1 year before the screening visit, or Surgically sterile, or If they are of childbe aring potenti al, agree to practice 1 highly effect ive nonhormonal method (see list below) and 1 additional effect ive (barrier) method of contraception at the same time, from the time of signing of the informed consent form (ICF) through at least 4 months a fter the last dose of study drug, or Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifest yle of the pati ent, f rom the time of signing of the ICF through at least 4 months after the last dose of study drug.

Whenever feasible, baseline imaging should be performed as close as possible to Cycle 1 Day 1. Tumor radi ological imaging generated for the purpose of regular medical practice before patients sign the ICF can be used as baseline disease assessment provided the imaging meets the qualit y and time window required for this study . Visit Window The day the first dose of brigat inib is administered is defined as Day 1. Fo llowing visit may be arranged ±3 days fro m the Day 1 of each cycle, with the exception of disease assessment, which can be arranged with a ±7 -day window. Once radiol ogical disease progression is observed or patients have started a new systemic anticancer therapy , the survival fo llow-up sh all be arranged with a ±14 -day window. Vital signs shoul d be repeated on Cy cle 1 Day 1 bef ore fi rst dose, regardless of the time from screening. Insulin, testosterone (male pat ients) and pregnancy tests (for female with child - bearing potential) do not need to be repeated on Day 1 if they were performed for screening within 7 days before Day 1, and in the opinion of the investigator, there is no reason to believe they have substant ially changed.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal (invest igational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occu rring event, or a previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the administration o f study drug. An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to discontinuat ion or del ay in treatment, dose m odification, therapeuti c intervent ion, or is considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline. Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study shoul d be reported as AEs in the appropriate section of the eCRF. Dis ease progressio n assessed by measurement of malignant lesions on radi ographs or other methods should not be reported as an AE. 10.1.3 AE Severity The severit y of AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE versio n 4.03 (see the study manual). If the AE is not def ined in the CTCAE, the investigator will determine the severit y of the AE on the basis o f the following definit ions: Mild (Grade 1): The AE is noticeable to the patient but does not interfere with routine activit y. Moderate (Grade 2): The AE interferes wit h routine activit y but responds to symptomat ic therapy or rest. Severe (Grade 3): The AE significant ly limits the patient’s abilit y to perform routine activit ies despite symptomat ic therapy. Life-Threatening (Grade 4): The patient is at immediate risk of death. Death (Grade 5): The patient dies as a direct result of the complicat ion or condit ion induced by the AE. 10.1.4 SAE Definition SAE m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: Results in death. Is life-threatening.

(Refers to an AE that may not result in death, be immediately life-threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, on the basis of appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient, require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes liste d above, or involves suspected transmissio n via a medicinal product of an infect ious agent. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism , virus, or infecti ous parti cle [eg,prion protein transmitt ing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy], pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infect ious agent.) In thi s study , severi ty for each AE, incl uding any lab abnormalit y, will be determined using the NCI CTCAE, versio n 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [39].Clarification should be made between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT the same as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually as sociated wi th events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to functi on. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 i s considered Grade 3 (se vere) but m ay not be consi dered seri ous. Seriousness (not i ntensity) serves as a gui de for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs All AEs spontaneously reported by the pati ent and/or in response to an open question fro m study personnel or revealed by observati on, physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 10.3 for the period of observat ion). Any clinically relevant deteri oration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicat ing a commo n underlying pathol ogy shoul d be noted as 1 comprehensive event. Regardless of causalit y, SAEs m ust be reported (see Section 10.3 for the period of observat ion) by the investigator to the Takeda Global Pharmacovigilance depart ment or designee wit hin 24 hours of beco ming aware of the event. This will be done by transmitting an electronic data capture (EDC) SAE report. If transmission of an EDC SAE report is not feasible, then a facsimile (fax) of the completed Takeda paper- based SAE form will be sent.

The invest igator and inst itution guarantee access for qualit y assurance auditors to all study docum ents as described in Section 14.1. 15.0 ETHICAL ASPECTS OF T HE STUDY This study will be conducted wi th the highest respect for the individual participants (ie, patients) according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin i n the Declarati on of Helsinki, and the ICH Harmonised Tripart ite Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct the study according to applicable local or regional regulatory requi rements and align his or her conduct in accordance with the responsibilit ies of the invest igator listed in Appendix B.The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing requi rements for informed consent and invest igator responsibilities. 15.1 Benefit-Risk of the Study The intended study popul ation are patients with refractory disease and those who have limited treatm ent opti ons. The study drug bri gatinib will be used at the standard 90 m g to 180 m g dose. The safet y profile of brigatinib at this dose is well established fro m the previous studies (AP26113 -11-101, AP26113 -13-201, and AP26113-13- 301). The safety surveillance procedures in this protocol are similar to those used in previou s brigatinib studi es and are reasonable to ensure proper monitoring of pat ients’ safet y. A detailed dose modificat ion guideline is provi ded in this protocol in case treatm ent-related toxicit y emerges. Only patients who tolerated previ ous doses well and have disease progression will be offered the opportunit y to escal ate to 240 m g, and an addit ional ICF will be provided before dose escalat ion. This dose level is st ill below the maximum dose studi ed in humans, and the MTD was not reached in a phase 1 study ofbrigatinib. Therefore, any toxicities are expected to be manageable. The m andatory procedures requi red by this study are similar to the m anagement that these patients will receive as part of clinical pract ice. The data collect ion and reporting plan are standard for such studies. These will ensure the collect ion of high -qualit y data to report clinically meaningful outcom es. Brigatinib may have ant itumor effects in ALK+ metastatic NSCLC pat ients who have already progressed on alect inib or cerit inib accord ing to nonclinical studies. Patients enro lled in this study may have clinical benefit from the study drug bri gatinib. The efficacy and safet y from this study will serve as important evidence to evaluate the use of brigatinib in this populat ion and potenti ally benefi t more pati ents in the future. In summary, the benefit -risk of this study supports the protocol to be implemented. 15.2 IRB and/or IEC Approval IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable state and federal/local requi rements of eac h participating regi on.
