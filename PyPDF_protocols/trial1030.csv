Prior and Concomitant Disease )  Severe psychiatric disease  Pregnancy / lactation  Known hypersensitivity against Gazyvaro (Obinutuzumab) or drugs with similar chemical structure or any other additive of the pharmaceutic al formula of the study drug  Participation in another interventional trial or follow -up period of a competing trial which can influence the results of this current trial  Creatinine > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless creatinine clearance normal), or calculated creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min  AST or ALT > 2.5 × ULN  Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN  INR > 1.5 × ULN  PTT or aPTT > 1.5 × the ULN Background Large field radiation therapy has proven to be superior to more limited fields radiation in early stage follicular lymphoma in prolonging PFS (ARO 98 -01 trial, personal communication M. Engelhard ) The MIR trial showed, that at least in the short time follow -up, the addition of MabThera to a smal l-field radiation therapy in conventional dosage can lead to at least equal results concerning the PFS as compar ed to the historic large field data of the ARO 98 -01 trial. However, the toxicity has been shown to be lower (Herfarth et al. 2014) . The metabolic CR rate as demonstrated by FDG -PET was identified as a prognostic marker for freedom of recurrence in advanced stage of follicular lymphoma ( Trotman et al. 2011 PRIMA trial). Immune modulating radiation therapy alone using a low -dose of 2 x 2 Gy (LDRT) has been shown to be effective in inducing CR in about 60% of follicular lymphoma in a prospective trial (Haas et al 2003 ) or 48% in the British FORT trial (Hoskin et al. 2014). It can be speculated that a CR -repsonse to LDRT identifies specifi c subtypes of follicular lymphoma. Also, it is not known whether a combination of LDRT with anti-CD20 antibody therapy may enhance the CR -rate. The goal of the current trial is a further reduction of the radiation dose in patients with a good response to a combination of LDRT and anti -CD20 immunotherapy. The shift from MabThera to Gazyvaro might lead to an even more effective treatment, which can be prove n by the morphological response in week 7 and the MRD eradication in comparison to the MIR trial. Patien ts with insufficient response (no metabolic CR) after LDRT will receive an additional radiation dose of 36 Gy adding up to the total dose 40 Gy of the MIR trial."

The calculation of the number of patients is primarily based on the aspects of practicability and precision of the results . The following calculations are based on the intention -to-treat (ITT) population . Since t he strength of the results for the primary endpoint m ay be weakened due to early drop -outs (as described later) , the number of patients needed should be high enough to compensate for potential drop -outs. Primary endpoint is the rate of metabolic CR in week 18 in patients with initially remaining lymphoma judged by FDG -PET/CT . Based on the morphologic CR rate of 37 -84% after 2 x 2 Gy documented in the literature and in face of a lack of data for metabolic CR after 2x2 Gy, a CR rate of 60% is assumed. If fifty patients enter the FDG -PET/CT and the observed metabolic CR rate amounts to 60% , the half width of the asymptotic two-sided 95% confidence interval amounts to about ± 13.5%. Based on the experience of the MIR trial, a general drop -out rate of 10% is assumed, and about 30% of the included patients will not have remaining lymphoma after initial surgery to pro ve the histology. In addition, we expect an additional drop -out rate of about 15% after the initial FDG -PET due to stage -shifting to a stage III /IV disease. These considerations lea d to the following calculation: If 93 patients are being recruited, about 15% will drop out due to a stage -shift to higher stages after FDG -PET (79 patients remaining). Of these 79 patients, about 30% will have no remaini ng PET positive lymphoma after initial surgery (according to the experience s in the MIR trial). Therefore, 55 patients would start therapy with the goal of reaching the primary endpoint assessment. Assuming a drop -out rate of 10% , 50 patients will be avail able for final assessment of the primary endpoint . The number of n=93 represents the upper limit of the patients to be included. This number of definit ively included patients might drop during the trial, if , e.g., less patients show a stage -shift o r more patients show rem aining lymphoma . Statistical analysis Trial data are evaluated by applying methods of descriptive data analysis: Rate of metabolic CR in week 18 after initiation of the therapy of each patient as relative frequency including the two-sided 95% confidence interval according to Wilson. (ITT and PP populations). PFS and OS at 2 years after initiation of the therapy of each patient will be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier method and the two-sided 95% confidence intervals according to Greenwood (ITT and PP populations). Quality of life will be evaluated according to the evaluation guide of the two question naires."

An involved field (IF) irradiation has been favored due to the toxicity of large field irradiation in other countries (e.g. USA). However, smaller irradiation field s have been accompanied with an increased risk of recurrence [2, 3] . A combination of involve d field irradiation with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab (MIR trial) has led to similar efficacy results compared to the large field irradiation but with markedly reduced side effects [4]. Haas et al. showed in a prospective trial, that a low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) can lead to a complete remission in up to 6 0% in follicular lymphoma [5]. This is presumed to result from immune modulatory effects induced by LDRT . The effectiveness of LDRT could also be demonstrated in another prospective, randomized British trial (FORT trial [6]: 2 x2 Gy vs. 12 x 2 Gy) with a CR rate of 40% after 2 x 2 Gy ( 60% after 12 x 2 Gy) . Currently, it is unknown, which patients need a higher radiation dose and which not. A metabolic complete remission (CR) is an important prognostic marker for progression -free survival. According to the results of the PRIMA trial, CR is a very strong predictive parameter if the CR is established using FDG -PET [7]. In the present GAZAI trial, p atients with early stage nodular follicular lymphoma will be treated in a combined approach of immunotherapy with an anti -CD20 antibody and small field (involved site) irradiation as in the MIR trial . In GAZAI , the fully humanized anti-CD20 antibody Obinutuzumab (GAZYVARO) will be used , which showed a high effic acy in combination with bendamustin in patients with follicular lymphoma refractory to Rituximab (GADOLIN trial) [8]. In addition, the radiation dose will be limited to 2 x2 Gy in responding patients . A dose build -up to a total of 40 Gy (dose in the MIR trial) will be performe d in case of failure to achieve a complete CR based on a FDG - PET in week 18. Primary endpoint of the trial is the rate of CR (based on FD G-PET/CT) after Obinutuzumab and 2x2 Gy IS radiotherapy in week 18. Secondary endpoints are the morphological CR rate i n week 7, week 18 and month 6, the PFS, the toxicity, the recurrence rate, the recurrence pattern, overall survival and quality of life. 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Follicular lymphomas (FL) are B cell lymphomas characterized by CD20 expression and quite often by a t(14;18)(q32; q21) translocation. Based on th e increasing amount of centroblasts, FL is categorized in grade 1, 2 or 3. FL grade 3 is a heterogeneous group of lymphomas. Grade 3b FL s clinically present more like aggressive lymphomas and are usually treated accordingly . Follicular lymphoma is the second most frequent non -Hodgkin lymphoma entity in the US and in Europe (30% of all NHL and about 70% of indolent lymphomas). Most patients present with an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. O nly about 15 -30% of the patients with FL initially present in an early stage (stage I or II according to the Ann Arbor classification). The natural course is usually slowly advancing with a relatively long survival, especially in the early stages. Due to t his behavior, a watch and wait concept (withholding therapy till progression) is being favored for the advanced stages and partly also for the early stages [9] [10]."

Long lasting remission s and the potential chance for cure were the main argum ents supporting this approach. However, there was no consensus about the extent of the radiation fields (target volumes). Table 1 summarizes the results of several international experiences with a longer follow -up [2, 11 -22]. These are mostly retrospective analyses with only a few exceptions [15, 17, 18] . Involved field, e xtended field and total lymphatic irradiation (TLI) were used in the se series. The 10 -years freedom -from - recurrence rates were 38% -72% and the overall survival rates 50% -78% with a median survival of more than 12 years.

Th ese patients were only treated by large field irradiation techniques (EF and TLI). 41% showed a recurrence after 8 years of follow -up. Risk for infield -field nodal relapse was significantly lower in adjuvant irradiated than in non -irradiated regions at least in stage I patients – suggestive of a necessity to evaluate large field irradiation under controlled conditions. However, this kind of treatment was accompanied with an increased risk of toxicity: 23% of the patients showed grade 3 / 4 toxicity [18]. The successor trial ARO98 -01 evaluated TLI and a modified EF irradiation in a randomized comparison . The recruitment of 202 patients was completed in 2007 a nd the final results have not been published yet. However, interim analyses showed a significant difference of the PFS and most recurrences occurred outside the radiation field [3]. 1.1.2 Radiation dose Most of the trials listed in Table 1 used radiation doses of 30 Gy or more. In the German trial"
25,page_25,"GAZ AI EudraCT: 2016 -002059 -89 Version: 1.2/ 06.10 .2017 CONFIDENTIAL -2_20171006_final Seite 26 von 74 published by Stuschke 1997 , 26 Gy were mandatory for areas of possible microscopic disease and 36 Gy to macroscopic disease. In a multiviariate analysis, a deviation of more than 20% of this dose proved to be a highly significant negative prognostic factor for recurrence [18]. In a 2011 published prospective British trial, the dose effect was evaluated in a randomized fashion in 361 patients with indolent lymphoma [23]. Patients received either 20 x 2 Gy or 12 x 2 Gy involved field radiotherapy. There was no difference in the local or sy stemic lymphoma control reported after median follow up of 5 years. However, some reservations have to be made: The patient cohort was very heterogeneous regarding the histology (40% non -follicular grade 1/2), the stage and pretreatment (30% were treated for recurrence ), and the thoroughness of follow -up examinations (radiological and only clinical examinations were allowed) [23]. Despite this, 24 Gy has was recommended as a standard dose in England since the results of this study were published [24]. The German radiation oncology community is more concerned with the problems of the trial and has more confidence in the above mentioned data of Stuschke et al. suggesting a minimal dose of 36 Gy to macroscopic tu mor sites [18]. How ever, low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) has show n long lasting effects. Ganem et al. published retrospective data about a low dose radiation therapy of follicular lymphomas in 1994 [25]. Twenty - seven patients with advanced disease were treated with 2 x 2 Gy over 3 days. A CR was achieved in 37%. More patients with low -grade lymphoma (according to the Working formulation ) were treated subsequently using the 2 x2 Gy scheme as published in 2001 by Girinsky et al.: Of 48 patients, 80% were pretreated with at least 2 different chemotherapy schedules in their past medical history. A total of 135 sites were treated using 2 x 2 Gy and this resulted in a 51% CR rate. Positive predictors were a lymphoma <5cm, less previous chemotherapies, and an age < 65 years [26]. Based on th ese data, a prospective multicenter phase 2 trial with 109 patients and recurrent indolent lymphoma was initiated and published by Haas et al in 2003 [5]. They reported a response rate of 92% and a CR rate of 61% (72% in patients without previous therapy). The local PFS in patients who achieved a CR was 75% after 2 years. The median local PFS was at 42 months. Luthy et al. treated 33 patients with advanced or recurrent indolent lymphoma also using the 2 x 2 Gy schedule [27]. They described a CR rate of even 84%. However, they also reported 23% infield recurrences after a ti me of 9 month s (median) . Achievement of CR was not a positive predictor. In summary, the CR rates after 2 x 2 Gy irradiation ranged between 37 and 84% (Table 2) Table 2: Response (PR/CR) und rate of CR after 2 x 2 Gy IF radiotherapy (based on Luthy et al. [27] Author n Total response [%] CR [%] Ganem, 1994 [25] 27 89 37 Sawyer, 1997 [28] 11 94 38 Girinsky, 2001 [26] 48 81 57 Johannsson, 2002 [29] 22 87 65 Haas, 2003 [5] 109 92 61 Luthy, 2008 [27] 33 95 84 Hoskin, 2014 [6] 243 80 48 The mode of action of 2 x 2 Gy is not completely understood . An induction of the p53 pathway is discussed [30]. Knoops et al. looked at lymph node biopsies before and after LDRT. The y found an"
26,page_26,"GAZ AI EudraCT: 2016 -002059 -89 Version: 1.2/ 06.10 .2017 CONFIDENTIAL -2_20171006_final Seite 27 von 74 upregulation of p53 expression in 10 of 15 samples. An increase of the p53 immuno -staining from 5% to >80% was seen in 7 samples [31]. This effect was observed primarily in the follicular lymphoma cells and not in T -cells or endothelial cells visible. In vivo imaging lead to the speculation, that LDRT neutralizes anti -apoptotic effe cts of the characteristic bcl -2 overexpression in follicular lymphoma cells [32]. The British FORT trial prospectively tested 12 x 2 Gy against 2 x 2 Gy in the treatment of indolent lymphomas in a randomized fashion. Recruitment was stopped shortly before the end of the trial was reached due to the superiority of the 24 Gy arm (freedom from local progression after 2 years 93.7% vs. 80.4%) [33]. The CR rate was 40% after LDRT (total response rate 74%) and 60% after 24 Gy (total response rate 81%). For follicular lympho mas, the final results showed a CR rate of 48% after LDRT and 68% after 24 Gy (p = 0.0096) . There were significantly more recur rences (n=70) in the LDRT arm after a median follow -up time of 26 months as compared to the standard 24 Gy arm (21 recurrences; HR 3.42; p<0.0001) [6]. However , this trial also has some major weaknesses [34]: The inferiority regarding the PFS could have been strengthened by a possible imbalance between the two arms: There was no differentiation between follicular lymphoma grade 1, 2, 3a or 3b. A central review of the pathology confirmed only in 60% a follicular or a marginal zone lymphoma. There was no central pathological review in 20% of the patients and other lymphomas (also aggressive lymphomas) or no lymphoma at all were diagnosed in th e other cases. It was not stratifi ed after the size of the lesion. T here was also no maximal size limitation and different response rate s in relation to the size were not discussed. No difference in the PFS was seen in a subgroup analysis of all patients ( 4 Gy and 24 Gy), but there was no information about the effect of the different doses in respect to the size of the lesion. There was no information about previous and following treatments. In the staging and follow -up procedures, 3D imaging was not manda tory, conventional x -ray and clinical evaluations only were also allowed. It is not clear, how many of these patients were evaluated only clinically without 3D imaging. Unfortunately, there was also no information about the best response status of the patients with recurrence. In summary, the FORT trial showed some effectiveness after LDRT, but it is not clear whether the difference between LDRT and 24 Gy was as large as published considering the above mentioned weaknesses. 1.1.3 Chemotherapy and radiation ther apy In the 70ties and 80ties, several trials addressed the possibility that relapse control could be improved by a combination of radiation therapy with systemic chemotherapy [35-38]. The sequential application of COP or CHOP -B and IF radiation therapy showed a n improvement of the recurrence -free survival but not of the overall survival compared with historical data [39]. An update of the data revealed a 10 years recurrence free survival of 72%, which is superior to historical controls [40]. However, 22% of the patients developed a neutropenia grade IV and there were 14 secondary malignancies. 1.1.4 Immunotherapy using an anti -CD20 -Antibody (MabThera / Rituximab) In early and advan ced stage CD20 positive follicular lymphoma , the use of the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab has been evaluated as monotherapy or in combination with ch emotherapy in several trials. The effectiveness of Rituximab without chemotherapy was tested in the SAKK 35/09 trial using two different dose schedules (4x vs. 8x) [41]. Most of the 202 included patients had an advanced dise ase, only 15% had a clinical stage I or II according to the Ann Arbor classification. Thirty -eight percent of the patients of the 8x arm showed a CR during follow -up. The highest CR rate was achieved in patients without previous chemotherapy in their medic al history and 8 cycles of MabThera (52%) [41]. However, there was no plateau of the PFS curve in the long -term follow -up. The above -mentioned best subgroup had a PFS of 70% after 2 years and 45% after 5 years (median PFS 43 months) [42]."

The recruitment of 85 patients was finished in 2010. The final clinical results were presented on the annual meeting of the European Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ESTRO) 2014 in Vienna [4]: The effectiveness was comparable with the superior arm of the ARO98 -01 trial (TLI) but with a lower morbidity profile. The PFS rate after 2 years was 86%. The CR rate after 4 cycles of M abThera (without radiation) was 29% in patients with macroscopic disease at inclusion. Best morphologic response was reached at mo nth 6 with a CR rate of 79%. The final results are going to be published after integration of the scientific MRD data. 1.1.6 FDG -PET for staging and response evaluation The sensitivity and specificity of a FDG -PET examination for staging purposes is very high [44-46]. Tskamoto describes a sensitivity of 91% in 193 regions with involvement of follicular lymphoma [45]. Only the involvement of t he duodenum in 3 patients was not detected. Elstrom et al. reported of similar results (sens itivity 98% in 42 patients) [46]. A sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 94% were presented by Wöhrer et al. in 62 patients with different grades of follicular lymphoma. These were lower if conventional staging methods were used (sensitivity 95%, specificity 80%) [44]. Luminari et al. looked at the consequences of an FDG -PET in 142 patients of the FOLL05 trial who were primarily staged by CT: Based on the FDG -PET, 32% mo re involved lymph node regions were detected (46/146). Less involved regions were diagnosed in 11%. A stage shift into a more advanced stage was diagnosed in 11% due to t he FDG -PET [47]. The Cheson criteria of 2007 recommend FDG -PET for response evaluation in patients with Hodgkin `s lymphoma or aggressive lymphomas [48, 49] . In these days, there was no statement for the use of FDG -PET for staging and response evaluation in indolent lymphomas due to the lack of consequences. However, it was recommended for clinical trials if the primary endpoint would be CR [48]. The current updat e from 2014 [50] includes now the use of FDG -PET for staging also for follicular lymphomas to avoid an “under staging” (up staging in 8 -41%). The 5 -PS score is recommended for interpretation of the results. The inclu sion of FDG PET for staging also for follicular lymphoma was also based on the results of the PRIMA trial: A positive FDG -PET in the response evaluation showed to be a highly negative predictive value [7, 51] . Patients, who were PET negative after inductio n chemotherapy had a significant higher PFS after 42 months than PET positive patients (71% vs. 33%; p<0.001). The PET signal was an independent prognostic marker. Similar observation were made in the Italian FOLL05 trial [52]: PET negative patients had a significant superior PFS after 3 years compared to PET positive patients (66% vs. 35%, p<0.001). Looking only at the morphologic changes via CT, the prognostic difference between CR and non -CR was much weaker (3 -years PFS 63% vs. 51%; p=0.04). The prognostic value was highest in case of a negative FDG -PET and a morpho logical PR in the CT scan [52]. 1.2 Rational for the Current T rial Concept The MIR trial has shown that the radiation volumes could be significantly reduced without compromising the effectiveness of the historical large field irradiation. The toxicity of the combined approach of an anti -CD20 antibody and an involved field radiotherapy was much lower than the historical data of large field irradiation. Therefore, the combination of an anti -CD20 antibody with small field irradiation of the involved sites will probably become the new standard in the treatment of early stage nodal follicular lymphoma grade 1 and grade 2. Low dose radiation therapy"
28,page_28,"GAZ AI EudraCT: 2016 -002059 -89 Version: 1.2/ 06.10 .2017 CONFIDENTIAL -2_20171006_final Seite 29 von 74 After the reduction of the radiation field, a marked reduction of the radiation dose should be tested prospectively: the combination of an a nti-CD20 antibody and low dose radiation therapy ( LDRT ). Although the FORT trial resulted in an inferiority of LDRT compared to higher dose irradiation, it also showed effectiveness in part of the patients with follicular lymphoma (CR rate 48%) . In the GAZ AI trial, the concept of LDRT with 2x2 Gy will for the first time be evaluated prospectively in a homogenous cohort of newly diagnosed, non -pretreated, and strictly examined FL grade 1 / 2 stage I/II patients. All diagnoses will be confirmed by central his tological review. Involved -site irradiation will be combined with immunotherapy with an improved anti -CD20 antibody (Gazyvaro) with the aim to control occult systemic disease and prevent distant relapse. Additionally, there will be a precisely defined salv age option for those patients who do not achieve CR after the combined LDRT and antibody treatment. These patients will receive additional radiation therapy with 36 Gy (5x2 Gy/week) adding up to a total of 40 Gy which was the established dose of the MIR tr ial. This salvage dose is , therefore , response adapted for those patients who do not sufficient ly respon d to LDRT . Role of FDG -PET The routine staging diagnostic procedures using CT/MRI will be augmented by a FDG -PET/CT examination in the GAZAI trial. The total radiation dose will then be defined response adapted by a second FDG -PET. Since the sensitivity and specificity of FDG -PET is higher compared to sole morphological imaging, all patients will get an initial FDG -PET/CT. This has to be performed at least 5 weeks after a surgical procedure (e.g. lymph node sampling) for minimizing the risk of false positive results. LDRT alone of the involved lymph nodes regions results in responses shown in Table 2 . However, LDRT alone leads less often to a CR than a full dose radiation therapy in these patients (see Table 1 and 2 and the FORT trial). Since a negative FDG -PET is an independent predictive factor regarding PFS [7, 51] , the decision for or against salvage radiation will be done based on a restaging FDG -PET/CT (FDG -PET positive: salvage RT of additional 18 x 2 Gy; FDG -PET negative: no salvage RT). Since only patients with initially PET positive lymph nodes are valuable for the evaluation of the primar y endpoint (metabolic CR rate a fter LDRT and anti -CD20 antibody), the FDG -PET in week 18 can be omitted in case o f FD G-PET negativity at the ini tial staging (e.g. all macroscopic pathological lymph nodes were surgically removed) . Obitunuzumab (Gazyvaro) The additional use of Rituximab in the radiation treatment of the early stages of nodular follicular lymphomas has bee n successfully proven in the MIR trial. However, Rituximab is a chimeric antibody and known to i nduce allergic reactions. One patient in the MIR trial could not complete the treatment due to an allergic reaction to Rituximab. It will, therefore , be useful to use a third generation humanized antibody instead. Obinutuzumab is a humani zed anti -CD20 antibody, which has already been approved for the treatment of CLL : Obinutuzumab showed superior results compared to Rituximab in an interim analysis of a prospective randomized trial [53, 54] . In follicular lymphoma, Obinutuzumab showed improved response rates in phase II trials if compared to Rituximab [55, 56] . A pr ospective randomized tri al comparing Rituximab and Obinutuzumab in combination with a chemotherapy has completed recruitment. Just recently, primary results of the GADOLIN trial for Rituximab in refractory or fast recurrent follicular lymphoma resulted in the EMA registration of Gazyvaro in combination with Bendamustin chemotherapy. The combination of Bendamustin with Gazyvaro resulted in a 52% risk reduction for recurrence or death compared to Bendamustin alone [8, 57] ."
29,page_29,"GAZ AI EudraCT: 2016 -002059 -89 Version: 1.2/ 06.10 .2017 CONFIDENTIAL -2_20171006_final Seite 30 von 74 Based on th ese results, it can be assumed that the use of Obinutuzumab may induce a higher CR rate compared to the Rituximab data of the MIR trial . It might be , therefore , an ideal partner for LDRT and should reduce the portion of patients who need salvage RT. Additionally, QLQ data and MRD data can be used for historical comparison with the use of Rituximab in the MIR trial. 1.3 Benefit -/ Risk -Assessment The standard treatment for the early stages of follicular lymphoma is under permanent discussion. Treatment recommendations range from watch & wait (with deferement of treatment until progression ) to large field irr adiations. The combination of involved-field irradiation and use of MabThera becomes more and more popular after the successful completion of the MIR trial. This includes an off -label use of MabThera, which is only accredited in the combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of follicular lymphoma. The actual trial offers the chance of a substantial reduction of the radiation time (2 instead of 20 fractions in the best case) and the radiation dose (10% of the radiation dose in the best case). In any case, no patient will receive a higher radiation treatment dose compared to the dose of the MIR trial. In addition to and in comparison with the MIR trial, the patients are treated with a huma nized CD20 antibody with less allergic potential, receive only 7 instead of 8 administrations, and a potentially more efficent antibody as shown in CLL. The use of LD RT has a higher risk of recurrence compared to a higher radiation dose according to the FORT trial. This risk will be minimized by additional salvage radiation up to the ”full dose” in case of a failure to reach a complete remission. The use of FDG -PET/CT strengthens the initial staging and the evaluation of the response. The remaining risk of a late in-field recur rence after Obinutuzumab and LDRT has to be balanced against the substantially reduced radiation dose to the patent. In addition, “full dose” radiation therapy is still possible in case of a late recurrence . 1.4 Additional Scientific Project The members of the pathology panel of the GLSG will conduct the pathological scientific add -on project. Genetic and molecular examinations of the already excised lymphoma specimen will be tested for different subgroups, which might result in the generation of new hypothesis [58, 59] . The genetic and molecular research strictly limited to all aspect s of the lymphoma disease. The detection of certain genetic profiles, which might predict the response to LDRT is one of the goals of thes e studies . 1.5 Committe es The following committees were initiated to control certain aspects during the course of the trial: 1.5.1 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) The DMC consists of independent experts in the treatment of malignant lymphomas. The DMC should evaluate the conduct of the trial , the safety , and the achievements of the major endpoints. The duty of the DMC is to secure the ethicall y correct conduct of t he trial and to protect the interests of safety for the patients. The DMC will meet on a regular basis (GLSG annual meetings). The DMC will give recommendations to the LKP regarding modifications, stopping or continuation of the clinical trial. Those recomm endations should be send to the LKP in written form with in 2 months after the meeting. The DMC will get the annual DSURs. The members of the DMC are listed in the protocol."

OBJECTIVES AND EN DPOINTS 2.1 Study Objectiv es The rate of metabolic CR after low -dose radiotherapy in combination with Gazyvaro (Obinutuzumab) for early stage nodal follicular lymphoma will be assessed. In addition, the feasibility of a response adapted approach using FDG -PET/CT regarding success (PFS, rates of remission, analysis of recurrences) and safety in combination with Gazyvaro will be assessed. The results will be historically compa red to t he re sults of the MIR trial regarding morphologic response in week 7 and the quality of life (secondary endpoints). Additional secondary endpoints are PFS, the site of recurrences in the three subgroups (1. PET negative after initial staging; 2. PE T negative in week 18; 3. PET positive in week 18). 2.2 Primary Endpoint  Metabolic complete response (CR) in week 18 in patients with initially remaining lymphoma judged by FDG -PET/CT 2.3 Secondary Endpoints  Morphologic CR, PR, SD, PD in week 7, week 18 and month 6 in patients with initially remaining lymphoma judged by CT/MRI  Historical comparison of the morphologic response with MIR data (using MabThera); The comparison of the CR rate in week 7 will allow f or a comparison of the two different CD20 antibodies. Due to the restricted patient numbers no matched pair analysis will be possible  Progression free survival (PFS) of all treated patients (2 years after individual treatment start)  Toxicity (NCI -CTC crite ria, version 4.03) of all patients  Relapse rate and pattern of recurrence of all treated patients at all follow -up visits.  Overall survival (OS) of all treated patients (2 years)  Quality of life according EORTC QLQ C30 and FACT -Lym question naires at inclus ion and in week 18, month 12, and 24 (all treated patients)  MRD response in peripheral blood: initially, week 18, months 6, 12, 18 and 24 (all treated patients). MRD is evaluated by the laboratory of C. Pott (Kiel) using at least the markers: t(14:18) PCR for MBR, 3’mbr, 5’mcr and MCR; clonal IGH rearrangements (FR1 -3); clonal IGL rearrangements (IGK and Kappa -KDE) 2.4 Additional Scientific Program  Genetic and molecular profiling of responders and non -responders (coordinated by W. Klapper, Kiel) 2.5 Extended Follow -up Phase (Register Phase) The GAZAI trial ends 30 months after the first Gazyvaro infusion for each individual patient.

TRIAL CONCEPT/ DE SIGN GAZAI is a prospective, open, nationally multi -center phase II trial for evaluation of LD RT in combination with Gazyvaro (Obinutuzumab) in patients with early stage nodal follicular lymphoma grade 1/2. Patients will get a completion of the “full” radiation dose in case of not reaching a sufficient respo nse (metabolic CR AND morphologic PR/CR) after LDRT . 4. DURATION OF THE T RIAL AND EARLY STOPP ING 4.1 Duration and Time L ine The individual duration for each participant is 30 months. Patients may enter in a succeeding register phase without trial speci fic appointments or examinations. Initial therapy phase: 3 months Week 1 -4 and week 8: 1 x weekly Gazyvaro (1000mg flat dose) Week 9: Radiation therapy: 2x2 Gy involved -site Week 12, 16: 1x weekly Gazyvaro (1000mg flat dose) Week 18: Re -Staging (if applicable) Week 20 -23: Radiation therapy 18 x 2 Gy involved -site (if applicable) Follow -up Phase: Month 6 – month 30 months (every 6 months) The trial (FPI – LPO) will last approximately 5.5 years. The duration of patient recruitment is estimated with 3. 5 years and starts in Q4 2017 . Length of the clinical phase: 5.5 years (66 months) Start of trial preparation: Q1 2015 FPI (First Patient In): Q4 2017 LPI (Last Patient In): Q1 2021 LPO (Last Patient Out): Q3 2023 DBL (Data Base Lock): Q1 2024 Completion of the statistical analysis: Q2 2024 Completion of the trial report: Q3 2024 4.2 Early Stopping of the Trial or Early Stopping of a Trial S ite The tri al can be stopped by the LKP if the DMC detects an unexpected accumulation of side effects (each grade 5, 2 succeeding grade 4 or 3 succeeding grade 3 CTC side effects), has new informat ion about the effect -risk ratio of the investigated therapy or the used methods of examination. Th e trial can also be stopped by the LKP if recruitment is below the expectations and cannot be improved. All investigators have to be informed im mediately about a stopping or a permanent ending of the trial. The participating sites must accept the decision."

A participating site can also be closed early by the LKP if the site does not act according to ICH -GCP or according to the trial protocol or the recruitment or the qu ality of the data is below the expectations. If the DMC suggests an interruption or an ending of the trial due to SAE evaluations or other reasons, the ethical board and the authorities (BOB and sate authori ty) have to be informed. The Ethi cal Board and th e authorities can also decide about an interruption or an ending of the trial. 5. PARTICIPANTS 5.1 Number of P articipants As described in the chapter Sample Size Calculation, a max imum of 93 patients will be included in the trial. The recruitment will be stopped, if ( whatever occurs first)  79 patients will have a FDG -PET/CT confirmed stage I/II follicular lymphoma and a trial specific therapy has been initiated or  55 patients had a second restaging FDG -PET/CT in week 18 or  93 patients were included Recruit ment and treatment of the participating patients will be performed in 15 locations/30 sites (each location consists of a radiation oncology site and a hemato -oncology site). The sites should have experience in the treatment of early stage follicular lympho ma (min. 5 patients / year). The sites should have the infrastructure for execution and documentation of a clinical trial according the AMG, Röntgenverordnung and Strahlenschutzverordnung. There must be the possibility to conduct a FDG -PET/CT. Each locati on should include 6 -7 patients. All sites, which successfully recruited and completely documented the therapy and follow -up of at least 4 patients will be considered for author ship in the final publication. 5.2 Common Criteria for Patient S election Patien ts (≥18 yrs) with histologically proven and centrally histologically reviewed nodal follicular lymphoma grade 1 or grade 2 in the clinical stage I or II (Ann Arbor classification) should be included. The biopsy must be performed within the last 6 months an d the complete staging must be within the last 4 months. A fine needle biopsy is not sufficient for a qualified diagnosis. The diagnosis must be centrally verified by one of the reference pathologists of the GLSG. Gender According to the MIR data, no gender specific effects regarding the efficacy or the safety are anticipated. It is expected that the distribution of gender in the trial mirrors the natural distribution of the disease. 5.3 Inclusion C riteria  Centrally reviewed CD20 -positive follicular lymphoma grad e 1/2 based on WHO classification (2008)  Untreated (radiation -, chemo - or immunotherapy) nodal lymphoma (including involvement of Waldeyer´s ring)  Age: ≥18 years  ECOG: 0 -2"

Obinutuzumab was derived by humanization of the parental B -Ly1 mouse antibody and subsequent glycoengineering leading to the following characteristics: high -affinity binding to t he CD20 antigen, high antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and antibody -dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP); low complement - dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity; and high direct cell death induction. Proprietary name: GAZYVARO® International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Obinutuzumab ATC code, if officially registered: L01XC15 Manufacturer: Roche Pharma AG Pharmaceutical formulation: Obinutuzumab is provided as a single 1000 mg dose liquid concentrate with a strength of 25 mg/mL. It is supplied in 50 mL glass vials containing 40 mL of the 25 mg/mL liquid concentrate. In addition to the antibody, the liquid also contains histidine/histi dine-HCl, trehalose, poloxamer 188 and HPW. Mode of administration: iv infusion Batch no.: Storage instructions: Store in a refrigerator (2 °C -8 °C) . Do not freeze . Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light. From a microbiological point of view, the prepared infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C-8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 6.3 Therapeutic Effects of Gazyvaro (Cited from IB, September 2014) Non-clinical in vitro studies show that Obinutuzumab mediates superior induction of direct cell death and effector cell -mediated ADCC and ADCP on a panel of NHL cell lines as compared to the type I CD20 antibodies rituximab and Ofatumumab. Its potency to mediate CDC is significantly reduced as compared to these two antibodies. In ex vivo autologous whole blood B -cell depletion studies with blood from healthy volunteers as well as CLL patients, Obinutuzumab mediated superior B -cell"

These properties of Obinut uzumab translated into superior anti -tumor efficacy in direct comparison to Rituximab against a number of aggressive subcutaneous (SC) and disseminated NHL xenograft models. The efficacious and optimal dose range of Obinutuzumab in xenograft models was in the range of 10 -30 mg/kg, corresponding to trough levels of 300 -600 μg/mL. Treatment with Obinutuzumab resulted in potent and superior depletion of B -cells in the peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissues of hCD20 transgenic mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Vac cination studies in cynomolgus monkeys and human CD20 transgenic mice showed that the enhanced efficacy in terms of B-cell depletion of Obinutuzumab translated into suppression of de novo antibody responses, but left the protective humoral memory responses intact. The data generated to date imply that Obinutuzumab represents a novel therapeutic CD20 antibody with outstanding efficacy compared to classical Type I and non -ADCC enhanced CD20 antibodies, such as Rituximab and Ofatumumab . 6.4 Known Side E ffects (Cited from ANEX I. package leaflet amended by the GADOLIN data [8]) Important risks identified in clinical investigations with Obinutuzumab were: IRRs (infusion related reactions, TLS (tumor lysis syndrome), thrombocytopenia (including acute thrombocytopenia), neutropenia (including prolonged and late onset neutropenia), prolonged B -cell depletion, infections (including hepa titis B reactivation and PML), worsening of pre -existing cardiac conditions and GI perforation. 6.4.1 Infusion -related reactions (IRRs) The incidence of IRRs was higher in the Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm compared to the Rituximab plus chlorambucil arm . The incidence of IRRs was 65% with the infusion of the first 1,000 mg of Gazyvaro (20% of patients experiencing a Grade 3 -4 IRR, with no fatal events reported). Overall, 7% of patients experienced an IRR leading to discontinuation of Gazyvaro. The incide nce of IRRs with subsequent infusions was 3% with the second 1,000 mg dose and 1% thereafter. No Grade 3 -5 IRRs were reported beyond the first 1,000 mg infusions of Cycle 1. IRRs grade 3 -5 occurred in 11% of the patients in the Bendamustin /Obinut uzumab ar m compared to 6% in the Benda mustin only arm in the GADOLIN trial [8]. Most frequently reported symptoms associated with an IRR were nausea, chills, hypotension, pyrexia, vomiting, dyspnea, flushing, hypertension, headache, tach ycardia, and diarrhea. Respiratory and cardiac symptoms such as bronchospasm, larynx and throat i rritation, wheezing, laryngeal edema and atrial fibrillation have also been reported . 6.4.2 Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis has been reported in patients treated with Gazyvaro. Hypersensitivity may be difficult to distinguish from IRRs. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected during infusion (e.g. symptoms typically occurring after previous exposure and very rarely with the fir st infusion), the infusion must be stopped and treatment permanently discontinued. Patients with known IgE mediated hypersensitivity to obinutuzumab must not be treated. 6.4.3 Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported with Gazyvaro. Patients who are considered to be at risk of TLS (e.g. patients with a high tumour burden and/or a high circulating lymphocyte count [> 25 x 109/L] and/or renal impairment [CrCl <70 mL/min]) should receive prophylaxis. Prophylaxis should"

All patient s considered at risk should be carefully monitored during the initial days of treatment with a special focus on renal function, potassium, and uric acid values. Any additional guidelines according to standard practice should be followed. For treatment of T LS, correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as indicated. 6.4.4 Neutropenia and infections The incidence of neutropenia was higher in the Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm compared to the rituximab plus chlorambucil arm with the neutropenia resolving spontaneously or with use of granulocyte -colony stimulating factors. The incidence of infection was 38% in the Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm and 37% in the rituximab plus c hlorambucil arm (with Grade 3 -5 events reported in 12% and 14%, respectively and fatal events reported in < 1% in both treatment arms). Cases of prolonged neutropenia (2% in the Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm and 4% in the rituximab plus chlorambucil arm) and late onset neutropenia (16% in the Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm and 12% in the rituximab plus chlorambucil arm) were also reported. Concerning treatment of follicular lymphoma in the GADOLIN trial, the grade 3 -5 neutropenia reached 33% in the Bendamu stin/Obinutuzumab arm compared to 26% in the Bendamustin only arm. Serious (grade 3 -5) infections were reported in 18% or 17%, respectively [8] 6.4.5 Thrombocytopenia The incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher in the Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil arm compared to the rituximab plus chlorambucil arm especially during the first cycle. Four percent of patients treated with Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil experienced acute thrombocytopenia (occurring within 24 hours after the Gazy varo infusion) . The overall incidence of hemorrhagic even ts was similar in the Gazyvaro treated arm and in the rituximab treated arm. The number of fatal hemorrhagic events was balanced between the treatment arms; however, all of the events in patients treated with Gazyvaro were reported in Cycle 1. A clear rela tionship between thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic events has not been established. The reported thrombocytopenia (grade 3 -5) in the GADOLIN trial was 11% in the arm with Obinutuzumab and 16% in the Bendamustin only arm [8] 6.4.6 Special populations Elderly In the pivotal study, 46% (156 out of 336) of patients with CLL treated with Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil were 75 years old or older (median age was 74 years). These patients experienced more serious adverse events and adverse events leading to death than th ose patients < 75 years of age. Renal impairment In the pivotal study, 27% (90 out of 336) of patients with CLL treated with Gazyvaro plus chlorambucil had moderate renal impairment (CrCl < 50 mL/min). These patients experienced more serious adverse even ts and adverse events leading to death than those with CrCl ≥50 mL/min. Additional safety information from clinical studies experience Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported in patients treated with"

The diagnosis of PML should be considered in any patient presenting with new -onset or changes to pre -existing neurologic manifestations. The symptoms of PML are unspecific and can vary depending on the affected region of th e brain. Motor symptoms with corticospinal tract findings (e.g. muscular weakness, paralysis and sensory disturbances), sensory abnormalities, cerebellar symptoms, and visual field defects are common. Some signs/symptoms regarded as “cortical” (e.g. aphasi a or visual -spatial disorientation) may occur. Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture (cerebrospinal fluid testing for John Cunningham viral DNA). Ther apy with Gazyvaro should be withheld during the investigation of potential PML and permanently discontinued in case of confirmed PML. Discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should also be considered. The p atient should be referred to a neurologist for the evaluation and treatment of PML. Hepatitis B reactivation Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death, can occur in patients treated wi th anti -CD20 antibodies incl uding Gazyvaro . Hepatitis B virus screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with Gazyvaro. At a minimum this should include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) status and hepatitis B core antib ody (HBcAb) status. These can be complemented with other appropriate markers as per local guidelines. Patients with active hepatitis B disease (all HBsAg positive and all HBcAb positive/HBV DNA positive) must not be treated with Gazyvaro. Patients with HBc Ab positive /HBV -DNA negative status should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis reactivation (e.g. Entecavir®). Worsening of pre -existing cardiac conditions Cases of arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation and tachyarrhythmia), angina pectoris, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction and heart failure have occurred when treated with Gazyvaro . These events m ay occur as part of an IRR and can be fatal. Laboratory abnormalities Transient elevation in liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase) has been observed shortly after the first infusion of Gazy varo. The most frequently observed identified risk in patients receiving Obinutuzumab was IRRs; these occurred predominantly during the first infusion/first cycle. In patients with CLL as observed in study BO21004, the incidence and severity of infusion r elated symptoms decreased substantially with subsequent infusions, with most patients having no IRRs during the second and subsequent administrations of Obinutuzumab. In patients with NHL as observed in study GAO4753g, the incidence of IRRs was highest dur ing the first cycle (55.2%), and gradually decreased during subsequent cycles (24.3%, 21.8%, 13.7%, 14.8%, 10.3% during Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively). The commonly experienced IRRs are characterized by nausea, fatigue, chills, hypotension, fever, vomiting, dyspnea, flushing, hypertension, headache, tachycardia, dizziness, diarrhea amongst other symptoms. Respiratory and cardiac symptoms, such as bronchospasm, larynx and throat i rritation, wheezing, laryngeal edema and atrial fibrillation have also been reported. In the majority of patients, IRRs were mild or moderate and could be managed by the slowing or temporary halting the first infusion but severe IRRs requiring symptomatic treatment have also been reported. IRRs may be clinically indistinguis hable from IgE -mediated allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis). Patients with a high tumor burden (e.g. high peripheral lymphocyte count in CLL [> 25 × 109/L]) may be at increased risk of severe IRR."

It reflects drug efficacy. However, B -cell depletion could increase the risk of infection, including serious infections, and/or reactivation of latent viral infections. Ove rall, although Obinutuzumab has a potent and prolonged effect on B -cell depletion; the AEs observed in trials did not suggest any clinically relevant effect. Potentially B -cell depletion can be associated with the risk of PML and Hepatitis B reactivation ( which are analyzed and described separately). In addition, immunization with live or attenuated viral vaccines, following Obinutuzumab treatment has not been studied, therefore the vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and unti l B-cell recovery. Postponing vaccination with live vaccines should be considered for infants born to mothers who have been exposed to Obinutuzumab during pregnancy until the infants’ B -cell levels are within normal ranges. 6.5 Dosage and D osage Schedule 6.5.1 Dosage The recommended dose of Gazyvaro is 1,000 mg. 6.5.2 Instruction for dilution Gazyvaro should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Do not shake the vial. Withdraw 40 mL of concentrate from the vial and dilute in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or non -PVC polyolefin infusion bags containing 250 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. After dilution, chemical and physical stability have been demon strated in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection at concentrations of 0.4 mg/mL to 20 mg/mL for 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C followed by 48 hours (including infusion time) at ≤ 30°C. From a microbiological point of view, the prepared infusion so lution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in -use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C -8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and val idated aseptic conditions. Do not use other diluents such as glucose (5%) solution . The bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid excessive foaming. The diluted solution should not be shaken or frozen. Parenteral medicinal produ cts should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration prior to administration. 6.5.3 Administration of Gazyvaro Gazyvaro has to be administered as an intravenous infusion by experienced medical oncologists in a medical institution and with direct access to emergency facility, where emergency situations can be handled immediately. The administration can be done in an out -patient setting, if these preconditions are fulfilled. After the end of administration patients should be monitored ar ound ≥ 1 hours with remaining catheter to give the possibility for administration of drugs if required. If no reactions occur during this period of observation, the patients may be discharged. Patients with pre -existing cardiac or pulmonary disease"

The rate of the infusion can be escalated in increments of 50 mg/hr every 30 minutes to a maximum rate of 400 mg/hr. Cycles 2 -7 Day 1 (1000 mg) If there were no infusion related side effects during previous admin istrations, infusions can be started at a rate of 100 mg/hr and increased by 100 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr. Management of IRRs may require temporary interruption, reduction in the rate of infusion, or treatment discontinuations of Gazyvaro as outlined below . • Grade 4 (life threatening): Infusion must be stopped and therapy must be permanently discontinued. • Grade 3 (severe): Infusion must be temporarily stopped and symptoms treated. Upon resolution of symptoms, t he infusion can be restarted at no more than half the previous rate (the rate being used at the time that the IRR occurred) and, if the patient does not experience any IRR symptoms, the infusion rate escalation can resume at the increments and intervals as appropriate for the treatment dose (see above ). The infusion must be stopped and therapy permanently discontinued if the patient experiences a second occurrence of a Grade 3 IRR. • Grade 1 -2 (mild to moderate): The infusion rate must be reduced and symptom s treated. Infusion can be continued upon resolution of symptoms and, if the patient does not experience any IRR symptoms, the infusion rate escalation can resume at the increments and intervals as appropriate for the treatment dose (see Table 3).. Patients must not receive further Gazyvaro infusions if they experience: • acute life -threatening respiratory symptoms, • a Grade 4 (i.e. life threatening) IRR or, • a second occurrence of a Grade 3 (prolonged/recurrent) IRR (after resuming the first infusion or during a subsequent infusion). Patients who have pre -existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions should be monitored carefully throughout the infusion and the post -infusion period. Hypotension may occur during Gazyvaro intravenous infusions. Therefore, wi thholding of antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours prior to and throughout each Gazyvaro infusion and for the first hour after administration. Patients at acute risk of hypertensive crisis should be evaluated for the benefits and ri sks of withholding their anti -hypertensive medicine."

In clinical studies with Gazyvaro, doses ranging from 50 mg up to and including 2,000 mg per infusion have been administered. The incidence and intensity of adverse reactions reported in these studies did not appear to be dose dependent. Patients who experience overdose should have immediate interruption or reduction of their infusion and be closely supervised. Consideration should be given to the need for regular monitoring of blood cell count and for increased risk of infections while patients are B cell depleted. 6.5.6 Time W indow for the Gazyvaro A dministration Therapy starts after inclusion of the patient and reconfirmation of stage I/II disease by the initial FDG - PET/CT. Gazyvaro should be administered weekly (every 7 days) for the first 4 weeks (week 1 – week 4). A deviation of +/ - 2 days is defined as conform to the protocol. Additional infusions are scheduled for week 8, 12 and 16 (every 28 days). A deviation of +/ - 4 days is d efined as conform to the protocol. The LDRT (2x2 Gy) is scheduled for week 9 (after the 5.

All patients who might be suitable for inclusion and are under screening get a screening number. If the patient fits into the study in respect of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and if the patient agrees to participate in the trial (signed informed consent), the patient receives a running patient number. Patients who were excluded from the trial keep their screening and patient number. New participants always receive a new identification code (ID code). The ID code will be locally assigned (by the site, which includes the patients (hemato -oncology or radiation onc ology) and is composed of the site number and the running patient number with the prefix GAZ (e.g. GAZ -01-03). Each recruiting site keeps their own identification list. The same ID will be used by the treating hemato -oncology site and radiation oncology si te. 6.8 Packing and Labe ling The trial medication will be packed by Roche Pharma AG. One vial of 40 mL concentrate contains 1,000 mg obinutuzumab, corresponding to a concentration before dilution of 25 mg/mL. The trial medication will be provided free of charge by Roche Pharma AG (Roche Pharma AG, Postfach 1270, D -79630 Grenzach -Wyhlen) and will be delivered to the trial site or the pharmacy of the trial site. The trial medication will be labeled by Roche Pharm a AG according to § 5 of GCP -V. 6.9 Delivery and Drug Accountability The investigator will confirm correct receipt of the trial medication in writing and ensure that the medication is stored safely and correctly. The trial medication must be carefully st ored in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions at 2 -8 °C and dry at the study sites in a locked area with restricted access, separately from other drugs, and kept out of the reach and sight of children. The investigator will document the distribution and return of the trial medication to the patient with the date, reco rding the quantity distributed and used on the forms provided for this purpose. The site monitor will periodically check the supplies of trial medication held by the investigator to ensure the correct accountability of all trial medication used. At the end of the trial, all unused trial medication and all medication containers will be completely returned to Roche Pharma AG. It will be assured that a final report of the drug accountability is prepared and maintained by the investigator. The medicat ion must n ot be used after the expiry date , which is stated on the carton after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. 6.10 Ordering of Gazyvaro Each new patient will be reported to the trial center in Heidelberg by using the inclusion fax form send together with the order form for study medication .

If the central review confirms an early stage, the order fax will be send forward to Roche Pharma AG and the trial site will be informed. The delivery of all vials necessary for the patient will be carried out directly to the address of the site, which is noted on the order form. The delivery usually lasts 3 days. The trial center will inform the monitor about the order. Gazyvaro is labeled as trial medication and must not be given to patients other than within the trial. An early notification and good in ternal communication within the trial site (pharmacist, physician and investigator) is mandatory for a smooth order. 7 IRRADIATION The CT for 3D treatment planning is scheduled for week 7 and should be done using appropriate positioning devices (e.g. thermoplastic masks etc.) . The response to the first 4 Gazyvaro administrations is also assessed using this CT. The irradiation occurs in week 9 after der fifth Gazyvaro administration (week 8 ). 7.1 Target volume A 3D treatment planning is mandatory. The target volume should be assigned as involved s ite according to the guidelines of the International Lymphoma Radiation Group (ILROG) [60]: The clinical target volume (CTV) encompasses the original GTV (at study inclusion). Normal structures such as lungs, kid neys, and muscles that were clearly uni nvolved, though previously displaced by the GTV, should be excluded from the CTV according to clinical judgment . Potential subclinical involvement should also be considered. Therefore, the CTV should also include at least adjacent lymph nodes in that site and a generous margin dictated by the clinical situation. If there are questions about the delineation of the target volume the trial center in Heidelberg should be contacted. Although a LDRT with 2x2 Gy will be carried out initially, the treatment plan sh ould be prepared for a dose of 40 Gy in 20 fractions and the usual normal tissue constraints should be accepted for this dose. If a salvage irradiation is necessary after the FDG -PET/CT in week 18, the same irradiation plan should be used."

The dose delivery should be according ICRU50. The irradiation delivery may include photons, electrons and protons. 7.3 Salvage irradiation (week 20 -23) All patients with PET positive lymphoma before the first Gazyvaro administration (initial FDG - PET/CT), will get an additional FDG -PET/CT in week 18 which should be sent to the trial center in Heidelberg. All of those patients who d o not show a morphologic CR/PR or do not have a metabolic CR will get a salvage irradiation starting in week 20. The target volume is identical to the initial LDRT irradiation in week 9. The dose is 18 x 2 Gy (ICRU 50). The same positioning devices, the s ame planning CT and the same treatment plan as for the LDRT should be used (see above). 8. METHODS OF DATA COLL ECTION / STUDY VISIT S 8.1 Initial Staging The extent of the lymphoma manifestation will be assessed according the Ann -Arbor classification system and using 3D imaging and bone marrow aspiration. A pathological staging is not necessary. 8.1.1 Procedures Medical history (incl. of B -symptoms) Current medication Clinical examination (including palpation of lymph node regions) Shipping of the biopsy tissue to a reference pathologist of the GLSG Laboratory testing: - Differential blood cell count (hemoglobin, leucocytes, thrombocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes) - Clinica l chemistry (sodium, potassium , AST/ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatas e, creatinine ) - LDH - albumin, immunoglobulins, immunefixation - ß2 microglobuline - Peripheral blood (10 ml EDTA) for MRD analysis and STRECK tube (10 ml) for cell -free DNA collection - Hepatitis - und HIV – serology (not applicable if there are values < 3 months ) - Pregnancy test (serum) for all women with childbearing potential (including tubal ligation) CT or MRI (</= 4 months), if necessary: additional ultrasound - head&neck* - thorax* - abdomen* - pelvis including inguinal region* *These regions must be screened using 3D sectional imaging and should also be scanned during the follow -up examinations from months 6 on.

These investigations are planned and coordinated by the pathology panel of the GLSG. All investigations should serve the increase of knowledge about origin, expansion and therapy of malignant lymphomas. There might be new scientific questions/methods concerning the aim of the study, which cannot be addressed today (e.g. knowledge of a new genetic mutation in follicular lymphomas, new measurement tools, which allow a more sensitive evaluation of MRD,…). For this reason, blood and tissue samples should be stored for a n unlimited time or unti l the draw back of the patients consent. 8.2 FDG -PET/CT The FDG -PET/CT within the trial should be performed according to the recommendations of Juweid et al. [49]  There should be at least 5 weeks interval after a surgical intervention (e.g. lymph node extirpation)  No use of „non attenuation PET scans“  FDG dosage 3. 5 – 8 MBq/kg body weight with a minimal dose of 185 MBq  4 hours fasting before FDG injec tion  Glucose level < 200 mg/dL at the time of injection  Primary staging FDG -PET/CT : Whole body scanning 60 +/ - 10 minutes after FDG injection ; Week 18: Whole body PET scanning, CT scanning of the ini tially involved regions  contrast enhancing agents are not mandatory for the CT imaging  Oral contrast agent might be used for better differentiation of bowel and other structures The interpretation of the initial staging PET should be done using visual assessment, with PET/CT images scaled to fixed SUV display and color table [50] 8.3 Efficacy Parameters 8.3.1 Criteria of Remission of the FDG -PET (metabolic remission) The metabolic remission criteria of the PET scan is according to the revised Cheson criteria of 2014 under the use of the 5 -PS score [50, 62] . The 5 -PS scores the most intense uptake in a site of initial disease, if present, as follows: ● Score 1: No uptake ● Score 2: Uptake ≤ mediastinum ● Score 3: Uptake ≥ mediastinum but ≤ liver ● Score 4: Uptake moderately higher than liver ● Score 5: Uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions ● Score X: New areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma Complete Metabolic Response (CMR ) Score 1 and score 2.

Complete Response (CR) All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size (≤ 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes ≥ 1.5 cm before therapy). Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter before treatment must have decreased to ≤ 1 cm in their greatest transverse diameter after treatment, or by more than 75% in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters (SPD) . Complete Response/un confirmed (CRu) A residual lymph node mass greater than 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by more than 75% in the SPD. Individual nodes that were previously confluent must have regressed by more than 75% in their SPD compared with t he size of the original mass. Partial Response (PR) ≥ 50% decrease in SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according to the following features: (a) they should be clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions, (b) they should be from as disparate regions of the body as possible, and (c) they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved. Stable Disease (SD) Stable disease is defin ed as less than a PR but is not progressive disease Progressive Disease (PD) • ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previ ously identified abnormal node for PRs or non-responders. • Appearance of any new lesion during or at the end of therapy. 8.4 Parameters of safety Clinical examination and medical history, blood values at the above mentioned visits.

FOLLOW -UP AND POSSIBLE TREA TMENTS AFTER END OF TRIAL Follow -up procedures and possible further treatments after the trial (early ending or after month 30) should be performed according to local standard procedures at each site. The results of this extended follow -up should be collected with the consent of the patient as in a register. It is the goal to analyze these long time follow -up data retrospectively i n the future. In case of a recurrence at the primary involved site after 2x2 Gy, it should be respected , that a “full dose” up to the target dose of the MIR trial (40 Gy) should still be possible. 10. ADVERSE EVENTS 10.1 Definition s 10.1.1 Adverse Event According to GCP, an adverse event (AE) is defined as follows: Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An AE may be: - New symptoms/ medical conditions - New diagnosis - Changes of laboratory parameters The criteria that should be considered when determining whether an abnormal test finding should be reported as adverse event are as follows: - Test result is associated wi th accompanying symptoms, and/or - Test result require diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or - Test result lead to a change in trial dosing outside the protocol -stipulated dose adjustments, or discontinuation from the trial, significant a dditional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or - Test result is considered clinically relevant at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor - Intercurrent diseases and accidents - Worsening of medical conditions/ diseases existing before clinical trial start - Recurrence of disease - Increase of frequency or intensity of episodic diseases. A pre -existing disease or symptom will not be considered an adverse event unless there will be an untoward change in its intensity, frequency or quality . This change will be documented by an investigator. Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE. Planned surgical measures perm itted by the clinical trial protocol and the condition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition leading to the measure was present prior to inclusion into the trial. In the latter case the condition should be reported as medical history. AEs are classified as ""non -serious"" or ""serious""."

Hospitalisations for disease -related procedures (surgery, imaging, laboratory tests) or any procedures planned before entry into the study are not considered SAEs. Hospitalisations for social reasons in the absence of an adverse event are not classified as SAEs either. ** Persistent or significant disability or incapacity means that there is a substantial disruption of a person's a bility to carry out normal life functions. The irreversible injury of an organ function (e.g. paresis, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmia) fulfils this criterion. Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations - such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. These should also usually be considered serious (examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation; or development of drug depen dency or drug abuse). Progression of the malignancy under treatment needs not to be reported as an adverse event. 10.1.3 Serious Adverse Reaction, SAR SAEs that potentially may be attributed to the investigational medicinal product (IMP; Gazyvaro) are to be classified as Serious Adverse Reactions (SARs). This terminology is also used in the context of side effects due to irradiation. 10.1.4 Expectedness An ‘unexpected’ adverse reaction is one the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information, the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . Furthermore, reports , which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known adverse reaction constitute ‘unexpected’ events. 10.1.5 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse R eaction, SUSAR SAEs that are both ‘suspected’, i.e., possibly related to the study drug (investigational medicinal product (IMP)) and ‘unexpected’, i.e., the nature and/ or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information are to be classified as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs)."
53,page_53,"GAZ AI EudraCT: 2016 -002059 -89 Version: 1.2/ 06.10 .2017 CONFIDENTIAL -2_20171006_final Seite 54 von 74 In case, either the investigator who primary reported the SAE or the second assessor, classifies the SAE as ‘suspected’ and the SAE is unexpected it will be categorised as a SUSAR. All SUSARs are subject to an expedited reporting to the responsible ethics committee(s), the competent authority and to all participating investigators 10.1.6 AEs of special interest The following AEs of special interest (AESI) will be reported as AE and SAE, considered an “Important Medical Event” even if no other criteria for seriousness apply, on the appropriate pages of the CRF and in the source documents: - Non-drug specific Drug induced liver injury (DILI) The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by more frequent 3 -fold or greater elevations above the upper limits of normal (ULN) of ALT or AST than the (nonhepatotoxic) control agent or placebo. Among subjects showing such aminotransferase (AT) elevations, often with ATs much greater than 3 x ULN, some subjects also show elevation of serum total bilirubin (TBL) to ≥ 2 x ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity < 2 x ULN). No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased AT and serum TBL, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C, preexisting or acute liver disease, or another drug capable of causing the observed injury.) - Progressive multifocal leucoencephalophathy (PML) PML is a disease that is always serious, and that is fatal or sev erely debilitatingin the large majority of patients. There is a potential risk that B-cell depletion may have an impact on the incidence and severity of infections. Rituximab has been associated with serious viral infections including PML. As obinutuzumab is more potent in terms of B -cell depletion than rituximab, there may be an increased risk of infections with obinutuzumab compared to rituximab. PML occurs almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients with deficits in the humoral or cellular immune re sponse or both. PML has been observed most frequently in subjects with hematological malignancies (e.g. NHL and CLL) as well as subjects with liver transplants and autoimmune disease (e.g. SLE) [66]. - Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (STIAMP) The definition of STIAMP is any organism, virus or infectious particle (e.g. prion protein transmitting Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product. As in the case of suspected adverse reactions and adverse reactions, the terms suspected transmission and transmission are consider ed synonymous. Confirmation of contamination (including inadequate inactivation/attenuation of infectious agents as active substances) of the concerned medicinal product increases the evidence for transmission of an infectious agent."

The metabolic abnormalities include: hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia and hyperp hosphatemia with secondary hypocalcaemia with risk of renal failure. TLS has been reported in patients receiving anti-CD20 antibody therapy plus chemotherapy. The presence of known risk factors such as bulky disease, preexisting (moderate) renal insuffici ency, high ALC and high uric acid levels (> 8 mg/dL) prior to therapy are known to increase the likelihood of TLS. Early identification of patients at risk and the prevention of TLS development with the initiation of preventive measures, as well as the car eful monitoring for early signs of laboratory TLS and the prompt initiation of supportive care are critical to prevent potentially life -threatening metabolic derangements [64]. All AESIs will be entered into the pharmacovigilance database. However, if none of the ‘seriousness’ criteria applies, the AESIs are not to be handled as serious adverse events. He nce, even if they are ‘unexpected’ and potentially related to the IMP, they will not undergo expedited reporting. 10.1.7 Grading of AEs The grading of AEs in this trial will be carried out on the basis of the 5 -grade scale defined in the CTCAE v4.03 : Grade 1: Mild Grade 2: Moderate Grade 3: Severe Grade 4: Life threatening or causing disablement Grade 5: Death The grading of all AEs listed in the CTCAE v4.03 will be based on the information contained therein. The gradin g of all other AEs, i.e., those, which are not listed in the CTCAE v4.03 will be performed by a responsible investigator, based on definitions given above. Clarification of the difference in meaning between ""serious"" and ""severe"": The terms “serious” and “ severe” are not synonymous. The term ‘severe’ should be used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on the existence of one of the above mentioned seriousness criteria. If the intensity of AEs worsened or if there are different CTC -grades during the course of trial, the highest intensity should be documented generally. If applicable, dependent on the AE, one AE for each intensity level should be recorded. In case of lab parameters of CTC -grade 4 but without any clinical symptoms, it should be reconsidered whether the event is classified as serious. If so, the SAE reporting to the KKS Heidelberg is additionally necessary (see section 9.3). Anyway, if one of the seriousness criteria, e.g. hospitalisation required or life -threatening condition, applies, the SAE reporting is essential."

A certain event has a strong temporal relationship and an alternative cause is unlikely. Probable: An AE that has a reasonable possibility that the event is likely to have been caused by the IMP/radiation therapy . The AE has a timely relationship and follows a known pattern of response , but a potential alternative cause may be present. Possible : An AE that has a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the IMP /radiation t herapy . The AE has a timely relationship to the IMP; however, the pattern of response is untypical , and an alternative cause seems more likely, or there is significant uncertainty about the cause of the event. Unlikely : Only a remote connection exists between the IMP /radiation therapy and the reported adverse event. Other conditions including concurrent illness, progression or expression of the disease state or reaction of the concomitant medication appear to explain the reported adverse event. Not rel ated: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence related to the IMP/radiation therapy and is likely to have been produced by the subject’s clinical state, other modes of therapy or other known aetiology. Not assessable: There is insufficien t or incomplete evidence to make a clinical judgement of the causal relationship. All subjects who have reportable AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the trial medication or not, must be monitored to determine the outcom e. The clinical course of the AE will be followed up until resolution or normalisation of changed laboratory parameters or until it has changed to a stable condition. This also holds for on -going AEs/SAEs of withdrawn subjects. The outcome of an AE at the time of the last observation will be classified as: Recovered / resolved: All signs and symptoms of an AE disappeared without any sequels at the time of the last interrogation. Recovering / resolving: The intensity of signs and symptoms has been diminishing and / or their clinical pattern has been changing up to the time of the last interrogation in a way typical for its resolution. Not recovered/not resolved: Signs and symptoms of an AE are mostly unchanged or worsened at the time of the last in terrogation. Recovered / resolved with sequel: Actual signs and symptoms of an AE disappeared but there are sequels related to the AE. Fatal: Resulting in death. If there is more than one adverse event only the adverse event leading to death (possibly re lated) will be characterised as ‘fatal‘."

The action taken with the IMP/radiation therapy will be assigned to one of the following categories: Dose not changed: No change in the dose of the IMP/radiation therapy. Dose reduced: Reduction in the dose of the IMP/radiation therapy. Dose increased: Increase in the dose of the IMP /radiation therapy . Drug withdrawn: Discontinuation of the IMP/radiation therapy. Unknown: The information is unknown or implausible and it cannot be supplemented or verified Not applicable: The question is implausible (e.g. the subject is dead). The term “countermeasures” refers to the specific actions taken to treat or alleviate adverse events or to avoid their sequels. Following categories will be used to categorise the countermeasures to adverse events: None: No action taken. Drug treatment: Newly prescribed medication or change in dose of a medication. Others: Other countermeasures, e.g. an operative procedure. 10.2 Period of Observation and Documentation Adverse events (AEs) will be ascertained by the investigators using non -leading questions, noted as spontaneously reported by the patients to the medical staff or observed during any measurements on all study days. The observation period begins with the first administration of the Gazyvaro (before the first administration of the Gazyvaro: medical history) and ends with the last study visit, i.e. 30 month after the last take of study medication. AEs will be documented in the patient file and in the CRF. All subjects who present AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the trial medication /radiation therapy or not, will be monitored by the responsible invest igator to determine their outcome; this applies to withdrawals too. The end date of the SAE is defined typically the same as for AEs. The end date of the SAE must not be later than the end date of the corresponding AE. AEs and SAEs that are on -going at the time of death are considered not resolved or resolving. All SAEs and their relevance for the benefit/risk assessment of the study will be evaluated continuously during the study and for the final report. All SAEs will be documented in the ""Serious Adverse Event"" form. 10.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events by Investigator All SAEs must be reported by the investigator to the responsible Safety Officer at the KKS Heidelberg within 24 hours after the SAE becomes known using the ""Serious Adverse Event"" form. The initial report must be as complete as possible including details of the current illness and (serious) adverse event and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the trial medication/radiati on therapy. The reporting will be performed by faxing a completed ‘SAE Form’ to the KKS Heidelberg, fax number: 06221 -56-33725 The investigator must also inform the site monitor in all cases ."

All SAEs will be subject to a second assessment by a designated person, who will be independent from the reporting investigator. The designated person for the present trial, referred to as the second assessor is the LKP: Prof. Dr. K. Herfarth, Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Heidelberg, INF 400, 69120 Heidelberg Dr. J. Schmier , Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, INF 410, 69120 Heidelberg The second assessor will fill out a ‘Second Assessment Form’ for each SAE and send it back per fax to the responsible person at the KKS Heidelberg within 48 hours, fax -number: 06221 – 56 – 33725 The ‘Second Assessment Form’ will contain the following information: I) Assessment of relationship between SAE and IMP/radiation therapy (causality) II) Assessment of expectedness of SAE (derived from IB) III) Statement if the benefit/ risk assessment for the trial did change as a result of SAE. The expedited reporting (to competent authority, responsible ethics committee and investigators) will be carried out by a responsible Safety Officer at KKS Heidelberg. Only SUSARs occurring after administration of Gazyvaro will undergo expedited reporting. Details concerning the reporting of SUSARs will be described in a separate document “Safety Manual”. 10.5 Emergency Treatment During and following a subject’s partic ipation in the trial, the investigator should ensure that adequate medical care is provided to a subject for any AE including clinically significant laboratory values. The investigator should inform a subject when medical care is needed for intercurrent il lness(es) of which the investigator becomes aware. 11. STATISTICAL PROCEDUR ES 11.1 Number of Patients Due to the descriptive char acter of the trial, no assessment of any formal statistical hypotheses is performed . The calculation of the number of patients is primarily based on the aspects of practicability and precision of the results . The following calculations are based on the intention -to-treat (ITT) population . Since the strength of the results for the primary endpoint m ay be weakened due to early drop-outs (as described later) , the number of patients needed should be high enough to compensate for potential drop -outs. Primary endpoint is the rate of metabolic CR in week 18 in patients with initially remaining lymphoma judged by FDG -PET/CT. Based on the morphologic CR rate of 37 -84% after 2 x 2 Gy in the literature (see Table 2) and in face of a lack of data for metabolic CR after 2x2 Gy, a CR rate of 60% (about the median of CR in Table 2 and approximately the CR rate in week 18 in the MIR"
58,page_58,"GAZ AI EudraCT: 2016 -002059 -89 Version: 1.2/ 06.10 .2017 CONFIDENTIAL -2_20171006_final Seite 59 von 74 trial (62%)) is assumed. If fifty patients enter the FDG -PET/CT and the observed metabolic CR rate amounts to 60%, the half width of the asymptotic two-sided 95% confidence interval amounts to about ± 13.5%. Based on the experience of the MIR trial, a general drop -out rate of 10% is assumed, and about 30% of the included patients are expected to have no remaining lymphoma after initial surgery to pro ve the histology. In addition, we expect an additional drop -out rate of about 15% after the initial FDG -PET due to stage -shifting in a stage III disease based on the Barrington pape r about PET staging [45] . These considerations lea d to the following calculation: If 93 patients are being recruited, about 15% will drop out due to a stage -shift to higher stages after FDG -PET (79 patients remaining). Of these 79 patients, about 30% will have no remaining PET - positive lymphoma after initial surgery (according to the experience s in the MIR trial). Therefore, 55 patients would start therapy with the goal of reaching the primary endpoint assessment. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10% , 50 patients will be available for final assessment of the primary endpoint . The number of n=93 is at the upper limit of the patients to be included. This number of definit ively included pat ients might drop during the trial ( e.g. if less patients show a stage -shift o r more patients show rem aining lymphoma ). 11.2 Variables of analysis Primary endpoint is the m etabolic complete response (CR) in week 18 in patients with initially remaining lymphoma judged by FDG -PET/CT . Secondary endpoints are:  Morphologic CR , PR, SD, PD in week 7, week 18 and month 6 in patients with initially remaining lymphoma judged by CT/MRI  Historical comparison of the morphologic response with MIR data (using MabTh era); the comparison of the CR rate in week 7 would be a comparison of the two different CD20 antibodies. Based on the patient numbers no matched pair analysis will be possible  Progression -free survival (PFS) of all treated patients (2 years after individu al treatment start )  Toxicity (NCI -CTC criteria , version 4.03 ) of all patients  Relapse rate and pattern of recurrence of all treated patients at all follow -up visits.  Overall survival ( OS) of all treated patients (2 years)  Quality of life according EORTC QLQ C30 and FACT -Lym questionnaires at inclusion and in week 18, month 12, 24 and 30 (all treated patients)  MRD response : initially, week 18, months 12 and month 24 (all treated patients). MRD is evaluated by the laboratory of C. Pott (Kiel) using at least the markers: t(14:18) PCR for MBR, 3’mbr, 5’mcr and MCR; clonal IGH rearrangements (FR1 -3); clonal IGL rearrangements (IGK and Kappa -KDE) 11.3 Definition of the Trial Populations All patients, who received at least parts of the treatment defined in this protocol, will be analyzed in the intention -to-treat (ITT) population as well as in the safety population. All patients, who deviated less than 20% from the protocol -defined dose and fulfill all inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be analyzed in the pe r-protocol (PP) population. Efficacy will be evaluated in the ITT - as well as in the PP population. Toxicity data will be analyzed in safety population. 11.4 Statistical Methods There will be a descriptive analysis of the data. The rate of metabolic CR i n week 18 will be calculated as relative frequency. The related 95% confidence interval will be calculated using the “score method” by Wilson [65]. This method showed excellent performance characteristics as compared to alternative"

In addition, the rate of metabolic CR will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the 95% Greenwood confidence interval to take into account a potential influence of censored values. (ITT and PP populat ion) PFS and OS at 2 years after initiation of the therapy of each patient will be analyzed using the Kaplan - Meier method and the two-sided 95% confidence intervals according to Greenwood. (ITT and PP population). Remission - and recurrence rates will be ca lculated as relative frequencies and reported together with the 95% confidence intervals according to Wilson. (ITT and PP population) Quality of life will be evaluated according to the evaluation guide of the two question naires. (ITT and PP population) Toxicity will be evalua ted for frequency and intensity (safety population). Adverse events will be coded by MedDRA (actual version at the time of data base lock). The counts of the events and the counts of patients will be listed in a table. All patients unde r observation will be taken into account for the calculations of the frequency of recurrences at the respective time. All statistical procedures will be defined in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized before data base lock. The respon sible statistician and the LKP will authorize the SAP. 11.5 Interim Analysis No interim analysis is planned. 11.6 Definition of Target Variables Progression -free survival : a) Calculated from start of therapy up to the time of progression (morphologic or metabolic) or death b) Calculated from start of therapy up to the time of progression (morphologic or metabolic) or death in patients with initially remaining lymphoma (morphol ogic or metabolic) Overall survival : Calculated from start of therapy up to the time of death 12. DATA MANAGEMENT 12.1 Data Collection All entries in the CRF must be verifiable by source documents. In advance , exceptions to this rule can be defined by the sponsor . A detailed list will be provided in the Investigator Site File. Regardless, there must be a minimum documentation, which provides information on study participation and includes all medical information necessary for appropriate medical care outside of the clinical trial in the patient record. In addition, source documents must mention that the patient has been included in an investigational study. Finally, there must be no data that are inconsistent between CRF and source documents. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all sections of the CRF are completed correctly and that entries can be verified against source data. Any errors should have a single line drawn through them so that the original entry remains legible and the c orrect data should be entered at the side with the investigator's signature, date and reason for change. Self -explanatory corrections need not to be justified."

The original CRF will be transferred to the data management in the Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics (IMBI) Heidelberg; one copy will be remained by the investigator. 12.2 Data Handling All data will be entered in a database as record ed in the CRF by trained staff of the IMBI . To ensure data quality, a double data entry will be done. The data management will check completeness, validity, and plausibility of data by validation programs, which will generate queries. All missing data or inconsistencies will be reported back to the centre(s) and have to be clarified by the responsible investigator prior to database lock . If no further corrections are to be made in the database it will be declared locked and used for statistical analysis. All data management activities will be done according to the current SOPs of the IMBI. Original files of the CRF will be transferred to the LKP after analysis and completion of the trial report. 12.3 Archiving of Essential Documents The investigator(s) will archive all trial data (source data and Investigator Site File (ISF) including subject identification list and relevant correspondence) according to the section 4.9 of the ICH Consolidated Guideline on GCP (E6) and to local law or regulations. The spo nsor or other owner like investigators of the data shall retain all other documentation pertaining to the trial for at least 10 years according to the §13 of the German GCP -Ordinance. These procedures shall include:  The protocol including the rationale, ob jectives and statistical design and methodology of the trial, with conditions under which it is performed and managed, and details of the investigational product used.  Standard operating procedures  All written opinions on the protocol and procedures,  Final report,  Case report forms (not RDE),  Audit certificate(s), if available.  All other relevant documents of the trial master file, according to the ICH -GCP guideline Any change of data ownership shall be documented. All data shall be made available if reques ted by relevant authorities. According to the §28c of the German X -Ray Directive and to the §87 of the German Radiation Protection Directive the informed consent forms including subjects’ consent for trial participation, application of x -rays, application of radioactive materials or irradiation and data transmission to the competent authority will be archived for at least 30 years after the trial termination. The LKP is responsible for archiving of the trial master file (TMF). It will be archived according the SOP for archiving of the University Hospital of Heidelberg. The investigator will archive all study documents including patient identification list and relevant correspondence in the Investigator Site File (ISF). The ISF, all source documents as well as all other in section 8 of the ‚ICH Consolidated Guideline on GCP’ listed documents are to be stored and archived after the regular or early ending of the trial according to the legal regulations."

This documentation must also include a list of members of t he EC present on the applicable EC meeting and a GCP compliance statement. The investigator and the KKS Heidelberg will keep a record of all communication with the EC and the regulatory authorities . Before the first subject is enrolled in the trial, all et hical and legal requirements must be met. All planned substantial changes (see §10, (1) of German GCP -Regulation) will be submitted to EC and the competent authority in writing as protocol amendments. They have to be signed by the sponsor and biometrician and approved by the EC and the competent authority. An approval by Federal Office for Radiation Protection (Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz) for the investigational use of FDG -PET/CT in this trial is prerequisite for the initiation of the trial. The use of radiation therapy in this trial has been reviewed by an radiation safety committee of experts of the DEGRO. The radiation treatment is considered as a treatment under the circumstances of “Heilkunde” and not as scientific research as defined by the German Radiation Protection Directive . 13.2.4 Notification of regulatory authorities In addition to the approval by the competent authority, the clinical trial must also be notified to the competent authority before recruitment of the first patient (according to AMG §67). The local regulatory authorities responsible for each particular investigator will be informed before the beginning, durin g and at the end of the trial according to the applicable regulations. Each investigator is obliged to notify his/ her local regulatory authority whereas the notification of the competent authority is the responsibility of the sponsor. Both responsibilitie s have been delegated to the KKS. Substantial Amendments, interruption or prem ature end of the trial need to be reported, too. 13.3 Subject Information and Informed Consent Before being admitted to the clinical trial, the patient must consent to partic ipate after being fully informed by the investigator or a designated member of the investigating team about the nature, importance, risks and individual consequences of the clinical trial and their right, to terminate the participation at any time. The pat ient should also have the opportunity to consult the investigator, or a physician member of the investigating team about the details of the clinical trial. The informed consent to participate in the clinical trial may be withdrawn by the patient verbally i n the presence of, or in written form directed to, the investigator or a physician member of the investigating team at any time during the trial. The patient must not entail any disadvantage therefor or be coerced or unduly influenced to continue to partic ipate. Furthermore, the patient is not obligated to disclose reasons for the withdrawal of the consent. If the patient has a primary physician, the investigator should inform him or her about the patient’s participation in the trial, provided the patient a grees hereto. After reading the informed consent document, the patient must give consent in writing. The patient's consent must be confirmed by the personally dated signature of the patient and by the personally dated signature of the physician conducting the informed consent discussion. If the patient is unable to write, oral presentation and explanation of the content of the informed consent form and of the data protection information must take place in the presence of an impartial witness. The witness an d the physician conducting the informed consent discussions must also sign and personally date the consent document. The witness must not be in any way dependent on the sponsor of the trial, the trial site or any member of the investigating team (e. g. an employee at the trial site.)."

The documents must be in a language understandable to the subject and must specify who informed the subject. The subjects will be informed as soon as possible if new information may influence his/her decision to participate in the trial. The communication of this information should be documented. The informed consent for genetic profiling and the extended follow -up according to a patient register will be independent of the consent of participation in the trial. Informed consent for irradiation and PET All patients will receive a separate information about the radiation procedure and will give thei r informed consent to irradiation. This information will specify the risks of the procedure according to the treatment site. The informed consent for the irradiation will be documented on the site specific forms and archived along with the radiation plan a nd radiation protocol. The informed consent for the FDG -PET/CT will also be on the site specific forms and should be archived with the patient’s documents. 13.4 Data Protection The data obtained in the course of the trial will be treated pursuant to the Federal Data Protection Law (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG). During the clinical trial, subjects will be identified solely by means of their individual identification code. Trial data stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with local data protec tion law and will be handled in strictest confidence. Distribution of these data to unauthorised persons has to be prevented strictly. The appropriate regulations of local data legislation will be fulfilled in its entirety. The subject consents in writing to release the investigator from his/her professional discretion in so far as to allow inspection of original data for monitoring purposes by health authorities and authorised persons (inspectors, clinical monitors, auditors). Authorised persons (inspector s, clinical monitors, auditors) may inspect the subject -related data collected during the trial ensuring the data protection law. The investigator will maintain a subject identification list (subject numbers with the corresponding subject names) to enable records to be identified. Subjects who did not consent to circulate their pseudonymised data will not be included into the trial. This protocol, the CRFs and other trial -related documents and material must be handled with strict confidentiality and not be disclosed to third parties except with the express prior consent of Sponsor. In particular, it must be ensured that the study medication is kept out of reach of third parties. Staffs of the investigators involved in this study are also bound by this agreem ent. 13.5 Continuous Information to the Ethics Committee and the Competent Authority Pursuant to the German Drug Law (AMG) and the GCP Ordinance, the responsible EC, the competent authority and all participating investigators will be informed of all suspe cted unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) occurring during the trial. Both institutions will be informed in case the risk/ benefit assessment did change or any others new and significant hazards for subjects’ safety or welfare did occur. Furthermo re, a report on the subjects safety will be submitted once a year – Development Safety Update Report (DSUR). The EC and the regulatory authorities must be informed of the end of the trial. They will be provided with a summary of trial results within one ye ar after the end of clinical phase (LPO)."

The insurance was taken out at HDI Global SE (insurance number: 57 010310 03018) Any impairment of health , which might occur in consequence of trial participation must be notified to the insurance company. The su bject is responsible for notification. The insured person will agree with all appropriate measures serving for clarification of the cause and the extent of damage as well as the reduction of damage. During the conduct of the trial, the subject must not und ergo other clinical treatment except for cases of emergency. The subject is bound to inform the investigator immediately about any adverse events and additionally drugs taken. The terms and conditions of the insurance should be delivered to the subject. The insurance company has to be informed about all amendments that could affect subjects’ safety. Additional Insurance for irradiation and PET/CT : Since the radiation therapy is not considered as scientific research (see above), an additional insurance for the radiation is not necessary. According to §91 of the radiation protection legislation, an insurance for FDG -PET/CT as accompanying diagnostic tool is not necessary, since this is already covered by the insurance for trials under the law of AMG. 14. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE The sponsor, the investigators, and all involved study personnel agree to conduct this clinical trial in accordance with the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 14.1 Direct Access to Source Documents According to ICH GCP According to ICH -GCP the investigator(s)/institution(s) must provide direct access to source data/documents for trial related monitoring, audits and regulatory inspection. Each subject has consented - via written informed consent - to direct ac cess to his/her original medical records for trial - related monitoring, audit and regulatory inspection. Any data to be recorded directly on the CRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of data), and to be considered to be source data must be clear ly identified (see 11.1). In the absence of either an audit -trail or limited access for the monitor the electronic record of data must be printed out (certified copy). In case of changes a new print -out has to be made. 14.2 Monitoring Monitoring will be done by on -site visits by a clinical monitor according to SOPs of the KKS. The monitor will review the entries into the CRFs on the basis of source documents. The investigator must allow the monitor to verify all essential documents and must provide suppor t at all times to the"

The site will be provided with a follow -up letter of the findings and the necessary actions to be taken . By frequent communications (letters, telephone, fax , e-mail), the site monitor will ensure that the trial is conducted according to the protocol and regulatory requirements. Frequency and details of monitoring will be defined in the monitoring manual. If there are major findings during monitoring or an audit, the investigational site might be closed by the LKP. Central quality assurance of imaging The initial FDG -PET/CT will be sent together with the initial staging imaging in DICOM format (mandatory for PET images, optional for staging images) to the trial center in Heidelberg. Specialists for nuclear medicine, diagnostic and radiation oncology will review it. In patients with PET positive remaining lymphoma, there is a second FDG -PET/CT of the involved region planned in week 18. The DICOM data of this shoul d also be sent to the trial center in Heidelberg and will be reviewed by specialists of nuclear medicine and radiation oncology. It is planned to establish a direct electronic transfer of the data. In case of the necessity of clarification of staging and/o r response evaluation, the CT and/or MR images and radiation plans, which were recorded during the treatment phase and the follow -up phase, might also be sent for central review to the trial center in Heidelberg. 14.3 Inspec tions and Audits Regulatory aut horities and/ or auditors authoris ed by the sponsor may request access to all source documents, CRF s, and other trial documentation. The investigator who must provide support at all times for these activities must guarantee direct access to these documents . The investigator will inform the sponsor immediately about a planned inspection. 14.4 Responsibilities of the Investigator The investigator ensures that all team members are informed adequately about the protocol, all amendments to the protocol, the study procedures und study specific duties and tasks. The investigator will maintain a list to delegate tasks to the team members. 15. ADMINISTRATIVE AGREE MENTS 15.1 Financing of the Trial The trial will be co -financed by Roche Pharma AG and the Departm ent of Radiation Oncology of the University of Heidelberg . 15.2 Financial Disclosure Before the start of the trial, the investigator will disclose any proprietary or financial interests he or she might hold in a funding company, in the investigational pro duct(s) or any commercial organisation being involved in the clinical trial. The investigator has also to confirm that he/she has not entered into any financial arrangement, whereby the value of compensation paid could affect the outcome of the clinical tr ial. The investigator agrees to update this information in case of significant changes."
