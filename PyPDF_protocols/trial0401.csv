The Osia® System is the latest addition to Cochlear’s BCHI Systems – combining the distinct benefits of the Baha® Connect and the Baha Attract Systems. The Baha Systems The Cochlear™ Baha bone conduction systems offer two ways to transmit vibrations from the external sound processor to the osseointegrated implant: The Baha Connect System uses a skin-penetrating abutment that provides a direct pathway for transmission of sound vibrations from the sound processor (SP) to the osseointegrated implant. The Baha Connect System thereby offers optimal efficiency of sound transmission via direct bone conduction. However, the skin-penetrating abutment of the Baha Connect System is seen as a barrier for many candidates and requires daily cleaning of the skin around the abutment in order to maintain a reaction-free implant site. The passive transcutaneous Baha Attract System uses a magnetic connection through intact skin. This offers the advantages over skin -penetrating systems by eliminating the daily cleaning, reduction in reported adverse skin reactions of the implant site and is perceived as more cosmetically appealing by many subjects. However, the Baha Attract System offers less efficient bone conduction (especially at high frequencies) due to attenuation of sound vibrations through the intact skin that separates the external transducer from the osseointegrated implant. Both Baha Systems make use of the same external SPs and the same osseointegrated Implant (BI300). Both systems have been proven to be safe and effective through years of clinical use and data from clinical investigation (3) (4) (5). The Osia system The Osia® System is an Active Osseointegrated Steady-State Implant System (OSI) where the whole actuator/transducer (vibrating unit) is implanted and fixed to the same osseointegrated implant (BI300) as the Baha Systems. The system is developed to combine the benefits of a skin-penetrating system (direct bone conduction) combined with the benefits of a non-skin-penetrating system (less need for maintenance care, cosmetic advantages, etc.). Compared to the passive transcutaneous Baha Attract System , the Osia System provides a more efficient transmission of sound, especially in the high frequency range, as the implantable transducer eliminates the attenuation of sound vibrations through the soft tissue that is inherent to the passive system. With the Osia System it is also possible to position the transducer closer to the ear canal, which may further improve audiological outcomes. The Osia System is intended to compensate for CHL, MHL, or SSD by transmitting amplified acoustic signals to the cochlea through mechanical vibration of the skull bone. It is indicated"
20,page_20,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 20 of 75 for recipients with a fitting range of up to 55 dB SNHL (for mixed hearing loss), which is in the same fitting range as the Baha 5 Power Sound Processor. 4.1.2.1 The Osia 2 System The Osia 2 System is a further development of its predecessor device, the Osia System, which received regulatory approval (CE-mark) in 2018. The design modifications primarily consist in a more robust implant with a less complex surgical procedure, and a more advanced and aesthetically appealing sound processor. None of the changes that have been made to the Implant or SP are anticipated to significantly alter the safety or performance of the system. The predecessor device (the Osia System) has been tested in a prospective multicentre clinical investigation, and has, at the time of writing this CIP, been implanted in over 100 recipients. Results show that the system provides good audiological performance and patient-reported outcomes in patients with CHL, MHL and SSD and that complications are few. The following section(s) describe the findings from both non-clinical and clinical data supporting the safe and effective use of the Osia 2 System. 4.2 Findings of Previous Nonclinical and Clinical Studies Nonclinical Data The OSI200 Implant has been designed in a way to allow for less complex surgical procedure, involving fewer surgical instruments and less bone excavation during implantation than for the predecessor OSI100 Implant, and has been tested and reported (6). The OSI200 implant is also more robust in its design and is anticipated to perform in a similar manner as its predecessor device, with a safety profile equal to, or better than, the OSI100 Implant (7). The Osia 2 SP has the same intended performance but offers an improvement over the predecessor sound processor with regards to size, weight, signal processing and wireless functionality. Results from technical verification and validation activities are described in the currently released Investigator’s Brochure (7). Clinical Data The objective of this clinical investigation is to gather clinical data on the Osia 2 System; as such, no in-patient clinical data is currently available for the Osia 2 System itself. However, the predecessor Osia System is currently (at the time of this final CIP) being tested in a prospective, multicentre clinical investigation including 51 subjects with CHL, MHL (up to 55 dB SNHL) or SSD (see section 4.2.2.1). In addition to clinical data on the predecessor, the Osia 2 SP and the predecessor SP are (by the time of finalising this CIP) being compared in patients already implanted with the precursor Implant (OSI100). Both the Osia 2 SP and the OSI200 Implant are also being clinically tested using an Osia Simulation model (section 4.2.2.2)"
21,page_21,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 21 of 75 4.2.2.1 Multicentre Clinical Investigation with the Osia System By the time of this final CIP safety and performance of the predecessor device Osia System is being tested in a prospective, multicentre clin ical investigation CBAS5 539 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT 03086135) including 51 adults with CHL (n=14), MHL (n=23), or SSD (n=14). Subjects were unilaterally (n=49), or bilaterally (n=2) implanted and serve as their own controls (i.e. pre-operative unaided hearing vs. aided hearing with the Osia System). All subjects have passed the 6 months follow-up and, as such, have completed the primary efficacy (3 months) and safety (6 months) endpoints, with data collection continuing until study completion at 12 months (8). 4.2.2.1.1 Performance The results from the clinical investigation demonstrate the following benefits for subjects with CHL, MHL and SSD with regards to hearing performance and health related quality of life. The Osia System provided statistically significant improvements in hearing performance compared to the unaided condition with an improvement in hearing thresholds (PTA4, mean of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) of 24.9 dB (SD 9.5 dB, range -50 to -6 dB, p<0.0001), speech recognition in quiet at 50, 65 and 80 dB SPL of 37.9 % (SD 25.2, range -40.0 to 80.0 %), 59.8 % (SD 27.1, range -5.0 to 100.0 %) and 31.7 % (SD 32.0, range -4.0 to 100.0 %), respectively, and adaptive speech in noise (SNR) of -13.3 dB (SD 8.1, range -47.2 to 0.6 dB, p<0.0001). All SSQ parameters (Total, Speech, Spatial, and Quality) showed statistically significant improvements (p<0.0001) and APHAB scores sh owed significant improvements (p<0.0001) for the subscales Ease of Communication (EC), Background Noise (BN), Reverberation (RV), and the Global score. Health status and health related quality of life, measured with HUI3, showed statistically significant improvements for the parameters Comprehensive health state (p=0.035) and Hearing attribute (p=0.0014). Comfort with the use of the Osia System, measured using a visual analogue scale where 0% was defined as no comfort at all and 100% as most comfortable imaginable, showed a total mean comfort of 81% at 3 months and the mean reported daily use was 10.5 hours/day (SD 4.3, range 1.0-18.0 hours/day). Analysis of the separate subgroups (CHL/MHL and SSD) showed similar trends as for the entire population. 4.2.2.1.2 Safety In total 68 Adverse Events (AEs) were reported during the first six months of the clinical investigation, whereof thirty-three (33) were judged as possibly, probably or causally related to the study device and/or procedure. Most of the AEs were reported as mild and related to post-operative pain or transient irritation/swelling. Three (3) Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were reported within the first six months and within the same subject. Two (2) of these SAEs were unrelated to the study device and/or procedure, and one (1) was related to the surgical procedure: One Osia Implant was removed due to wound infection starting shortly after surgery. There were no device-related SAEs recorded during this time period. Seventy-one (71) Device Deficiencies (DDs) have been reported (to date); However, none of the DDs were related to the Implant (Fitting Software: 46.5%; Sound Processor: 41%; User Manual: 8.5%; Broken safety line: 4%)"
22,page_22,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 22 of 75 4.2.2.2 Ongoing Clinical Investigation: Osia 2 System The Osia 2 SP, which is compatible with both the OSI100 and OSI200 Implants, is currently being tested in two different clinical investigations. The first investigation CBAS5731 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT NCT03848910 is designed to compare hearing performance and patient preference of the Osia 2 SP to the Osia SP in patients (n=11) that have completed the Osia System multicentre clinical investigation (i.e. that have already been implanted with the OSI100 Implant). The other investigation CBAS5749 compares hearing performance of the Osia 2 System to its predecessor device using a validated simulation model. In this investigation, audiological outcomes with the different combinations of the Osia System sound processors and implants are tested on actual Baha Connect users, which allows within-subject comparisons of the different SPs and Implants. While the final results from these clinical investigations are not yet available at the time of finalising this clinical investigation plan (will be finalised before the start of this clinical investigation), preliminary data suggests good outcomes with the Investigational device. 4.3 Study Rationale The Osia 2 System is a further development of it s predecessor device (the Osia System) which has been regulatory approved in Europe and has been proven safe and effective, providing significantly improved objective and subjective hearing outcomes and health-related quality of life in subjects with CHL, MHL or SSD when compared to the pre-operative unaided condition. Currently, there is nothing that would contradict the safety and performance of the Osia 2 System; however, as with any surgical procedure, Osia surgery is not entirely free of risks. The clinical investigation on the Osia System (predecessor device) showed no serious adverse events or device deficiencies related to the Implant (OSI100) and most adverse events that were judged as possibly, probably or causally related to the procedure/device occurred within the first 1 to 3 months and were related to the surgical procedure (n=33). As mentioned in section 4.2.1, the design of the OSI200 Implant allows for a shorter, less complex surgical procedure with fewer surgical instruments, less bone excavation; as such, it is anticipated that any risks related to the surgical procedure will be similar or less than for the OSI100 Implant. The Osia 2 System also has the same performance requirements as the first Osia System, but includes a sound processor with added functionality, wireless connectivity and improved aesthetics, all of which are believed to provide added benefit to the user. The rationale for conducting this clinical investigation is to gather clinical data on patients implanted with the OSI200 Implant. While the non-clinical and clinical data all indicate that the Osia 2 System will perform as intended and provide a bone conduction hearing implant (BCHI) system with a similar, or improved, safety profile as its CE-marked predecessor device, which is currently being used by more than one hundred recipients world-wide, it is of utmost interest to assess the performance and safety of the Osia 2 System when used as intended. The study method proposed in this clinical investigation plan is considered relevant to the intended use of the Investigational device and the data collection period/intervals reflects potential safety"

24,page_24,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 24 of 75 The regulatory classification of the system is expected to be Class AIMD in the EU and Class II in the US. The instruments of the Osia 2 System that have previously been CE marked and FDA cleared for the current Baha or Cochlear Implant (CI) systems maintain their current classification. The BI300 Implant will also maintain its classification in the EU (Class IIb), in the US (Class II), in Australia (Class II) and in Hong Kong (Class III). 5.1.1 The OSI200 Implant The OSI200 Implant is a single use device intended for long term implantation under the skin in the mastoid region of either side of the head. It is made up of the receiver coli, magnet assembly and the implant body (Figure 2). The radio frequency (RF) receiver coil receives power and data for the implant when it is inductively coupled to a similar coil in the external SP. The magnet assembly ensures that the SP is firmly attached and correctly aligned with the receiver coil. The implant body encapsulates the electronic assembly (EA) and actuator components. The EA receives the signal from the RF receiver coil and processes it accordingly, using the data received to drive the actuator. The actuator converts the electrical signal into an amplified mechanical stimulation and transmits it to the mastoid bone through the osseointegrated BI300 implant. The entire implant assembly is enclosed within a silicone overmould. The overmould material (MED-4860) is a medical grade, biocompatible sili cone suitable for long term implantation. The OSI200 Implant attaches to the skull bone via a BI300 Implant (ossointegrating titanium fixture). Figure 2. Left: OSI200 Implant with the Receiver coil and magnet assembly (1) and the Implant body with actuator and electronic assembly (2); Right: T he different subassemblies of the OSI200 Implant. 5.1.2 The Osia 2 Sound Processor (Osia 2 SP) The Osia 2 SP is a button-type SP, worn off-the-ear (OTE) (Figure 3), to be used with the OSI200 Implant. During use, the Osia 2 SP is in contact with the skin or hair and is kept in place by two magnets, one external magnet in the Osia 2 SP and one internal magnet in the OSI200 Implant. The"

The Osia 2 SP is compatible with the Cochlear wireless accessories available on the market as well as various other accessories like Safety line and SoftWear pad. It is also compatible with iPhone via Bluetooth Low Energy enabling the use of apps and streaming. The subjects will be able to choose from five different front colors for their SP. The Osia 2 SP is powered by one battery which is expected to be enough for one full day of use. The Osia 2 SP is further described in the Cochlear Osia 2 Sound Processor User Manual. Figure 3. The Osia 2 Sound Processor. 5.1.3 Osia 2 Sound Processor Magnets Sound Processor Magnets for the SP comes in 4 different strengths; 1 being the weakest and 4 the strongest. 5.1.4 BI300 Implant The Osia 2 System uses the same osseointegrated BI300 Implant for anchorage in the bone as in existing first Osia System, Baha Connect and Baha Attract systems. The BI300 Implant is 4.5 mm in diameter and comes in two different lengths, 4 mm and 3 mm, and is made of titanium. The surface is moderately roughened (TiOblast™) on its intraosseous parts. A cover screw (92136) is available in case of the need to close the surgical incision after implanting the BI300 without attaching the actual OSI200 Implant. The OSI200 Implant body attaches to the internal connection of the BI300 Implant using a fixation screw."

Hence, Osia surgery reuses existing surgical tools for Baha surgery. There are only one surgical tool and one template that are specific to the Osia 2 System. Table 3 lists the recommended surgical instruments. The Bone Bed Indicator is a reusable instrument to be used to verify the clearance between the actuator bottom plane and the bone surface. It is hand tightened to the BI300 Implant and then turned clockwise around to check the clearance of the surrounding area. The OSI200 Implant Template is a single-use sterile marking template to be used during marking of the skin and the bone during surgery to indicate placement of the OSI200 Implant. Cochlear Limited, Sydney, Australia is the l egal manufacturer for the Bone Bed Indicator and the Implant Template. Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions, Mölnlycke, Sweden is the legal manufacturer for all existing instruments relating to the BI300, which are already on the market.

Subjects will be screened, and 30 eligible subjects will be included in the clinical investigation. Subjects who drop out prior to surgery will be replaced, in order to reach a total of 30 evaluable (implanted) subjects. After surgical implantation of the device, subjects will attend scheduled study visits over a six- month study period to be assessed as described in the CIP Schedule of Events (Section 3). At study visits, subjects will be evaluated through objective audiological hearing tests, patient reported outcomes and safety assessments. The primary outcome is to determine the hearing performance of the Investigational device compared to unaided hearing, assessed by free field thresholds audiometry, [PTA4, Mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz] and Adaptive speech recognition in noise at 3 months post-surgery. Safety will be assessed by recording and summarising all AEs/ADEs and DDs. 7.1.1 Design Rationale This clinical investigation is designed to collect data regarding the objective and subjective hearing performance and quality of life for the Investigational device. Safety parameters will also be collected. This investigation is limited to adult subjects, although the device is intended for both peadiatric and adult patients. The peadiatric population constitutes a heterogeneous patient group (age-related), and there are currently no audiological tests suitable for comparisons across age ranges and across multiple countries/languages. Subjects with either CHL or MHL ( ≤ 55 dB SNHL) or SSD are included, since these are the intended patient populations for the Investigational device. The investigation will be performed in an open design since it is not possible to perform the investigation in a blinded fashion. The main evaluations of the investigation, i.e. audiometric thresholds (pure tone average PTA4) and speech recognition in noise measured in free-field, are relevant and objective methods that are commonly used by clinics internationally as a way to assess hearing performance. Threshold audiometry is not language specific (no words used), thus rendering comparative data in an international, multilingual setting. Speech communication is a very important aspect in human communication. In everyday life, conversations usually occur in the presence of background noise and listeners with hearing- impairment often complain about problems with understanding speech in noisy situations. Speech in noise tests resemble everyday situations (listening to complete sentences in noise) and can therefore be used to test the performan ce of hearing in noisy situations. The Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) is a speech in noise test designed to be used in an adaptive procedure to establish the speech recognition threshold for sentences, where 50% of the sentences are correctly repeated. The original HINT material was developed in 1994 and consists of short everyday sentences in English, which are judged to be natural by native speakers of American English (10). The Chinese Hearing in Noise Test (CHINT) was developed using the same rationale as the English HINT and have shown to be comparable, allowing the two tests to be compared directly across languages (11). In Australia an adaptive Australian Sentence Test in"
33,page_33,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 33 of 75 Noise, the AuSTIN test will be used, which is validated in terms of test-retest reliability and efficiency (12).Questionnaires to collect patient reported outcomes—Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) (13) and Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) (14) and the health related quality questionnaire, HUI (15) are well established methods that are abundantly referred to in the scientific literature. The Baha 5 Power Sound Processor on a Softband was chosen as a secondary assessment. The Baha 5 Power Sound processor has the same fitting range (55 dB SNHL) and intended target population as the Investigational device. When used on a Softband, the Baha 5 Power Sound Processor is a relevant choice to present as a pre-operative listening for the subject, thus offering the patient the possibility to experience bone conducted sound prior to implantation. The follow-up period of 3 months post-surgery for the primary analysis is chosen as it is judged as long enough for the subjects to adapt and get used to the hearing performance with the Investigational device. The total length of the investigation is judged to be adequate for evaluating safety, as most safety issues are likely to be related to general risks associated the surgical intervention and thus occur early in t he study. Six months data from a clinical study with a predecessor device of the Investigational device confirmed that the device is effective and safe. In summary, this investigation is expected to demonstrate that the Investigational device performs within its intended use and is a suitable treatment for adult patients with a CHL, MHL or SSD. 7.2 Subjects Signed informed consent must be obtained from the subject before any study procedures are initiated. Eligibility of enrolled subjects must be supported by unaided audiometric threshold measures (including both air- and bone conduction thresholds) at screening to demonstrate that the subject meets the audiological inclusion criteria. Bilateral surgeries are allowed. However, performance data for the Investigational device will only be collected for one of the ears, as judged by the investigator as the “test ear”. 7.2.1 Inclusion Criteria Subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria described below to be eligible for this clinical investigation. 1.

(yes/no, reason for rejection)  Has the subject previously had a Baha implant (yes/no, reason for changing) Treatment ear Treatment ear (indicate left or right or both. In case of both, indicate “test ear”). Audiogram Unaided audiometric threshold measures (including both air- and bone conduction thresholds) should demonstrate whether the subject has a CHL, MHL or SSD and meets the audiological inclusion criteria. An existing audiogram may be used as long as it has been completed during the last six months, and contains all the required relevant frequencies. Frequencies required for air conduction thresholds are 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 and 8000Hz. For bone conduction thresholds the required frequencies are 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 6000Hz. The subject’s pre-operative Pure Tone Average PTA4 for CHL and MHL ( mean of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000Hz ) using unmasked BC thresholds and the Pure Tone Average PTA4 for SSD ( mean of 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000Hz ) using air conduction thresholds should be computed and measured in order to ensure that the subject meets the inclusion criteria. If an audiogram is older than 6 months or does not contain the required frequencies, a new audiogram shall be performed at Screening/Baseline. Frequencies required for air conduction"
38,page_38,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 38 of 75 thresholds are 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 and 8000Hz. For bone conduction thresholds the required frequencies are 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 6000Hz. Contralateral masking should be used if needed, and according to local practice. The site staff shall always measure both the unmasked thresholds, as well as and the masked thresholds if applicable. Soft tissue thickness At Screening and Baseline or at Surgery, depending on local practice and requirements, soft tissue thickness should be measured. The measur ement should be performed in the centre of the marked coil position. For complete instruction and recommendation regarding the soft tissue thickness, see the Cochlear Osia OSI200 Implant Physicians Guide (9). 7.3.2 Post-Enrolment Evaluations and Procedures 7.3.2.1 Surgery The Cochlear Osia OSI200 Implant Physicians Guide does not take into account any particular circumstances or factors relevant to an individual patient or case. Other surgical approaches and variations are practiced and may be more appropriate in certain patient cases. After considering all relevant circumstances, factors and information in each case, the appropriate surgical procedure is determined by the responsible investigator exercising independent medical judgement. Complete information is found in the Cochlear Osia OSI200 Implant Physicians Guide (9). However, the ideal position of the OSI200 Implant is with the actuator close to and in horizontal line with the ear canal without touching the pinna (Figure 5). The ideal angulation of the implant is around 0° for the coil and the actuator (Figure 5). Depending on the anatomy and medical history of the patient the placement may vary, and the maximal deviation should be 45° for the coil or actuator (Figure 6 A and B). The transmitting range of the OSI200 Implant is dependent of the soft tissue thickness; if the soft tissue thickness is exceeding the recommended thickness it will have a negative impact on the sound processor performance and magnet retention. Take patient hair and potential use of optional Cochlear SoftWear Pad into consideration when determining if soft tissue thinning is needed. Figure 5: Ideal OSI200 Implant placement."

Selection of the “test ear” will be as judged by the responsible investigator prior to surgery. Patient-reported outcomes (APHAB, SSQ) and quality of life assessment (HUI), will be collected post-surgery in a bilateral hearing situation. Safety-related information, including adverse events and device deficiencies, will be collected and reported for each side receiving the Investigational device, i.e. for the whole subject. Current hearing aid If the subject is currently using a hearing aid at Screening/Baseline, the speech in noise test shall also be performed with the current hearing aid. Blocking All audiometric tests shall be performed with the non-test ear blocked (in case of normal or near-normal hearing or a large asymmetry with the non-test ear having significantly better hearing thresholds). Before blocking of the non-test ear a free-field measurement on PTA4 frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) shall be performed. The blocking shall then be done with earplug and muff and a additional free-field measurement on PTA4 frequencies shall then be performed to verify effective blockage and document the hearing level after blockage. Settings for the Sound Processors The Investigational device and the Baha 5 Power SP should be tested using the Everyday program. AUDIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS General set up All tests shall be performed in a sound insulated room. Equipment used for audiological testing shall be calibrated before initiation of the study . The speakers should be at the height of the test subject’s head and more than 1 metre away from the test subject. There should preferably be more than 1 metre of free space around the test subject in all directions. This is in accordance with the current standard (16). It is important to keep the same sound room and test equipment set-up during the entire clinical study. Changes may be necessary and allowed, but only after approval by the Sponsor. Sound Processor fitting The BFS of current market release will be used at Screening and Baseline when the fitting procedure should be performed for the Baha 5 Power Sound Processor on a Softband as a reference device."
41,page_41,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 41 of 75 The currently released version of OFS will be used to adjust the Investigational device settings for a specific subject. This will be performed during fitting, and throughout the study as needed (for example if the magnet is replaced with a di fferent strength or start/stop of use of a soft pad). If the gain needs to be adjusted or changes to the program configuration are needed, a fine tuning is recommended. The fitting software will be installed on a laptop computer provided by the Sponsor, and the fitting-data will be saved on the laptop until the study is ended when it will be transferred to the Sponsor in a coded way. Coil-to-coil measurement The Digital Link Calibration (e.g. coil-to-coil measurement) that is a step in the connection step in the OFS, should be performed at each occasion the software is being used to fit or finetune the device to optimise the performance of the device for the user throughout the study.

A recipient is expected to experience the following clinical benefits when using the system: Efficient sound transmission through direct bone conduction, without the inherent medical and cosmetic drawbacks of a percutaneous (skin-penetrating) abutment. Compared to passive transcutaneous BCHIs (e.g. the Baha Attract System), the Investigational device provides a more efficient transmission of sound, especially in the high frequency range, as the actuator (vibrator) is directly coupled to the bone, eliminating the attenuation of vibrations through the soft tissue that is inherent to the passive system. With the Investigational device it is also possible to position the transducer closer to the ear canal, which may further improve audiological outcomes. The Investigational device is designed to provide hearing benefit to patients with conductive, mixed or sensorineural hearing loss of up to 55 dB,"
49,page_49,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 49 of 75 similar to a Power SP (e.g. Baha 5 Power) on abutment. Skin complications requiring treatment and/or precluding the use of the sound processor are relatively frequent for percutaneous devices (e.g. the Baha Connect System) due to the exposed abutment. For percutaneous abutments, daily site care is required to maintain a reaction-free skin penetration, but is not a guarantee for successful outcomes. For this transcutaneous Investigational device, the implant site is sealed and does not provide a direct path for infections. In addition, a transcutaneous system, without an abutment protruding through the skin, is often perceived as a more aesthetic option. State-of-the-Art signal processing and wireless connectivity The Investigational device is built around the same platform for audio signal processing and wireless functions as the Baha 5 family of Sound Processors with Bluetooth ® Smart technology, made for iPhone (MFi) with support for direct audio and data streaming, and 2.4 GHz wireless technology that connects to Cochlear Wireless Accessories (e.g. MiniMic 2 and 2+, Phone clip, TV streamer, Remote control 2). In addition to the overall clinical benefits prov ided by the Investigational device, participation in this clinical study is anticipated to benefit the subject by providing early, pre-market access to the latest technology within BCHI Systems. 8.2 Anticipated Adverse Device Effects The Investigational device has been designed and manufactured to ensure that all risks have been reduced as far as possible. However, certain adverse device effects (ADEs) may occur even after all state-of-the-art risk control measures have been implemented and verified. As per section 4.2.2, safety and performance of the Osia System (predecessor device) has been tested in a prospective, multicentre clinical study. The following adverse device effects have been reported (to date) and may be relevant to the participants of this clinical study (more detail provided in the IB):  One (1) serious adverse event (SAE) has been reported for the Osia System involving the removal of an Osia Implant due to a wound infection starting shortly after surgery: possibly related to the procedure (reported by investigator).  Forty one precent (41%) of system related adverse events (n=28) were related to the surgical procedure. These adverse events were mostly mild and transient (e.g. post- operative pain, swelling or irritation). The device-related adverse events (n=11 were reported as warmth from SP (n=2), headache (n=1), position vertigo (n=1), feeling of tension at implant site (n=1), pain (1), numbness (n=1) and change in bone conduction thresholds (3). More information and details with regards to any risks with the use of the Investigational device is provided in the Investigator´s Brochure."
50,page_50,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 50 of 75 8.3 Risks Associated with Participation in the Clinical investigation Subjects participating in the clinical study are exposed to the anticipated adverse device, and or procedure related effects associated with standard Baha and Osia implant surgery and in connection with general anaesthesia. The following potential complications and adverse effects are stated in the OSI200 Implant Physician’s guide (9). Prospective implant recipients should be advised of the following risks:  General risks associated with surgery and general anaesthesia.  Osseointegration failure – potential causes for failure of osseointegration include lack of adequate bone quantity/quality, trauma, infection, generalised diseases and surgical complications.  Other medical complications that may require additional medical treatment, such as: - Concurrent Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) leakage - Subdural injury - Subcutaneous haematoma - Irritation, inflammation or breakdown of the skin flap; infection; and in some cases, extrusion of the device caused by the presence of a foreign body under the skin Failure of device component parts (both external and internal) could result in the perception of an uncomfortably loud sound sensation, intermittent sound, or no sound. Partial or full failure of the device could require removal or replacement of the implant. While the majority of risks are associated with the surgery it cannot be excluded that soft tissue related complications may occur. Investigators and users shall be aware of the following:  If the user experience tightness, numbness or even pain at the implant site, or develop significant skin irritation, he/she shall stop using the sound processor and contact the investigator.  Signs of overheating and signs of discomfort or skin irritation at the implant site.  Occasional feedback and/or noise may occur. 8.4 Risk Mitigation The Osia 2 System has been designed and manufactured to ensure that all risks have been reduced as far as possible; however, as with any surgical intervention, a 100% success rate cannot be guaranteed. As such, the following will be performed during the clinical study to further mitigate the risks identified above:"
51,page_51,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 51 of 75  Before start of each site in the clinical study each investigator will have done documented surgery training according to the Cochlear Osia OSI200 Implant Physician’s Guide either at a cadaver lab or on a plastic skull.  The suggested surgical approach and the two new tools have been validated by 27 surgeons in 4 regions and will be described in a usability report under preparation by the time of this final CIP (6) .  CBAS qualified staff will be present during one or more of the first surgeries at each clinic in order to support any surgical questions or issues related to the OSI200 Implant.  All reported ADEs and DDs will be reviewed regularly by the Sponsor for the duration of the study to facilitate early detection and appropriate intervention if events are unanticipated with respect to incidence, severity, or outcome.  MRI examinations can be performed safely on a person with this implanted device only under very specific conditions. An MRI information package is supplied with each implant for additional information regarding magnetic resonance imaging (19). Subjects enrolled in the study that receive the Osia 2 System will receive an MRI card, for information to radiologists if an evaluation and planning of any MRI examination becomes necessary. Subjects that have received radiation therapy, or are planned for radiation therapy during the study, at the same side of the skull where the Osia 2 System will be positioned are excluded from the study.  Users shall routinely check the device for signs of overheating and for signs of discomfort or skin irritation at the implant site and inform the study staff.  Do not apply continued pressure to the processor when in contact with the skin (e.g. sleeping while lying on processor, or using tight fitting headwear). 8.5 Risk-to-Benefit Rationale The Investigational device has been designed to make the implant more robust, reduce complexity of the surgery and provide a more advance sound processor compared to the precursor Osia System. The predecessor system has been shown to be safe and effective in a multicentre clinical investigation. As with the predecessor device, most of the risks identified for the Investigational device are related to surgery and/or implant failures leading to explantation (further details are provided in the Investigator´s Brochure). The design modifications to the Investigational device compared to the predecessor implant (OSI100), as described above, have resulted in a more robust implant thought to reduce the occurrence rate / likelihood of implant failures leading to explantation. In addition, the shorter and less complex surgical procedure required for Investigational device implantation is believed to mitigate the general risks associated with surgery and general anaesthesia. Based on the data presented herein, the relatively low risk associated with the intended use of the device, and the added benefit to the patient, it is believed that the anticipated risks related"
52,page_52,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 52 of 75 to the intended use of the Investigational device are well within the acceptable limits when weighed against the benefits to the patient. 9 S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1 General Considerations The distribution of continuous variables as well as change in continuous variables will be given as n, mean, SD, SEM, Median, Min and Max and the distribution of dichotomous and categorical variables will be given as number and percentages. For continuous variables estimated mean and the 95% two-sided confidence interval (bootstrapped) for difference between groups will be presented. Since all included subjects will have measurements of the primary and important secondary efficacy variables for unaided hearing, with the Investigational device and with a Baha Power sound processor on a Baha Softband, all statisti cal analyses will be paired. All statistical analyses will be non-parametric. In order to choose the most powerful test, the Fisher’s non- parametric permutation test for paired observations will be used for all paired analyses of continuous variables. The permutation tests use the measured values and not only the ranks in the calculations. For paired analysis of dichotomous and ordered categorical variables the Sign test will be used. The main efficacy analyses will be performed at 3 months after surgery on the ITT population and complementary efficacy analyses will be performed 6 months after surgery on the ITT population. In addition, all analyses will be made on the PP population. Sub analyses will also be performed on one group consisting of Mixed/conductive subjects and one consisting of SSD subjects. Imputation of missing values will be performed for all efficacy variables using stochastic regression imputations. All ITT analyses will be performed/presented both for the imputed and for the non-imputed data (sensitivity analyses). The final definition of the analysis sets (ITT, PP and Safety) will be taken at the clean file meeting before database lock. See separate paragraph for definitions. A statistical analysis plan (SAP) with detailed st atistical analyses specified for all variables and time points will be written and signed before the database lock. The approximate number of subjects per site is 10 and the maximum is approximately 15. See separate paragraph for Sample size calculation. Major protocol deviations are those that are considered to have an effect on the analysis. The number of patients with major protocol deviations will be summarised per treatment group. A list of protocol deviations will be produced. Imputation of missing values will be performed for all efficacy variables. No imputation of baseline values or baseline carry forward will be made. Imputations will be made according to the following rules:"
53,page_53,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 53 of 75 1. If a value is missing at the end of a patient, last observation will be carried forward. 2. If a missing value is occurring between two time points with values, an interpolation will be made for continuous variables and for categorical variables the value from the previous visit will be carried forward. The number of patients with major protocol deviations will be summarised per treatment group. A list of all protocol deviations will be produced. 9.2 Outcome measures 9.2.1 Primary Outcome measures The improvement in hearing performance when using the Investigational device at 3 months post-surgery compared to the preoperative unaided situation assessed as: o Thresholds audiometry, free-field [PTA4, mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz]. o Adaptive speech in noise [speech-to-noise ratio, 50% speech understanding]. 9.2.2 Secondary Outcome measures  The improvement in hearing performance at fitting and 6 months post-surgery when using the Investigational device compared to the unaided situation assessed as: o The improvement in Thresholds audiometry, free-field [PTA4, mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz] o The improvement in Adaptive speech in noise [signal-to-noise ratio, 50% speech understanding].  The improvement in hearing performance at fitting, 3- and 6 months post-surgery when using the Investigational device compared to the unaided situation assessed as: o The improvement in Thresholds audiometry, free-field [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 8.0 kHz]. o The improvement in Speech in quiet [% correctly perceived words at 50dB, 65dB and 80dB SPL].  The benefit in self-reported hearing outcome when using the Investigational device at 3- and 6-months post-surgery compared to the unaided hearing assessed by: o The improvement in scores using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB). o The improvement in scores using the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ)."

58,page_58,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 58 of 75 9.4 Sample Size Determination Based on 6 months safety data from 51 subjects implanted with the predecessor Osia System at 5 clinics in the multicentre clinical investigation described in section 4.2.2.1 (8) it is judged that approximately 10 subjects per clinic and 3 clinics is reasonable for detecting any safety issues with the Investigational device in this study. The primary safety evaluation will be performed 3 months post-surgery, which with an estimation of 30 subjects will equate 7.5 patient years. This is considered to be enough safety data for the primary safety analysis. With a total of 30 subjects, there will be a very high power to detect significant changes in the primary performance evaluations audiometric thresholds (PTA4) and adaptive speech in noise (speech to noise ratio, SNR) . PTA4: Assuming the same mean reduction in PTA4 as in the multicentre clinical investigation of the predecessor Osia System (Mean change -25 dB, SD 9.5 dB), the resulting power with 30 subjects is 0.99. SNR: In the multicentre clinical investigation of the predecessor Osia System a change in SNR from 4.98 dB (SD 7.76 dB) unaided to -8.19 dB (SD 6.58 dB) aided resulted in a mean improvement in SNR of -13.3 dB (SD 8.1 dB). In that investigation, speech was presented from the front and noise from the rear speaker. In the present investigation, however, both speech and noise will be presented from the front speaker, which is known to result in higher SNR values in the aided situation (the SNR in the unaided situation is not expected to change significantly). In a pilot clinical investigation conducted at Cochlear’s own research facility (CBAS5271, Sub study 118), a mean SNR value of -2.5 dB was recorded with the Investigational device (Osia 2 System). Assuming that in the present investigation the unaided mean SNR is similar to the unaided scores in the multicenter investigation and that the aided mean SNR is similar to the pilot investigation, a mean improvement in SNR of approximately -7.6 dB (SD 8.1 dB) is expected. With 30 subjects, the resulting power is 0.99. 9.5 Analysis Populations The final definition of the analysis sets (ITT, PP and Safety) will be taken at the clean file meeting before database lock.  The Intention-to-Treat population (ITT) will include all subjects who have undergone surgical intervention.  The Per Protocol population (PP) will include subjects that have completed the study according to the protocol. Subjects that were incorrectly included or were considered major protocol violators that affect the primary analysis should be removed from the PP population.  The Safety population consists of all surgically treated subjects All efficacy analyses will be performed on both ITT and PP populations. ."
59,page_59,"Template 1278855 Version 1.0 59 of 75 9.6 Primary Outcome Analyses Primary efficacy analysis will be determined by analysis of change in free-field threshold audiometry: PTA4 (mean of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000Hz) and change in Adaptive speech recognition in noise (50% performance), from unaided versus Investigational device at 3 months post-surgery visit for the ITT populat ion, using Fisher’s two-sided non-parametric permutation test for paired observations at a significance level of 0.05 to demonstrate an improvement in PTA4.

Data collection will be performed using for electronic data capture (EDC) on electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs). Site staff will be trained on the completion of the eCRFs prior to obtaining access to the system, and will have their own Login/Password. Access to clinical investigation information will be based on an individual’s role and responsibilities. uses role-based user permissions for data entry, viewing, and reporting options. All communications between users and the EDC server are encrypted. Web servers are protected by a managed firewall. This application is designed to be in compliance with applicable regulations including 21 CFR Part 11. The application will include programmed data consistency checks and supports manual generation of data clarifications/queries, including documentation of site responses. The application maintains a comprehensive audit trail for all data entered, including updates and queries, and documents the time that each entry occurred and who made the entry. Principal Investigators will affirm that the data for each subject at their site is accurate and complete by way of an electronic signature. In addition, de-identified electronically generated data will be collected from the OFS. The unamended data file shall be regarded as the source. . 15 C ONFIDENTIALITY The investigator and site staff will collect and process personal data of the subjects in accordance with governing data privacy regulations [such as the EU GDPR regulations]. Data will be reported to the Sponsor on CRFs or related documents (for example, questionnaires). Subjects will be identified on CRFs and other related documents only by a unique subject identification code and shall not include the subject’s name or other personal identifiable information. Completed CRFs or related documents are confidential and will only be available to the Investigator and site staff, the Sponsor and their representatives, and if requested to the Ethics Committee and national regulatory authorities. Publications or submission to a regulatory authority shall not disclose the identity of any subject."
