INTRODUCTION 1.1 Overview EDP-305 (also known as EPS-2305, EPC-2305 or EP-022305) is a Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist being investigated as a potential treatment for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis and Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). This st udy, EDP 305-201, is a randomized, double-blind, pl acebo-controlled, Phase 2 st udy designed to assess the safety, tolerab ility, and effectiveness of EDP-305 in subjects with PBC with or without an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). 1.2 Background 1.2.1 PBC and Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) Bile acids play a key role in regulating liver and metabolic homeostasis including regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism mediated through two receptor pathways, FXR and TGR5 (Matsubara, Li, & Gonzalez, 2013 ). FXR is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and is considered a master regulator of many bile acid activities including feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver, and peripheral insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue ( McMahan et al., 2013 ). Given the critical role bile acids play in liver homeostasis and the role of FXR in regulating bile acid biosynthesis, FXR has become a target for therapeutic intervention in numerous liver diseases including NASH and PBC. Primary biliary cirrhosis is an important but uncommon autoimmune disease which predominantly affects women. Based on well-defined assessment of cases, the incidence and prevalence rates for PBC in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia are reported as ranging from 0.33 to 5.8 per 100,000 inhabitants and 1.91 to 40.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively (Boonstra, Beuers, & Ponsioen, 2012) . Kim et al estimated that there were 47,000 prevalent cases of PBC in the United States white population and that approximately 3500 new cases are diagnosed each year (Kim et al., 2000) . PBC disproportionately affects women (10:1 women to men ratio) although some r ecent data s uggest an increasing male prevalence (Lleo et al., 2016) . The typical age of diagnosis is between 40 and 60 years; r ecent data s uggest that young age at diagnosis (ie, < 30 years of age) and male gender indicate a poor prognosis (Boonstra et al., 2012) . Racial and ethnic differences in PBC patients have not been clearly identified. It is a globally recognized autoimmune cholestatic liver disease (Beuers, Trauner, Jansen, & Poupon, 2015; Hirschfield & Gershwin, 2013; Selmi, Mackay, & Gershwin, 2011; Webb & Hirschfield, 2017) with several characteristics, including: cholestasis, serologic reactivity to antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) or specific antinuclear antibody (ANA) reactivity, with accompanying histologic evidence of chronic non-s uppurative, granulomatous, lymphocytic small bile duct cholangitis. Without treatment, the disease progresses to cirrhosis and, as the liver"
18,page_18,"Clinical Study Protocol EDP 305-201 v3.0 (Amendment 2.0, G lobal US and EU) Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 of 87 fails, complications develop including those related to cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma (Carbone et al., 2013; Huet et al., 2008; Kuiper et al., 2010; Lammers et al., 2014; Trivedi et al., 2016) , liver transplantation or death ensue. It is believed that a key result of the immunologic injury in PBC is a rise in the endogenous hepatocellular bile acids to cytotoxic levels, causing inflammatory damage, an increase in hepatocellular enzymes and apoptosis which over time results in hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis (Beuers, 2006) . Disease progression may take decades from diagnosis to the development of the clinical events associated with hepatic decompensation. Early on, patients are typically asymptomatic, and suspicion of a potential PBC diagnosis is raised by an elevation of alkaline phosphatase noted on screening blood tests obtained during routine office visits. Currently, patients are more likely to be diagnosed at earlier stages of the disease, secondary to the current practice guideline that include screening of liver biochemistries during routine physical exams (Floreani et al., 2011; Prince, Chetwynd, Craig, Metcalf, & James, 2004). Clinically, PBC is monitored by assessing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. ALP is used universally in the diagnosis of the disease (as noted in both the US and r ecent European treatment guidelines (European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2017; Lindor et al., 2009) . However, other liver enzymes including gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferases (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are also used in the clinical assessment and care of patients. As the disease progresses and hepatocellular function is impaired, bilirubin levels (a direct measurement of hepatic degradation) rise and albumin and prothrombin time (assays of hepatic synthesis) are impaired. 1.2.2 Rationale for Development of EDP-305 for PBC Until most recently, there has been one approved treatment for PBC, ursode oxycholic acid (UDCA), which was approved by the FDA in 1997. UDCA is effective in more than 50 percent of patients, but up to 40 percent of patients do not achieve an adequate reduction in blood chemistries (eg, ALP and/or total bilirubin) with UDCA, while 5% to 10% are unable to tolerate UDCA. While UDCA therapy has a marked impact on clinical outcomes in PBC, up to 40% of UDCA-treated patients have a suboptimal or absent response to UDCA and, as such, are at significantly increased risk of an adverse outcome (death, requiring a liver transplant, or other clinical complications) (Carbone et al., 2013; Corpechot et al., 2008; ter Borg, Schalm, Hansen, & van Buuren, 2006) . Several studies have shown that UDCA-treated patients with early stage disease, who respond biochemically to UDCA treatment, have survival rates comparable with a standardized general population (Carbone et al., 2013; Corpechot et al., 2008; ter Borg et al., 2006) . In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for the FXR agonist Ocaliva® (obeticholic acid, OCA) for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as a single therapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2016) ."
19,page_19,"Clinical Study Protocol EDP 305-201 v3.0 (Amendment 2.0, G lobal US and EU) Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 20 of 87 Several animal models have demonstrated that the FXR has a protective effect in various diseases, including cholestatic and autoimmune liver diseases, alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver, gallstone formation, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It has been recently reported that EDP-305 potently suppresses liver injury and fibrosis in mouse models of b iliary and metabolic liver disease (An et al., 2017) . Furthermore, in the MCD diet mouse model of steatohepatitis and perisinusoidal fibrosis, EDP-305 outperformed OCA in attenuating MCD diet-induced liver injury and fibrosis. In conclusion, there remains an unmet medical need for better therapies in patients with an inadequate response to UDCA or those who cannot tolerate the drug, and those with a more advanced fibrosis stage. Results from in vitro pharmacology and animal model studies suggest that EDP-305 has the potential to satisfy this unmet medical need. 1.3 Nonclinical Studies 1.3.1 Mechanism of Action and Pharmacology A summary of pharmacology studies is presented below. Additional details for each study as well as details on additional studies can be found in the Inv estigator’s Brochure (IB) . As noted for each st udy, the natural agonist of FXR, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and/or it’s close synthetic analog obeticholic acid (OCA), were used as controls. OCA has recently been approved for the treatment of PBC. 1.3.1.1 Mechanism of Action EDP-305 is an FXR agonist which, as discussed above, plays an essential role in the feedback regulation of bile acid biosynthesis. The efficacy and potency of EDP-305 was demonstrated in several in vitro assays. x In FXR Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell reporter assays and full-length FXR Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK 293) cell reporter assays, EDP-305 and its major metabolites were potent stimulators of FXR activity. x In human Huh7.5 hepatocyte cells, EDP-305 effected a dose-dependent increase in SHP gene expression and decrease in CYP7A1 mRNA expression. x In reporter gene assays measuring activation of 25 different nuclear receptors, only FXR was activated following incubation with EDP-305. 1.3.1.2 In Vitro Pharmacology The ability of EDP - 305 to regulate over 30 key genes involved in bile acid and lipid metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, and glucose metabolism was evaluated using in vitro systems. OCA was used as a comparator/control in all cases. The results, which are described in the IB, demonstrated that EDP-305 affected the expression of 38 genes important in bile acid (5 genes)"
20,page_20,"Clinical Study Protocol EDP 305-201 v3.0 (Amendment 2.0, G lobal US and EU) Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 21 of 87 and lipid (9 genes) metabolism, inflammation (10 genes), fibrosis (8 genes) and glucose metabolism (6 genes). 1.3.1.3 In Vivo Pharmacology The efficacy of EDP- 305 was demonstrated in animal models of disease: x The regulation of FXR downstream genes critical for bile acid metabolism was assessed in C57BL/6 mice treated with EDP-305 or OCA orally for five days. EDP-305 induced a dose-dependent increase in FGF15 and SHP gene expression in the ileum, and dose- dependent increases in SHP and BSEP mRNA and decreases in CYP7A1 mRNA in the liver. In all cases, EDP-305 was more active than OCA. x STAM mice develop NASH, fibrosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma, in a manner replicating the pathological progression seen in the human disease. Treatment of STAM mice with EDP-305 for 4 weeks resulted in a significant reduction in non-fasted blood glucose levels, significant improvement in the NAFLD activity score (NAS), and significant reductions in key genes associated with fibrosis (ie, smooth muscle actin), and lipogenesis (sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c). In all cases, EDP-305 was more active than OCA. x The effects of preventative and therapeutic treatment with EDP-305 and OCA on hepatic lipids were assessed in a hamster model of dyslipidemia. In this study, treatment began concurrently with the start of a 4-week high fat/high cholesterol diet (preventative model) or two weeks later (therapeutic model). EDP-305 and OCA stimulated significant reductions in hepatic lipid levels in both the therapeutic and preventative treatment protocols. Additionally, both EDP-305 and OCA showed a moderate reduction in HOMA-IR and plasma insulin levels in the therapeutic model, suggesting the potential for improvement in insulin sensitivity. x Mdr2-/- mice develop progressive biliary-type (periportal) fibrosis resembling that observed in PSC, PBC, CFLD and congenital b iliary cirrhosis ( Ikenaga et al., 2015 ). In Mdr2-/- mice with pre-established fibrosis, administration of EDP-305 (10 or 30 mg) resulted in significant decreases in serum ALT and AST levels compared to vehicle controls. Mice receiving OCA (30 mg/kg) had a significant decrease in AST but not ALT levels. Histologically, treatment with EDP-305 resulted in a marked attenuation of fibrosis compared to placebo control mice with a 39% reduction in hepatic collagen content. Treatment with OCA at 30 mg/kg did not result in a histological improvement in fibrosis, and had no significant impact on hepatic collagen levels. Thus, treatment with EDP-305 potently improved pre-established liver injury and hepatic fibrosis in Mdr2-/- mice outperforming OCA in all parameters measured. 1.3.2 Safety Pharmacology EDP-305 was tested in a battery of safety and secondary pharmacology studies. The results of the safety pharmacology tests are shown below in Table 1 . A detailed description of the studies and results can be found in the IB."

The studies showed that EDP-305 was well absorbed with a calculated oral bioavailability of 9.0% in monkeys, 26.0% in mice, 29.2% in dogs, and 33.3% in rats. An evaluation of membrane permeab ility to EDP - 305 was performed using Caco-2 cells and showed a high in vitro permeability of 8.7 x 10-6 to 10.8 x 10-6 cm/sec at concentrations tested from 0.5 μM to 10 μM. Based on the outcome of these absorption studies, EDP-305 is projected to have a good oral absorption in humans. 1.3.3.2 Distribution Drug concentrations in the plasma, liver, and kidney were measured following 5-day oral administrations of EDP-305 to mice at 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg. Results showed that EDP-305 preferentially penetrated into the liver, which is the target organ of NASH and PBC. The liver- to-plasma exposure ratio ranged from 6.0 – 13.8. As determined by equilibr ium dialysis, plasma protein binding of EDP - 305 (1 μg/mL) was >99.9% in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. The in vitro partitioning of EDP-305 between plasma and formed elements (erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets) of whole blood was also evaluated. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratios ranged from 0.46 –0.57 in human, indicating that EDP-305 had a preferential distribution into the plasma compartment. The blood"
22,page_22,"Clinical Study Protocol EDP 305-201 v3.0 (Amendment 2.0, G lobal US and EU)Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 23 of 87to plasma partition ratio was independent of the concentrations evaluated (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 μg/mL). 1.3.3.3 Metabolism The metabolic stability of EDP - 305 was examined in liver microsomes across different species including rat, dog, monkey and human. Results showed that EDP-305 had the highest intrinsic clearance (Cl int) of 41.0 μL/min/kg in monkey liver microsomes, and had the lowest intrinsic clearance of 6.5 μL/min/kg and 6.9 μL/min/kg in rat and human liver microsomes, respectively. The human metabolites observed in in vitro liver microsome incubations were also formed in mouse and/or monkey, the primary species for general toxicology studies. Thus, no metabolites unique to humans have been observed to date. 1.3.3.4 Drug Interactions Based on preclinical evaluation, EDP-305 has low potential to inhibit CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 or to induce CYP 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4. However, incubation in the presence of EDP-305 resulted in a concentration-dependent down-regulation of mRNA for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. The in vitro studies suggest that there is potential for EDP-305 to inhibit organic anion- transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3. EDP-305 has low potential to inhibit BSEP, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), P-glycoprotein (P-gP), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters. EDP- 305 is unlikely to be a BCRP substrate but has potential to be a P-gP substrate. 1.3.4 Toxicology The nonclinical safety assessment program evaluated the potential toxicity of EDP-305 in pivotal GLP studies (mouse and monkey) and in non-pivotal studies (rat, mouse, and monkey). In all studies, the vehicle was 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose in water (ultrapure, reverse osmosis or NANOpure). The mouse was chosen as the rodent species for the definitive studies based on the presence of a gallbladder in this species versus the rat. The monkey was chosen as the non- rodent species owing to the similar metabolic profiles between monkey and human. Results of key studies are presented below while details of all studies can be found in the IB. 1.3.4.1 Repeat-dose Toxicology Studies"

CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 of 87 A Phase 1 FIH study (EDP 305-001) to evaluate the safety, tolerab ilit y, and pharmacokinetics of EDP-305 in healthy volunteers (HV) and subjects with presumptive NAFLD (PN) was conducted. The study included 2 phases: a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) phase enro lling healthy adult subjects, including a “fasted” versus “fed” two -part cohort to assess food effect (SAD/FE), and a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) phase enrolling healthy adult subjects into 3 cohorts, and subjects with PN into 3 cohorts. A total of 42 HV were planned to be enrolled into 6 SAD cohorts at doses of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg EDP-305/pl acebo and a total of 48 subjects were planned to be enrolled into 3 MAD-HV cohorts (5, 10, 20 mg EDP-305/placebo) and 3 MAD-PN cohorts (5, 10, 20 mg EDP-305/placebo). The study was amended to add a 80 mg cohort in the SAD phase, and 6 MAD cohorts (3 HV and 3 PN) assessing 3 lower doses of EDP- 305, 0.5mg, 1mg, and 2.5mg, in each subject population. In all cohorts except SAD/FE, 8 subjects were enrolled at a randomization ratio of 3:1 (6 r eceiving EDP- 305 and 2 receiving placebo (PBO)). Ten subjects were enrolled in the SAD/FE cohort and randomized 4:1, EDP-305 to PBO. A total of 146 subjects have been enrolled and r eceived at least one dose of EDP- 305 or pl acebo, and were included in the safety analyses: 50 healthy subjects in the SAD phase, and 48 healthy subjects and 48 subjects with presumptive NAFLD in the MAD phase. EDP-305 was generally well tolerated at single doses up to 80 mg and at multiple doses up to 20 mg for 14 days. TEAEs occurring in ≥ 2 EDP -305 treated subjects in MAD were: headache and pruritus in HV, and constipation and pruritus in PN. No SAEs or Grade 4 AEs were reported. Drug related pruritus was reported after multiple dosing at the higher doses of EDP -305 10 mg (n=2) and 20 mg (n=7), and PBO (n=1), with 1 discontinuation at 20 mg in HV (moderate). Majority of drug related pruritus were mild to moderate (except one subject with severe). No pruritus was observed at lower doses (below 10 mg). No clinically significant laboratories were reported except one transient Grade 2 ALT/AST elevation in one subject (MAD-HV-20 mg) that led to drug discontinuation. Total, LDL-, HDL- cholesterol and triglycerides did not differ between EDP-305 and pl acebo in either healthy or PN subjects at any dose, except at 20 mg in PN for cholesterol and HDL. A dose proportional increase in exposure was observed following single and multiple doses of EDP-305. Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles following single doses of EDP-305, indicated linear, one-compartment PK, with monophasic decline. Half-life was similar following single doses with a mean ranging from 11 to 16 hours. A high fat meal increased EDP -305 exposure by approximately 200%. Half-life ranged from 10-23 hours following multiple doses of EDP-305. There was more drug accumulation (~3-fold) observed following 20 mg dose compared to lower doses. Similar exposures were observed in both HV and PN subjects. The metabolite (EP - 022571, EP-022572 and EP-022679) levels were generally low (<5% of parent drug), following single and multiple doses of EDP-305.

STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, pl acebo-controlled, dose-ranging st udy assessing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of two doses of EDP-305 in subjects with PBC with or without an inadequate response to UDCA. The study is composed of 3 phases or periods: x Screening period which includes the Screening Visit and may occur over a time period of 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug x Treatment period which begins with the first dose of study drug on Day 1 and concludes with the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit on Day 84 (Week12) x Safety Follow-up period which includes the End of Study (EOS) Visit on Day 112. 4.1 Dose and Treatment Schedule Subjects will be ra ndomized in a 3:3:1 ratio to one of two doses of EDP-305 and pl acebo. Every subject will r eceive a single daily dose of blinded st udy drug for a total of 12 weeks. An overview of the study design is shown in Figure 1. Study visits and assessments are detailed in the Schedule of Assessment (SoA) in Appendix 1. Figure 1: Study Design Abbreviations: D=Day; W=Week"
41,page_41,"Clinical Study Protocol EDP 305-201 v3.0 (Amendment 2.0, G lobal US and EU) Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 42 of 87 4.2 Rationale for Study Design This proposed trial w ill evaluate EDP - 305 in patients with PBC who w ill be ra ndomized to one of three treatment groups: (1) 1 mg EDP-305, (2) 2.5 mg EDP-305, or (3) pl acebo in a 3:3:1 ratio. 4.2.1 Justification of Design and Control Group Until recently, ursode oxycholic acid (UDCA) has been the only approved treatment for PBC, which was approved by the FDA in 1997. While UDCA therapy has a marked impact on clinical outcomes in PBC, up to 40% of UDCA-treated patients have a suboptimal or absent response to UDCA and, as such, are at significantly increased risk of an adverse outcome (death, requiring a liver transplant, or other clinical complications) (Carbone et al., 2013 ; Corpechot et al., 2008 ; ter Borg et al., 2006 ) (U.S. Department of HHS Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.) ( https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov , Sept 5, 2016). In May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for the FXR a gonist Ocaliva ® (obeticholic acid, OCA) for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as a single therapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2016). The confirmatory trials are ongoing. This Phase 2 double-blind, parallel dose group study evaluating 3 doses of EDP-305 compared to placebo was designed to assess the safety, efficacy, and PK of EDP- 305 for the treatment of subjects with PBC over a 12-week treatment period. This trial will establish the effect of adding EDP-305 to the PBC standard of care treatment, UDCA on the ALP change. Patients w ill continue their pre-study stable dose of UDCA throughout the trial. Accordingly, patients w ill not have any standard therapies withheld in the trial. The use of placebo is implemented to maintain the study blind and scientific validity of the trial. Some patients cannot tolerate UDCA; their standard of care does not include UDCA. Patients taking drugs that might have effects in PBC or recently c onditionally approved (i.e., OCA) are being excluded from the trial to ensure that the trial provides the clearest comparison of the effects of EDP -305 with pl acebo. 4.2.2 Justification of EDP-305 Dose This phase 2 trial has been designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerab ilit y of 2 doses (1 mg, and 2.5 mg) of EDP-305 in patients with PBC so as to provide proof of concept data to support Phase 3 in this indication. Study EDP 305-001 characterized a broad range of single and multiple doses: from 1 to 80 mg in the SAD part, and from 0.5 to 20 mg in the MAD part, and administered as an oral suspension. The safety and tolerabilit y of EDP - 305 has been established not only in healthy subjects but also in subjects with presumptive NAFLD at doses up to 80 mg single dose and up to 20 mg once daily for 14 consecutive days."
42,page_42,"Clinical Study Protocol EDP 305-201 v3.0 (Amendment 2.0, G lobal US and EU)Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 43 of 87As demonstrated in study EDP 305-001, EDP-305 was generally well tolerated at single doses up to 80 mg and at multiple doses up to 20 mg for 14 days. No SAEs or Grade 4 AEs were reported. No clinically significant laboratories were reported except one transient Grade 2 ALT/AST elevation in n=1 (MAD-HV-20mg) that led to drug discontinuation. Drug related pruritus was reported after multiple dosing at the higher doses of EDP-305 10 mg (n=2) and 20 mg (n=7), and PBO (n=1), with 1 discontinuation at 20 mg in HV. Total, LDL-, HDL- cholesterol and triglycerides did not differ between EDP-305 and placebo in healthy at any dose or PN subjects at any dose, except for cholesterol and HDL at 20mg. The pharmacokinetics of EDP-305 was profiled over a broad range of single and multiple doses. A dose proportional increase in exposure was observed over the broad dose range studied. Half- life ranged from 11-16 hours and from 10-23 hours following single and multiple doses of EDP- 305, respectively. There was more drug accumulation observed following 20 mg dose compared to lower doses, indicating a potential change in the PK profile at 20 mg. Based on observed safety profile to date, pharmacokinetics profile and changes in C4 and FGF- 19 in study EDP 305-001 and relative bioavailab ility data from st udy 006, ( Section 1.4.2.4), EDP-305 doses of 1 and 2.5 mg once daily using the tablet formulation are selected for this study. The exposures associated with this dose range are expected to result in clinically meaningful changes in C4 and other relevant markers of FXR activity (FGF-19), while minimizing the incidence of potential adverse events (i.e. pruritus). Doses of 1 and 2.5 mg using the tablet formulation in the fasted state (comparable to approximately 2.5 and 5 mg using the suspension formulation in the fasted state)"
43,page_43,"Clinical Study Protocol EDP 305-201 v3.0 (Amendment 2.0, G lobal US and EU) Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 44 of 87 are expected to provide exposures associated with clinically meaningful changes in C4 and FGF- 19, while minimizing the incidence of potential adverse events (i.e. pruritus). In summary, based on data from studies 001, 004, and 006, doses of 1 and 2.5 mg are expected to provide: x A safe and tolerable regimen with lowest chance to induce pruritus x Plasma exposures representing linear, time-independent PK and correlated with desirable dose dependent changes in PD markers suitable for a once daily dosing x Maximal decreases in C4 ranging from approximately 67% to 85% at steady state and associated increases in FGF-19 ranging from approximately 1000% to 1700% at steady state. Given the similarity in the MOA between EDP-305 and OCA, the expected changes in C4/FGF-19 over the selected dose range for EDP-305 in phase 2 studies, are expected to be associated with relevant downstream pharmacological effects clinically relevant changes in liver markers."

The subject will be instructed to take all st udy drug doses at home except when study drug w ill be administered in the clinic (ie, at the Days 1 and 3, and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 visits). The subject will be instructed to take the st udy drug approximately at the same time every day (ie, orally in the morning after fasting overnight for a minimum of 8 hours). If a subject forgets to take their study drug at their scheduled time, the dose may be taken later that day following a minimum of 4 hours fast; however, no more than 1 dose should be taken on any calendar day and a minimum of 16 hours between doses should be maintained. Stopping rules for study drug administration are provided in Section 10.1. 5.7.1 Dispensing of Study Drug When drug is dispensed at the clinic, study drug may be dispensed only under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist or an authorized designee and only for administration to the study subjects. A 4-week supply of blinded study drug in individually labelled bottles w ill be dispensed by qualified site personnel to the subject at the visit on Day 1, Week 4, and 8. The bottle number dispensed to the subject and the number of tablets dispensed will be recorded in the site source documents. Subjects will be instructed to store st udy drug in the original bottle under refrigerated conditions. Subjects w ill be provided with a cooler bag to bring the st udy drug home. Once returning home, the subject will be instructed to refrigerate the st udy medication, removing it only for dosing. 5.7.2 Treatment Compliance The subject will be instructed to bring all st udy drug (including empty bottles) to the clinic at each st udy visit. Both accountab ility and st udy drug compliance w ill be reviewed at each visit as indicated in the SoA ( Appendix 1).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 48 of 875.8 Concomitant Medications Subjects taking UDCA at the start of the study must remain on the same dose of UDCA throughout the 12-week dosing period. If the Investigator believes that dosing with UDCA should be stopped due to adverse r eactions, then the Medical Monitor s hould be consulted prior to discontinuing the drug. Subjects who were not taking UDCA at the start of the study w ill not be allowed to initiate treatment during the study. All subjects enrolled in the study must abstain from taking any prohibited concomitant medication through the end of study. Details of prior and concomitant medication use will be recorded in the source documentation and the electronic case report form (eCRF) as indicated in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ). 5.8.1 Co-administration of EDP-305 and Ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid, UDCA) Drug-drug interaction between EDP-305 and UDCA is not anticipated based on available EDP-305 drug-drug interaction (see Section 1.4.2 ), and on UDCA metabolic profile from the literature. In the liver, ursodiol is conjugated with glycine or taurine, then secreted into bile. These conjugates of ursodiol are absorbed in the small intestine by passive and active mechanisms. The conjugates can also be deconjugated in the ileum by intestinal enzymes, leading to the formation of free ursodiol that can be reabsorbed and reconjugated in the liver. Nonabsorbed ursodiol passes into the colon where it is mostly 7- dehydroxylated to lithocholic acid. Some ursodiol is epimerized to chenodiol (CDCA) via a 7-oxo intermediate. Chenodiol also undergoes 7-dehydroxylation to form lithocholic acid. These metabolites are poorly soluble and excreted in the feces. A small portion of lithocholic acid is reabsorbed, conjugated in the liver with glycine, or taurine and sulfated at the 3 position. The resulting sulfated lithocholic acid conjugates are excreted in bile and then lost in feces ( Axcan Scandipharm Inc., 2007 ). As UDCA is primarily metabolized through conjugation, EDP-305 is not expected to have an impact on the metabolism of UDCA. Available data from Study EDP 305-005 indicated that CYP3A4 is a major pathway for EDP- 305 metabolism, as is also supported by preclinical phenotyping data ( refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional detail). As reported in the literature, UDCA did not have an effect on midazolam pharmacokinetics (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) ( Becquemont et al., 2006 ;Dilger, Denk, Heeg, & Beuers, 2005 ). UDCA had limited effect on digoxin (a sensitive P -gp substrate) ( Becquemont et al., 2006 ). Based on this information, UDCA is not expected to have an effect on EDP-305 pharmacokinetics during co-administration."

The unblinding method w ill use the IWRS process. Unblinding of individual subject treatment by the Investigator should be limited to medical emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject's study treatment is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, the Investigator must first attempt to contact the study Medical Monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. In situations in which the Investigator has attempted and failed to contact the Medical Monitor, and/or the urgency of the case required immediate action, he/she should use his/her best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and proceed with unblinding. Once a subject's treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent clinical situation, the Medical Monitor and study coordinator should be notified within 24 hours of unblinding of the treatment. Information relating to unblinding (the reason, date, etc.) should be clearly recorded in the subject’s study file . In addition, the Investigator should consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding should be considered a serious adverse event (SAE), according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report as described in Section 9.2. CRO pharmacovigilance will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with Regulatory reporting requirements. In addition, Enanta may unblind individual subjects at any time for matters relating to safety concerns."

STUDY CONDUCT AND VISIT SCHEDULE 7.1 Study Visits Details of assessments at each visit are presented in the SoA ( Appendix 1). 7.1.1 Scr eening Screening procedures will occur after the subject signs and dates an Institutiona l Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) approved ICF and provides authorization to use protected health information (See Section 12.1.3) . The ICF will be completed prior to c onduct of any study-specific procedures. Screening procedures will be conducted as listed in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ). Screening will occur over a period lasting no more than 28 days. For each subject, Screening can occur on one day or over multiple days. All Screening assessments must occur no earlier than 28 days before the first dose of study drug at the Day 1 visit. If any Screening assessment falls outside of that window, the Investigator should consult with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor to determine if the assessment needs to be repeated. If a subject does not qualify for study entry due to an out-of-range lab value that is not consistent with the subject’s medical history or appears spurious, with the approval of the Medical Monitor, the subject may retest that lab parameter once if the Investigator believes that he/she would qualify upon retest. At the completion of Screening procedures/assessments, subjects who qualify for the study should be given detailed instructions on fasting requirements prior to the first dose and when to return to the clinic for the Day 1 visit. 7.1.2 Rescreening Subjects who met all eligibility criteria that were current at the time of their Screening Visit may be re screened under the following circumstances and with the approval of the medical monitor: x Subjects within the Screening Period who met all eligibility criteria, but are not able to obtain required documentation within the allotted window for the Screening Period. x Subjects who are eligible, but transiently (for personal reasons) unable to commit to all study procedures 7.1.3 Baseline V isit (Day1) Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria w ill report to the clinic on the morning of Study Day 1 after fasting overnight for a minimum of 8 hours. After a review"

CONFIDENTIAL Page 53 of 87 of applicable inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects who continue to satisfy eligibility requirements will be ra ndomized in a 3:3:1 ratio to their treatment group. Predose assessments and procedures will be c onducted as noted in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ) and considered Baseline values. After predose/Baseline study procedures are completed, subjects w ill receive the first dose of study drug in the clinic on Day 1 followed by PK and biomarker blood draws. Additional PK, C4, FGF19 and Bile Acid samples will be collected from subjects at a subset of sites (PK/PD Substudy) that have the technical capab ility to collect and process intensive (l onger duration) sampling. PK and PD samples will be collected as described in Section 8.4. Before leaving the clinic, subjects will r eceive st udy medication and instructions on how to take the medication at home. 7.1.4 Treatment Period Visits (Day 3, Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 /EOT) Except for days when there is a clinic visit, subjects will take their daily dose of st udy drug at home for 12 weeks. Throughout the 12-week treatment period, subjects w ill return to the clinic as shown in the SoA ( Appendix 1) for study assessments. Prior to each visit, subjects will be instructed to fast for a minimum of 8 hrs prior to the scheduled visit time. At the end of the treatment period, subjects will complete the EOT visit. Subjects who complete 12 weeks of treatment will complete the EOT assessments at the Day 84 visit /Week 12. Subjects who discontinue treatment early should complete EOT assessments at the time of discontinuation (if in the clinic) or as soon thereafter as possible if the subject discontinues treatment while not in the clinic. Procedures performed are specified in the SoA ( Appendix 1). Population PK and PK/PD samples w ill be collected as specified in the SoA ( Appendix 1) and as described in Section 8.4. Subjects should discontinue drug on Day 84. Subjects, who return for their EOT Visit after Day 84, should stop dosing on Day 84 (Week 12 Visit). 7.1.5 Safety Follow-up Period (End of Study Visit) All subjects, including those who discontinue treatment early, should return to the clinic for the End of Study (EOS) visit 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug for safety assessments (Appendix 1). For subjects who complete the study, the EOS visit would be scheduled on Day 112. Following completion of study procedures, subjects w ill be terminated from the st udy. Any subject with ongoing AEs/SAEs (serious adverse events) at the EOS visit should be followed until resolution of their AE/SAE or until the Investigator has determined that the event has stabilized as discussed in Section 9.3 ."

CONFIDENTIAL Page 54 of 87 7.2 Subject Withdrawal / Early Termination Subjects are free to withdraw their participation at any time during this clinical trial. The Investigator has the right to remove any subject from treatment with study drug or participation in the study. However, the Investigator should consult with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor before prematurely removing a subject. For any subject who decides to withdraw from the study, the Investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject to return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow-up with the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events. Although a subject may discontinue study treatment, every effort must be made to continue the subject on the study, returning for the EOT visit (if prematurely discontinuing treatment) and the safety follow-up visit. If a subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected. Enanta may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. For safety monitoring purposes, subjects who withdraw after receiving st udy drug should return to the clinic as soon as possible and undergo the EOT evaluations (SoA , Appendix 1). Subjects should then return for the Safety Follow Up assessments 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Any subject who withdraws with ongoing AEs/SAEs should be followed until resolution of their AE(s) or until the Investigator has determined that the AE(s) has stabilized. Site personnel w ill attempt to contact any subject who does not return to the clinic for the EOS visit at least three times using the subject’s preferred method of communication, followed by a certified letter if the three attempts were unsuccessful. Any subject who still ca nnot be reached following those attempts will be considered Lost to Follow -up. These subjects will be included in the analysis as indicated in Section 11.3 . 7.2.1 Withdrawal Criteria The primary consideration in any determination to discontinue a subject’s participation must be the health and welfare of the subject. Reasons for withdrawal may include, but are not limited, to the following: x Adverse Event x Noncompliance with study drug dosing or study procedures x Lack of efficacy x Lost to follow-up x Withdrawal by subject x Protocol deviation"

Subjects who prematurely withdraw from the study for any reason after having been randomized will not be repl aced. 7.2.2 Documentation of Withdrawal of Subjects The reason for early withdrawal/termination/lost-to-follow-up of any subject from the study must be documented on the appropriate eCRF. If the reason for early withdrawal is an AE or an abnormal laboratory value, the specific event or test result, if available, should be recorded on the AE eCRF and the subject should be monitored until the event is resolved or deemed stable by the Investigator. 7.3 Site or Study Discontinuation 7.3.1 Study Discontinuation The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: x The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to subjects. x Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory. x A decision from the IRB/EC or regulatory authority to terminate the st udy. If the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, Enanta Pharm aceuticals, Inc. w ill promptly notify the Investigator and will also inform the regulatory authorities of the suspension or termination of the study and the reasons for the action. The Investigator is responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC, and providing the reasons for the suspension or termination of the study. 7.3.2 Site Termination A single site may warrant termination under the following conditions: x Failure of the site to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate. x Failure of the site to comply with pertinent governmental regulations as appropriate. x Submission of knowingly false information from the research fac ility to the S ponsor, clinical monitor, or governmental authority."

STUDY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS All visits and assessments should be conducted as shown in the SoA ( Appendix 1) . 8.1 Demographics and Medical History Demographics and baseline characteristics including date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity and medical history will be obtained from each subject and entered in the eCRF as reported. As a general rule, all medical events occurring within the last 6 months should be recorded. For events which occurred more than 6 months ago (and which are not ongoing), only significant or relevant events should be entered on the eCRF. Any items in the history that are st ill ongoing should be noted as such in the eCRF. All surgeries occurring in adulthood should be recorded in the eCRF while methods of contr aception, if applicable, s hould only be documented in the source documents. If possible, the date of diagnosis of PBC should be recorded. 8.2 Clinical Evaluations 8.2.1 Vital Sign Measurements and ECGs Vital signs will include heart rate (HR), respiratory rate, blood pressure (BP) and oral temperature. Vital signs will be measured at times shown in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ) after the subject has been supine for 5 minutes. Temperature should be taken at the Screening, Day 1 and EOS visits. Resting 12-lead ECGs will be done locally and recorded at the times indicated in the SoA after the subject has been supine for 5 minutes. A standard bedside 12-lead ECG machine that calculates heart rate and measures the PR, QRS, QT, RR, and QTc ( QTcF) intervals will be utilized. If a bl ood draw and ECG are scheduled at the same time, then the ECG should be obtained first. The Investigator or designee should review the ECGs in real-time for gross abnormalities and interval measurements of concern (absolute readings and for postdose ECGs, change from Baseline). Clinical interpretation of the ECGs by the Investigator or designee should be recorded on a hard copy of the ECGs. The Investigator or designee should repeat any ECG with a change from baseline in QTcF >60 msec or a QTcF interval >500 msec. Also, ECGs may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator to account for erroneous readings."

CONFIDENTIAL Page 58 of 87 Prior to dosing the Baseline ECG must be reviewed to confirm that no clinically significant cardiac abnormalities are present. 8.2.2 Physical Examination The Investigator or designee will perform the physical examination. A full physical examination will be c onducted at Screening and EOS as indicated in the SoA ( Appendix 1) and will include examination of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes/ears/nose/throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; chest, lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. All subsequent physical examinations w ill be targeted to new signs and symptoms including specific assessments of any changes from previous status. Only clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded in the eCRF (eg, use of contact lenses does not need to be recorded). 8.2.3 Weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) Height should be recorded once at the Screening visit while weight should be recorded at the Screening and EOS visits. BMI should be calculated at the times shown in the SoA ( Appendix 1 ) according to the following equation: BMI=weight (kg)/height (m) 2. 8.2.4 PBC-40 Quality of Life Assessment The PBC-40 Quality of Life Assessment (PBC-40 QoL) is a st udy of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). It is a survey containing domains of PBC-40 relate to fatigue, emotional, social, and cognitive function, general symptoms, and itch. This measure has been validated for PBC and the survey will be provided to sites by Enanta. The PBC-40 QoL will be performed as indicated in the SoA ( Appendix 1). 8.2.5 Assessment of Pruritus Pruritus will be monitored in this st udy. As listed below, two separate scales w ill be used to assess pruritus in subjects. x An itch visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to record the intensity of the event ( Furue et al., 2013 ). Site personnel should instruct the subject to draw a line on the scale corresponding to the maximum intensity of itch. x The 5-D itch scale is a multidimensional questionnaire completed by subjects assessing pruritus. The 5D-itch scale includes a range of 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst imaginable itch) covering five dimensions: degree, duration, direction, disability and distribution. The scales should be completed by the subject as indicated in the SoA ( Appendix 1)."

CONFIDENTIAL Page 59 of 87 8.2.6 Adverse Events The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in Section 8.1 of this protocol. All AEs and SAEs must be recorded in the source documents and eCRF as described below ( Section 9.2 ). At all visits, the PI or designee should inquire about the occurrence of AEs. The following are examples of open-ended questions that may be used to obtain this information: “How are you feeling?” ; ""Have you had any medical problems recently?"" ; ""Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit/assessment?"" It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to ensure any n ecessary additional therapeutic measures and follow-up procedures are performed and documented in the subject source notes and eCRF. Any medication taken during the course of the study through the end of the study w ill be re corded with indication, dosage, route of administration, and start and stop dates of administration. All subjects will be questioned a bout concomitant medication at each clinic visit as indicated in the SoA ( Appendix 1) . 8.3 Clinical Laboratory and Diagnostic Procedures All laboratory samples will be analyzed by a centralized laboratory. A laboratory reference manual will be provided to the site detailing kit contents, reordering s upplies, sample collection (see below), handling, storage and shipment instructions. All unblinded laboratory values w ill be reviewed by the Investigator, documented, and the results maintained in the source documents. All out-of-range lab findings require an interpretation as to whether or not they are clinically significant. Clinically significant laboratory findings in the opinion of the Investigator should be recorded as an AE (or SAE as appropriate). At all visits blood samples should be collected before the first dose of the study drug. Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if j udged clinically appropriate by the Investigator, or if the safety review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of clinical laboratory safety evaluations. Any changes to the scheduled times of the clinical laboratory determination will be agreed to by Enanta and the Investigator, and documented in the study trial master file (TMF). For Biomarker analysis, fasting serum or plasma samples should be collected before the daily dose of study drug for analysis of FGF19, bile acids, C4, and at visits indicated in the SoA (Appendix 1). Samples should be collected after an overnight fast of a minimum of 8 hours. 8.3.1 Safety Laboratory Assessments Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory assessments w ill be collected according to the SoA (refer to Table 14) .

SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING 9.1 Definitions 9.1.1 Pretreatment Events A pretreatment event is any event that meets the criteria for an AE/SAE and occurs after the subject signs the ICF but before receiving the first administration of st udy drug. 9.1.2 Adverse Events An AE is any event, side effect, or untoward medical occurrence in a subject enrolled in a clinical trial whether or not it is considered to have a causal relationship to the study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, laboratory finding outside of normal range with associated clinical symptoms or suspected latent clinical symptoms in the opinion of the Investigator, physical examination finding, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug. The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by non-directive questioning of the subject at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during or between visits or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments. Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed before the subject was enrolled in the study are not to be considered AEs unless the condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the study (eg, surgery was performed earlier than planned). 9.1.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: x Results in death: This includes deaths that appear to be completely unrelated to study medication (eg, a car accident). x Is a life-threatening event: An event that places the subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. x Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization of an existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: o routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition o elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF"
66,page_66,"Clinical Study Protocol EDP 305-201 v3.0 (Amendment 2.0, G lobal US and EU) Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page 67 of 87 o treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission o social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject's general condition x Results in permanent or prolonged (at least 28 days in duration) disab ilit y or incapacity. x Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of a study subject. x Medically important event: An event that may not be immediately life-threatening, or result in death or hospitalization, or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, but is considered medically significant for other reasons. An opportunistic or otherwise unusual infection for the PI's practice, such as tuberculosis, w ill be considered medically significant. The term severe is used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe); the event itself, however, may be of minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as serious, which is based on outcome of the event, as described above. Seriousness, not intensity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 9.2 Documenting and Reporting of Adverse Events (Including Serious Adverse Events) Adverse Events will be evaluated and documented using the grading scales contained in the National Cancer Institute, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 4.03). 9.2.1 Documenting and Reporting Adverse Events All AEs reported from the time of informed consent to the end-of-study for each subject w ill be recorded in the subject’s source documents. For subjects who do not receive st udy drug (ie, screen failures), AEs will only be recorded in the source documents . For subjects enrolled into the study (ie, randomized), record all AEs in the subject’s AE eCRF and Clinical Trials SAE Form (if applicable).

Any recurrence of an AE with similar causality to study drug w ill be reported as recurrence or exacerbation of the initial event, and not as a new event. Whenever possible, report AEs as a specific diagnosis or syndrome (eg, flu syndrome) rather than as individual signs or symptoms. If no specific diagnosis or syndrome is identified, AEs should be reported as separate and individual events. An AE includes the following: x Progression or exacerbation of the subject’s underlying disease . Clinical sequelae that result from disease progression, such as pleural effusion or small bowel obstruction, are reportable as AEs. x Pre-existing event that increases in frequency or intensity. x Condition detected or diagnosed during the study period, even though it may have been present, in retrospect, prior to the first dose of study drug. x Laboratory abnormalities outside of normal limits and requiring therapeutic intervention. x An overdose of the study drug without any signs or symptoms w ill be considered an AE. A calculated dose that exceeds its correct dose by 10% or more and is administered to the subject will be considered an overdose and documented as an AE. The following events will not be identified as AEs in this study: x Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, etc); however, the condition (the “triggering event”) that leads to the procedure may be an AE. x Pre-existing conditions present or detected prior to the first dose of study drug that do not worsen. 9.2.2 Assigning Attribution of Adverse Events The Investigator must attempt to determine the cause of each event. Every effort will be made by the Investigator to assess the relationship of each AE to study drug. To ensure consistency of AE/SAE causality assessments, Investigator(s) should apply the following guideline: Related: There is an association between the event and the administration of study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study drug and causes other than the study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event re-appeared on re-exposure to the study drug. Possibly Related: There is an association between the event and the administration of the study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to study drug, but there may"

Unlikely Related: The event is unlikely to be related to the study drug and likely to be related to factors other than study drug. Not Related: The event is related to an etiology other than the study drug (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record). 9.2.3 Classifying Action Taken with Study Drug In the case of an AE, the actions that can be taken with study drug are defined below in Table 15 . Table 15: Options for Action Taken with Study Drug Classification Definition Dose Not Changed Study drug dose not changed in response to the AE Dose Reduced Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE Drug Interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE Drug Withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE Not Applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable” should be used in circumstances when no opportunity to decide whether to continue, interrupt or withdraw treatment was possible such as when the investigational treatment had been completed before the adverse event began. 9.2.4 Classifying Adverse Event Outcome For every AE/SAE, the possible outcomes of the event and the definition of the outcome are shown below in Table 16. O ne outcome must be entered into the appropriate field on the AE and (if appropriate) SAE form for each event as discussed in the eCRF instructions."

On the Clinical Trials SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) w ill be assessed only as related or not related. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the Investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report the outcome of the event to using the SAE Form. The Investigator is responsible for notifying the Sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug . The SAE Form should be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on previously reported events .

In addition, as listed below, two separate scales will be used to assess pruritus in subjects who report itching. xAn itch visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to record the intensity of the event ( Furue et al., 2013 ). Site personnel should instruct the subject to draw a line on the scale corresponding to the maximum intensity of itch. xThe 5-D itch scale is a multidimensional questionnaire completed by subjects assessing pruritus. The 5D-itch scale includes a range of 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst imaginable itch) covering five dimensions: degree, duration, direction, disability and distribution. If reported, pruritus should be assessed at each visit until resolution of the event. The scales should be completed by the subject/site personnel during each assessment/visit where pruritus is reported."
