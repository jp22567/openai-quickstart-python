Effect iveness for the acute treatment of migraine was init ially demonstrated in a Phase 2b double -blind, rando mized, placebo - controlled, dose -ranging study where rimegepant at 75 mg showed efficacy on all four tradi tional endpoints: pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia .1Efficacy was confirmed in two pivotal Phase 3 trials using the current registrational co -primary endpoints of Pain Freedo m and Freedo m from Most Bothersome Symptom at 2 hours after dosing. This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficac y, safet y, and tolerabilit y of rimegepant for the prevent ion of migraine. Target Populatio n:The study will recrui t male and female subjects , 18 years of age or older wi th at least a one -year history of migraine (with or without aura) consistent with a diagnosi s according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edit ion.2Per their own report, s ubjects must have migraine onset prior to age 50, migraine attacks that last 4-72 hours (if not treated) and have had, 4-18 migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensit y per 4 weeks period within the 12 weeks prior to the screening visit. After a 28-day observatio n peri od of standard of care, up to approximately 800 eligible subjects will be rando mized to receive rimegepant or placebo , with dosing on an every other day (EOD ) dosing schedule. At the complet ion of the 12 -week doubl e -blind ,treatm ent p hase, subjects will be evaluated for entry into the 52-week open label ,extensio n phase if laboratory test resul ts meet protocol entry criteria (Table 2). Number of Subjects:Approximately 1500 subjects will be screened to rando mize up to approximately 800 subjects to rimegepant or placebo . It i s estimated that approximately 675 subjects will be entered into the open -label extensio n phase."

The Screening phase includes a screening visit and a 28-day Observation Period. For subjects to be eligible for the study , they must report having had 4-18 migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensity per month in the 3 m onths pri or to the Screening Visit , and at least 6migraine days and no more than 18 headache days during the 28-day Observat ion Peri od whi ch will be docum ented i n the eDiary . Upon com pletion of the Screening visit, subjects will be pro vided an electroni c diary (eDiary )to docum ent each day o f the 28-day Observation Period if a migraine occurred and the migraine intensity. Subjects will record the standard of care migraine treatment received on a paper diary and female subjects will record their menstrual period inform ation on a paper log. After complet ing the 28-day Observat ion Period, the subject will return to the clinic wit h both diaries for the Baseline Visit. Subjects will have blood drawn for baseline lab profiles at the Pre-Rando mizat ionLabVisit; this visi t must occur wi thin96 hours (4 days) of the Baseline Visit .

It i s characteri zed by moderate -to-severe episodic unilateral pulsat ing headaches that last for 4 to 72 hours. Ty pical characteri stics of the headache are unilateral location, pul sating qualit y, moderate or severe intensit y, aggravat ion by routine physical act ivity, and associat ion with nausea and/or photophobia and phonophobia.1BHV -3000 (rimegepant) is a calcitonin gene -related pepti de (CGRP) receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatm ent of migraine. The CGRP receptor is located within pain- signaling pathways, intracranial arteri es and m ast cells and i ts activa tion is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysio logy. For example, research and clinical studies have shown: serum levels of CGRP are el evated during migraine attacks, infusion o f intravenous CGRP produces persistent pain in migraine sufferers and non -migraine sufferers, and treatment with ant i-migraine drugs normalize CGRP l evels. Addit ionally, m ultiple clinical studies show that small mo lecule CGRP receptor antagonists, which inhibit the binding of endogenous CGRP to CGRP receptors, are effec tive in aborting migraine attacks. Treatm entwith a CGRP receptor antagonist is believed to relieve migraine through the possible mechanisms of 1)blocking neurogenic inflammation, 2) decreasing artery dilat ion, and 3) inhibit ing pain transmissio n. There i swidespread agreement that this new approach avo ids the cardiovascular effects produced by act ive vasoconstriction associ ated wi th the current standard triptan therapy (non-selective 5 -HT1B/1D agonists (e.g., sumatriptan [Imi trex™]) ). 1.2 CGRP’s Role in Migr aine The CGRP receptor is located within pain -signaling pathway s, intracranial arteries and mast cells and its act ivation is thought to play a causal ro le in migraine pathophysio logy. For exam ple, research and clinical studies have shown: serum levels o f CGRP are el evated during migraine attacks, infusio n of intravenous CGRP produces persistent pain in migraine sufferers and non - migraine sufferers, and treatment with anti -migraine drugs normalize CGRP levels. Addit ionally, multiple clinical studies show tha t small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, which inhibit the binding of endogenous CGRP to CGRP receptors, are effect ive in aborting migraine attacks. Treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist is believed to relieve migraine through the fo llowing possible mechanisms: Blocking Neurogenic Inflammation: Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to CGRP receptors l ocated on m ast cells woul d inhibit inflammat ion caused by trigeminal nerve release of CGRP onto mast cells wit hin the tough outer covering of the brain, or the meninges. Decreasing Artery Dilation: By blocking the CGRP receptors located in smooth muscle cells wit hin vessel walls, CGRP receptor antagonists would inhibit the pathologic dilat ion of intracranial arteries wit hout the unwanted effect of act ive v asoconstri ction."
23,page_23,"Protocol BHV3000 -305 Confidential Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Study for Migraine Prevention Version 9Page 24of 91 Inhibiting Pain Transmission: Binding o f CGRP receptor antagonists to CGRP receptors would suppress the transmissio n of pain by inhibit ing the central relay o f pain signals from the tri geminal nerve to the caudal trigeminal nucleus . 1.3 Produc t Development Background Details o f the clinical and preclinical studies are provided in the most current Investigator Brochure. A summary of the rel evant dat ato the study are presented below. 1.3.1 Clinical Adverse Event Profile Rimegepant appears to be generally safe and well tolerated in humans when given as single oral doses up to the maximum dose of 1500 mg and mult iple oral doses up to the maximum daily dose of 600 mg for 14 day s. The on going BHV3000 -201 study is a Phase 2/3, 52-week, open - label, safet y study with rimegepant 75 mg that is designed to enroll approximately 2000 subjects to receive rimegepant up to once daily .Please refer to the Invest igators Brochure for a summary of the clinical safet y profile. The primary identified AE of interest is potential change in liver funct ion tests. Investigators must carefully mo nitor routine liver function tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and ALP) and potenti ally liver rel ated symptom s and signs. Clinicians should also monitor ch anges in hematol ogy and other l aboratory measures. Pl ease refer to the current Invest igators Brochure for further informat ion regarding the clinical safet y profile o f rimegepant. 1.4 Study Rationale Thedemonstrated efficacy of rimegepant in the three pivotal Phase 3 regi strati onal trials in the acute treatm ent of migraine and the safet y profile observed to date in the Phase 2/3 BHV3000- 201 l ong-term open -label safet y study with up to daily dosing for as l ong as 1 y earsuggest that rimegepant may have an impor tant rol e in the treatment of migraine. This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy , safet y, and tol erabili ty of rimegepant for the prevention of migraine. It will also further define the safet y profile o f rimegepant administration foras long as 64 weeks . Approximately 800 subjects will dose with blinded study drug at leastevery other day for a peri od of approximately 12 weeks , followed by an addi tional 52 weeks with open -label rimegepant with scheduled dosing every other day as well . During the open -label portion of the study , on days wi thout scheduled rimegepant dosing, subjects may take up to 1 tablet of rimegepant per calendar day as needed for acute treatment of migraine."
24,page_24,"Protocol BHV3000 -305 Confidential Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Study for Migraine Prevention Version 9Page 25of 91 1.4.1 Study Design Rationale This is a 12-week multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo con trolled evaluat ion of the safet y and efficacy of rimegepant 75 m g tablet taken every other day for the prevent ion of migraine with a 52-week open -label extensio n phase . Up to approximately 800 s ubjects will be rando mized and assigned treatment in the doubl e-blind phase of the study ; it is est imated that approximately 675 subjects will enter the open -label phase of the study .During the double -blind phase, subjects will be instructed that they must take one table t of blinded study drug every other calendar day . If subjects have a migraine during the double -blind phase o f the study , if needed, they may treat the migraine with their standard of care medicat ionand continue to take study medicat ion on thei r regul ar schedule (scheduled dosing days only ). During the open -label phase of the study , subjects will be required to take one tabl et of rimegepant every other calendar day . However, if subjects have a migraine on a day that they are not scheduled to dose with rim egepant, they may take 1 tablet of rimegepant on that calendar day to treat the migraine. Dosing with more than 1 tablet of study medicat ion per calendar day is not permitted. Therefore, subjects can take a maximum o f one tabl et of study drug per calendar day for the 52weeks of the open -label phase. The study will randomize approximately 800 subjects and it is expected that approximately 675 subjects will enter the open -label phase of the study. During the doubl e-blind phase, the subjects willbe rando mized in a 1:1 ratio to the rimegepant or placebo treatment groups , stratified by current use of prophylact ic migraine medicat ions (yes or no) . 1.4.2 Dose Selection The Phase 2b dose -ranging study CN170003 established that rimegepant 75 mg is the minim um effect ive dose for the acute treatment of migraine. The three Phase 3 studies BHV3000 -301, BHV3000 -302, and BHV3000- 303confirmed this efficacy using the current registrational endpo ints for acute treatment of migraine. In addit ion, several CGRP antagon ists have been shown to be effect ive for the prevent ion of migraine. This observation and the flat dose-response with rimegepant and other CGRP receptor antagonists suggest that rimegepant 75 mg every other day (EOD ) may be an effect ive dose for the preve ntion of migraine. The pharmacokinet ic profile of rimegepant supports the dosing schedule of this protocol with up to daily dosing. 1.5 Research Hypothesis Rimegepant is safe and effect ive treatment for the prevent ion of migraine."

A qualified migraine headache is defined as a migraine wit h or without aura, last ing for ≥30 minutes, and meet ing at least one of the fo llowing cri teria (A and/or B): A)≥ 2 of the fo llowing pain features: Unilateral location, Pulsating qualit y(throbbing) , Moderate or Severe pain intensity, Aggravat ion by or causing avo idance of routine phy sical activity (e.g. walking or climbing stairs) B)≥ 1 of the fo llowing associ ated symptoms: Nausea and/or Vomit ing, Photophobi a and phonophobia During the double -blind, treatm ent phase, i f the subject takes a migraine -specific medicat ion (i.e. triptan or ergotamine ) during aura or to treat a headache on a calendar day , then i t will be counted as a migraine day regardless of the duration and pain features/ associ ated symptom s. The use of study medicat ion on non- scheduled dosing days is only permi tted during the open -label, extensio n phase .Dosing with study medication on non -scheduled dosing days is not permitted during the double -blind, treatment phase . A moderate to severe migraine day is a migraine day with a migraine reported wi thmoderate or severe pain intensit y. For the full definit ion of Migraine Days, pl ease refer to Section 15.3 Appendix 3. 3.5 Definition of Headache Days A Headache Day is any calendar day in which the subject experiences a qualified headache (initial onset, continuat ion, or recurrence of the headache). A qualified headache is defined as: Aqualified migraine headache (including an aura -only event that i s treated with acute migraine -specific m edicati on), or Aqualified non -migraine headache, which is a headache that lasts ≥ 30 minutes and is not a qualified migraine headache, or Aheadache of any duration for which acute headache treatment is administered."

The Screening phase includes a scree ning visit and a 28-day Observat ion Peri od. For subjects to be eligible for the study , they must have reported having had 4-18 migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensit y per m onth in the 3 m onths pri or to the Screening Visit , and at least 6migraine days and no m ore than 18 headache days during the 28-day Observation Period which will be docum ented in the eDi ary . Upon the complet ion of the screening visit, subjects will be provided anelectroni c diary(eDiary ) to document each day of the 28-day Obser vation Peri od if a migraine occurred, the migraine intensity and if the migraine was treated . Subjects will record the standard of care migraine treatm ent received on a paper diary and female subjects will record their menstrual period inform ation on a paper log . After complet ing the 28-day Observat ion Peri od, the subject will return to the clinic with both diaries for the Baseline Visit. Subjects will have blood drawn for baseline lab profiles at the Pre -Randomization Lab Visit; this visit must occur within 96 hours (4 day s) of the Baseline Visit. Sites are encouraged to complete this visi t within 96 hours (4 day s) of the Baseline Visit, however, if scheduling challenges arise, site staff may use an addit ional +2 day window for this visit to occur wit hin 144 hours (or 4 days, +2 day s). Subjects will then return for the Baseline (Rando mization) Visit. At the Baseline Visit, eligibilit y for continued participat ion in the study will be assessed before rando mizat ion occurs and study medicat ion will be d ispensed . Subjects will be instructed that they must take one tabl et of blinded study drug every other cal endar day . If subjects have a migraine during the double -blind phase of the study , if needed, they may treat the migraine wit h their standard of care medicationand continue to take study medicat ion on thei r regul ar schedule (scheduled dosing days only). At the com pletion of the 12- week double -blind phase, subjects may be entered into the 52-week open -label phase fo llowing laboratory test resul ts wi thin acceptable ranges per protocol (Table 2). During the open -label, extension phase, subj ects will be instructed that they must take one tablet of study medicat ion every other calendar day. If subjects have a migraine on a day that they are not scheduled to dose with study drug, they may take 1tablet of rimegepant on that calendar day totreat a migraine. D uring the open -label, extensio n phase, subjects can take a maximum o f one tabl et of study drug per cal endar day for this 52-week peri od. Subjects are required to record their migraine occurrence and severit y and all study medicat ion doses in the eDiary. Subjects are also required to record the rescue medication taken on a paper diaryand female subjects will record their menstrual periodinformat ion on a paper log ."

In this study , the Rave system will be utilized for obtaining subject identificat ion and as the electroni c data capture ( EDC ) system . Each subject will be assigned a unique sequent ial 4-digit subject number through Rave (0001, 0002, 0003, etc. ). This subjec t number m ust not be reused for any other parti cipant in the study . Subjects will maintain their subject number assigned at screening throughout the trial. At the Baseline Visit, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the rimegepant or pla cebo treatment groups. The randomization will be stratified by the use of prophylactic migraine medications (yes or no). After confi rming subject eligibilit y, registering a subject for Baseline (Rando mizat ion) will trigger a container number for the study medication. The study drug will be dispensed at baseline and as needed at the study visits. 7.2.2 Selection and Timing of Dose and Administration Study medicati on (rimegepant or matching placebo ) will be assigned via the Rave system . There are no dose adjustments in this study and subjects will receive 30 tablets of rimegepant or placebo in a bottle. Subjects will be dispensed study medicat ion at the Baseline Visit ,and the subjects will be instructed that they must take onetablet every other calendar day, regardless of whether they have a migraine on that day or not. This is the scheduled dosing regimen for the doubl e-blind treatment phase and the open -label, extension phase . During the open -label, extensio n phase, subjects wil l receive open -label rimegepant. Subjects will be instructed that they must take one tabl et every other cal endar day , regardl ess of whether they have a migraine on that day or not. During the open -label, extensio n phase only , if a subject hasa migraine on a non -scheduled dosing day , they may take 1tabletof rimegepant as acute treatm ent for their migraine , if needed, with a maximum of one tabl etper calendar day. This regimen of scheduled dosing on every other cal endar day and as needed rimegepant dosing shoul d be f ollowed for up to 52weeks in the open -label, e xtension phase. Subjects can take a maximum o f one tabl et of study medicat ion per calendar day for 52weeks during the open -label, extensio n phase. Dosing should occur around the same time every other day (EOD ) for migraine prevent ion. It i s preferred that subjects dose every other day in the morning, however, it is more important that the subject consistent ly dose at approximately the same time every other day . The time of dosing sho uld be consistent throughout the study for the EOD dosing days. If the subject has a migraine on a day when they already took study medication , the subject can take their rescue medicat ionin accordance with protocol restrictions . Subject smust be instru cted that they"

Subjects must be instructed to continue taking study medicat ion every other calendar day during the open -label, extensio n phase. As noted above, subjects may treat a migraine with study medicat ion on a non -scheduled dosing day , but s ubjects must be instructed that dur ing the open -label, extensio n phase, they CANNOT take m ore than 1 tablet of rimegepant per calendar day. 7.2.3 Dose Modification There will be no dose adjust ments in this study . 7.2.4 Dose Interruptions If a subject experiences an AE that requires interruption in s tudy medicat ion, the investigator shoul d consul t with the Sponsor m edical m onitor to evaluate the need for any addi tional tests prior to re -starting study medicat ion. 7.3 Blinding and Unblinding Blinding is crit ical to the integrit y of this clinical study . However, in the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual subject, in which knowledge of the invest igational product is crit ical to the subject’s management, the blind for that subject may be broken by the treating physician. Before breaki ng the blind of an individual subject’s treatment, the invest igator should have determined that the information is necessary, (i.e., that it will alter the subject’s immediate management). In many cases, particularly when the em ergency is clearly not inves tigational product related, the problem may be properly managed by assuming that the subject is receiving active product without the need for unblinding. In cases of accidental unblinding, contact the Medical Monitor and ensure every attempt to preserve t he blind is made. 7.4 Treatment Compliance Responsible study personnel will dispense the study drug. Subjects shoul d finish a bottle of study medicat ion before starting a new bottle. Accountabilit y and com pliance verificat ion shoul d be docum ented in the subje ct’s study records. Subjects must be counseled on the importance of taking the study drug as directed (see Secti on7.2.2 ). Treatment compliance, review o f study medicat ion doses reported in the eDiary and through review of returned study medicati on, shoul d be assessed by site staff at each study visit. Discrepa ncies between doses reported in the eDiary, review of study medicat ion and inform ation provi ded by subject must be docum ented in the source record. Incorrect or missing dosing data and migraine data that are reported in the eDiary will be corrected through either a"

Invest igators shoul d inform Subjects thatinvoluntary terminat ion from the study will occur in cases where non -compliance is ident ified. Study staff shoul d contact a subject in betwee n the m onthly study visits if th esubject demonstrates non -compliance wi th the eDi aryand docum ent the contact in the source , to identify potenti al lost to f ollow up subjects as early as possible. Invest igators must monitor subjects for possible cases of abuse of study medicat ion (subjects taking study drug for non -therapeuti c purposes, e.g.for psy choact ive effects such as high or euphori a). Invest igators should also assess study drug accountabilit y discrepancies ( e.g.missing study medicat ion, loss of drug, or non -compliance cases in which more study medicat ion was used, as compared to expected). Invest igators should obtain more informat ion and explanation from subjects when there are study drug accountabilit y discrepancies. See Sec tion8.1.1 . Cases of potential study medicat ion abuse or overdose (including cases of non -compliance wit h study medicat ion dosing instructions or subjects who discont inue treatment without returning study medicat ion) should be documented in the source record and reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate. Dosing errors (e.g. accidentally taking 2 tablets in one calendar day) should be reported as deviat ions. 7.5 Destruction and Return of Study Drug If the study drug (those supplied by the sponsor or sourced by the investi gator) are to be destroy ed on si te, it is the invest igator’s responsibilit y to ensure that arrangements have been made for the disposal, pr ocedures for proper disposal have been established according to the applicable regulat ions, guidelines and inst itutional procedures, and appropriate records of the disposal have been docum ented. The unused study drugs can only be destroy ed after being inspected and reconciled by the responsible Biohaven ( BHV )Study monitor or the sponsor’s designee unless this is against inst itutional policy . All unused and/or partially used study drug m ay be destroy ed on si te provi ding the si te has an applicable standard operating procedure on file."

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnorm al laboratory finding for example) symptom, o r disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of the invest igational product, whether or not considered relate to the invest igational product. Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elici ted during an open -ended quest ioning, examinat ion, or evalua tion of a subject . In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects shoul d not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs. There are two ty pes of adverse events, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Non -Serious Adverse Events (AEs). 8.1 SERIO US ADVERSE EVENT 8.1.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) AnSAE is any event that m eets any of the fo llowing cri teria at any dose: Death Life-threatening Inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizat ion Persi stent or si gnificant disa bility/incapacit y Congenital ano maly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received rimegepant Other: Im portant m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi talizati on, m ay be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardi ze the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion. Examples of such events are (but not limited to): oIntensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm oBlood dy scrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpatient hospitalizat ion oDevelopment of drug dependency or drug abuse oPotenti al drug induced liver injury (see Section8.1.5 )"
66,page_66,"Protocol BHV3000 -305 Confidential Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Study for Migraine Prevention Version 9Page 67of 91 oAbuse or Overdose of medicat ion Potenti al study medicat ion abuse (including cases of excessive non-compliance wit h study medicat ion dosing instructions or subjects who discont inue treatm ent wi thout returning study medicat ion) should be documented in the source record and reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate . Invest igators must monitor subjects for possible cases o f abuse of study medicat ion (subjects taking study drug for non -therapeuti c purposes, e.g. for psy choactive effects such as high or euphoria). Invest igators should obtain more informat ion and explanat ion from subjects when there are study drug accountabilit y discrepancies Potenti al study medicat ion overdose i s defined in Section 8.1.3 Definition of Terms Mild: Is usually transient and may requi re only minimal treatm ent or therapeutic intervent ion.The event does not generally interfere with usual act ivities of daily living. Moderate: Is usually alleviated with addit ional specific therapeuti c interventi on. The event interferes wi th usual act ivities of daily living, causing disco mfort but poses no significant or perm anent ri sk of harm to the subject. Severe: Interrupts usual activit ies of daily living, significant ly affects clinical status, or may requi reintensive therapeut ic intervent ion. Life threatening: An AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death fro m the event as i t occurred; i.e., it does not include a reactio n that if it had occurred in a more serious form might have caused death. For example, drug induced hepat itis that resolved wit hout evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug induced hepat itis can be fatal. Hospitalization: AEs requiring hospitalizat ion should be considered SAEs. Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical pr ocedures that are not the result of AE (e.g., elective surgery for a pre -exist ing condit ion that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'non -serious' according to the usual criteria. In general, hospitalizat ion signifies that the subject has been detained (usually invo lving at l east an overnight stay ) at the hospi tal or em ergency ward f or observat ion and/or treatment that woul d not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether 'hospitalizat ion' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered SAEs in Biohaven clinical studies (but may be considered non -serious AEs):"

Disabili ty/incapaci tating: An AE is incapacitat ing or disabling if the experience resul ts in a substant ial and/or permanent disrupt ion of th e subject's abilit y to carry out norm al life f unctions. 8.1.2 Collection and Reporting Serious Adverse Events Following the subject ’s wri tten consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or not rel ated to study drug, m ust be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specific procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the observ ation phase and up to and including the 8-Week Follow-up. The invest igator should report any SAE occurring after thistime period that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specific procedures. All SAEs should be fo llowed to resol ution or s tabilizat ion. An SAE report sho uld be co mpleted for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of seriousness. If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to the study drug, but is potentially related to the condit ions of the study (such as a wi thdrawal of previ ous therapy or a com plicati on related to study procedure), the relat ionship should be specified in the narrat ive sect ion of the SAE Report F orm. SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, overdose (see S ection8.1.3 ), poten tial drug induced liver injury (see S ection8.1.5 )and pregnancies (see Section8.1.4 ) mustbe reported within 24 hours of the Invest igator beco ming aware of the event. For this study we will be capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC) and on the SAE form. The Investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs and all Other Important Medical Events to"
68,page_68,"Protocol BHV3000 -305 Confidential Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Study for Migraine Prevention Version 9Page 69of 91 the Invest igator, or designated staff, is responsible for entering the SAE informat ion in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) sy stem (i.e.: event term , start stop dates, causalit y, severi ty). Any serious adverse event must be reported immediately or no later than 24 h ours after awareness o f the event to If a form is unable to be submitted within 24 hours, the SAE may be reported by telephone via the Safet y Hotline Number: If only limited informati on is init ially available, follow -up reports are required. If an ongo ing SAE changes in its intensit y or rel ationship to study drug or if new informat ion beco mes available, a fo llow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours of the Invest igator becoming aware of the updated information using the same procedure used for the transmissio n of the initial SAE and the same event term should be used. The minimum informat ion required for an init ial SAE report is: Sender of report (Site number, Invest igator name) Subject identificat ion (subject number) Protocol number SAE term (if an SAE is being reported) 8.1.3 Overdose An overdose is defined as the accidental or intent ional administration o f any dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important . Alloccurrences of overdose (suspected or confirmed) must be communicated to Biohaven or a specified designee within 24 hours and be fully documented as an SAE. Details o f any signs or symptoms and their management should be recorded including details o f any treatm ents administered. Asymptomat ic dosing errors (e.g. accidentally taking 2 tabl ets in one cal endar day ) shoul d be reported as deviat ions."
69,page_69,"Protocol BHV3000 -305 Confidential Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Study for Migraine Prevention Version 9Page 70of 91 8.1.4 Pregnancy If,following the baseline visit , it is subsequently discovered that a study subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of the invest igational produce exposure, including during at least 6 half -lives after the product administration, the invest igational product will be permanent ly discontinued in an appropriate manner (i.e. , dose tapering if necessary for subject safety). Protocol -requi red procedures for the study discontinued and the follow -up m ust be perform ed on the subject unless contraindicated by the pregnancy (i.e., x -ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy fo llow-up procedures should be considered if indicated. The invest igator must immediately notify the Bio haven (or designee) Medical Monitor of the event and co mplete thePregnancy Form within 24 hours and in accordance wit h SAE reporting procedures as describe d in Secti on 8.1.2 . The pregnancy shoul d be reported using paper forms, which should be faxed to Follow-up inform ation regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcom e and, where applicable offspring informat ion must be reported on a Pregnancy Report Form . Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study parti cipant shoul d be reported to the sponsor. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Report Form, as appropri ate. 8.1.5 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Wherever possible, timely confirmat ion of the init ial liver-related l aboratory abnorm alities shoul d occur pri or to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meet ing the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs as per Section 8.1.2 . Potenti al drug induced liver injury is defined as: 1.ALT or AST elevat ion > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) AND 2.Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without init ial findings o f cholestasis (el evated serum alkaline phosphatase)"

If any potential DILI is ident ified and meets the criteria above, the Biohaven Medical Monitor (or designe e) shoul d immediately be contacted for further instruction and whether the subject must di scont inue from the trial and appropri ate fo llow up requirements. 8.2 Non-serious Adverse Events A non-serious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious. 8.2.1 Collecti on and Reporting of Non -Serious Adverse Events The collection of non- serious AE inform ation should begin at the init iation of study drug through the 2-Week Fo llow up Safet y Visit. No n-serious AE inform ation shoul d also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in phase or other observation period intended to establish a baseline status for a subject . Non-serious adverse events should be fo llowed until conclusi on or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they become serious. Follow -up is also requi red for non -serious AEs that cause interrupti on or di scont inuat ion of study drug or those that are present at the end of study treatm ent. 8.2.2 Laboratory Test Abnormalities The fo llowing l aboratory test abnorm alities shoul d be captured on the non -serious AE CRF page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate: 1.Any laboratory test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the definit ion of an SAE; 2.Any laboratory abnorm ality that requi red the subject to have the study drug discont inued or interrupted; 3.Any laboratory abnorm ality that requi red the subject to receive specific corrective therapy ."

Contin uous vari ables are summarized wit h univariate statist ics (e.g., n, mean, standard error, median, minimum and maximum). For the ca lculation of descript ive statist ics of observed data, subjects must have a baseline value to be evaluable for endpoints based on values and changes fro m baseline over time. Tabulat ions of the fo llowing endpo ints present the number of unique subjects with a n event: protocol deviat ions; interruptions o f study therapy; non -study medicat ions; adverse events; and laboratory abnorm alities. Thus, for these endpo ints, multiple occurrences of the same event are counted only once per subject. 9.2 Populations for Analysis The set of enrolled subjects consists of all subjects who signed the informed consent form and were assigned a subject ident ificat ion number. The set of rando mized subjects consists of enrolled subjects who were assigned a rando mized treatm ent group and prophylact ic migraine medication use stratum. The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of doubl e-blind study medicat ion(rimegepant or placebo) . The efficacy analysis set is a subset of the FAS that includes subjects with at least 14 day s of eDiary data in both the Observat ion Peri od and at least one 4-week interval during the doubl e- blind treatment phase. The safety analysis set consists of all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose o f study medicat ion(doubl e-blind or open -label). For the double -blind phase, s ubjects in safet y analyses will be analyzed based on their rando mized treatment so long as they receive at least one dose of their randomized treatment. Otherwise, subjects wil l be analyzed based on the actual treatment received. The rimegepant safet y analysis set includes enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of rimegepant (double -blind or open -label)."
72,page_72,"Protocol BHV3000 -305 Confidential Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Study for Migraine Prevention Version 9Page 73of 91 9.3 Sample Size With a sample size of roughly 800subjects randomized ,and 400 subjects per group, we expect roughly 370 subjects per group in the efficacy data set. Assuming rimegepant provides roughly a 1day advantage over pl acebo on the primary endpoint, and a commo n standard deviation o f 3.75 days, then the study will have roughly 95% power on the primary endpo int. The estimates for the change in migraine days per month and the standard deviation are consistent with publicly available informat ion from another invest igational oral CGRP antagonist for this indicat ion. 9.4 Primary Endpoint Thechange from baseline efficacy endpo int isanalyzed using a generalized linear mixed effect model,that includes subject as a random effect , and has the baseline number of migraine days (i.e., during the Observat ion Peri od) asa covaria te. The model includes fixed effects for : treatm ent group ; stratificat ion factor (use of prophylact ic migraine medicat ion); scheduled visit ; and the visit by -treatm ent group interacti on.Scheduled visits included in the model are nominally at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Evaluat ion of migraine days per month is based on the data from the previous visit to the current visit (i.e., 4 -week interval) , and i s prorated to account for missing migraine reports. A migraine days per month endpoint, prorated to 28 day s, will be computed for subjects in the efficacy analysis set who provide at least 14 days of eDiary data during any reporting period (i.e., Observat ion Peri od or a 4-week interval during the double -blind treatment phase) . The difference est imate (rimegepant -placebo), standard error, 95% confidence interval, and p -value will be reported for the last 4 weeks (Weeks 9 to 12) of the double -blind treatment phase . 9.5 Secondary Endpoint(s) The number of subjects that experience at least a 50% reduction in the mean number of moderate or severe migraine days per month inthe last 4 weeks of the double -blind treatment phase will be analyzed using a stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test after the missing data are imputed as non -response. The c hange from baseline in the mean number of migraine days per month over the ent ire doubl e-blind treatment phase (Weeks 1 to 12) will be assessed with the same statist ical model used to analyze the primary endpoint. The use of rescue medicat ions (mean number of days per m onth) in the last 4 weeks of the doubl e-blind treatment phase will be assessed using a generalized linear mixed effects model that is similar in structure to that used for the primary analysis. Rescue medicat ions are defined in Secti on 5.5. Thechange from baseline in the mean number of migraine days per m onth inthe first 4 weeks (Weeks 1 to 4) of the doubl e-blind treatment phase will be assessed with the sam estatistical model used f or to analyze the primary endpo int."

The frequency of unique subjects that have ALT or AST that exceed 3x the ULN concurrent ly (on the same laboratory test occasi on) with total bilirubin that exceeds 2x the ULN will be tabul ated and presented with descript ive statist ics and exact confiden ce intervals. Safety endpo ints will be assessed separately for the foll owing phases and popul ations: Doubl e-blind treatment for the safet y analysis set; Rimegepant treatment (double -blind or open -label) for the rimegepant safet y analysis set. The change sfrom baseline in MSQ rol e function -restri ctive domain score and MIDAS total score at Week 12 will be analyzed using generalized linear model sthatinclude the baseline score as a covariate, and fixed effects for treatment group and stratificat ion factor (use of prophylact ic migraine medication) .The Week 12 difference est imate (rimegepant -placebo), standard error, 95% confidence interval, and p -value will be reported for each endpoint . 9.6 Multiplicity Correction Type 1 error iscontrolled through the use of hierarchical testing. The significance o f the primary endpo int isevaluated at the 0.05 level. If the primary endpoint i s significant, then thefollowing secondary endpoints will be tested hi erarchically in the foll owing order, each at the 0.05 level: proporti on of subjects wi th a 50% reduction in the mean number of moderate or severe migraine days per month in the last 4 weeks of the double -blind treatm ent phase ; change from baseline in the mean number of migraine days per month over the entire course of the double -blind treatment phase;"

Data reported on the CRF that ar e derived fro m source documents must be consistent with the source docum ents or the di screpancies must be explained. Electronic CRFs will be prepared for all data collections fields when electroni c data capture (EDC )is being used. The confident iality of records that coul d identify subjects must be protected, respecting the privacy and confident iality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requi rement(s). The Investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records of changes and corrections. If EDC is being used, signatures will be obtained electronically and a copy of the el ectroni c CRFs will be provided (or the data from the CRFs) for future reference. 10.5 Records Management and Retention In accordance with the pri nciples o f GCP and GLP, the study may be inspected by regulatory authori ties, the Sponsor and CRO. The Sponsor is ent itled to access informat ion about the status of the study and to review the original documents of the study . The Investigator must retain a ll study records and source documents for the maximum required by the applicable regulat ions and guidelines, or institution procedures or for the period of time specified by the sponsor, whichever is longer. The I nvest igator must contact the Sponsor prior to destroying any records associ ated wi th this study . Biohaven will notify the Invest igators when the study files for this study are no longer needed. If the Investigator withdraws fro m the study (i.e., reti rement, rel ocati on), the records shall be transferred to a m utually agreed upon desi gnee. Noti ce of such transfer will be given in writ ing to Bi ohaven. It is the responsibilit y of the Invest igator to ensure that the current disposit ion record of investigat ional product (those supplied by the sponsor ) is maintained at each study site where the study drug i s inventori ed and dispensed.

A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is notified within 5 days. Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The written amendment m ust be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await approval before implement ing the changes. Biohaven will submit protocol amendments to the appropriate regul atory authori ties for approval. If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator, and/or Biohaven, the amendment to the protocol substant ially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject and/or has an impact on the subject's invo lvement as a study parti cipant, the currently approved written inform ed consent form will requi re similar m odificati on.
