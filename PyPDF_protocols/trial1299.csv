The current 2 -year study will, together with the preceding 1 -year originating studies I1F-MC-RHBV (RHBV) , I1F-MC -RHBW (RHBW), and I1F -MC -RHBX (RHBX) , provide efficacy and safety data of ixekiz umab af ter long-term treatment for patients with axSpA, including both radiographic axSpA (rad-axSpA) andnonradiographic axSpA (nonrad-axSpA) patients, and biological disease modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) -naive as we ll as tumo r necrosis factor (TNF) -experienced patients. Therefore, d ata generated from the current study will provide further information on the long -term efficacy and safety profile of ixekizumab. Objective(s)/Endpoints: Objectives Endpoints Primary To evaluate in patients having achiev ed a state of sustained remission whether the combined ixekizumab treatment group is superior to the placebo group in maintaining response during Period 2The proportion of patients in the randomized withdrawal population who do not experience a flare during Period2 Objectives Endpoints Major Secondary To compare the combined ixekizumab treatment group to historical control for 2 -year radiographic progression in spine in patients with active radiographic axSpA (rad axSpA)Change in modified Stoke Ank ylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS ) score To evaluate in patients having achieved a state of sustained remission whether the ixekizumab 80 mg every 2 weeks ( Q2W )treatment group or ixekizumab 80 mg every 4 weeks ( Q4W ) treatment group is superior to placebo in maintaining response after randomized withdrawalThe proportion of patients in the randomized withdrawal population who do not experience a flare during Period2 To evaluate in patients having achieved a state of sustained remission whether the combined ixekizumab treatment group is superior to the placebo group in maintaining response after randomized withdrawalTime to flare for patients in the randomized withdrawal population during Period2"

Study RHBY includes 4 study periods: Lead -In [Period 1]: 24 weeks ( Week 0 to Week 24 ) Extension Period including Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Randomized Withdrawa l–Retreatment [Period 2]: 40 weeks ( Week 24 to Week 64) Long -Term Extension Period [Period 3]: 40 weeks ( Week 64 to Week 104) Post-Treatment Follow -Up [Period 4]: at least 12 weeks and up to 24 weeks after the date of the patient’s early termination visit (ETV )or last regularly scheduled visit"
14,page_14,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 14 LY2439821Treatment Arms and Duration: The study duration will be up to 2 years for ixekizumab administration (80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W) , and up to 2 years and 6 months for stud y participation over 4 periods: During the Lead -In Period (Period 1; 24 weeks ), patients will receive active treatment in the form of ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W (open label or blinded depending on the previous originating study) . During the Extension Period, including blinded, randomiz ed withdrawal –retreatment (Period 2; 40 weeks ): (Group A): Patients who do notmeet entry criteria for participation in the randomized withdrawal – retreatment period will continue to receive uninterrupted ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W. (Group B): For patients having achieved a state of sustained remission who do meet the criteria for participation in the 40 -week double -blind placebo -controlled randomized withdrawal –retreatment period oPatients in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W treatment group will be re -randomized to either ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or placebo. Patients who experience a flare will receive ixekizumab 80mgQ2W. oPatients in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W treatment group will be re -randomized to either ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W or placebo. Pati ents who experience a flare will receive ixekizumab 80mg Q4W. During the Long -Term Extension Period (Period 3; 40 weeks ), o(Group A): Patients in Group A will continue their assigned treatment regimen uninterrupted . Patients in Group A receiving ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W may have their dose escalated to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W if the investigator determines that the patient may benefit from an increase in frequency of dosing to achieve adequate diseas e control. o(Group B): Patients in Group B will continu e the same treatment that they were r eceiving at the end of Period 2 . However, if a patient experiences a flare and meets criteria f or retreatment , the patient will be retreated with the ixekizumab treat ment regimen (ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W) that he or she was receiving prior to withdrawal to evaluate whether the patient can regain his or her original response. During the Long -Term Extension Period, patients in Group B receiving ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W may also have their dose escalated to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W if the investigator determines that the patient may benefit from an increase in frequency of dosing to ac hieve adequate disease control . Escalatio n to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W may occur only after the patient has been retreated upon flare with the ixekizumab treatment regimen received during Period1 (ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W )for at least 12 weeks. All patients receiving at least 1 dose of investigational product will enter the Post -Treatment Follow -Up (Period 4) for a minimum of 12 weeks and up to 24 weeks after their last regularly scheduled visit (or the date of their ETV). Number of Patients : It is estimated that approximately 750patients will enter the long -term extension study ( RHBY ) after completion of studies RHBV, RHBW, or RHBX and that30% of these patients ( i.e., approximately 200 patients) will meet the criteria to enter the double -blind randomized withdrawal –retreatment period. Approximately 100 patients who achieved a state of sustained remission on ixekizumab Q 2Wwill be randomized to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2 W or"

Study RHBY will include patients who have completed one of the originating studies (RHBV, RHBW, and RHBX), and will include rad-axSpA andnonrad -axSpA patients, as well as bDMARD -naive and TNF -experienced patients. Statistical Analysis: Approximately 100 patients who achieved a state of sustained remission on ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W or placebo, and approximately 100 patients who achieved a state of sustained remission on ixekizumab 80 mg Q 2W will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or p lacebo in the double - blind randomized withdrawal –retreatment period . This total sample size of 200 will provide over 99% power to detect a difference in the proportion of patients who do not experience a flare between the combined ixekizumab treatment group(including Q2W and Q4W) and placebo using a 2 - sided Fisher’s exact test at the 0.05 level, assuming the flare rates are 10% for ixekizumab and 70% for placebo. During Period 2, the primary analysis (the proportion of patients in th e combined ixekizu mab treatment group who do not experience a flare during Period 2 compared with placebo) will be based on the Randomized Withdrawal ITT Population. The primary analysis method for treatment comparisons of categorical efficacy and health outcomes variables at specific time points will be made using a logistic regression analysis with treatment, geographic regions, and o riginating study in the model. The odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported; treatment difference and 95% CIs will al so be reported. Secondary analysis will be conducted using a Fisher’s exact test. For the primary analysis, missing data will be imputed using the nonresponder imputation (NRI )method. Patients will be considered a nonresponder (having a flare) for the N RI analysis if they do not meet the clinical response criteria at any specified analysis time point. All nonresponders at any specified time point as well as all patients who discontinue study treatment before the specified analysis time point, for any re ason, will be defined as a nonresponder for the NRI analysis. Patients without at least 1 observation on study treatment will also be defined as a nonresponder for the NRI analysis. The NRI may be applied at any time point specified for analysis. The pri mary outcome of proportion of patients who do not experience a flare will be tested for ixekizumab versus placebo at a 2-sided α=0.05. The comparison of major secondary objectives will be tested using an appropriate multiple testing approach providing str ong control of the familywise error rate (for the primary and major secondary tests) at a 2 -sided α=0.05. The Kaplan -Meier product limit method will be used to estimate the survival curves for time -to-flare for the patients who are randomized to the randomized withdrawal –retreatment period. Treatment comparisons will be performed using the stratified log -rank test with treatment, geographic region, and originating study in the model. The analy sis for all continuous efficacy and health outcome variables will be made using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment, baseline value, geographic region, and originating study in the model. Missing data will be imputed using modified baseline observation carried forward (mBOCF). Type III sums of squares for the least-squares (LS) means will be used for the statistical comparison; the 95% CI will also be reported. Fisher ’s exact test will be used for all adverse events ( AEs), baseline, discontinuation, and other categorical safety data. Continuous vital signs and laboratory values will be analyzed by an ANCOVA with treatment and baseline value sin the model."

In these cases, any assessments/procedures (including laboratory tests) conducted during the patient’s final visit in the originating study should not be repeated for Visit 1 (Week 0) of Study RHBY. In cases where entry into Study RHBY is delayed beyond Week 52 of the originating study, assessments/proce dures (including laborato ry tests) indicated for Visit 1 (Week 0) of Study RHBY that are not conducted during the last visit (Visit 801 or Visit 802) of the originating study will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Activities . bFor most patients, the final visit of the originating study (RHBV, RHBW, or RHBX) will coincide with Visit 1 (Week 0) of Stud y RHBY. However, in particular circumstances, the duration between the final visit of the originating study and Visit 1 (Week 0) of Study RHBY may be extended after consultation with the sponsor. Therefore, there is no specified visit window for V isit 1 (Week 0) of Study RHBY. cPatients will be assigned to Group A or Group B at Visit 5/Visit 505 (Week 24). dA complete physical e xamination (excluding pelvic, rectal examination) will be performed at baseline. All physical examinations throughout the st udy are to include a symptom -directed physical as well as examination of heart, lungs, abdomen, eyes ,and visual examination of the skin. ePatients are to be resting for a minimum of 5 minutes prior to vital sign collection. Blood pressure and pulse will be measu red in sitting position and will be recorded before IP dosing at all visits. fWeight is only captured on eCRF at Visit 1 (Week 0), Visit 10/Visit 515 (Week 64), Visit 14/Visit 519 (Week 104), or ETV. Body weight collected at other visits is used only for calculation of creatinine clearance. gHabits include recording of caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco consumption. hIf patients are not eligible to enter Study RHBY at Week 52 in the originating study (e.g., due to unresolved safety concerns ), then entry into Study RHBY may be delayed beyond Week 52 of the originating study.

Study Rationale The clinical development plan to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of ixekizumab in pat ients with axial spondyloarthrit is (axSpA) includes three Phase 3 studies (I1F -MC-RHBV [RHBV], I1F-MC-RHBW [RHBW], and I1F-MC-RHBX [RHBX]; hereafter referred to as the originat ing studi es). The current study (I1F -MC-RHBY [RHBY]) is an extensio n study and offers patients who have co mpleted any of these ori ginat ing studies an opportunit y to continue ixekizumab (LY2439821) t reatment for up to 2 addit ional years . Ixekizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) high-affinit y monoclonal antibody (MAb) that selectively targets the cytokine interl eukin- 17A (IL -17A, also known as IL-17). Ixekizumab treatment is administered by subcutaneous (SC) inject ions. The demonstrati on of increased IL- 17 producing T h17 lymphocy te number s and serum IL- 17 levels in radiographic axSpA (rad-axSpA )is consistent wit h a di rect rol e of Th17 lymphocy tes in this disease (Wendling et al. 2007; Jandus et al. 2008; Mei et al. 2011) . IL-17 secreting cells have also been detected in situ in the bone marrow of facet jo ints obtained from pat ients with rad-axSpA (Appel et al. 2008) . Com pelling scient ific informat ion exists to date suggesti ng an important rol e of the IL -23/IL -17 pathway in the pathogenesis of axSpA (Baeten et al. 2010; Maksymowych 2010; Baraliakos et al. 2011; Reveille 2011; Baeten et al. 2013, 2014; Yerem enko et al . 2014 ). Selectively targeting IL -17A wi th ixekizumab is hypoth esized to provide therapeut ic benefit without unduly impact ing host defenses. As such, ixekizumab may o ffer a therapeutic option for patients with axSpA who have failed nonsteroidal ant i-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and for patients with axSpA who have lost response, failed to respond, or are intolerant to current marketed drugs. Ixekizumab may offer a m ore favorabl e safet y profile co mpared to currently marketed therapies. Axial spondyloarthrit isrequi res long-term and often life -long treatment and data from withdrawal studi es wi th tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor s (TNF inhibitors )have shown that in most pati ents wi th axSpA, treatm ent needs to be maintained long -term in order to maintain response (Baraliakos et al. 2005 ,2007; Brandt et al. 2003, 2005). In patients with early disease, the likelihood of maintaining response after treatment withdrawal may be so mewhat higher (Haibel et al. 2008 ;Barkham et al. 2009; Haibel et al. 2010; and Siep er et al . 2014). Inhibit ion of IL -17A represents a newer therapeutic class for the treatment of axSpA. Accordingly , there is clinical ut ility in understanding whether an alternative mechanism -of-action other than inhibit ion of TNF may offer durabilit y in maintaining an achieved response fo llowing the wi thdrawal of treatm ent. During thedoubl e-blind , placebo -controlled, randomized withdrawal –retreatment period, the current study (RHBY) will evaluate what happens with patients who achieved sustained remissio n on ixekizumab treatment when they are di scont inued fro m treatm ent, as well as how l ong i t takes for these patients to relapse. In addit ion, the study will evaluate the effect of ixekizumab on structure progression in the spine approximately 2 years post- baseline of the ori ginat ing Phase 3 study ."
25,page_25,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 25 LY24398213.2. Background Axial spondyloarthrit is, a chronic inflammatory disease predo minant ly affect ing the axial skeleton (sacroiliac jo ints [SIJ] and spine) (Poddubnyy 2013), i s now recognized as a single disease ent ity, with a subset defined by the presence of radi ographi cally (rad -axSpA) defined structural damage of the SIJ and a subset without clear structural damage defined radiographically (nonradiographic axSpA [nonrad -axSpA] ). When co mpar ing axSpA with rheumatoi d arthri tis (RA), i t can be noted that while RA can be divided into erosive and nonerosive or seropositive and seronegat ive subsets, it is well accepted that it is still one disease. AxSpA, in a similar fashio n, also has subsets, and can nonetheless be cons idered a single disease (Deodhar et al. 2014). Radiographic axSpA, al so called ankylosing spondylit is (AS), represents a disease in which there is evidence o f disease features on radiographic imaging. It is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by chroni c inflammat ion of the axial skeleton and variable invo lvement of the peripheral joints (Braun and Sieper 2007). As the disease progresses, it can lead to new bone formation in the form of syndesmophytes and j oint ankylosis, primarily in the axial skeleton . Patients wi thrad-axSpA may also have extra -articular manifestations of the disease such as enthesit is, anterior uveit is, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) , as well as comorbidi ties of aortitis or cardi ac conduct ion abnorm alities. Compared wi th the general popul ation, pati ents wi th rad-axSpA have increased rates of work disabilit y, unempl oyment, and mortalit y (Boonen and van der Linden 2006). According to several nat ional and internat ional referral programs (Rudwaleit and Sieper 2012 ; Poddubnyy et al . 2012) , the proportion of nonrad- axSpA patients among all axSpA patients ranges from 40% to 60%. Until recent ly, axSpA pat ients without radi ographically defined sacroiliit is but with evidence of sacroiliit is from magnetic resonance imagin g (MRI) imaging, or other characterist ics of disease, have been less well diagnosed despite sharing a similar burden of disease and the same co mmo n features as patients with rad -axSpA, such as spinal inflammat ion, chronic back pain, positivit y for human l eukocy te ant igen -B27, and extraarticular manifestations. Delays in the diagnosis of axSpA can postpone administration of suitable treatment by several years (Haibel et al. 2008 ; Landewé et al. 2012 ;Rudwaleit et al. 2009c ;van der Heijde et al. 2006). Th e Assessment of Spondyloarthrit is Internat ional Societ y (ASAS) criteria for axSpA (Rudwaleit et al. 2009a, 2009b) have been developed, in addit ion to a diagnostic algorithm (van den Berg et al. 2013), to facilitate earlier recognit ion of axSpA and to ident ify axSpA pat ients with and wi thout radiographic sacroiliit is (Rudwaleit et al. 2004, 2005) using x -rays and MRI. Adoption of the ASAS cri teria has the potential to lead to earlier ident ificat ion of patients with axSpA (Rudwaleit et al. 2004), early in th e disease course, and to result in more t imely therapeut ic intervent ion. Axial spondyloarthrit isaffects up to 1.4% of the adult populat ion worl dwide (Braun and Sieper 2007; Reveille et al. 2012; Strand et al. 2013). Current standard of care for rad-axSpA includes regul ar exercise, physical therapy , NSAIDs, and TNF inhibitors (Braun et al. 2011; Ward et al. 2015). In addit ion, recent ly co mpleted registration studies o f secukinumab (an IL -17A"
26,page_26,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 26 LY2439821antagonist like ixekizumab) have also demonstrated efficacy in pat ients with rad-axSpA (Baeten et al. 2015; Braun et al. 2015). For patients with nonrad -axSpA, the current standard of care includes regular exercise, physical therapy, and NSAIDs. TNF inhibitors hav e also demonstrated efficacy in nonrad -axSpA; however, although they are approved in som e geographi es, they are not y et approved gl obally for this indicat ion (Braun et al. 2011; Robinson et al. 2014; Ward et al. 2015), and approximately 40% of patients onl y obtain a partial response on TNF inhibitors (Sieper at al. 2012, 2013; Landewé et al. 2012; Dougados et al. 2014). Corti costeroi d injecti ons m ay also be of som e benefi t. Though NSAIDs are the first line of drug treatm ent for axSpA, they are not effect ive or well tol erated in all pat ients (Braun and Sieper 2009). In contrast to patients with RA, patients with axSpA do not respond well to convent ional disease -modifying ant irheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX) or sy stemic corticosteroi ds(Braun and Sieper 2009; Haibel and Specker 2009). TNF inhibitors have demo nstrated efficacy across the axSpA spectrum and may be prescribed when NSAID treatment has failed or cannot be tolerated (Braun et al. 2014) and where regul atory approval has been o btained for this populat ion. To date, few treatment options are globally available for nonrad -axSpA (van der Heijde et al. 2006; Heiberg et al. 2008; Inman et al. 2008; Glint borg et al . 2010). While TNF inhibitors have proven to be effective treatments f or axSpA, an unmet need remains, as not all patients respond well to or tolerate TNF inhibitor treatm ents (van der Heijde et al. 2006; Heiberg et al. 2008; Inman et al. 2008; Glintborg et al. 2010). While TNF inhibitors have demonstrated significant impac t on si gns and symptoms, funct ion, and qualit y of life, they have not been able to demonstrate significant effect on structural progressi on in prospective clinical studies. The use of these bio logic therapi es in various diseases also is associated with sa fety concerns, such as opportuni stic infect ions, demyelinat ing disorders, blood dyscrasias, reactivation of tuberculosis (TB), and exacerbat ion of congest ive heart failure (Moreland 2005; Smit h et al . 2009). There remains, therefore, a significant unmet n eed for safer, more effect ive treatments for patients with axS pA (Dougados and Baeten 2011). 3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment The 2 ixekizumab treatment regimens in Study RHBY (ixekizumab 80 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W ] and ixekizumab 80 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W ]) have al sobeen tested in pivotal Phase 3 studies in patients wi th psoriasis (Ps) and psoriat ic arthrit is (PsA), and demo nstrated efficacy wit h favorable benefit -risk profile in pat ients with Ps (Griffit hs et al. 2015) and in patients with PsA (Gottlieb et al. 2015; Mease et al . 2015). Other therapies (most TNF inhibitors and secukinumab) have demo nstrated efficacy with comm on dose regimens across various rheumatol ogical condi tions (RA, PsA, axSpA) (Humira ®package insert , 2016 [WWW]; Enbrel ® package insert ,2015 [W WW] ; Simponi ®package insert , 2016 [WWW]; Cimzia ®package insert 2016, [WWW]; Cosent yx®package insert 201 6,[WWW]; Sanford and McKeage 2015). The collect ive data fro m ixekizumab and secukinumab on efficacy o f IL-17A inhibit ion across various indicat ions support a reasonable expectation of efficacy for ixekizumab in pat ients with rad-axSpA, both short and long-term. As up to 40% of the patients do not get appropriate benefit"
27,page_27,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 27 LY2439821from TNF inhibitors and TNF inhibitors have failed to demonstrate significant eff ect on structural progressi on, there i s a need for addit ional alternat ive therapies. Eli Lilly and com pany (Lilly )has considerable experience wit h ixekizumab across indicat ions, and more than 4950 patients (4209 Ps patients, 532 RA patients, and 209 PsA p atients) have been treated with at least 1 dose of ixekizumab. Across 3 disease states (RA, PsA, and Ps), no notabl e safet y concerns have been observed with the current ly proposed dose regimens that woul d precl ude the study of ixekizumab for the treatment of patients wi th axSpA. Events ident ified as important potential risks for ixekizumab include serious infect ions, seri ous hypersensit ivity, and IBD. More information about the known and expected benefit s, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) and reasona bly ant icipated adverse events (AEs) of ixekizumab are to be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB). The protocol for Study RHBY includes appropriate inclusion/exclusio n criteria to minimize enrolling pat ients with greater safet y risks, as well as criteria to discont inue those patients who develop potentially increased safet y risks during the study . Re gular review of blinded safet y data and risk mit igation act ions by Lilly or i ts designee are intended to assist in ident ificat ion and reduction of potential risks associated with ixekizumab administration. In addit ion,patients parti cipat ing in Study RHBY will already have successfully co mpleted one of the originating 1 -year axSpA studies. The current benefit/risk profile of ixekizumab therefore supports further research of ixekizumab in axSpA."

End of Study Definition End of the trial is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2) for the last patient in the trial. 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design In the context of long -term treatm ent, i t is important to understand the long- term efficacy and safet y of ixekizumab treatment in patients with axSpA. The current 2 -year study will, together with the preceding 1 -year studi es RHBV, RHBW, and RHBX, provi de descri ptive data about efficacy and safety of ixekizumab after long -term treatm ent, up to 3 y ears (including the 1 -year durati on of the ori ginat ing stud y), for pati ents wi th axSpA, including both rad- axSpA and nonrad -axSpA pati ents, and bio logical disease modifying ant irheumat ic drug (bDMARD) -naive as well as TNF inhibitor -experienced pat ients. Therefore, d ata generated from the current study will help t o provide further informat ion on the long-term efficacy and safet y profile of ixekizumab. As axSpA is a chronic condit ion that m ay requi re long -term treatm ent, there i s increasing interest in evaluat ing the need for long- term uninterrupted treatm ent com pared to temporary treatm ent withdrawal after achieving clinical response, fo llowed by retreatm ent if there is loss o f clinical response ( i.e., flare). Data from withdrawal studies with TNF inhibitors have shown that in most patients wi th axSpA, treatm ent ne eds to be m aintained l ong-term in order to maintain response (Baraliakos et al. 2005 ,2007; Brandt et al. 2003 ,2005). In patients with early axSpA, the likelihood of success of this approach may be so mewhat higher (Haibel et al. 2008 ;Barkham et al. 2009; Haibel et al. 2010; Sieper et al . 2014). The potenti al of ixekizumab (with a mechanism of action [MOA] different from TNF inhibitors) to maintain response after treatment withdrawal will be evaluated in the current study during a double blind placebo -controlled rando mized withdrawal period (Peri od 2). To increase the likelihood of successful wit hdrawal wit hout immediate relapse, only patients having achieved a state of sustained remissio n will participate in the rando mized withdrawal – retreatmentperiod .It is ant icipated that approximately 30% of the 750 patients will meet the entry criteria for randomized withdrawal (Sieper et al . 2015). These pat ients will be re-randomized in blinded fashio n to ei ther continue thei r current regimen or receive placebo. Patients randomized to placebo may still receive treatm ent in the form of the all owed concomitant medicat ions as described in the concomitant therapy section (Section 7.7). The m onthly visit schedule for pati ents parti cipat ing in the rando mized withdrawal –retreatm ent period(Group B) allows these pat ients to be follo wed cl osely and ixekizumab treatment to be resum ed upon signs of relapse . The l ength of the randomized withdrawal period is 40weeks and considered sufficient ly long based on previous rando mized withdrawal studi es of TNF inhibitors in RA and axSpA (Haibel et al. 2008 ;Barkham et al. 2009; Haibel et al. 2010; Sieper et al . 2014 ;Smolen et al . 2014). It is anticipated that the majorit y of patients who no longer receive active treatment will relapse within that time frame."

The Post -Treatment Follow -Up Peri od (Peri od 4) is important for safet y monitoring fo llowing administration of the last study treatm ent. The duration of the Post -Treatment Fo llow-Up Period is at least 12 weeks and up to 24 weeks to allow fo r monitoring during ixekizumab clearance and reflects a time period equivalent to approximate ly 5 half -lives of ixekizumab. A repeat x-ray of the cervical and lumbar spine will be taken at Week 56 i n Study RHBY (approximately 2 years after baseline of the originating study ) to eval uate the potenti al effect of ixekizumab treatment on structural progression. The x-ray at Week 56 is only needed for patients ini tially enrolled in Studi esRHBV or RHBW (see Schedule of Act ivities, Section 2). As structural progression in axSpA is slow, a 2 -year time interval between consecut ive x-rays is appropriate for such evaluat ion in pat ients with radiographic axSpA and avoi ds radi ographic overexposure for patients. 5.5. Justification for Dose Study RHBY is a l ong-term extensio n study for pati ents who have completed Week 52 of any of the following originat ing studies: RHBV, RHBW ,or RHBX. The ixekizumab dose regimens used in Study RHBY (ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W) are the same as those used in studies RHBV, RHBW ,and RHBX."

It is recommended that these inject ions be administered away from the invest igational site. If the patient or caregiver is not able to administer any dose through outthe study , study site staff may administer that inject ion. Refer to the appropriate Manua l Syringe Directions for Use provided by the sponsor for the investigat ional product. Note that in the case a study drug inject ion is performed in an arm, it is not to be given in the same arm fro m which pat ient blood sam ples, including PK samples, are drawn at relevant visits. Study Drug Administration Logs will be dispensed to each patient for recording pertinent data about each inject ion; details o f the use of these logs are provided in Section7.2.1 . Possible inject ion sites are identified in the Manual Syringe Directions for Use . The injection site may be rotated to anot her area for subsequent doses. 7.1.2. Special Treatment Considerations All biological agents carry the risk of systemic allergic/hypersensit ivity reacti ons. Clinical manifestations of these reactions may in clude, but are not limit ed to: skin rash pruri tus (i tching) urticaria (hives) angioedema ( e.g., swelling of the lips and/or tongue) anaphylactic reaction Sometimes these react ions can be life threatening. Proteins may also cause redness, itching, swelling, or pain locally at the inject ion site; therefore, all pat ients are to be closely mo nitored for signs or symptoms that cou ld result from such reactions, educated on the signs or symptoms of these ty pes of react ions, and instructed to contact the study site immediately if any of the symptoms are experienced fo llowing an inject ion. If a patient experiences an acute allergic/hy persensi tivity react ion after an inject ion of investigational product, he or she is to be managed appropriately and given instruction to receive relevant supportive care. Addit ionally, for an event j udged by the invest igator to be a potent ial systemic all ergic/hypersensit ivity reacti on, a bl ood sam ple will be drawn as soon as possible for immunogenicit y and PK testing (Secti on 9.4.9 ). For pati ents who experience a potential allergic/hypersensit ivity react ion, consideration for any prem edicat ion for future inject ions will be agreed upon between the investigator and sponso r. Examples of potential allergic/hypersensit ivity reacti ons that might merit premedication include mild-to-moderate skin rashes, mild -to-moderate generalized pruritus and/or urticaria, and mild-to-moderate inject ion site react ions (e.g., injection site e rythema, injecti on si te pruri tus, etc.).

Patients may self -premedicate at home prior to administration of invest igational product, as directed by the invest igator. All such premedications will berecorded as concomitant medicat ions. Corticosteroi ds are not perm itted as agents for premedicat ion. 7.1.3. Packaging and Labelling The invest igational products will be supplied by the sponsor or i ts desi gnee in accordance wit h current Good Manufactu ring Practices (cGMP). Clinical trial materials will be labeled according to the country ’s regul atory requi rements. All investigat ional products will be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and destroy ed accord ing to applicable regulat ions. Ixekizumab and placebo to match will be supplied as an injectable so lution in 1-mL, single -dose, prefilled, disposable manual syringes wit h study specific labels. Each sy ringe of ixekizumab is designed to deliver ixekizumab 80 m g. The sy ringes (and contents) containing eit her ixekizumab or placebo will be visibly indist inguishable fro m each other. Syringes will be supplied in cartons with the appropriate quantit y of sy ringes specific to the planned dispensing schedule o f the investigational product. 7.2. Method of Treatment Assignment During the Lead- In Peri od (Peri od 1), patients who were previously r eceiving ixekizumab treatm ent during Studies RHBV and RHBW will, as of Week 0 in Study RHBY, continue to receive the same ixekizumab treatment regimen they were on at the end of the originat ing study , but now in open -label fashio n.

During the Extensio n Peri od, the IWRS will be used to assign double -blind invest igational product to each patient in Group B. Site personnel will confirm that they have located the correct invest igational product package by entering a confirmation number found on the package into the IWRS. 7.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses Invest igational product is to be administered at approximately the same t ime each day, as much as possible. For injections not administered on the scheduled day of the week from Week 0 to Week 104 , the missed dose should be administered as soon as possible . Injection(s) for missed dose(s) should not be given within 5 days of the next scheduled dose; inject ions should be ≥5days apart. Dates of subsequent study visits are not to be m odified according to this delay. A paper Study Drug Administration Log will be completed by patients for each inject ion throughout study partici pation. The data from the Study Drug Administration Log must be transcribed into the electronic case report form (eCRF) by site personnel. Patients will be instructed to contact their study site in the event of an inject ion probl em. In addition, si te personnel will review all Stud y Drug Administration Logs at each visit to ident ify any product complaints, and they will co mplete a Product Complaint Form for each operation failure reported on a Study Drug Administration Log (see Secti on 9.2.3 for addi tional instructi onsregarding co mplaint handling) . 7.3.

Upon flare, p atients will be retreated with the ixekizumab treatm ent regimen assigned in Period1in an open -label fashion. Pati ents who experience a flare and were originally fro m Study RHBX will not receive open -label treatment until the Week 52 datal ock has occurred for Study RHBX. During the Long - Term Extensio n Period (Peri od3), pati ents fro m Group A will continue to receive ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W.

Upon flare, patients will be retreated with the ixekizumab treatment regimen assigned in Period 1 in an open -label fashio n. As of Week 64, p atients init ially treated wi th ixekizumab 80mg Q4W during Period 1 may have their dose escalated to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W , in an open -label fashi on, only after the pati ent has experienced a flare and been subsequently retreated with ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W for at least 12 weeks. Patients who experience a flare and were originally from Study RHBX will not receive open -label treatment unt il the Week 52 datal ock has occurred for Study RHBX. Emergency unblinding for AEs m ay be perform ed through the IWRS , which m ay supplement or take the place of emergency codes generated by a com puter drug -labeling system. This option may be used ONLY if the patient’s well -being requires knowledge of the pati ent’s treatm ent assignment. All act ions result ing in an unblinding event are recorded and reported by the IWRS. If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or a patient is unblinded, the patient is to be discontinued from study treatm ent. In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient rem ain on study treatm ent,the invest igator must obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly clinical research physician or Lilly clinical research scient istfor the pati ent to continue on study treatm ent. In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determin ing if unblinding of a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment is warranted. Patient safet y must always be the first consideration in making such a determinat ion. If the invest igator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator is requested to make ever y effort to contact the Lilly clinical research"

Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, regulat ions, or laborator y certification standards. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments Below are bri ef descripti ons on key aspects of efficacy assessments used in the study . Com plete assessments are includ ed in site training materials. 9.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessments As described in Section 10.3.3.1 , the primary efficacy endpoint is the proporti on of patients in the randomized withdrawal popul ationwho do not experience a flare (a flare is defined as ASDAS ≥2.1 at 2 consecut ive visits, or ASDAS >3.5 at any visit during Per iod 2). The ASDAS is a co mposite index to assess disease activit y in axSpA (Machado et al .2011a, 2011b; Zochling 2011). The parameters used for the ASDAS (with high sensit ivity C-reactive protein [CRP] as acute phase reactant) are the fo llowing: 1)Total back pain (BASDAI quest ion 2) 2)Patient gl obal assessment (Section 9.1.2.4 ) 3)Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI question 3) 4)Durati on of morning stiffness (BASDAI quest ion 6) 5)CRP in mg/L The ASDAS crpis calculated with the fo llowing equati on: 0.121 × total back pain + 0.110 × patient gl obal + 0.073 × peri pheral pain/swelling + 0.058 × durati on of morning st iffness + 0.579 × Ln(CRP+1) (Machado et al. 2015). (Note: CRP is in mg/liter, the range of other variables is from 0 to 10; Ln represent s the natural logarithm .) 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments 9.1.2.1. Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score Four di sease act ivity states have been defined by ASAS con sensus (Machado et al. 2011c): ASDAS <1.3 defines inactive disease 1.3 ≤ ASDAS <2.1 defines mod erate di sease act ivity 2.1≤ ASDAS ≤3.5 defines high disease act ivity ASDAS >3.5 defi nes very high di sease activit y"
65,page_65,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 65 LY2439821Secondary efficacy assessments will include evaluation of pat ients who meet the criteria for inact ive disease (ASDAS <1.3; Machado et al. 2011c), clinically important improvement (defined as change ≥1.1 units), and major improvement (defined as change ≥2.0 units; Machado et al. 2011b). 9.1.2.2. Imaging Used for Efficacy Measures and Disease Diagnosis 9.1.2.2.1. Radiographic Imaging of the Spine The radi ographic image (x -ray) of the spine is used to evaluate structure progression. At Week 56, a spinal x -ray, plain radiograph of the lateral views of cervical and lumbar spine, will be centrally read ; the x-ray at Week 56is only needed for patients init ially enrolled in Studi es RHBV or RHBW . The data set will be scored by the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylit is Spinal Score (mSASSS ; Wanders 2004; Creemers 2005). By the scoring system of mSASSS of the spinal x-rays, a total of 24 si tes are scored on the lateral cervical and lumbar spine: the anterior corners of the vertebrae from lower border of C2 to upper border T1 (inclusive), and fro m lower border of T12 to upper border of S1 (inclusive). Each corner can be scored from 0 to 3, result ing in a range fro m 0 to 7 2 for the total mSASSS. The example o f scoring according to the mSASSS, 0 = normal; 1 = sclerosis, squaring or erosi on; 2 =syndesmophyte; 3 = bony bridge. 9.1.2.2.2. Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada MRI S core for Sacroiliac Joints At Week 24 (Group B : Visit 505), an MRI of both left and right SIJ is co llected. Both left and right SIJ are scored for bone marrow edema. Total SIJ Spondyloarthrit is Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) scores can range fro m 0 to 72 with higher scores reflect ing worse disease. Scoring will be performed by a central reader. 9.1.2.2.3. Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging A ctivity At Week 24 (Group B : Visit 505), an MRI of the spine is collected. All 23 disco -vertebral unit s of the spine (fro m C2 to S1) are scored for bone marrow edema with a validated scoring method. Scoring will be performed by a central reader. 9.1.2.3. ASAS20, ASAS40, ASAS5/6, ASAS Partial Remission The fo llowing ASAS domains are used to determine ASAS20, ASAS40, ASAS 5/6, and ASAS partial remiss ion (Sieper et al. 2009; ASAS Handbook): 1)Patient Gl obal (Secti on 9.1.2.4 ) 2)Spinal Pain (Section 9.1.2.5 ) 3)Funct ion (Section 9.1.2.6 ) 4)Inflammat ion (mean of BASDAI questions 5 and 6) (Section 9.1.2.7 ) 5)CRP (Secti on 9.1.2.14.1 ) 6)Spinal mo bility (lateral spinal flexi on) (Secti on 9.1.2.8 ) 9.1.2.3.1. ASAS20 The ASAS20 resp onse is derived from pat ient-reported assessments. An ASAS20 response is defined as a ≥20% improvement and an abso lute improvement from baseline (fro m originat ing"
66,page_66,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 66 LY2439821study ) of ≥1 uni ts (range 0to 10) in ≥3 of the f ollowing 4 domains (Patient Global, Spinal Pain, Funct ion, and Inflammat ion) and no worsening of ≥20% and ≥1 unit (range 0 to 10) in the remaining dom ain. 9.1.2.3.2. ASAS40 The ASAS40 response (Anderson et al. 2001; Brandt et al. 2004; Sieper et al. 2009) is derived from patient-reported assessments. The ASA S40 is defined as a ≥ 40% improvement and an absolute improvement from baseline (fro m originating study ) of ≥2 uni ts (range 0 to 10) in ≥3 of the following 4 domains (Pati ent Gl obal, Spinal Pain, Funct ion, and Inflammat ion) wi thout any wors ening in the rema ining do main. 9.1.2.3.3. ASAS5/6 The ASAS5/6 includes assessment of all 6 individual ASAS domains listed above (Secti on9.1.2.3 ) and represents improvement of ≥20% in at least 5 domains. 9.1.2.3.4. ASAS Partial Remission The ASAS partial remissio nis derived fro m patient-reported assessments. An ASAS partial remission is define d as a value not above 2 units (range 0 to 10, numeric rating scale [ NRS]) in each of the fo llowing 4 domains: Pati ent Gl obal, Spinal Pain, Funct ion, and Inflammat ion. 9.1.2.4. Patient Global (Assessment of Disease Activity) From the ASAS Handbook (Sieper et al. 2009), the pati ent is asked to respond to the fo llowing question: “How active was y our spondyli tis on average during the last week?” The answer is recorded on an NRS and is rated between “0” (not active) and “10” (very act ive). 9.1.2.5. Spinal Pain From the ASAS Handbook (Sieper et al. 2009), the pati ent is asked to respond to the fo llowing 2 questions (on average during the last week): 1.“How m uch pain o f your spine due to ankylo sing spondylit isdo you have?” 2.“How m uch pain o f your spine due to ankylo sing spondylit isdo you have at ni ght?” The answers are recorded on an NRS and are each rated between “0” (no pain) and “10” (most severe pain). The first question is used to derive responses ( i.e., ASAS40, ASAS20, and so on). 9.1.2.6. Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index The BASFI is a patient -reported assessment. The BASFI establishes a patient’s funct ional baseline and subsequent response to treatment (Calin et al. 1995). To complete the BASFI, a patient will be asked to rate the difficult y associated with 10 individual basic functi onal act ivities. Patients respond to each question using an NRS (range 0 to 10), with a higher score indicat ing worse functioning. The patient’s final BASFI score is the mean of the 10 item scores compl eted on an NRS. 9.1.2.7. Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index The BASDAI is a patient -reported assessment. The BASDAI is an instrument consist ing of 6questions that relate to 5 major symptoms relevant to axSpA (Garrett et al. 1994; Sieper et al. 2009): 1) Fatigue, 2) Spinal pain, 3) Peripheral arthrit is, 4) Enthesit is, 5) Intensit y, and 6)"
67,page_67,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 67 LY2439821Durati on of morning stiffness. Patients need to score each item wit h a score from 0 to 10 (NRS). Higher score represents worse disease activit y. The BASDAI50 represents an improvement of ≥50% of the BASDAI score fro m baseline. 9.1.2.8. Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index—Spinal Mobility The Bath Ankylo sing Spondylit is Metrology Index (BASMI )is a combined index comprising the following 5 clinical measurements of spinal mobili ty in pat ients with axSpA (Jenkinson et al. 1994): lateral spinal flexi on tragus -to-wall distance lumbar flexio n (modified Schrober) maximal intermalleol ar distance cervical rotation The BASMI includes these 5 measurements which are each scaled to a score of 0 to 10 depending on the result of the assessment (BASMI linear function). The average score of the 5 assessments gives the BASMI linear result (van der Heijde et al. 2008; Sieper et al. 2009). The BASMI must be assessed by a rheumatologist or health c are provi der who m eets the qualificat ions for study assessment. 9.1.2.9. Chest Expansion While pat ients have their hands rest ing on or behind the head, the assessor will measure the chest encircled length by cent imeter (cm) at the fourth intercostal level anteriorl y. The difference between m aximal inspiration and expi ration in cm will be recorded. Two tries will be recorded. The better (larger difference) measurement of 2 tries in cent imeters will be used for analyses. The m easurement of chest expansio n must be assessed by a rheumatol ogist or health care provi der who meets the qualif ications for study assessment. 9.1.2.10. Occiput to Wall Distance The patient is to make a maximum effort to touch the head against the wall when standing with heels and back against the wall ( occiput). Then the di stance fro m occiput to wall is measured. Two tri es will be recorded. The better (smaller) measurement of 2 tries in cent imeters will be used for analyses (Sieper et al. 2009 ). The m easurement of occi put to wall distance mus t be assessed by a rheumatol ogist or health care provi der who meets the quali fications for study assessment. 9.1.2.11. Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score The Maastri cht Ankylo sing Spondylit is Enthesit is Score (MASES )is an index used to measure the severit y of enthesit is (Hueft -Dorenbosch et al. 2003). The MASES assesses 13 sites for enthesit is using a score of “0” for no activity or “1” for activit y. Sites assessed include: costochondral 1 (right/left), costochondral 7 (right/left), spinal iliaca anteri or superi or (ri ght/left), crista iliaca (ri ght/left), spina iliaca posterior (right/left), processus spinosus L5, and Achilles"
68,page_68,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 68 LY2439821tendon proximal insert ion (right/left). The MASES is the sum of all site scores (range of scores: 0 to 13), higher scores indicate more severe enthesit is. The MASES is to be assessed by a rheumatologist or health care provider who meets study qualif ications for study assessment. 9.1.2.12. SPARCC Enthesitis Score The SPARCC enthesit is is an index used to measure the severit y of enthesi tis (Maksymowych et al. 2009). The SPARCC assesses 16 si tes for enthesi tis using a score of “0” for no activi ty or “1” for activit y. Sites assessed include: Medial epicondyle (left/right [L/R]), Lateral epicondyle (L/R), Supraspinatus insertion into greater tuberosity of humerus (L/R), Greater trochanter (L/R), Quadri ceps inserti on into superi or border of patella (L/R), Patellar ligament insertion into inferi or pol e of patella or tibial tubercle (L/R), c Achilles tendon insert ion into cal caneum (L/R), and Plantar fascia i nsertion into cal caneum (L/R). The SPARCC is the sum of all site scores ( range of scores: 0 to 16). Higher scores in dicate more severe enthesit is. The SPARCC is to be assessed by a rheumatologist or health care provider who meets study qualifi cations for s tudy assessments. 9.1.2.13. Peripheral Arthritis 9.1.2.13.1. Tender Joint Count The number of tender and painful jo ints will be determined by examinat ion of 46 jo ints (23 joints on each side of the patient’s body ). The 46 joints to be assessed and classified as tender or not tender are detailed in site training materials. Any joints that require intra -articular injections during the study (according to Section 7.7) mustbe excluded fro m evaluat ion from the time of the inject ion to the conclusio n of the study . Joint assessments will be performed by an experienced rheumatologist or skilled and trained assessor. To minimize interobserver variat ion, particularly during the blinded, randomized withdrawal –retreatm ent peri od (Peri od 2), i t is recommended that the same assessor performs the tender jo int count ( TJC) for a given patient. Missing, replaced, ankylo sed, or arthrodesed jo ints will be ident ified by the investigator an d will be excluded fro m evaluat ion during the study . The TJC data wil l be co llected electronically. 9.1.2.13.2. Swollen Joint Count The number of swo llen jo ints will be determined by examinat ion of 44 jo ints (22 joints on each side of the pati ent’s body ). The 44 j oints to be assessed and classified as swo llen or not swollen are detailed in site training materials. Any jo ints that require intra- articular inject ions during the study (according to Secti on 7.7) must be excluded fro m evaluat ion from the tim e of the inject ion to the conclusio n of the study . Joint assessment is to be performed by an experienced rheumatologist or healt h care provider who meets the qua lificat ions for study assessments. To minimize interobserver variat ion, particularly during the blinded, rando mized wit hdrawal –retreatm ent peri od (Peri od2), it is"
69,page_69,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 69 LY2439821recommended that the same assessor performs the swollen jo int count ( SJC)for a gi ven pati ent. Missing, replaced, ankylo sed, or arthrodesed jo ints will be identified by the invest igator and will be excluded fro m evaluat ion during the study . The SJC data wil l be collected electronically . 9.1.2.14. Laboratory Tests Used for Efficacy Measu res and Disease Diagnosis 9.1.2.14.1.High Sensitivity C -Reactive Protein High sensi tivity C-react ive protein will be the measure of acute phase reactant. It will be measured with a high sensit ivity assay at the central laboratory to hel p assess the effect of ixekizu mab on disease activit y. 9.1.2.15. Health Outcomes Measures 9.1.2.15.1. Healthcare Resource Utilization Healthcare resource utilization data regarding the number of visits to medical care providers (such as general practit ioners, specialists, physical, or occupational therapists, and other nonphysical care providers for services outside of the clinical trial), emergency room admissio ns, hospi tal admissi ons, and conco mitant m edicati ons will be recorded by the invest igator or designee in the study ’s CRF . These data will be collected to support econ omic evaluat ions of treatm ent. 9.1.2.15.2. Fatigue Severity Numeric Rating Scale The fat igue severit y NRS i s a pat ient-reported single -item 11-point hori zontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 represent ing “no fat igue” and 10 representing “as bad as y ou can imagine” (Naegeli et al. 2013). Patients rate their fatigue ( feeling tired or worn out ) by circling the 1 number that describes their worst level of fatigue during the previous 24 hours. 9.1.2.15.3. Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short -Form Health Survey The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is a 36 -item patient-reported measure designed to be a short, multipurpose assessment of healt h in the areas o f physical funct ioning, role –physical, role -emotional, bodily pain, vitalit y, soci al functioning, mental hea lth, and general healt h. The 2 overarching do mains of mental well -being and physical well -being are captured by the Mental Com ponent Summary and Physical Component Summary scores. The summary scores range from 0 to 100; hi gher scores indicate better leve ls of function and/or better health. Items are answered on Likert scales of varying lengths. The SF -36 versio n 2 (acute version) will be used, which utilizes a 1 -week recall period (Ware 2000). 9.1.2.15.4. Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society Health Index The ASAS –Heal th Index (AS AS-HI)is a disease specific healt h-index instrument designed to assess the impact of intervent ions for SpA, including axSpA. This broader concept of health is included in the Internat ional Classification o f Functi oning Dis abilit y and Healt h (ICFD) which has been published by World Heal th Organizati on(WHO). The ASAS has applied the ICFD as a basis to define a core set of items relevant for patients with axSpA. The 17- item instrum ent has scores ranging fro m 0 (good health) to 17 (poor health)(Kiltz et al . 2015). Each i tem consists of 1 question that the patient needs to respond to with either “I agree” (score 1) or “I do"
70,page_70,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 70 LY2439821not agree (score 0).” A score of “1” is given where the item is affirmed, indicating adverse health. All item scores are summed to give a total score or index. 9.1.2.15.5. European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions 5- Level The European Qualit y of Life -5 Dimensi ons 5-Level (EQ -5D- 5L) is a standardized measure of healt h status used to provide a simple, generic measur e of healt h for clinical and econo mic apprai sal. The EQ -5D- 5L consists of 2 components: a descript ive system o f the respondent’s healt h and a rating of his/her current health state using a 0- to 100 -mm visual analog scale (VAS). The descript ive system c omprises the following 5 dimensio ns: m obility, self -care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensio n has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her healt h state by ticking (or pl acing a cross) in the box associated with the most appropri ate statement in each of the 5 dimensio ns. It should be noted that the numerals 1 to 5 have no arithmetic properties and are not to be used as a cardinal score. The VAS records the respondent’s self -rated heal th on a vert ical VAS in which the endpo ints are labeled “best imaginable healt h state” and “worst imaginable health state.” This informat ion can be used as a quant itative measure of hea lth outcome. The EQ-5D- 5L healt h states, defined by the EQ -5D- 5L descript ive system, may be converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essent ially attaches values (also called weights) to each of the levels in each dimen sion (The EuroQol Group 2011). 9.1.2.15.6. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire— Spondyloarthritis The Work Productivit y Activit y Impairment Questio nnaire -Spondyloarthrit is(WPAI-SpA) consists of 6 questions to determine emplo yment status, hours missed fro m work because of spondylo arthri tis, hours missed fro m work for other reasons, hours actually worked, the degree to which spondylo arthri tis affected work productivit y while at work, and the degree to which spondylo arthri tis affected activit ies outside of work. T he WPAI -SpA has been validated in the rad-axSpA patient population (Reilly et al. 2010). Four scores are derived: percentage of absenteeism, percentage of presenteeism (reduced productivit y while at work), an overall work impairment score that combines absenteeism and presenteeism, and percentage of impairment in activit ies performed outside of work. Greater scores indicate greater impairment ( Reilly Associ ates Heal th Outcom es Research [ WWW ]). 9.1.2.15.7. Jenkins Sleep Questionnaire The Jenkins Sleep Evaluat ion Ques tionnaire (JSEQ )is a 4 -item scale designed to estimate sleep probl ems in clinical research. The JSEQ assesses the frequency of sleep disturbance in 4 categori es: 1) troubl e falling asleep, 2) waking up several t imes during the night, 3) having trouble staying asleep (including waking up far too early), and 4) waking up after the usual amount of sleep feeling tired and worn out. Patients report the number of days they experience each of these problems in the past month on a 6 -point Likert Scale ranging f rom 0 = “no day s” to 5 = “22 -30 day s.” The total JSEQ score ranges from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicat ing greater sl eep disturbance (Deodha r et al . 2010)."

Adverse Events An AE is defined as fo llows: any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or cl inical investigat ion subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with this treatm ent. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (invest igational) product. Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study and f or alerting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study. Invest igators mu st docum ent thei r review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to the invest igational produ ct or the study, or that caused the patient to discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. Th e frequency of follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the informed consent form (ICF) i s signed, study site personnel will record vi a case report form (CRF) the occurrence and nature of each pat ient’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study . In addition, site personnel will record any change in the condit ion(s) and any new condit ions as AEs. Invest igators should record their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, invest igational product, via CRF. The invest igator will in terpret and docum ent whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, study device, or a study procedure, taki ng into account the disease, concomitant treatment or pathologies. To assess the relat ionship of the AEs, the following is defined: Reasonably Possibly Related : Reasonable possibilit y that there i s a cause and effect relationship between the study product and/or study procedure and the AE. The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study ."
72,page_72,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 72 LY2439821If a patient’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via electronic data entry , clarifying if possible, the circumstances leading to any dosage m odificat ions, or discontinuations of treatment. Accurate start and stop dates (and times, where required) are to be report ed via electronic data entry for all AEs. Only AEs that are ongoing at the last study visit and/or communicat ion are to be docum ented as “o ngoing.” 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es: death initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion a life- threatening experience ( i.e., immediate risk of dying) persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y congenital ano maly/birth defect considered significant by the invest igator for any other reason: important medical events that may not resul t in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious, based upon appropriate medical judgment. Although all AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the CRF, SAE report ing begins after the pati ent has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, it needs to be reported ONLY if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official notification on study -specific SAE forms. This 24-hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE information and a ll follow -up SAE inform ation. Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet t he definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in pat ients once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the patient summary CRF has been co mpleted). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly . 9.2.1.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the recording and expedited rep orting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) that are consistent with global regulat ions and the associ ated detailed guidances."

Adverse Events of Special Interest The fo llowing adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be used to determine the safet y and tolerabilit y of ixekizumab over the range of doses sel ected for this clinical study . Adverse events of special interest for ixekizuma b are as fo llows: cytopeni as (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocy topeni a) clinically significant hepatic events and/or significant elevat ions in liver funct ion test changes/enzyme elevat ions (ALT, AST, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) infect ions inject ion-site reacti ons allergic reactions/hypersensit ivities cerebrocardiovascular events malignancies inflammatory bowel disease depressio n Sites will provide details on so me of these AEs as instructed on the CRF. Invest igators will also educate patients and/or caregivers about the symptoms of allergic/hypersensit ivity react ions and will provide instructions on dealing with these reactions (see also Secti on7.1.2 ). A blood sample will be collected as soon as possible for any patient who experi ences an AE of a potential systemic allergic/hypersensit ivity react ion during the study as judged by the invest igator. Data on preferred terms associated with cerebrocardiovascular events (defined as death, cardiac ischemic events including MI and hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalizat ion for heart failure, serious arrhy thmia, resuscitated sudden death, cardiogenic shock, coronary revascularization procedure, strok e/transient ischemic attack, peripheral revascularization procedure, peripheral arterial event, and hospitalization for hy pertensi on)will be co llected, and these events and any deaths will be adjudicated by an external clinical events committee (CEC) made up of a chairman, 2 cardio logists, and a neurologist. The role of the CEC will be to adjudicate these defined clinical events in a blinded, consistent, and unbiased manner throughout the course of a study andensure that all events that have been reporte d are evaluated uniformly by a single group (the CEC). Data on suspected IBD, as identified by events possibly indicat ive of ulcerative colit is and Crohn’s disease, will be co llected and the events will be adjudicated by an external CEC with expert ise in IBD. The rol e of the CEC will be to adj udicate defined clinical events, in a blinded, consistent, and unbiased manner throughout the course of a study andensure that all events that have been reported are evaluated uniformly by a single group . 9.2.3.

Treatment of Overdose Refer to the IB and/or the product label where applicable. 9.4. Safety 9.4.1. Electrocardiograms For each patient, electrocardi ogram s (ECGs) should be collected according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). Pati ents are to be resting for 5 minutes prior to the ECG. It is recommended that pat ients be in a supine posit ion. Any clinically significant findings from ECGs that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of the invest igational treatment should be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via CRF . 9.4.2. Vital Signs For each patient, vi tal signs measurements (sitting) should be conducted according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Vi tal signs include blood pressure (BP), pulse, and temperature. Pati ents are to be resting for a minimum of 5 minutes prior to vital sign collect ion . Any clinically significa nt findings fro m vital signs measurement that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of study treatment should be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via CRF. 9.4.3. Laboratory Tests For each patient, laboratory tests detailed in ( Appendix 2 ) shoul d be conducted according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Please reference the central laboratory manual for specific instructi ons. Urine pregnancy test will be collected and read/analyzed locally . Urine testing for pregnancy may occur at interv als m ore frequent lythan according to the Schedule of Activit ies during the study treatm ent peri od and/or follow up period if requi red per l ocal regul ation.

Eye Symptom Assessment At each study visit, study heal thcare provi ders will evaluate the patient for any symptoms of anteri or uvei tis as specifi ed in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). If the patient has no prior ophthalmo logist diagnosed anterior uveit is and develops eye pain or disc omfort, eye redness, blurring of visio n, or any other symptoms suggest ive of anterior uveit is, the patient must be evaluated by an ophthalmo logist. If a patient has prior history of ophthalmo logist di agnosed anteri or uvei tis, then she/he m ust be evaluated by a physician for recurrence of anterior uveit is (whenever possible, diagnosis is to be con firmed by an ophthalmo logist). 9.4.6. Tuberculosis Testing Tuberculosis testing will be conducted based on clinical assessment of TB risk (symptom s/signs/known or suspect ed TB exposure), and as required by local regulations and/or local standard of care . Patients wi th a positive TB test and /orother evidence o f active TB should be discontinue d (Sect ion 8.1.1 ).

76,page_76,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 76 LY24398219.4.7. Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology —Self-Report (16Items) For each patient, a QIDS -SR16 assessment will be collected according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). Any clinically significant findings from the QIDS -SR16 assessment that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of study treatment are to be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE viaCRF. The QIDS -SR16 is a self-administered 16-item instrum ent intended to assess the existence and severit y of symptom s of depressio n as listed in the American Psychiatric Associat ion’s Diagnostic and Stati stical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edit ion (APA 1994). A patient is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way they have fel t for the past 7 days. There is a 4 -point scale for each item ranging from 0 to 3. The 16 items corresponding to 9 depression domains are summed to give a single score ranging from 0 to 27, with higher scores denoting greater symptom severit y. The dom ains assessed by the instrum ent are (1) sad mood, (2)concentration, (3) self -criticism, (4) sui cidal ideati on, (5) interest, (6) energy/f atigue, (7)sleep disturbance (init ial, middle, and late insomnia or hy perso mnia), (8) decrease/increase in appeti te/wei ght, and (9) psy chomotor agi tation/retardati on. Addi tional informat ion and the QIDS -SR16 questions may be found at the Universit y of Pittsburgh IDS/QIDS internet page (IDS/QIDS home page [WWW] ) . 9.4.8. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C -SSRS (Posner et al. 2007; C- SSRS web site [WWW]) is a scale that captures the occurrence, severit y, and f requency of suicide -related i deations and beha viors during the assessment period. The C -SSRS m ust be administered by appropriately trained si te personnel . The tool was developed by the Nat ional Inst itute of Mental Heal th Treatment of Ado lescent Suicide Attem pters tri al group for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algorithm o f Suicide Assessment categorizat ion of suicidal events. Patients will be assessed according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). The Self -Harm Supplement Form is a one -quest ion form that i s completed at any visit, including baseline visits, asking for the number of suicidal or nonsuicidal self -injuri ous behavi ors the patient experie nced since last assessment. For each unique event ident ified, a questionnaire (Self -Harm Follow-Up Form ) which collects supplemental informat ion on the self -injuri ous behavior must be completed. This informat ion is then docum ented in the eCRF. 9.4.9. Immunogeni city For each patient, an immunogenicit y sample will be collected according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). If necessary, samples may al so be tested for ixekizumab drug concentrations to facilitate the interpretation of the immunogenicit y data. Addit ionally , a bl ood sam ple will be collected, as soon as possible, for any patient who experiences a potential systemic allergic/hypersensit ivityreact ion during the study as judged by the invest igator. These samples will be tested for immunogenicit y and PK, while other"

Safety Monitoring Lilly will periodically review evo lving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate methods. If a study patient experiences elevated ALT ≥3xULN, al kaline phosphatase ≥2xULN, or elevated total bilirubin ≥2xULN, clinical and laboratory monitoring is to be init iated by the investigator. Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory test abnorm alities. For other AESIs or abnormal lab result s, please refer to the appropriate protocol section that add resses these topics. To ensure patient safet y and co mply with regul atory guidance, the invest igator is to consult with the Lilly clinical research physician/clinical research scient ist regarding co llection of specific recommended clinical inform ation and follow-up laboratory tests.

Sample Size Determination Approximately 100 patients who achieved a state of sustained remissio n on ixekizumab Q4W will be rando mized in a 2:1 rati o to ixekizumab 80 m g Q4W or placebo, and approximately 100patients who achieved a state of sustained remissio n on ixekizumab Q2W will be rando mized in a 2:1 rati o to ixekizumab 80 m g Q2W or pl acebo in the double -blind randomized withdrawal –retreatm ent peri od. This 200 total sampl e size will provide over 99 % power to detect a difference in the proporti on of patients who do not experience a flare between ixekizumab treatm ent (including both Q2W and Q4W) and placebo using a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test at the 0.05 level , assuming the flare rates are 10% for ixekizumab and 70% for placebo. It i s estimated that approximately 30% of total enro lled patients ( i.e., approximately 200 pati ents) will meet the criteria to enter the double -blind rando mized withdrawal –retreatm ent period. If less t han the anticipated number of pat ients meet the criteria to enter the double -blind rando mized withdrawal –retreatm ent peri od (e.g., 20%), the total number of pat ients (approximately 150) would st ill provide over 95% power to detect a difference between ixekizumab treatm ent and pl acebo in the proporti on of patients who do not experience a flare. 10.2. Populations for Analyses For purposes of analysis, the following major pati ent populat ions are defined (Table RHBY. 5). Table RHBY. 5 .

General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis o f this study will be the responsibilit y ofEli Lilly and Company . Continuous data will be summarized in terms of the mean, standard deviat ion, minimum, maximum, median, and number of observat ions. Categorical data will be summarized as frequency counts and percentages . Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the j ustification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report. Addi tional expl oratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deem ed appropri ate. Com plete details of the pl anned analyses will be documented in the statist ical analys is plan (SAP). 10.3.1.1. General Considerations for Analyses during the Combined Periods 1, 2, and 3 Combined Periods 1, 2, and 3 start at the first injection of ixekizumab 80 Q2W or ixekizumab 80mg Q4W in Study RHBY and ends on the date of Week 104 (Group A: Visit 14/Group B: Visit 519) or at early terminati on visi t (ETV) pri or to Week 104. 10.3.1.1.1.

Change fro m baseline will be calculated as the visit value of interest minus the baseline value . The primary analysis method for treatment c omparisons of categori cal efficacy and health outcom esvariables at specific time po ints will be made using a logistic regression analysis with treatm ent, geographi c regi ons, and originat ing study inthe model. The odds rati oand 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported ; treatment difference and 95% CIs will also be reported. Secondary analysis will be conducted using a Fisher’s exact test. The Kaplan -Meier product limit method will be used to estimate the survival cur ves for time- to-flare for the patients who are randomized to the rando mized withdrawal –retreatm ent period. Treatment comparisons will be performed using the stratified log-rank test with treatm ent,geographic region , and originat ing study in the m odel. The analysis for all cont inuous efficacy and healt h outcom e variables, change from baseline to endpo int analysis, will be made using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment, baseline value, geographic region, and originat ing study in the model . Missi ng data will be imputed using modified baseline observat ion carried forward (mBOCF). Type III sum s of squares for the least -squares (LS) means will be used for the statist ical comparison; the 95% CI will also be reported. Fisher's exact test will be used for all AEs, baseline, discontinuation, and other categorical safety data. Continuous vital signs and laboratory values will be analyzed by an ANCOVA with treatm ent and baseline value sin the model. For pati ents who are randomized and subsequent ly experie nce a flare in Period 2, efficacy, healt h outcom es, and safet y data collected between t ime of flare and the end of Period 2 will be summarized for ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or ixekizumab Q4W without inferent ial stati stics. 10.3.1.2.2. Flare Population For the Flare Populat ion, Peri od2 starts at the time of first inject ion of the retreatment of ixekizumab 80 mgQ2W or 80 mg Q4W fo llowing the flare and ends on the date of Week 64 prior to inject ion of study treatm ent (Visi t515) or the ETV before the date of Week 64. Summary statistics will be provided based on the Flare Populat ion within 16 weeks after the ixekizumab retreatment for patients who have 16 weeks of post -retreatment fo llow-up. No inferential statistics will be provided. The Kaplan –Meier estimates of the proporti on of patients who first regain response on the variables of interest will be carried out at each post -retreatment interval (4weeks, 8 weeks, etc.) up to 40 weeks. If a pat ient has not regained response or discontinues the study by Week 64, the patient will be censored at the date of their last visit during Peri od2. 10.3.1.3.

The primary analysis will be ANCOVA to compare the 2- year radiographic progression in spine measured by change in modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylit is Spinal Score (mSASSS). The ANCOVA model will include population and baseline mSASSS score. Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare the proportion of nonprogressors measured by change in Total mSASSS <2 and by mSASSS=0, the proporti on of progressors measured by change in Total mSASSS ≥0, and the proporti on of patients wi th no new syndesmophy tes. 10.3.1.4. General Considerations for Analyses during the Post -Treatment Follow -Up (Period 4) For the safet y analyses during Period 4, baseline is defined as the last nonmissing assessment prior to entering Period 4, that is, on or prior to Week 104 ( Group A: Visit 14/Group B: Visit 519), or ETV. Safet y data collected will be summarized using descript ive statist ics. 10.3.1.5. Missing Data Imputation In accordance with precedent set with other Phase 3 AS trials (van der Heijde et al. 2006; Inman et al. 2008), the fo llowing me thods for imputation of missing data will be used: 10.3.1.5.1. Nonresponder Imputation for Clinical Response Analysis of categorical efficacy and healt h outcomes variables will be assessed using a nonresponder imputation (NRI) method. Patients will be considered a no nresponder for the NRI analysis if they do not m eet the clinical response criteria at any specified analysis t ime point . All nonresponders at any specified time point as well as all patients who discontinue study treatm ent before the specified analysis t ime point, for any reason, will be defined as a nonresponder for the NRI analysis. Patients wi thout at l east 1 observat ion on study treatment will also be defined as a nonresponder for the NRI analysis . The NRI m ay be applied at any time point specified for analysis. 10.3.1.5.2. Modified Nonresponder Imputation for Clinical Response Analysis of categorical efficacy and healt h outcome variables for long-term ixekizumab treatm ent analysis will be assessed using amodified nonresponder imputation (m NRI)method. Patients will be considered asnonresponders if they disco ntinue study drug due to a flare, an AE, or lack of efficacy . For patients discontinuing study drug for any other reason, the data will be imputed using multiple imputation method (as described in Sect ion10.3.1.5.4 ). Patients without at least 1 observation will also be defined as nonresponders for the mNRI analysis. 10.3.1.5.3. Modified Baseline Observation C arried Forward The primary analyses for all cont inuous efficacy and healt h outcome variables will be based on an mBOCF approach. For patients discont inuing study drug due to an AE, the baseline (from the"

For pati ents di scont inuing study drug for any other reason, the l ast nonmissing observat ion before discont inuat ion will be carried forward to the corresponding prim ary endpoint for evaluat ionwith the f ollowing except ion; for pati ents who experience a flare in Period 2 and are retreat edwithixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or Q4W , the l ast nonmissing observat ions prior to the ixekizumab re-treatm entwill be carried forward to s ubsequent time points .Rando mized patients without at l east 1 postbaseline observation will not be included for evaluat ion with the except ion of patients di scontinuing study treatment because of an AE. 10.3.1.5.4. Multiple Imputation Analysis of cont inuous efficacy a nd healt h outcome variables for long -term ixekizumab treatm ent analysis will be assessed using mult iple imputation method. In the multiple imputation analyses, missing data will be imputed so as to estimate what observat ions woul d have been if the pati enthad not discontinued. Specifically, multi ple imputati onis the partial imputation of nonmo notone missing data using Markov chain Monte Carlo method with the simple imputation model, followed by a sequent ial regressio n imputatio n with the baseline score. 10.3.1.6. Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons The primary outcom e of proporti on of patients who do not experience a flare will be tested for ixekizumab versus placebo at a 2 -sided α=0.05. The co mpar ison of major secondary object ives (Secti on 4) will be tested using an appropri ate m ultiple testing approach providing strong control of the familywise error rate (for the primary and maj or secondary tests) at a 2 -sided α=0.05 . Details o f the specific testing method ology (incl uding testing order, interrelat ionships, ty pe I error allocat ion, and the associ ated propagati on) will be specified in the SAP. There will be no adjust ment for multiple comparisons for any other analyses. 10.3.2. Treatment Group Comparability 10.3.2.1. Patie nt Disposition All patients who discont inue from the study treatment and the study will be i dentified, and the extent of their participat ion in the study will be reported. Patient dispo sition will be summarized for each treatment period. Reasons for discont inuat ion from the study will be summarized. The reason for discontinuation during Period 2 for the Randomized Withdrawal ITT Population will be tested between treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test. 10.3.2.2. Patient Characteristics Patient characterist ics and baseline clinical measures will be summarized. Baseline characterist ics will include gender, age, age category , wei ght, race, geographic region, originating study , abnorm al/normal CRP. Baseline cli nical measurements m ay include BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI, chest expansio n, Fat igue NRS, Patient Global NRS, total back pain, spinal pain at night, spinal pain, inflammat ion, MASES, enthesit is SPARCC, TJC, and SJC."

Missing data will be imputed using the NRI method described in Section 10.3.1.5.1 . 10.3.3.2. Major Secondary Analyses The m ajor secondary analysis for the time to flare will be based on the Rando mized Withdrawal ITT P opulation. Time to fl are will be calculated in weeks as follows: Dateofflare−DateofFirstDoseinPeriod2+1 7 The date of flare is the time po int when the pat ient qualifies for retreatment. If the date of the first dose is missing, the date of randomizat ion will be used. Patients who complete Period 2 without a fla re will be censored at the date of complet ion (i.e., the date of the last scheduled visit in the period). Patients without a date of co mpletion or discont inuat ion for Peri od 2 and who di d not experience a flare will be censored at the latest nonmissing da te out of the fo llowing dates: date of l ast dose and date of last attended visit in Period 2 (scheduled or unscheduled). Treatment comparisons between ixekizumab and placebo in time to flare for the Rando mized Withdrawal ITT Population will be analyzed us ing a stratified log -rank test with treatment, geographi c regi on, and originating study in the mo del. The Kaplan -Meier product limit method"

The frequency and percentage (incidence) of pat ients with posi tive, negat ive, or inconclusive ADA at baseline and postbaseline (and NAbs at baseline and postbaseline) will be summarized by treatment group. Patie nts who are TE -ADA posit ive, TE -ADA persistent posit ive, and TE-ADA transient positive will also be summarized. The potential impact of immunogenicit y on efficacy responses will be evaluated, as appropriate. Assessment of immunogenicit y with respect to safety will include com parison of patients who experience treatm ent-emergent adverse event (TEAEs )of systemic allergy/hypersensit ivity and of inject ion-site reacti ons and who al so develop treatment -emergent ant i-ixekizumab antibody positivity with patients who experience the same types of TEAEs but who remain treatm ent-emergent anti -ixekizumab ant ibody negative. Anti -ixekizumab ant ibody titers will also be evaluated in ant i-ixekizumab antibody positive patients who experience these events. 10.3.7. Interim Analyses The study will have approximately 1interim database lock and 1 final database lock . The interim database l ock will occur and the analysis will be performed at the time when all pat ients have completed throug h Week 64 or have di scontinued at or prior to Week 64. At this time, study team members will beco me unblinded; however, invest igators, patients, and site personnel will remain blinded to study treatm ent until final database lock. Theinterim database loc k will include all data collected by the cutoff date, including the data from the Long -Term Exten ded Treatment Period (Period 3), and follow-up data from patients that have begun the Post - Treatment Follow -Up Peri od (Peri od 4). The analyses from the Week 64 database lock will be treated as a primary analysis because all primary and major secondary study object ives will be assessed at this time. The final database lock , unblinding, and analysis will occur when all patients have completed or di scont inued the study . Addit ional analyses and snapshot sof study data may be performed during Period 3 or after completion of Period 4 to fulfill the need for regulatory interactions or publicat ion purposes. Unblinding details are specified in the blinding/unblinding plan."

The new protocol is indicated by amendment ( a) and will be used to conduct the study in place of any preceding versio n of the protocol. The overall changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are as fo llows: In the original protocol, pa tients parti cipat ing in the randomized withdrawal –retreatm ent period (Group B) were unblinded to study treatm entonce the Week 64 datal ock had been completed. In Protocol RHBY Amendment (a), patients in Group B will be blinded until the com pletion of the study or time of flare. Changing the time of unblinding for patients in Group Bwillhelp to eliminate bias from part icipants and retain patients who are on placebo; therefore ,it will facilit ate the assessment of the proporti on of patients who experience a flare after Week 64. Revisio ns were made to Section 7.3(Blinding), Secti on10.3.7 (Interim Analyses), andTable RHBY .2. Secti on10(Statistical Considerat ions) was revised, as fo llows: oThe Ixekizumab St ructure Populat ion definit ion was added to Table RHBY .5to align with the structure object ive. oTo assess the long -term efficacy of ixekizumab treatment , ananalysis o f Combine d Peri ods1, 2, and 3 was added. Therefore, the Long -Term Ixekizumab Treatment Efficacy Population was defined in Table RHBY .5. The analysis methods were updated to include the handling of missing data (i.e., mNRI and MI). Due to the inclusio n of the assessment of Combined Periods 1, 2, and 3, it was determined that the analysis o f Period1 only and Co mbined Periods 2 and 3 was l onger needed. oThe last observation carried forward method for handling missing data was removed; other methods for missing data are included and considered more appropriate for the analysis. The rem ainder of the changes to the protocol were added to improve clarit y. oThe fo llowing changes were made to the Section 2(Schedule o f Activities [SOA]) :"

However, if a patient experiences a flare and meets criteria for retreatment, the patient will be retreated with the ixekizumab treatment regimen (ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W) that he or she was receiving prior to withdrawal to evaluate whether the patient can regain his or her original response. During the Long -Term Extension Period, patients in Group B receiving ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W may also have their dose escalated to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W if the investigator determines that the patient may benefit from an increase in frequency of dosing to achieve adequate disease control. Escalatio n to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W may occur only after the patient has been retreated upon flare with the ixekizumab treatment regimen received during Period1 (ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W )for at least 12 weeks. Statistical Analysis: The analy sis for all continuous efficacy and health outcome variables will be made using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment, baseline v alue, geographic region, and originating study in the model. Missing data will be imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) or modified baseline observation carried forward (mBOCF). Type III sums of squares for the least -squares (LS) means wi ll be used for the statistical comparison; the 95% CI will also be reported."

Section 5.2. Number of Participants It is estimated that approximately 750 pati ents will enter the long -term extensio n study (RHBY) after com pletion of studies RHBV, RHBW, or RHBX. This sample size is est imated based on the 1-year retention rates fro m ixekizumab Ps studies and fro m 1secukinumab rad -axSpA study (Baeten et al. 2015), which had a retentio n rate of approximately 85%."
135,page_135,"I1F-MC-RHBY(a) Clinical Protocol Page 135 LY2439821Section 5.4 .Scientific Rationale for Study Design The l ength of the rando mized withdrawal period is 10 m onths 40weeks and considered sufficient ly long based on previous rando mized withdrawal studies of TNF inhibitors in RA and axSpA ( Haibel et al . 2008 ;Barkham et al. 2009; Haibel et al. 2010; Sieper et al . 2014 ;Smolen et al. 2014). It is ant icipated that the majorit y of patients who no longer receive active treatment will relapse within that time frame. Patients who do notmeet entr y criteria for randomized -withdrawal by Week 24 (ant icipated to be approximately 70% of the 750 pati ents) will continue to receive their act ive treatment regimen during the remainder of the study (Group A). Patients receiving ixekizumab 80mg Q4W may have their dose escalated to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W if the invest igator determines that the patient may benefi t from an increase in frequency of dosing to achieve adequate disease control. Patients who have their dose escalated will continue on ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W for the remainder of Peri od 3. A repeat x-ray of the cervical and lumbar spine will be taken at Week 56 in Study RHBY (approximately 2 years after baseline of the originating study ) to eval uate the potenti al effect of ixekizumab treatment on structural progressi on. The x-rayat Week 56is only needed for patients ini tially enrolled in Studi es RHBV or RHBW (see Schedule of Act ivities, Section 2). As structural progression in axSpA is slow, a 2- year time interval between consecut ive x-rays is appropriate for such evaluat ionin pat ients with radiographic axSpA and avoi ds radi ographic overexposure for patients.

Discussio n of the timing of discontinuat ion from study treatm ent and from the study is provi ded in Sect ion 9.4.10.2 . Section 9.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessments As described in Section 10.3.3.1 , the primary efficacy endpoint is the proporti on of patients in the randomized withdrawal populat ionwho do not experience a flare ( a flare i s defined as ASDAS ≥2.1 at 2 consecut ive visits, or ASDAS >3.5 at any visit during Per iod 2). The ASDAS is a co mposite index to assess disease activit y in axSpA (Machado et al .2011a, 2011b; Zochling 2011). The parameters use d for the ASDAS (wi th high sensit ivity C-reactive protein [CRP] as acute phase reactant) are the fo llowing: 1)Total back pain (BASDAI quest ion 2) 2)Patient gl obal assessment (Section 9.1.2.4 ) 3)Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI question 3) 4)Durati on of morning stiffness (BASDAI quest ion 6) 5)CRP in mg/L The ASDAS crpis calculated with the fo llowing equati on: 0.121 6× total back pain + 0.110 6× patient gl obal + 0.073 6 × peripheral pain/swelling + 0.0586 × duration of morning st iffness + 0.579 6× Ln(CRP+1) (Machado et al. 2015).

Section 10.3.1.5.2. Modified Nonresponder Imputation for Clinical Response Analysis of categorical efficacy and healt h outcome variables for long -term ixekizumab treatm ent analysis will be assessed using a modified nonresponder imputation (mNRI) m ethod. Patients will be considered as nonresponders if they discont inue study drug due to a flare, an AE , or lack of efficacy . For patients discont inuing study drug for any other reason, the data will be imputed using mult iple imputation method (as descr ibed in Sect ion10.3.1.5.4 ). Patients without at least 1 observation will also be defined as nonresponders for the mNRI analysis. Section 10.3.1.5.4 . Last Observation Carried Forward An LOCF analysis will be performed on select ive continuous efficacy and healt h outcom es variables. This approach is ident ical to the mBOCF approach, with 1 except ion: for patients discontinuing study drug bec ause of an AE, the last nonmissing postbaseline observation before discontinuat ion will be carri ed forward to the corresponding endpoint for evaluation."

Multiple Imputation Analysis of cont inuous efficacy and healt h outcome variables for long -term ixekizumab treatm ent analysis will be assessed using mult iple imputation method. In the multiple imputation analyses, missing data will be imputed so as to estimate what observat ions woul d have been if the pati ent had not discontinued. Specifically , multi ple imputati onis the partial imputation of non-monotone missing data using Markov chain Monte Carlo method with the simple imputation model, followed by a sequent ial regressio n imputatio n with the baseline score. Section 10.3.2.2 . Patient Characteristics Patient characterist ics and baseline clinical measures will be summarized for each treatm ent period. Base line characterist ics will include gender, age, age category , wei ght, race, geographic region, originat ing study , abnorm al/norm al CRP. Baseline cli nical measurements m ay include BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI, chest expansio n, Fat igue NRS, Patient Global NRS, total back pain, spinal pain at night, spinal pain, inflammat ion, MASES, enthesit is SPARCC, TJC, and SJC. Section 10.3.2.3 . Concomitant Therapy Previous and concomitant medicat ions will be summarized for pati ents who enter each treatment period and will be pres ented by WHO Anatomic Therapeut ic Class Level 4 and WHO preferred term. Conco mitant DMARDs, conco mitant corti costeroids, and concomitant NSAIDs will also be summarized. Treatment group comparisons in Period 2 will be conducted using Fisher’s exact test. Section 10.3.2.4 . Treatment Compliance Treatment compliance wit h investigational product will be summarized for pati ents who enter each treatment period . A patient will be considered overall co mpliant for each study period if he/she is missing no more than 20% of the expected doses, does not miss 2 consecut ive doses, and does not over -dose ( i.e., take m oreinjections at the same time point than specified in the protocol ). Section 10.3.3.2. Major Secondary A nalyses The 2 -year radiographic progression re flected by change fro m baseline of originating studies RHBV and RHBW to Week 56 of Study RHBY ( Group A: Visit 9/Group B: Visit 513 ) will be measured by mSASSS score and summarized by treatment. The comparison of the ixekizumab treatm ent group to the historical control will be analyzed by ANCOVA, wi th baseline score as covari ate. The historical control will be defined in the SAP. The historical control aims to include both the Outcome in AS International Study (OASIS cohort; van der Heijde et al. 2005) and the German SpA Incept ion Cohort (GESPIC; Reveille et al. 2012). Within-treatm ent changes fro m baseline alo ng with 95% CI will be assessed by a pa ired t -test using the LS means."
