There is preliminary evidence fro m the treatm ent-resistant subpopul ation in the Phase 3 migraine studi esthat gal canezumab may be efficacious and well -tolerated in these patients. Study CGAW will include up to 6 months on galcanezumab (3 months of double -blind treatm ent and 3 m onths of open -label treatm ent). Objectives/Endpoints: Objectives Endpoints Primary Objective To test the hypothesis that galcanezumab is superior to placebo in the prevention of migraine in patients with treatment -resistant migraineThe overall mean change from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days during the 3-mo nth double -blind treatment phase in the total population (episodic and chronic migraine)a Key Secondary Objectives Note: Allkey secondary objectives will be tested in both the total population (episodic and chronic migraine) and the episodic migraine subpopulation unless otherwise specified.The specific methodology (including testing order and populatio n) for the tests of the following keysecondary endpoints will be specified in t he statistical analysis plan: To compare galcanezumab with placebo with respect to prevention of migraine inthe episodic migraine subpopulationThe overall mean change from baseline in the number of monthly migr aine headache days during the 3-month double -blind treatment phase in patients with episodic migraine To compare galcanezumab with placebo with respect to 50% response rateThe percentage of patients with ≥50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine headache days during the 3-month double -blind treatment phase To compare galcanezumab with placebo with respect to change in functio ningThe m ean change from baseline in the Role Function - Restrictive domain score of the Migraine -Specific Quality of Life Q uestionnaire version 2.1 (MSQ v2.1) at Month 3 To compare galcanezumab with placebo with respect to 75% response rateThe percentage of patients with ≥75% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine headache days during the 3-month double -blind treatment phase To compare galcanezumab with placebo with respect to 100% response rateThe percentage of patients with 100% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine headache days during the 3-month double -blind treatment phase aEpisodic migraine is defined as 4 to 14 migraine headache days and <15headache days per 30-day period in the prospective baseline period.

9,page_9,"I5Q-MC-CGAW Clinical Protocol Page 9 galcanezumab (LY2951742)Summary of Study Design: Study CGAW isa multicenter, randomized, double- blind, parallel, placebo -controlled study of galcanezumab in patients who meet International Classificat ion of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria for a diagnosis o f migraine with or without aura or chroni c migraine ,and who have previously failed 2 to 4 standard -of-care treatm ents f or migraine prevent ion. The study has 4periods, including a prospective baseline periodto determine pat ient eligibilit y. Treatment Arms and Duration: Two treatm ent arms: galcanezumab (120 m g/month, with a 240 -mg loading dose) and placebo. Following a 1-mont h prospective baseline period, eligible patients will be rando mized in a 1:1ratio to receive placebo or gal canezumab for up to 3months of doubl e -blind treatment. Invest igational product is administered as 1 or 2 subcutaneous injections per month (2 inject ions of 120-mg galcanezumab or 2 inject ions of pl acebo at randomizat ion; 1 inject ion of 120-mg galc anezumab or 1 inject ion of placebo at the subsequent double -blind dosing visits) . Patients who com plete the doubl e-blind treatm ent phase may enter a 3-month open -label treatm entphase. At the first dosing visit in the open -label treatm ent phase, p atients previously assigned to placebo will receive a n initialloading dose of galcanezumab 240 m g(2 injections of 120 mg each) ,while patients previ ously assigned to gal canezumab will receive 1 inject ion of120-mg galcanezumab and 1 inject ion of placebo to reta in blinding of dose assignment from the doubl e -blind phase. Thereafter, all patients in the open -label treatm ent phase will receive 120 m g/month galcanezumab. Number of Patients : The study will screen an est imated 764potential study participants to ensure randomization of approximately 420 patients withmigraine , of which approximately 250patients have episodic migraine . Statistical Analysis: Unless otherwise specified, analyses will be conducted on an intent -to-treat (ITT) populat ion, which includes all pat ients who are randomized and receive at least one dose of invest igational product. Patients in the ITT populat ion will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they are randomized. When change from baseline is assessed, the patient will be included in the analysis only if he/she has a baseline and a postbaseline measurement. The primary analysis will evaluate the efficacy of galcanezumab compared wi th placebo on the overall mean change from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days during the 3-month double -blind treatment phase. Migraine headache day isdefined to include both migraine and probable migraine days. The primary analysis will be performed using a restricted maximum likel ihood- based mixed model repeated measures technique."

Study Rationale The purpose of Study I5Q-MC-CGAW (CGAW )is to assess the efficacy and safet y of galcanezumab (LY2951742) in a treatment -resistant patient populat ion with episodi c or chroni c migraine. Treatment resistance, in this study , will be defined as previous failure to respond to 2to 4 different standard -of-care migraine prevent ive medicat ions eit her due to inadequate efficacy and/or due to safet y/tolerabilit y reasons (see Section 6.1for further details) . The efficacy and safet y of galcanezumab have previously been established in three Phase 3 clinical trials ( Study I5Q-MC-CGAG [CGAG] and Study I5Q-MC-CGAH [CGAH] for episodic migraine and Study I5Q-MC-CGAI [CGAI] for chronic migraine) . Subgroup analyses in those patients with at least 2prior migraine prevent ive treatment failures due to efficacy alo ne (prespecified) or efficacy and/or safet y/tolerabili ty reasons (post hoc) have indicate dclinically meaningful impr ovements in m ultiple outcom es.However, the Phase 3 studies excluded pat ients who had failed medicat ions from 3 or more classes of migraine prevent ives dueto inadequate efficacy among those m edicat ions wi th Level A or Level B evidence (defined as those listed in Silberstein et al . [2012] or botulinum toxin A or B ). Study CGAW will thusenable a comprehensive clinical assessment of galcanezumab in a broade rtreatm ent-resistant pati ent populat ion, including patients who may potentially have failed up to 4 different classes of standard -of- care migraine prevent ives. Treatment resistance is more prevalent am ong pati ents wi th chronic migraine than episodi c;however ,the epi sodic form of migraine (i e,4 to 14 migraine headache days and fewer than 15 headache days per month) is the most comm on, with approximately 7% of the migraine populat ion suffering fro m the chronic form (ie,at least 15 headache days per m onth, of which at l east 8 are migraine ) (Buse et al. 2012; Katsarava et al. 2012; Blumenfeld et al. 2013; ICHD -3 201 8).Therefore, th ere is a need to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of galcanezumab in a treatment -resistant popul ation, as well as specific ally address for the episodic populat ion.Study CGAW will include up to 6 months on galcanezumab (3months of double -blind treatment and 3 months of open -label treatm ent). 3.2. Background Migraine is a chronic, debilitat ing neurological disease found to be one of the top 10causes of disabili ty worldwide (Vos et al . 2012 ). Despite the availabilit y of prevent ive medicat ions for migraine, many pat ients do not respond to these treatments or are unable to tolerate them . Research on treatment patterns indicate that, am ong all prevent ive medicat ion users in the United States, Germany, France, and Japan, approximately 43% have a history of previ ous prevent ive medicat ion failure or of switching treatments (Pike et al. 2016). Among patients with episodi c or chroni c migraine who are undergoing oral prevent ive treatment, side effects and a lack of efficacy are the m ost comm on reasons for di scont inuat ion (Bl umenfeld et al . 2013). Among patients whose disease is not adequately managed, the negat ive impact on patient f unctioning increases, leading to losses in work /school and home productivit y, missing or restrict ing family andsocialactivities, and an overall decrease in qualit y oflife(Blumenfeld et al . 2011; Lantéri - Minet et al . 2011; Bagley et al . 2012; Abu Bakar et al. 2016). Another indicator of the disabling"
16,page_16,"I5Q-MC-CGAW Clinical Protocol Page 16 galcanezumab (LY2951742)nature of the inadequate treatment of migraine is health care resource utilizat ion (Shah et al. 2013; Messali et al. 2016). The number of outpatient visits isgreater am ong pati ents wi th migraine compared to patients without migraine , and the direct costs associated with health care resource utilizat ion are even greater among patients with a history of switching and discontin uing mul tiple migraine prevent ive treatment s(Bonafede et a l. 2017; Ford et al. 2017; Raval and Shah 2017). Therefore, new treatment options are needed, particularly for those patients who have previously failed m ultiple prevent ive medicat ions. Calciton in gene -related pepti de(CGRP) is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide widely expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous sy stem . Ca lcitonin gene -related pepti deis implicated in the pathophysio logy of migraine and is hypothesized to be invo lved in the release of inflammatory mediators and the transmissio n ofnociceptive (pain) information fro m intracranial blood vessels to the nervous system (Villal ón and Olesen 2009). In individuals wit h migraine , serum concen trations of CGRP are significant ly elevated during migraine attacks (Goadsby et al . 1990; Goadsby and Edvinsson 1993), and infusio n of CGRP to individuals wit h a history of migraine can trigger migraine attacks (Lassen et al. 1998, 2002). The binding of CGRP with antibodi es has been shown to prevent its biological activit y; thus, these ant ibodies represent a promising pharmaco logicapproach for the prevention of migraine . 3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment Galcanezumab is a humanized mo noclonal antibody that potently and select ively binds t o CGRP andprevents i ts biological activity without bl ocking the CGRP receptor . The efficacy o f galcanezumab for the prevent ion of migraine has been demonstrated in three Phase 3 rando mized, double -blind trials which found statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reduct ion of monthly migraine headache days and improvement in patient funct ion compared to pl acebo in pati ents wi th episodi c and chronic migraine. Across Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies in patients wi th migraine, galcanezumab exhibited a favorable safet y profile at doses up to 300 mg every 4 weeks for 3 m onths, or 240 m g monthly for up to 1 y ear. The incidences of serious adverse events (SAEs) and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were l ow,and treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were generally o f mild to moderate severit y. In the Phase 3 studies, the most commo nly reported TEAEs were inject ion site pain and inject ion site reaction s, also generally of mild tomoderate severit y. There was no evidence of an effect on cardiovascular funct ion.These data provide a favorable benefit -risk profile for galcanezumab for migraine prevent ion. More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, SAEs ,and reasonably anticipated AE s of galcanezumab are to be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB)."

23,page_23,"I5Q-MC-CGAW Clinical Protocol Page 23 galcanezumab (LY2951742)Patients are requi red to di scont inue all excluded medicat ions or treatments for migraine prevent ion at l east 5 day sprior to Vi sit 2. Botulinum toxin A or B in the head or neck area for therapeuti c use must be discontinued at least 3months prior to Visit 2. Nerve blocks or devi ce use, such as transcranial magnet ic stimulation,in the head or neck area or for migraine prevent ion arenot allowed wit hin 30 days before Vi sit 2. The screening visit (Visit 1) will consist of a full clinical assessment, including a comprehensive medical evaluat ion docum enting medical history , and a physical and neuro logical examinat ion (see Schedule of Act ivities, Secti on 2) . Visit 1 will be com plete when the l ast scheduled procedure of the sc reening assessment for the patient is completed. Study Period II : Qualified pat ients will enter Study Period II (prospective baseline) to determine their eligibilit y for the study and to establish baseline data for comparison of endpoints during the dou ble-blind treatment phase . Beginning at Visit 2, pati ents will log in daily to the electroni c pat ient-reported outcomes (ePRO) system to answer questions about the occurrence of headaches, headache duration, headache features, severit y of headache, and whether any acute headache medicat ionwas taken . Also beginning at Visit 2, patients will record the name, dose, and date of any acute headache medicat ion on a headache medication log which will be returned to site staff at each study visit. At the end of the prospective baseline period, sites will be notified whether their pat ients met criteria and are eligible to be randomized at Visit 3. To avoid biased reporting, patients must not be told the number of migraine or headache days on which study qualificat ion is based. Study Period III : At the start of the 3 -month double -blind treatment phase (Visit 3), patients meet ing all eligibilit y requi rements will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 120mg/month galcanezumab (wi th an ini tial 240-mg loading dose) or placebo . At Vi sit 3, if available and where local regulat ions and ethical review b oards (ERBs) allow, patients will also watch a training video designed to address patient expectatio ns wit h regard to participation in a placebo - controlled trial and the difference between medical treatment and research. To preserve blinding, patients in both treatment groups will receive 2 inject ions of invest igational product at the first dosing visit (2 galcanezumab inject ions of 120 mg or 2 placebo inject ions) and the n 1injection o f investigational product (120 -mg galcanezumab or placebo) for the next 2 dosing visits. The patient will be considered enrolled in the study when rando mizat ion occurs. During this phase, study procedures at dosing visits must always occu r prior to the pati ent receiving their assigned treatment. Patients will be given invest igational product ( galcanezumab or placebo) inject ions during office visits(Figure CGAW .1). For both treatm ent groups, invest igational product will be administered by subcutaneous inject ion once monthly at the dosing visits. Patients will cont inue to log in and complete the ePRO diary each day . Pati ents m ay con tinue to take their allowed acute migraine headache medicat ion (wi th some limitations; see Secti on 7.7) during the treatment phase and will continue to record this use ."
24,page_24,"I5Q-MC-CGAW Clinical Protocol Page 24 galcanezumab (LY2951742)Patients will receive thei r last doubl e-blind dose of invest igational product at Visit 5. Patients who do not opt to conti nue into Study Period IV will receive no further inject ions. Study Period IV : Pati ents who com plete the double -blind treatment phase (Study Period III) can opt to enter an open -label treatment phase (Study Period IV) for 3months of treatment with galcanezumab . Sites and pat ients will remain blinded to patients’ previous treatment assignments. In order to preserve that blind but to allow for a loading dose to be administered to previous placebo patients, all pat ients who enter th e open -label treatment phase will receive 2injections at Visit 6, and sites and patients will remain blinded to the dose administered at Visit6; pati ents previ ously assigned to gal canezumab will receive 1 inject ion of 120 mg and 1injection o f placebo, while those patients pre viously assigned to placebo will receive an init ial loading dose of gal canezumab 240 mg (2inject ions of 120 mg each) . Injections administered after Visi t 6 will be unblinded to dose as all pat ients will be receiving 120 mg/mont h galcanezumab at the next 2 dosing visits (Visit 7 and Visit 8). Patients will continue to have efficacy and safety assessed, including daily completion of the ePRO di ary and recording of acute headache medication use (see Schedule of Activit ies, Secti on 2). 5.2. Number of Participants The study will screen an est imated 764potential study participants to ensure randomization of approximately 420patients withmigraine , of which approximately 250 patients have episodic migraine (defined as 4 to 14 migraine headache days and <15headache days per 30 -day period in the prospective baseline period) . To ensure an appropriate balance of patients with episodi c and chronic migraine, the sponsor will stop enrollment of pat ients with chronic migraine if the number of patients exceeds approximately 40%. Chronic migraine will be defined as at least 15headache days per 30 -day period in the prospective baseline period, of which at l east 8 are migraine. Further details are available in Sect ion 10.1. 5.3. End of Study Definition End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule o f Activities(Secti on 2) for the last patient . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design The l ength of the rando mized, double - blind treatment phase (3 months) is considered a sufficient durati on to demonstrate the efficacy of a migraine prevent ive medicat ionversus placebo given the mechanism and observed onset of act ion for CGRP ant ibodies (Dodick et al . 2014a, 2014b). Furtherm ore, a pl acebo -controlled study with a durati on longer than 3 m onths may not be tolerated by patients suffering fro m chroni c migraine. A 3- month open -label extensio n is included to allow for assessment of mainte nance of effect and longer -term safet y. The use of a placebo -controlled study is considered to be appropriate ,as major treatment guidelines rely on placebo -controlled data as the gold standard for establishing levels of evidence in support of treatment efficacy (eg, European Federation of Neurological Societ ies[Evers et al . 2009], Amer ican Academy o f Neurol ogy[Silberstein et al. 2012] )."

Justification for Dose In the adult Phase 3 migraine studies, the dose regi men of 120 mg/mo nth with a 240 -mg loading dose was foundto be efficacious and safe for the prevent ion of migraine in adult patients . A loading dose of 240 mg resulted in achievement of steady -state concentrations for the 120 -mg monthly maintenance dose by Month 1."

Assignment to treatm ent groups w ill be determined by a computer -generated random sequence using an interactive web -response system (IWRS). The IWRS will be used to assi gn doubl e-blind investigat ional product to each patient during the double -blind treatment phase. TheIWRS will also be used to assign invest igational product during the open -label treatm ent"
32,page_32,"I5Q-MC-CGAW Clinical Protocol Page 32 galcanezumab (LY2951742)phase. Site personnel will confirm that they have located the correct ly assigned package by entering the confirmat ion number found on the package into the IWRS. To achieve between -group comparabilit y, the randomizat ion will be stratified by country and migraine frequency fromthe prospective baseline period (low frequency episodi c, high frequency episodi c,chronic) . Low frequency episodic will be defined as 4 to <8migraine headache days per 30 -day period. Hi gh frequency episodic will be defined as 8 to 14 migraine headache days per 30 -day period, wi th <15 headache days (migraine or nonmigraine) per 30- day period. Chroni c migraine will be defined as ≥8 migraine headache days per 30 -day period, wi th ≥15 headache days (migraine or nonmigraine) per 30 -day period. To ensure an appropriate balance of patients with episodic and chronic migraine, t he sponsor will stop enrollment of patients wi th chroni c migraine if the number of patients exceeds approximately 40%. 7.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses This is a fixed -dose study . The actual time of all dose administrations will be recorded in the patient’s eCRF. Invest igational product inject ions are to be administered after all other study procedures are completed for the given visit. 7.3. Blinding This is a double -blind study . Blinded crossover to an open -label treatment phase is included in this study . To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly personnel will see the rando mizat ion table and treatment assignment s before the study is complete. After the reporting database is locked for statist ical analysis of the double -blind treatment phase, a limited number of sponsor personnel will be unblinded to comple te the study report and prepare for submissio n. However, any sponsor personnel cont inuing with the management and oversight of the trial will remain blinded to patients’ previous treatment assignment. Emergency unblinding for AEs m ay be perform ed through the IWRS . This option may be used ONLY if the patient’swell-being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment. All unblinding event sare recorded and reported by the IWRS . If an invest igator, si te personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, the patient must be discont inued fro m the study . In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient remain in the study , the investigator must obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly clinical research physician or clinical research scient ist for the pati ent to continue in the study . In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment is warranted for medical management of the event. Patient safet y must al ways be the first considerat ion in making such a determinat ion. If a patient’s treatm ent assi gnment i s unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately . If the invest igator decides that unblinding is warranted, it is the responsibilit y of the investi gator to prom ptly docum ent the decisio n and rat ionale and notify Lilly as soon as possible."

Appendix 2 lists the l aboratory tests that will be performed for this study . Unless otherwise stated in the subsect ions below, all samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroy ed wi thin 60 days of rece ipt of confi rmed test resul ts. Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory certificati on standards. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessments ePRO Di ary: Pati ents w ill be asked to use an ePRO device to record headache informat ion, including report ingheadaches, intensit y of headache ,headache features , and whether any acute headache medicat ion was taken. The sy stem also will be used to collect informat ion about migraine -associated symptoms (eg, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and/or vomit ing). 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments Secondary efficacy assessments in this study (Table CGAW .2) are intended to facilitate the collect ion and analysis of informat ion such as response ( ≥50% reduction fro m baseline in the number of migraine headache days per month) and changes in medicat ion use for the acute treatm ent of heada che. Much o f this informat ion will be provided by the ePRO diary ; however, details o f acute headache medicat ion use will be captured by a headache medicat ion logand reported at monthly site visits . The scale to be used for secondary efficacy assessment is summarized below. Patient Global Impression of Severity Scale: The Patient Gl obal Im pressi on of Severi ty (PGI-S)scale (Guy 1976) is a patient -rated instrument that measures illness severit y. For this study , the pati ent will be instructed as fo llows: “Consi dering migraine as a chronic condit ion, how woul d you rate y our level of illness?” The PGI -S includes a range of possible responses, from 1 (“norm al, not at all ill”) to 7 (“extrem ely ill”). 9.1.3. Appropriateness of Assessments Theefficacy and safet y assessments used in this study have been well documented and are generally regarded as reliable, accurate, and relevant in this patient populat ion.

Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patientswho have entered this study and for al erting Lilly or its design ee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of patientsduring the study. Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report and ECG . The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused the patientto discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patientshoul d be f ollowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. The frequency o f follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. However, any worsening of the primary study condit ion shoul d be recorded as an AE. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via e CRF the occurrence and nature of each patient ’s pre -exist ing condit ions, including clinically significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in th e study . In addit ion, site personnel will record via eCRF any change in the condit ion(s) and any new condit ions as AEs . Invest igators should record their assessment of the potenti al relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure or invest igational product via eCRF . The invest igator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, study device, or a study procedure, taki ng into account the disease, concomitant treatment , and pathologies. A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there potentially is a cause and effect relat ionship between the invest igational product, study device ,and/or study procedure and the AE. The invest igator will answer yesor no when making this assessment. The invest igator will use AE fo llow-up forms to record addit ional details regarding AEs related to injection sites and hypersensit ivity events. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient ’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF , clarifying if possible the circumstances leading to discont inuat ion of treatment. 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es:"
40,page_40,"I5Q-MC-CGAW Clinical Protocol Page 40 galcanezumab (LY2951742)death initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion a life- threatening experience ( ie, immediate ri sk of dying) persistent or signific ant di sabili ty/incapacit y congenital ano maly/birth defect important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitali zation but m ay jeopardi ze the patient or m ay require intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above. Examples of such m edical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at hom e, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the d evelopment of drug dependency or drug abuse. when a condit ion related to the invest igational device ( eg, prefilled syringe ) necessitates medical or surgical intervent ion to preclude eit her perm anent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a bo dy structure, the serious outcom e of “requi red intervent ion” will be assigned. All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF and assessed for serious criteria. The SAE reporting to the sponsor begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the SAE should be reported to the sponsor as per SAE reporting requirements and t imelines (see Section9.2) if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official notificati on on study -specific SAE forms. This 24-hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informati on and all fo llow -up SAE inform ation. Patients with a serious hepat ic AEshoul d have addi tional data collected using the eCRF. Pregnancy ( during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements, any pregnancy that occurs during the study , including those in which conceptio n occurred within 5 months after last administration of invest igational product, should be reported following the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus . Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in patientsonce they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the patientdisposit ion eCRF has been co mpleted). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patienthas been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Lil ly."

Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery system s used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study parti cipants, m onitor quali ty, and f acilitate process and product improvements. Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product (or drug delivery system such as a prefilled syringe) so that the situation can be assessed. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose Refer to the IB. 9.4. Safety 9.4.1. Electrocardiograms For each patient, a single 12-lead di gital ECG will be co llected according to the Schedule o f Activities (Secti on 2). Electrocardi ograms shoul d be collected pri or to bl ood draws and dosing. Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collect ion and remain supine but awake during ECG collect ion. Electrocardi ograms will have a central overread and shoul d be recorded according to the study -specific recommendat ions included in the ECG manual. Any clinically significant findings from ECGs that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose o f the invest igational treatment s hould be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF . 9.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs will include body temperature, bl ood pressure, and pulse. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured as a single measurement in the sitting posit ion prior to bl ood draws and dosing , according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2) and fo llowing the study -specific recommendat ions included intheManual of Operations for the study .

Laboratory Tests For each patient, l aboratory tests detailed in Appendix 2 shoul d be conducted accordi ng to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2) . Any clinically significant findings from laboratory tests that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the pati ent receives the first dose of invest igatio nal product should be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF . In addit ion, an immunogenicit y blood sample will be collected, when possible, for any patient who experiences a serious potenti al systemic hypersensit ivityevent during the study as judged by the investigator. This immunogenicit y blood sample should be co llected immediately or as soon as possible, taking into considerat ion the availabilit y and well-being of the pati ent. Exact date and time of the samp le shoul d be recorded on the laboratory requisi tion form. Lilly or its desi gnee will provide the investi gator wi th the resul ts of laboratory tests analyzed by a central vendor. Note that any anti -drug ant ibody result that may unblind a site would not be shared. 9.4.4. Immunogenicity Assessments Immunogenicit y will not be proactively evaluated in this study . However, where local regul ations and ERBs allo w, a single venous blood sample will be collected prior to the start of treatm entas specified in the Schedule o f Activities (Secti on2)and stored for future immunogenicit y assessments, if applicable. Immunogenicit y samples may also be collected from a patient in the event of a serious potenti al systemic hypersensit ivity event ,as noted in Secti on 9.4.3 . Samples will be retained for a m aximum o f 15 years after the last patient visit for the study , or for a shorter peri od if local regulations and ERBs allow, at a facilit y selected by the sponsor. The durati on allows the sponsor to respond to future regulatory requests rel ated to galcanezumab . Any samples remaining after 15 years will be destroy ed. 9.4.5. Safety Monitorin g Invest igators are responsible for monitoring individual pat ient safety throughout the tri al. Neurol ogical examinat ions will be conducted in order to assess f or any signs of pre -exist ing or treatm ent-emergent neurological abnorm alities such as stroke or other cerebrovascular events. Lilly will periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate blinded methods. 9.4.5.1. Hepatic Safety Monitoring If a study patient experiences elevated ALT ≥3X ULN, ALP ≥2X ULN, or elevated TBL ≥2X ULN, liver testing ( Appendix 4 ) shoul d be repeated wi thin 3 to5 days including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, direct bilirubin , gamma- glutamyl transferase, and creat ine kinase to confirm the abnorm ality and to determine if it is increasing or decreasing.

Whole Blood Sample for Pharmacogenetic Research A whole blood sam ple will be collected for pharmacogenet ic analysis as specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on2)where local regulat ions and ERBs allow. Samples will notbe used to conduct unspecified disease or populat ion genet ic research either now or in the future. Samples will be used to investigate variable response to galcanezumab and to invest igate genet ic variants thought to play a role in migraine. Assessment of variable response may include evaluat ion of AEs or differences in efficacy . These studies may include , but are not limited to ,CGRP and mo lecules that directly and indirect ly influence CGRP signaling to eval uate thei r associati on wi th observed response t o galcanezumab. All pharm acogenet ic samples will be coded with the pat ient number. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patient only by the invest igator site personnel .

Health Economics Health outcom e measures of galcanezumab in pat ients with migraine will be co llected as described in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2) based on the fo llowing scales: Migraine -Specific Quality of Life Q uestionnaire version 2.1: The Migraine -Specific Qualit y of Life Questionnaire versio n 2.1 ( MSQ v2.1 )is a self-administered healt h status i nstrument that was developed to address the physical and emotional impact on funct ioning that is of specific concern to individuals suffering fro m migraine headaches .The instrument consists of 14 items that address 3 dom ains: (1) Rol e Funct ion-Restrictive ;(2) Rol eFunct ion-Preventive; and (3) Emotional Funct ion (Jhingran et al. 1998b) . The restrict ive do main specifically measures disabili ty as related to the impact on performance of normal activit ies, wi th the preventive domain addressing co mplete funct ional impairment and the emotional do main assessing the feelings related to disablin g monthly migraine headache days .Responses are given using a"
45,page_45,"I5Q-MC-CGAW Clinical Protocol Page 45 galcanezumab (LY2951742)6-point Likert -type scale, ranging fro m “none o f the time” to “all o f the time .” Raw scores for each dom ain are com puted as a sum of item responses, wi th the collect ive sum providing a total raw score that is then converted to a 0 to 100 scal e, wi th higher scores indicating a better health status , and a positive change in scores reflecting funct ional improvement (Jhingran et al. 1998a; Martin et al. 2000). The instrument was designed with a 4 -week recall period and is considered reliable, valid, and sensit ive to change in functional impairment due to migraine ( Jhingran et al . 1998b; Bagley et al. 2012 ). Migraine Disability Assessment : The Migraine Di sabili ty Assessment (MIDAS )is a pat ient- rated scale which was designed to quantify heada che-related disabilit y over a 3 -month peri od. This instrument consists of 5items that reflect the number of days reported as missed , or wi th reduced productivit y at work or home and social even ts. Each questi on is answered as the number of days during the past 3 months of assessment, ranging from 0 to 90, with the total score being the summat ion of the 5numeric responses. A higher value is indicat ive of more disabili ty (Stewart et al. 1999 , 2001). This instrument is considered highly reliable and valid , and is correlated with clinical judgment regarding the need for medical care (Stewart et al. 1999, 2001) . For clinical interpretabilit y,4categori cal grades were developed based on the total score : Grade I (0to 5) is for little or no disabilit y, Grade II (6to 10)is for mild disabilit y, Grade III (11to 20) isfor moderate di sabili ty,andGrade IV (21+ ) isfor severe disabilit y. The severe disabili ty category has subsequently been subdivided into Grade IV -A (severe [ 21 to 40]) and Grade IV -B (very severe [ 41 to 270]) because a high proportion of patients with chronic migraine are in Grade IV (Blumenfeld et al. 2011). Health Care Resource Utilization and Employment Status : The Health Care Resource Utilizat ionquest ionnaire (HCRU )will be so licited by study personnel while document ing pat ient responses. The HCRU consists o f 3 questions, asking about the number of hospi talemergen cy room visits, overnight stays in a hospital, and any other visits with a healt hcare professional that occurred since the pati ent’s last study visit,outsi de of visits associated with their participat ion in the clinical trial . Pati ents are al so specifically a sked about the number of healt hcare events that are related to migraine headaches . The baseline visit will include the same quest ions, however with the f rame of reference being over the last 6 months . A question on emplo yment status will also be solicited, given the correlat ion and potential confounding with healt h outcom es measures. Migraine Interictal Burden Scale : The 4-item Migraine Interi ctal Burden Scale (MIBS -4) measures the burden related to headache in the time between attacks. The self -administered instrum ent consi sts of 4items that address disruption at work and school, diminished family and social life, difficul ty planning, and emot ional difficult y. The questionnaire specifically asks about the effect of the disease over the p ast 4 weeks on day s without a headache attack . Response opti ons include :don’t know/not applicable, never, rarely , som e of the time, m uch of the tim e, or m ost or all o f the time. Each response has an associated numerical score, with the summat ion across all 4items resul ting in a total score ranging from 0 to 12, and the level of interictal burden being categorized into the following: 0 for none, 1 -2 mild, 3 -4 moderate ,and >5 severe (Buse et al. 2007, 2009)."

The questionnaire consists of 2 parts. The first part assesses 5 dimensio ns (m obilit y, self -care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort,and anxiet y/depressi on) that have 5 possible levels o f response ( no problems, slight problems, moderate pr oblems, severe problems, extreme problems ). This part of the EQ -5D-5L can be used to generate a health state index score, which is often used to compute qualit y-adjusted life years for utilization in health econo mic analyses. The health state index score is calculated based on the responses to the 5 dimensio ns, providing a single value on a scale fro m less than 0 (where zero i s a healt h state equivalent to death; negat ive values are valued as worse than dead ) to 1(perfect healt h), with higher scores indi cating better health ut ility. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analog scale (VAS) on which the patient rates their perceived healt h state from 0 ( the worst heal th you can imagine ) to 100 ( the best healt h you can imagine ). Work P roductivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire :The Work Productivit y and Activity Impairment Questionnai re (WPAI) is a patient -reported instrument developed to measure the impact on work productivit y and regular activit ies attributable to a speci fic health probl em(Reilly et al. 1993); for this study ,the questions are specific to migraine . Recall period is the past 7 days. The scale contains 6 i tems that measure: 1)employment status, 2) hours missed fro m work due to the specific healt h probl em, 3) hours missed fro m work for other reasons, 4) hours actually worked, 5) degree health affected productivit y while working, and 6) degree healt h affected productivit y in regular unpaid act ivities. Four scores are calculated fro m the responses to these 6 i tems: absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivit y loss, and activit y impairment. Scores are calculated as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicat ing greater impairment and less productivit y, ie, worse outcom es. CCI"

Eligible pat ients will be randomized in blinded fashio n in a 1:1 ratio to placebo or galcanezumab 120mg (with a loading dose of 240mg). Wit h the assumption of a 10% discont inuation rate and an effect size of 0. 39, it is estimated that this sample size will provide approximately 9 6% power that gal canezumab will separate from placebo at a 2-sided sign ificance level of 0.05 for the intent-to-treat (ITT) popul ation in this study . The study is also powered for the subpopulat ion of pati ents wi th episodi c migraine. The study will seek to enroll approximately 2 50patients with epi sodic migraine as determi ned during the prospective baseline period . With the assumpt ion of a 10% di scont inuat ion rate and an effect size of 0.46, i t is estimated that this will provide approximately 93% power that gal canezumab will separate fro m placebo at a 2-sided significance level o f 0.05 for the episodicmigraine subpopulati on in this study . Assumpt ions in this sample size calculation were based on data from 3doubl e -blind, pl acebo - controlled, Phase 3 studies, with anadjustm ent made to reflect differences in this study and the potenti al impact of the development phase and the inclusio n of an open -label treatment phase on placebo responses. 10.2. Populations for Analyses Three analysis populations are defined as fo llows:ITTpopulat ion, safet ypopul ation,andopen - label treatment populat ion. The ITT and safet y popul ations include a ll pat ients who are rando mized and receive at least one dose of invest igational product . The ope n-label treatment popul ation includes all pat ients who enter the open -label treatment phase as indicated by receiv ing any inject ion starting from Visit 6. Unless otherwise stated, all efficacy analyses will be analyzed according to the ITT principle on the ITT populat ion; that is, patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to whi chthey were randomized, regardless of whether they actually received a different treatment. Safet y analyses will beconducted on the safet y popul ation based on treatment the patient received . Analyses for the open -labeltreatm entphase only will be based onthe open -label treatm ent popul ation. 10.3. Statistical Analyses 10.3.1. General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis o f this study will be the responsibilit y of Lilly or i ts desi gnee. Details o f statist ical analysis methods will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) . Unless otherwise specified, analyses will be c onducted on the ITT populat ionfor efficacy analyses and on the safet y populati on for saf ety analyses (see Sect ion 10.2). When change fro m"
49,page_49,"I5Q-MC-CGAW Clinical Protocol Page 49 galcanezumab (LY2951742)baseline is assessed, the patient will be included in the analysis only if he/she has a baseline and a postbaseline measurement . Continuous efficacy variables with repeated measures will be analyzed using mixed model repeated m easures ( MMRM )methods. The MMRM will include the fixed categorical effects of treatm ent, baseline migraine headache day frequency category (low episodi c migraine, high episodic migraine, chronic migraine), pooled country , month, and treatment -by-month interact ion, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline and baseline -by-month interact ion. Forthe model of the primary endpoint , the baseline migraine headache day frequency category will be excluded from the covari ates since the cont inuous baseline mo nthly migraine headache day value is already in the model . For continuous efficacy variables without repeated measures, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA )model with last observat ion carri ed forward (LOCF )imputation will be used, which contain sthe main effects of treatment, baseline migraine headache day frequency category , and pooled country , as well as the continuous fixed covariate of baseline. Ty peIII sum -of-squares for the Least Squares Means (LSMeans) will be used for the statist ical comparisons. Binary efficacy variables with repeated m easures will be analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model (GLIMMIX) as pseudo -likelihood -based mixed effects repeated measures analysis . The GLIMMIX model will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, month, and treatm ent-by-month interacti on, as well as the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline value. For binary efficacy variables without repeated measures, comparisons between treatment g roups will be performed using logistic regressio ns with the same model terms as the ANCOVA model. Pooled country may be rem oved to ensure model convergence. For continuous safet y variables with repeated m easures, MMRM methods will be used , as well as an ANC OVA m odel with LOCF imputation if deemed appropriate . When an ANCOVA model is used for safet y measures, the model will contain the main effect of treatment, as well as the continuous fixed covariate of baseline. TypeIII sum -of-squares for the LSMe ans will be used for the statist ical co mpar isons. For categorical safet y variables (such as AEs and other categorical changes of interest), as well as categorical baseline characteristics, comparisons between treatment groups will be performed using Fisher ’s exact test . Treatment effects will be evaluated based on a 2 -sided significance level o f 0.05 for all the efficacy and safety analyses unless otherwise stated. The 95% confidence intervals for the difference in LSMeans between treatment groups will be presented. Type I error due to mult iple comparisons for the primary and key secondary objec tives will be controlled using sequent ial gating procedure (see Section 10.3.3.2 ).There will be n o adj ustments for multiplicity for analyses o f other data (other secondary object ives ortertiary object ives) . Unless otherwise noted, a ll efficacy and safety analyses will be conducted on the total popul ation and the episodic migraine subpopul ation."

Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol . Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the just ificat ion for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report or SAP. Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deem ed appropri ate. 10.3.2. Treatment Group Comparability 10.3.2.1. Patient Disposition The number and percentage of ITT patients who complete the study or di scontinue early will be tabul ated for all treatm ent groups for Study Period III and Study Period IV separately . Reasons fordiscont inuat ion will be co mpared between treatment groups for Study Period III wi th the ITT popul ation.

Treatment compliance for each patient in the double - blind treatment phase will be calculated as the number of completed scheduled dosing visits in which the patient receives an inject ion, divided by the number of completed scheduled dosing visits, includ ing any skipped dosing visits before the last dosing visit (Visit 5) or early discontinuat ion visit in the double -blind treatment phase. 10.3.2.5. Electronic Patient -reported Outcome Diary Compliance Electronic pat ient-reported outcomes diary co mpliance at each 1 -month peri od (incl uding baseline, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, … to Mon th 6) as well as for Study Period III overall (Month 1 through Month 3) will be calculated. Diary com pliance at each peri od is calculated as: Actualnumberofdiarydaysintheperiod Expected numberofdiarydaysintheperiod100 10.3.3. Efficacy Analyses 10.3.3.1. Primary Analyses The primary efficacy endpoint i s the overall mean change from the baseline period in the number of monthly migraine headache days during the 3 -month double -blind treatment phase, and the primary analys is will evaluate the efficacy of galcanezumab compared with placebo in the total ITT populat ion. The primary analysis will be performed using a restricted maximum likelihood -based MMRM technique. The analysis will include the fixe d categori cal effects of treatm ent, pooled country, month, and treatment -by-month interact ion, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline number of migraine headache days and baseline number of migraine headache days -by-month interact ion. An un structured covariance structure will be used to model wit hin-patient errors. The Kenward- Roger (Kenward and Roger 1997) approximat ion will be used to estimate deno minator degrees of freedo m. If the m odel does not converge with both the Hessian and the G matrix being positive definite under the default fitting algorithm used by PROC MIXED, the Fisher scoring algorithm will be implemented by specifying the SCORING option in SAS. If the model st ill fails to converge, the model will be fit using covariance m atrices o f the following order specified by a decreasing number of covariance parameters unt il convergence is met: Heterogeneous Toeplitz Heterogeneous First -order autoregressive Toeplitz First-order autoregressive When the unstructured covariance matrix is not utilized, the sandwich estimator (Diggle and Kenward 1994) will be used to estimate the standard errors of the fixed effects parameters. The sandwich est imator is implemented by specifying the EMPIRICAL option in SAS ®. When the"
52,page_52,"I5Q-MC-CGAW Clinical Protocol Page 52 galcanezumab (LY2951742)sandwich est imator is utilized, the Kenward -Roger approximat ion for denominator degrees of freedo m cannot be used. Instead, the deno minator degrees of freedo m will be partit ioned into between -subject and within -subject portions by the DDFM=BETWITHIN option in SAS ®. SAS ® PROC MIXED will be used to perform the analysis. 10.3.3.2. Key Secondary Analyses The key secondary measures (see Table CGAW .2) will be analyzed for the double -blind treatm entphase (Study Period III). The analysis models are described in Sect ion 10.3.1 . Popul ations tested will include the total population (episodic and chronic migraine co mbined) and the episodic migraine subpopulat ion. Patients will be categorized as episodic or chronic based on their number of migraine and headache days during the prosp ective baseline period. In order to control for ty pe I error, thekey secondary analyses will be tested using a gate d testing approach at a 2-sided alpha level o f 0.05. If the null hypothesis is rejected for the primary endpo int, key secondary endpo intswill be sequent ially tested fo llowing the gatekeeping hierarchy depicted in Figure CGAW. 2, starting wi th the com parison of change in migraine headache days between treatment groups based on the episodic migraine subpopul ation. If the null hypothesis is rejected for that compariso n, then the comparison of 50% response rate between treatment groups will be tested in the total population. If that nu ll hypothesis is rejected, then the next comparison in the sequence will be tested (50% response rate in the episodic subpopulati on), following this same pattern unt il all hypotheses are tested or until the null hypothesis is accepted for an endpo int, at which po int, any further testing would stop for the key secondary object ives. If themu ltiple testing approach for key secondary measures needsto be changed, the updated approach will be provided in the SAP,and it should not lead to modification o f this protocol ."

Com parisons between treatment groups for all categorical safet y measures will be made using Fisher’s exact test for S tudy PeriodIIIwith the safet y popul ation. Descript ive statistics only will be presented for the analyses in Study PeriodIV. Analyses of cont inuous safet y data will be conducted for Study PeriodIII and Study PeriodIII/IV using the safet y popul ation. In those analyses, only values co llected a t scheduled visits will be used. 10.3.4.1. Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as the reported AEs that first occurred or worsened during the postbaseline phase co mpared with thebaseline phase. For each TEAE, the reporte d severit y level o f the event (mild, moderate, or severe) will be determined by pat ient or physician opinio n. The Medi cal Dict ionary for Regul atory Activities(MedDRA ) Lowest Level Term (LLT) will be used in the treatm ent-emergent com putati on. For each LLT, the maximum severit y at baseline will be used as the baseline severit y. If the maximum severit y during postbaseline is greater than the maximum baseline severit y, the event is considered to be treatm ent-emergent for the specific postbaseline period. Safet y analyses for each study period will use all visits up through the last scheduled visit in the priorstudy period as baseline. For each patient and TEAE, the maxi mum severi ty for the MedDRA level being displayed ( preferred term, High Level Term, or SOC) is the maximum postbaseline severit y observed from all associ ated LLTs mapping to that MedDRA level . For events that are sex-specific, the deno minator and co mputa tion of the percentage will include only patients from the specific sex. 10.3.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs collected during the study include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse , and temperature. Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be taken when the patient is in a sitting posi tion. The number and percent ageof patients m eeting criteria for treatment -emergent abnorm alities in vital signs and wei ght at any time during study will be summarized. Treatment group comparisons will be perf ormed using Fis her’s exact test. 10.3.4.3. Electrocardiogram Intervals and Heart Rate The corrected QT interval will be calculated using theFridericia method ( QTcF ). The number and percentage of patients m eeting criteria for treatment -emergent abnorm alities in ECG intervals (pulse , QRS, and QTcF) and heart rate at any time during study will be summarized . Treatment group comparisons will be performed using the Fisher’s exact test. 10.3.4.4. Laboratory Tests The incidence rates of patients with treatment -emergent abnorm al,high,or lowlaboratory values at any time postbaseline will be assessed using Fisher’s exact test for each laboratory test."

Patients wi th all norm al or hi gh values at baseline (no low values) will be included in the analysis of treatment -emergent low laboratory values. Patients will be defined as having a treatm ent-emergen t high value if they have all normal or low values at baseline, fo llowed by a value above the upper reference limit at any postbaseline visit. Pati ents wi th all normal or low values at baseline (no high values) will be included in the analysis o f treatm ent-emergent hi gh laboratory values. For analytes simply classified as normal or abnormal, patients will be defined as having a treatm ent-emergent abnormal value if they have all normal values at baseline, fo llowed by an abnorm al value at any postbaseline visit.
