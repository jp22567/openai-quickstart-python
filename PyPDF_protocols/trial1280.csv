INTRODUCTION 1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND Plaque psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic skin disease characterized b y raised, well -demarcated, oval ery thematous plaques covered in adherent silvery scale ( R11-1257). Lesions are typicall y painful and/or itchy, and can be associated with a high degree of morbidity . PsO can affect extensive areas of skin; disease severit y is in fact defined b y bod y surface area (BSA) as mild (<3%), moderate ( 3-10%), and severe (>10%) ( P20-07441 ). Approximately 25% of patients are classified as having moderate -to-severe disease. Disease severity correlates inversel y with quality of life, as reported b y patients with regard to s ymptom severity and disease impact on functionality and socialization ( R16-4115, R11 - 1260 , R03-1208 , R16- 3072 ). Plaques on visible skin (e.g., scalp, face, hands) have particular impact on phy sical, sexual, psy chosocial, and even economic status; dise ase severit y is associated with reduced levels of emplo yment and income ( R16-3072) . PsO is more than a superficial disease, with 30% of patients having joint involvement, and a high correlation between PsO and obesity , diabetes, depression, metabolic sy ndrome, and cardiovascular risk ( R16-4115 ). Affecting approximately 2% of the global population, including 25 million North American and European patients, PsO is the most prevalent immune- mediated skin disease ( R08-1089 ). Direct and indirect annual costs attributed to PsO in the US are estimated to be US $6,422 per patient on average, resulting in a total burden of US $35.2 billion. This cost is distributed, roughl y in equal t hirds, to medical costs, reduced quality of life, and productivity loss ( R17- 1990 ). Across German y, Ital y, Spain, UK, and France the per -patient cost of PsO has been estimated to range from US $2,077 to $13,132 annually (R17-1989 ). The immunologic mechanism of PsO involves initial dendritic cell (DC) activation by cutaneous pathogens, leading to IL- 23 secretion, promoting Th17 differentiation and stabilization. Keratinocy tes are the principal target, in addition to DCs, dermal fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, for IL-17, resulting in the expression of numerous chemokines which direct chemotaxis and inflammation, and of defensin and S100A family peptides which alter expression of multiple genes involved in cell adhesion. The critical role of IL- 17 in PsO pathogenesis has been extensively evaluated in IL -17-knockout animal models and confirmed in humans. T h17 cells, the majority of which are of memory phenot ype, are enriched in the papillary dermis of psoriatic plaques. Disease severity has been shown to correlate directl y with IL -17A level ( R16- 3073). The central role of IL- 23 and IL-17 activity in the pathogenesis of disease has been proven unequivocally by the substantial c linical efficacy of biologic agents targeting these cy tokines in the treatment of patients with moderate- to-severe plaque PsO. Mainstay s of therap y for the treatment of PsO include topical agents, ultraviolet light -based therapies, traditional s ystemic agents ( e.g., methotrexate, acitretin, cy closporine), and more recentl y, targeted biologic and small- molecule therapies. Steroidal and non -steroidal topical agents (e.g., vitamin D analogues, retinoids, tar, anthralin, salicy lic acid, tacrolimus) are efficacious, particularl y for mild- to-moderate disease, but ty pically require long -term administration, and often provide only incomplete clearance. Long -term adherence to topically -prescribed therapies is often poor, and sy stemic absorption limits long -term usage"

Ultraviolet light -based therapies, often combined with the photosensitizing agent psoralen, may be used to treat extensive areas of involved skin, but generally require long- term therap y, and are associated with non -melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Conventional systemic agents provide relatively inexpensive options to treat more severe or refractory disease, but long -term usage may be substantiall y limited b y the risks of hepatotoxicity , bone marrow suppression, and pulmonary toxicity (methotrexate), teratogenicity (acetretin), and nephrotoxicity and hy pertension (cy closporine). During the past 15 y ears, antibodies targeting TNFα, and subsequently IL-12/23 an d IL-17, have demonstrated substantial efficacy and indeed complete remission rates, with safet y and tolerability superior to conventional therapies. Retinoic acid -related orphan receptor (ROR) γt is a nuclear hormone receptor/transcription factor expressed in T h17 cells and in distinct subsets of ly mphoid cells, including NK cells, innate ly mphoid cells (ILC), and T-cells. RORγt sits at a key focal point, integrating multiple signals, including T cell receptor engagement and cy tokines (e.g., IL -1, IL -6, IL -23), and driving the expression of multiple genes (e.g., IL -17A, IL -17F, IL-22, IL -23R). Via sitting at this focal node integrating multiple signals and effecting multiple outputs, RORγt has the potential to have a broader effect in Th17- mediated dise ased than individual cy tokine blockades alone (e.g., IL -23 or IL -17). 1.2 DRUG PROFILE Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) is developing the new chemical entit y (NCE), RORγt antagonist BI730357, for the treatment of patients with plaque PsO and other T h17-mediated dise ases. BI730357 binds in the ligand -binding domain (LBD) of RORγt and inhibits co -activator peptide recruitment, thereby blocking the RORγt -mediated transcription of pro -inflammatory cytokines, and of IL -23R. For a more detailed description of the profile of BI 730357 please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) (c09228382)."

The Investigator’s Brochure (c09228382 ) provides the most current and complete detail of BI 730357 clinical experience. The most relevant detail s of Phase I clinical development to date are provided below. Phase Ia first -in-human trial 1407 .1evalua ted single - rising dose administration of BI 730357 ranging from 2 mg through 800 mg, given as oral solution (2 mg and 8 mg) and film - coated tablets (25 mg to 800 mg) to healthy male adult subjects aged 18 to 45 y ears. Approximately 84 subjects were to be e ntered into the trial; each group of 8 subjects was randomized (6 active:2 placebo) into sequential dose groups under fasting (2 mg, 8 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg), and fed conditions (400 mg, 800 mg). An additional 12 subjects were recrui ted into a 3 -way crossover substudy , and administered 25 mg BI 730357 as oral solution, tablet fasting, and tablet fed. In total, 66 male adult subjects received BI 730357. Safety evaluations included phy sical examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory tests, and adverse events (AEs). AEs, which generally reflected commonly -occuring events of short duration, and were mostly mild or moderate in severity , were distributed without discernable trend among recipients of placebo and rising dose levels of BI 730357. No serious AEs (SAEs) were reported. Overall, single -dose administration of BI 730357 was well tolerated by healthy male subjects in this clinical trial. Phase Ib trial 1407- 0002 evaluated MRD administration of BI 730357 ranging from 25 mg to 400 mg, given as film-coated tablets to healthy male adult subjects aged 18 to 45 years. Approximately 84 subjects were to be entered into the trial; each group of 12 subjects was randomized (9 active:3 placebo) into one of 4 sequential dose groups under fasting co nditions (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg), and 3 sequential dose groups under fed conditions (50 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg). Subjects were dosed for 14 days (dose groups up to 100 mg) or 28 days (200 mg and 400 mg dose groups). Safety evaluations included phy sical examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory tests, and AEs. Nodeaths, S AEs, or severe AEs were reported during the trial. Overall, administration ofBI 730357 to healthy male subjects at doses up to 400 mg for up to 28 day s waswell tolerated. The hi ghest exposures observed in this study were substantially below the NOAEL exposures observed in the 4- week dog stud y. In fasted individuals, exposure (Cmaxand AUC) increased in a less than dose -proportional manner over the entire dosing range, both for single and multiple dosing. Steady state was attained b y 7 da ys of multiple dosing, with an accumulation of approximately 2-fold for both Cmaxand AUC. Under fed conditions, BI 730357 plasma exposures (AUC and C max) were observed to be higher compared with the same dose level under fasted conditions."

Primary anal ysis of data through Week 12 show that the overall frequency of patients with at least 1 treatment - emergent AE was 50.6% for patients receiving BI 730357 (range 47.5% to 53.8%), vs. 55.0% of placebo recipients. No drug- related SAEs were reported. One severe AE, “psoriasis,” was reported; all ot her reported AEs were mild to moderate in severit y. This was also the onl y reported an AE leading to discontinuation of trial drug. Overall, administration of BI 730357 to patients with moderate- to-severe plaque PsO at doses up to 200 mg for at least 12 weeks, under fasted conditions, has been well tolerated.

Howeve r, these antibody drugs must be administered b y subcutaneous injections, and long -term therapeutic effect may be limited by the formation of antidrug antibodies. There remains a medical need for the introduction of new, efficacious oral treatment options. RORγt has the potential to demonstrate substantial efficacy in the treatment of PsO, via a broader effect in T h17-mediated disease than provided by individual cy tokine blockade alone (e.g., IL -23 or IL -17).The favorable preclinical data and acceptable safet y, tolerability and PK demonstrated after single dose administration to healthy male volunteers in first -in- human t rial 1407 .1 and in MRD trial1407-0002 position BI 730357 favorably for advancement into a PoCC evaluation in adult patients with moderate -to-severe plaque PsO. The aim of this Phase II t rial is to investigate safety , tolerability , and efficacy of B I730357 in patients with moderate -to-severe plaque PsO. Favorable results of this trial will serve as a PoCC in the treatment of PsO, for refinement of Phase III dose selection, and to support further development in other disease indications."

Part 2 of this trial therefore plans to evaluate the efficacy , safet y, tolerability , and PK of 400 mg q.d.and 200 mg b.i.d. administration of BI 730357, under fed conditions, to patients with moderate- to-severe plaque PsO . It is anticipated that higher median BI 730357 exposures, as expected with 400 mg dosed q.d., and 200 mg dosed b.i.d. under fed conditions for 12 weeks will not exceed the NOAEL thresholds observed in 13 week general toxicity studies (see section 1.2.1 ). Treatment with doses of up to 400 mg q.d.under fed conditions to healthy volunteers for up to 28 day s in Phase Ib MRD trial 1407 -0002, and with doses of up to 200 mg q.d.under fasting conditions for more than 12 weeks thus far i n Part 1 of this trial did not identify any safety signals (see section 1.2.2 ). 1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT Study participants are exposed to the risks of the study procedures and the risks related to the exposure to the trial medication. Procedure - related risks Blood sampling b y venipuncture or through an indwelling venous catheter may be accompanied by mild bruising and also, in rare cases, by transient inflammation of the wall of the vein. In addition, in rare cases a nerve might be injured while inserting the venous catheter, potentially resulting in paresthesia, reduced sensibility , and/or pain for an indefinite period. The total volume of blood withdrawn per subject during the trial will amount to approximately 350 mL (over 24 weeks in Part 1) and 250 mL (over 12 weeks in Part 2) . In the optional intensive PKsubstudy , approxamitely an additional 60 mL willbe withdrawn. No health -related risk is expected from this blood withdrawal. Drug -related risks and safety measures As the nature of the target and the mechanism of action of BI 730357 are well understood, comparable compounds hav e been tested b y other companies before, and the animal models"

The pharmacological effects of BI 730357 are dose dependent, and no evidence for prolong ed or irreversible effects has been observed. Multiple dose administration of up to 200 mg BI730357 q.d. fasted (over 24 weeks in Part 1) and of up to 400 mg q.d. fed(over 12 weeks in Part 2) is supported by pre -clinical, as well as clinical safet y data from trial 1407 .1and trial 1407-0002 (see section 1.2.2 ). Since preclinical data indicate that BI 730357 has phototoxicity potential, subjects in this trial will be advised to apply protection measures as described in section 4.2.2.3. Solarium radiation , treatment with ultraviolet light (e.g., PUVA) , and use of medication with known phototoxicity potential (e.g., doxy cycline) areprohibited during this clinical trial until the end of the follow- up period. BI 730357 is confirmed as a sensitive cy tochrome P450 (CYP) 3A substrate, based on clinical drug -drug interaction (DDI) evaluation with itraconazole, a CYP3A inhibitor, in trial 1407- 0014. Drugs or foods that are known CYP3A inhibitors or str ong or moderate CYP3A inducers should not be co -administered in clinical trials with BI 730357. Based on in vitro data, BI 730357 could potentially induce CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, or 2C19 in human. Sensitive substrates of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, or 2C19 f or which a reduction in exposure could present a potential patient risk should not be given together with BI 730357. Additionally , based on in vitro data, BI 730357 may inhibit a number of transporters in human; based on the magnitudes of the in vitro inhi bition, it is recommended that substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2- K for which an increase in exposure could present a potential patient risk should not be given together with BI 730357. As with other immune -targeted t herapies, impaired host defense is a theoretical target -related toxicity , potentially resulting in increased risk of infection and/or malignancy . Th17 cells play an important role in defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi at mucosal surfaces (R16- 3166), ( R16- 3149). I n some studies, IL - 17-antagonists were associated with increased infections ( R13-2643). Homozy gous, but not heterozy gous RORC knockout mice have a high incidence of T cell l ymphoma, thought to originate in the thy mus ( R16-2630 ). While the translatability of the knockout phenoty pe to pharmacological RORγ antagonism and to humans is unknown, this raises the h ypothetical concern for clinical T cell ly mphoma risk. The exact cause of T -cell ly mphomas in RORC knockout mice is not fully understood, but changes in homeostasis in the thy mus, such as th ymocyte apoptosis and proliferation, are thought to play a role. No evidence of an in creased risk of ly mphoma development or changes preceding l ymphoma development has arisen based on the BI 730357 toxicology studies in rat and dog ofup to 26- and 39- week duration, respectively . AEs and SAEs consistent with malignancy, and specificall y those representing l ymphoma, are to be evaluated throughout the BI 730357 clinical development program. Thus far, no clinical signal regarding malignancy has been identified in BI 730357 clinical trials. As with all drugs, the potential for h ypersensitivity and allergic reactions has to be taken into consideration when BI 730357 is administered."

Even though gastritis development is not expected in humans, AE consistent with gastric intolerance or gastritis are designated as AEs of special interest (AESI) to ensure timel y characterization, monitoring, and reporting of an y such effects in this study (see section s 1.2.1 and5.2.6.1 ). Results of the Week 12 primary anal ysis from Part 1 of this trial demonstrate proof- of- concept in the treatment of patients with moderate- to-severe plaque PsO for BI 730357 at the 200 mg dose. Patients with plaque PsO receiving BI 730357 may therefore experience improvement in disease severit y. C onsidering the data and modelling from thePart 1 Week 12 primary anal ysisof this trial, higher efficacy may be observed in Part 2 of this trial with the expected higher BI 730357 exposure sresulting from dosing posologies to be evaluated . However, this is a newl y - developed drug at an early stage of testing, therefore an individual benefit for patients cannot be guaranteed. In addition, patients may be randomized to placebo treatment and not see an y potential benefit. Nonetheless, the results from toxicit y and safet y pharmacology studies demonstrated an acceptable profile for clinical trials with daily oral administration. The potential risks which are described above will be minimized by close monitoring and the involvement of a n independent external DMC. These risks are considered manageable and outweighed by the potential benefits of the study drug."

DESCRIPTION OF DESIG N AND TRIAL POPULATION 3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN This is a Phase II trial consisting of tw o parts. Part 1: Part 1 is a randomised, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, double- blind evaluation of approximately 180 male and female patients with moderate- to-severe plaque PsO. Patients will be randomised 2:2:2:2:1 to one of 4 BI 730357 treatment groups A to D, of which A will receive the lowest and D the highest dose of BI 730357; treatment group E will receive placebo. At the Week 12 primary efficacy endpoint , non- responders will be reassigned to the next higher dose level or to the highest dos e level, if they have been in the placebo arm (see Figure 3.1: 1). Placebo recipients who achieve a PASI 75 response will remain on placebo through Week 24.

Patients who have achieved a PASI 50 response will continue on their initial dose of BI 730357, in order to evaluate whe ther a greater response can be achieved with continued treatment. This design is intended to permit placebo recipients the opportunity to receive active study drug after Week 12 if they continue to experience substantial disease. Likewise, recipients of BI 730357 at lower dose levels (A through C) will be provided the opportunity to receive a higher dose of study drug. However, in order to fully evaluate the time -to-response curve in patients who demonstrate a partial response to BI 730357 at Week 12, the r esponse threshold for BI 730357 recipients (PASI 50) is set lower than for placebo recipients (PASI 75). Moreover, this reassignment will allow dose selection for Phase III based on efficacy evaluation over the full 24 weeks of treatment and obtain maximum safety information regarding the safet y of high -dose exposure. I t is anticipated that the best timing and the best cut -off for co -primary efficacy endpoint evaluation in Phase III studies will be refined based upon the results of this trial .Safet y (physical examination, ECG, laboratory , AEs, and SAEs), efficacy , PK and target engagement are to be evaluated through Week 24. Part 2: Part 2 is a randomised, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, double- blind evaluation of approximately 90male and fema le patients with moderate -to-severe plaque PsO. Patients will be randomised 4:4:1 to one of two BI730357 treatment groups V(200 mg b.i. d.) or U(400 mg q.d.); treatment group W will receive placebo.

A placebo control arm has been chosen to be included in order to evaluate the absolute effects of BI730357 on safet y and tolerability . This is acceptable ,as the duration of the placebo treatment, if no spontaneous improvement of the disease occurs, will be limited to 12 weeks, and no intolerable disease progression is to be expected during this period. Patients completing the treatment priod of the trial will be offered to roll over into an extension trial , in which they will continue receiv ing study medication . 3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION The trial is intended to provide PoCC of BI 730357 in the treatment of moderate -to-severe plaque PsO. Therefore, in Part 1 approximately 180 male and female patients suffering from this condition will be included at about 3 2study sites .In Part 2, approxi mately 90 male and female patients will be included. Screening of patient s will be competitive, i.e. ,screening will stop at all sites once a sufficient number of patient s havebeen screened. Investigators will be notified about screening completion , and will then not be allowed to screen additional patient s for this trial. A log of all patient s enrolled into the trial(i.e.,who have signed informed consent) will be maintained in the ISF at the investigational site ,irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not. If a patient is randomised in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more exclusion criteria on the day of enrolment), the sponsor should be contacted i mmediately . 3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry Male or female patients with moderate- to-severe plaque PsO ."

The dose range for this trial was selected on the basis of the PK and safety data obtained in the SRD and MRD trials (1407.1 and 1407 -0002, respectivel y)combined with the preclinical efficacy data. The proposed BI 730357 dose selection strate gy for P oCC evaluation in PsO patients was predicated upon the estimated whole blood BI 730357 IL -17 IC 50concentration in murine models, from which an anticipated human therapeutic trough exposure of 140 nM at stead y state (C min,ss) was predicted (with a corresponding AUC 0-24,ssof 5200 nM•h ). The target C min,ss in human was determined based on the effective plasma concentration required to reduce the tissue level of IL -17 by 80% in an IL -23 induced minicircle mouse model [c09228382 ]. Part 2: Modelling of dat a from Part 1 of this trial indicates that the efficacy plateau of BI 730357 may not have been reache d with 200 mg dosed q.d.under fasted conditions, and that exposures resulting from posologies dosing BI 730357 higher, under fed conditions, and/or twice dail y ma y provide a better efficacy. Doses of 200 mg b.i.d. and 400 mgq.d. administered under fed conditions aretherefore selected for Part 2 of this trial (see section 1.3). The higher BI 730357 exposures achieved with 200 mgb.i.d. and 400 mg q.d. administered under fed conditions for 12 weeks areexpected to be safe with regard to the NOAEL levels observed in 13 week general toxicity studies (see section 1.2.1 ). In addition , treatment of patients with BI 730357 doses of up to 200 mg q.d.under fasted conditions for up to 24 weeks in part 1 of this trial, and administration of BI 730357 to healthy volunteers at doses of up to 400 mg q.d.under both fasted and fed conditions for up to 28 day s in MRD trial 1407-0002 did not identify any safety signals (see section 1.2.2 ). In summary , the data generated in Part 2 of this trial will extend characterization of the dose- response relationship within a wider therapeutic range, and enable selection of the dose range for Phase III development. 4.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups In Part 1, d uring visit 2,eligible patient s will be randomise d in a 2:2:2:2:1 ratio to one of 4 BI730357 dose groups A to D, or placebo, in a blinded fashion via Interactive Response Technology (IRT). At the Week 12 primary efficacy endpoint , non- responders will be reassigned to the next higher d ose level or to the highest dose level, if they have been in the placebo arm (see Figure 3.1 : 1). Placebo recipients who achieve a PASI 75 response will remain on placebo through Week 24.

The C -SSRS is a semi -structured, inv estigator- rated interview, developed by clinical experts in cooperation with the FDA, assessing both suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. I t does not give a global score, but provides some categorical and some severity information specificall y for beha vior and ideation. The C -SSRS interview may be administered by any type of phy sician, psy chologist, clinical social worker, mental health counselor, nurse, or coordinator with C -SSRS training. It has a typical duration of five minutes, and causes onl y a low burden on subjects. At a minimum, the interview consists of 2 screening questions related to suicidal ideation and 4 related to suicidal behavior, and may be expanded to up to 17 items in case of positive responses. Free text entries are allowed for; t he investigator has to directly evaluate the scale and write a report. In this trial , paper forms will be used for the assessment of the C- SSRS® ,and results will be transcribed into the e-CRF. The C -SSRS has been widely used in large multinational clinical trials. The C -SSRS will be administered at the Screening Visit/Visit 1 (using the ‘baseline/ screening’ version) with the aim to exclude patients with active moderate or severe s ymptomatology within a specified time prior to the screening or screening visit. The lifetime and the past year history of suicidal ideation and behavior will also be recorded. After the screening visit, the assessment ‘since last visit’ version will be performed at ea ch visit. The investigator is to review positive and negative reports for plausibility and clinical relevance. Doubtful reports may be repeated or reports may be validated by a consulting psychiatrist or other mental health professional expert . If there is a confirmed positive report of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation type 4 or 5 after start of trial, the investigator is to immediately interview the patient, and/or is to consult a mental health professional . If the positive report is confirmed, appro priate actions for the patient’s safet y have to be initiated. All C -SSRS reports of suicidal ideation type 4 or 5 and all reports of suicidal behavior must be reported as separate SAEs by the investigator. For ‘Self -injurious behavior, without suicidal i ntent’, standard AE / SAE reporting rules are to be applied."

Ifsuch abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as baseline conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only. Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE which fulfils at least one of the following criteria: -results in death, -is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically might have caused death i f more severe. -requires in patient hospitalisation or -requires prolongation of existing hospitalis ation, - results in persistent or signif icant disability or incapacity ,or -is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect, -is deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when based on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions.

Skin biopsies, although not standard, are also widely used in PsO trials and indispensable for the understanding of the disease pathoph ysiology and effects of the treatments which are investigated. Onl y a subset of patients will be asked for skin biopsies. A separated informed consent will be obtained from these patients. Therefore, the appropriateness of all measurements applied in this trial is gi ven. Information about race should be obtained from all study participants as allowed by local regulations. This is because the prevalence and characteristics of psoriasis differ widely between patients of different racial origin. It will thus be worthwhi le to assess if patients of different race will respond differentl y to the stud y treatment."

STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL Part 1: The primary trial objective includes demonstration of PoCC with respect to a non -flat dose response curve, characterization of the dose-response relationship within the therapeutic range, and selection of the dose range for phase III development. See section 2.1.1 for details on the objective of this trial . For this purpose, the primary anal ysis uses methodology for dose finding employ ing both multiple comparison procedures and modelling techniques (MCPMod). The co -primary endpoin ts are defined in section 2.1.2 . Part 2: ABayesian borrowing approach will be implemented to estimate treatment effect by PASI 75 and sPGA. No hypothesis testing will be performed . The primary endpoint is defined in section 2.1.2 Baseline refers to the measurement recorded at randomisation (Visit 2); if data at Visit 2 is missing, then data from Visit 1 will be considered baseline. The percent reduction from baseline is calculated b y % PASI reduction from baseline = ((PASI at baseline -PASI at Visit X) / PASI at baseline) * 100, at all follow up visits. Achieving an x% or larger reduction from baseline PASI score is denoted as PASI X. 7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES Part 1: The co -primary endpoints are based on Week 12 PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 response. The null hypothesis is that there is a flat dose response curve comparing the placebo and the BI730357 dose groups. The alternative hy pothesis is that there is a non -flat dose response curve indic ating a benefit of BI 730357 over placebo. The MCPMod procedure allows for simultaneous evaluation of different potential dose response patterns, whilst protecting the overall probability of Ty pe I error (one sided α of 5%). The pre -specified models and their parameters used for this test are outlined in section 7.3.1 . Part 2: The co -primary endpoints are based on Week 12 PASI 75 response and sPGA 0/1. PASI 75 at week 12 will be anal ysed based on a Bay esian borrowing approach. 7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES The following patient analy sis sets are defined: The efficacy anal yses will be based on the intent- to-treat principle, comprising all participants who were randomised and received at least one dose during the trial.

Specifications of important protocol v iolation s will be provided in the TSAP. 7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses Part 1: The achievement of PASI 75 at Week 12 is the first co -primary endpoint, and is a binary variable with values of 0 or 1. The achievement of a sPGA score of clear or almost clear at Week 12 is the second co -primary endpoint and is a binary variable with values of 0 or 1. After the last patient reaches Week 12, the anal yses for PoCC and dose -finding will be performed on each co -primary endpoint using multiple comparison and modelling t echniques (MCPMod) [ R10-1424 , R15-1961 ] for binary data whereby several possible dose response models (patterns) will be evaluated, while keeping full control of the ty pe I error at 5%, one - sided , to identify the best -fitting model or subset of models. A non -flat dose -response relationship is established if for each co -primary endpoint, the null hypothesis of no dose effect (i.e., a flat dose response curve) is rejected for at least one of the pre-specified models with respect to the alpha chosen. For the sample size calculation, the maximum effect size is assumed to be 50%, with the placebo effect size assumed to be 10% for PASI 75 at Week 12. The maximum effect size is assumed to be 50% with the placebo effect size assumed to be 10% for sPGA (0/1) at Week 12. Further details are given in section 7.7 . The following models shapes have been selected as the candidate set of possible dose response patterns (Figure 7.3.1:1 ) based on current expectation. Assuming the following dose groups will be tested: placebo, active BI 730357 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg.  Linear: no assumptions needed  Emax 1: 30% of the maximum effect is achi eved at 50 mg  Emax 2: 80% of the maximum effect is achieved at 50 mg  Exponential: 5% of the maximum effect is achieved at 25 mg  Logistic: 10% of the maximum effect is achieved at 25 mg 80% of the maximum effect is achieved at 100 mg Note that the actual shapes and assumptions on proportion of maximum effect are applied on the logit scale for binary data, e.g. linear model. For interpretation convenience, dose response curves in Figure 7.3.1: 1 are converted to original scale of PASI 75 and sPGA 0/1 probability ."

If PoCC is established, the statistically significant (best fitting) model(s) from the above candidate set are refitted to the data to generate new estimates for all model parameters from the data. The final model will be obtained via model averaging across the significant models based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The target dose(s) can be estimated from that model by incorporating information on the minimum clinically relevant effect and accounting for safety . Only doses within the dose range investigated (0 to 200 mg) will be considered although the actual modelling will be performed on a broader range of doses including extrapolation. If considered necessary and for the purpose of further model refinement, MCPMod might be repeated on the primary endpoint but with an extended set of shapes including the original candidates. Comparisons between treatment groups will be exploratory in nature. Comparisons between treatment groups regarding the co -primary endpoints will also be performed using the Chi - square test for each of the four active treatments versus placebo.

For the PoCC anal ysis, the anal yses will be p erformed by BI personnel independent of the trial team in order to prevent potential introduction of operational bias. A logistics plan prepared and approved in accordance with Sponsor’s specific procedures will detail procedures used to ensure that all members of the trial team remain blinded. The logistics plan will also contain a detailed list of functions that need to be unblinded to perform this analysis. Part 2: The achievement of PASI 75 at Week 12 will be summarized in the form of proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 at Week 12 as an outcome measure so as to perform the primary analysis. The primary anal ysis on PASI 75 at week 12 will be based on a Bay esian borrowing approach. For the placebo control group, an informative prior is based on his torical data whereas the prior for the BI 730357 group is non -informative. The derivation of the informative prior is based on a meta -analytic predictive (MAP) prior approach which is additionally robustified against prior -data conflicts byadding a vaguel y informative component to the prior. A Bay esian approach with an informative mixture beta prior for the placebo group will be used. The prior is a combination of a mixture of informative beta priors derived from historical trials and a vaguely informativ e beta prior .Theweight on the vaguel y informative beta prior is 50%. The prior considered is : 0.388 * Beta (8.269, 132.315 ) + 0.112 * Beta (2.546, 27.521 ) + 0.5 * Beta (0. 07, 0.93 ). Non -informative beta prior Beta( 1, 1) is used for BI active treatment arms. The actual prior may be updated based on additional historical information being available , including result from part I . The final prior will be documented in the TSAP. The primary anal ysis for sPGA clear or almost clear at week 12 will be analy sed by summarizing t he proportion of responders in each arm with 95% exact confidence intervals. If considered necessary ,same approach as PASI 75 based on Bay esian borrowing approach. The proportion sof 200 mg b.i.d. and 400 mg q.d.recipients who achieve PA SI 75 improvement criteria at Week 12.,will be respectively compared with that of placebo recipients . For that purpose ,the posterior probability distribution for the risk difference will be evaluated and compared to specific boundary values. The dual cri teria will be assessed to evaluate the effect of BI 730357: (1) significance: a posterior probability of at least 90% that the PASI 75 response rate for patients on BI 730357 is higher than that for patients on placebo; and (2) relevance: a posterior proba bility of at least 50% that the PASI 75 response rate for patients on BI 730357 is higher than that for patients on placebo b y various boundary values. If at least one dose satisfy both criteria, it is considered as “pass”. If neither doses have significan ce or relevance criteria been met, it is considered as “not pass”. Otherwise it is in the “consider” zone, where sPGA 0/1 at week 12 will be jointly evaluated."

As the trial will continue unchanged irrespective of the results, no statistical adjustment for the primary endpoint is required. When the last patient completes the Week 12 visit (timepoint of primary endpoint), the primary anal ysis will be performed. In order to support the further double- blinded conduct of the trial until the Week 24 visit, the Trial Team will be kept blinded on the individual patients’ treatment group a ssignment. A separate team will be formed to perform this analy sis. Details will be specified in the logistic plan. In summary , Part 1 of this trial will be double -blinded until the final anal ysis when the last patient completes Week 24. More details abou t the anal yses will be specified in the TSAP. Part 2: No interim anal ysis is planned for the Part 2 of this trial. For both trial parts, an independent DMC will follow the DMC charter and be responsible for reviewing safet y data periodically to ensure patient safet y and to monitor the conduct of the trial and the integrity of the data. Refer to section 8.7 for more in formation for DMC. 7.5 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA Every effort should be made to collect complete data at all visits. With respect to safet y evaluations, it is not pl anned to impute missing values. The following rules will be used to impute for missing data: -For all non -binary endpoints, L OCF (Last Observation C arried Forward) will be used to impute missing values -For all binary endpoints (i.e., endpoints that are either 1 (patient responded) or 0 (patient did not respond)): -If no data after that visit*, then impute as failure (NRI [No Response I mputation])"

Missing items from the Quality of Life questionnaires will be handled according to the measure i nstructions (cf. Appendix 10. 6). If there is no data for a particular visit, then it will be imputed following the same rules as described above. More details will be i ncluded in the TSAP, if needed . 7.6 RANDOMISATION An IRT will be used for the assignment of subjects to treatment groups. Part1: Patients will be randomised in blocks to double-blind treatment. Patients will be randomised to one of 4 BI 730357 dose groups and placebo in a 2:2:2:2:1 ratio. I n total, approximately 40 patients will be allocated to each BI 730357 active dose group, and approximately 20 patients to placebo. Refer to section 3.1 for the details . Part 2: Patients will be randomised to the 200 mg b.i.d. , 400 mg q.d.BI 730 357 dose group or placebo in a 4 :4:1 ratio. In total, approximately 40 patients will be allocated to B I 730357 200 mg b.i.d. dose group, 4 0 patients will be allocated to B I 730357 400 mg q.d.dose group and approximately 10 patients to placebo. Refer to section 3.1 for the details . BI will arrange fo r the randomi sation and the packaging and labelling of trial medication. The randomi sation list will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a pseudo - random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non - predictable. The block size will be documented in the Clinical Trial Report. Access to the codes will be controlled and documented. 7.7 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE Part 1: Sample size calculation is mainly driven b y safet y considerations. Based on an assumed m aximum treatment effect size of BI 730357 vs. placebo for the PASI 75 endpoint, as well as on the pre- specified models listed in section 7.3.1 , the power is provided in the Table 7.7 : 1for different scenarios for one of the co -primary endpoint PASI 75. The maximum treatment benefit is assumed to be 50% compared to placebo ( 60% vs 10%) for PASI 75 at Week 12."

APPENDICES 10.1 PASI SCORE DEFINITIO N AND USE The PASI score is an established measure of clinical e fficacy for psoriasis medications ( R96- 3541 ). The PASI is a tool which provides a numeric scoring for patients overall psoriasis disease state, ranging from 0 to 72. I t is a linear combination of percent of surface area of skin that is affected and the severity of ery thema, infiltration, and desquamation over four body regions. The endpoints used are based on the percent reduction from baseline, generally summarized as a dichotomous outcome based on achieving over an X% reductio n (or PASI X), where X is 50, 75, 90 and 100. To calculate the PASI score, the four main body areas are assessed: head (h), trunk (t), upper extremities (u) and lower extremities (l) . These correspond to 10, 30, 20 and 40% of the total body area respective ly. The area of psoriatic involvement of these four areas (Ah, At, Au, and Al) is given a numerical value: 0 = no involvement, 1 = <10%, 2 = 10 to <30%, 3 = 30 to <50%, 4 = 50 to <70%, 5 = 70 to <90%, and 6 = 90 to 100% involvement. The signs of severity, erythema (E), infiltration (I) and desquamation (D) of lesions are assessed using a numeric scale 0 -4 where 0 is a complete lack of cutaneous involvement and 4 is the severest possible involvement; scores are made independently for each of the areas, h, t,u and l and represents a composite score for each area. An illustration of judging erythema follows: 0 = no erythema, 1 = slight ery thema, 2 = moderate ery thema, 3 = striking ery thema, and 4 = exceptionall y striking erythema. The PASI score is calculated according to the following formula: PASI = 0.1(Eh+Ih+Dh)Ah + 0.3(Et+It+Dt)At + 0.2(Eu+Iu+Du)Au + 0.4(El+I l+Dl)Al 10.2 STATIC PHYSICIAN GLO BAL ASSESSMENT (SPGA ) The sPGA used in this trial is a 5 point score ranging from 0 to 4, based on the phy sician’s assessment of the average thickness, ery thema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions ( Table 10.2: 1 ) (!""#$ #%&& '. The assessment is considered “static” which refers to the patients disease state at the time of the assessments, without comparison to any of the subject’s previous disease states, whether at Baseline or at a previous visit. A lower score indicates less body coverage, with 0 being clear and 1 being almost clear. The Investigator (or qualified site personnel) scores the ery thema, induration and scaling of all psoriatic lesions from 0 -4 based on the following descriptors: Erythema 0Normal (post -inflammatory hyper/hy popigmentation may be present) 1Faint, diffuse pink or slight red coloration 2Mild (light red coloration) 3Definite red coloration (Dull to bright red) 4Bright to Deep red coloration of lesions"

If a patient has nail psoriasis, the phy sician will assess the nail psoriasis at each protocol defined time point. Fingers (5) on each hand will be individually examined for two distinct assessments and are graded as follows: Nail Matrix Assessment: 0 = None 1 = present in 1 quadrant of nail 2 = present in 2 quadrants of nail 3 = present in 3 quadrants of nail 4 = present in 4 quadrants of nail Nail Bed Assessment: 0 = None 1 = present in 1 quadrant of nail 2 = present in 2 quadrants of nail 3 = present in 3 quadrants of nail 4 = present in 4 quadrants of nail The sum of the scores will be added resulting a range of 0 to 80. If an individual finger assessment is missing (not done), the average of th e remaining measured digits will be imputed and added to the sum. I f < 50% of the finger assessments are missing the imputation will be performed. If more than 50% of the assessments are missing then the sum of the scores will be left as missing. 10.4 PPASI : PA LMOPLANTAR PSORIASIS SEVERITY INDEX The PPASI provides a numeric scoring for psoriasis affecting the hands and feet with scores ranging from 0 to 72. It is a linear combination of percent of surface area of hands and feet that are affected and the severit yof ery thema, induration, and desquamation. If a patient has palmoplantar psoriasis, the ph ysician will assess the psoriasis at each protocol defined time point. Both palms and soles on each hand and foot will be individually assessed for ery thema, indurat ion, desquamation and percentage of area affected as follows:  Erythema, Induration and Desquamation:"

The DLQI has a one -week recall period. Item scores range from 0 (not relevant /not at all ) to 3 (very much). Question 7 is a “y es”/ “no” question where “y es” is scored as 3. DLQI total score is calculated by summing the scores of each question resulting in a range of 0 to 30 where 0-1 = no effect on subject’s life, 2 -5 = small effect, 6 -10 = moderate effect, 11- 20 = very large effect, and 21 -30 = extremel y large effect on subject’s life. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired. A 4-point change from baseline is considered a clinically important difference. 10.7 PSORIASIS SYMPTOM SC ALE (PSS) The PSS will be completed by the patient sduring all clinic visits except V1. The PSS is a four -item patient- reported outcome (PRO) instrument that assesses the severity of ps oriasis sy mptoms in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. The s ymptoms included are: pain, redness, itching and burning from psoriasis. Current sy mptom severity is assessed for a 24 hour recall period using a 5 -point verbal rating scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). The PSS was developed based on published evidence supporting the development of two similar, proprietary patient -reported outcome instruments: the Psoriasis Sy mptom Inventory and the Psoriasis Sy mptom Diary . These measures were developed in accordance with FDA PRO Guidance and have published evidence of reliability , validity , and abilit y to detect change (R14-3562 , R14-3559 , R15-1219 , R15-1410 , R15-1411 ).
