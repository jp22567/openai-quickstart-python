Introduction 6.1. Background Atrial fibrillation is a common and disabling cardiac arrhythmia with a heterogeneous clinical presentation. The fundamental pathophysiology consists of atrial wavelets propagating in different directions, causing disorganized atrial depolarizations without effective atrial contraction, with concomitant rapid and irregular ventricular contractions. AF can be clinically stratified based on whether episodes are self -terminating (paroxysmal) or persistent. Paroxysmal AF (PAF) is defined as recurrent AF (≥2 episodes) that term inates spontaneously within 7 days. Persistent AF is defined as continuous AF that is sustai ned for greater than 7 days.1 1 Calkins, H., et al., HRS/EHRA/ECAS expert Consensus Statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for Patient selection, procedural techniques and follow -up, definitions, endpoints and research trial design.

19,page_19,"056-F275, Clinical Inves tigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 Page 20 of 115 Version 4 , 10NOVO016 Confidential AF is the most common of the sustained arrhythmias affecting millions of people worldwide. In the US, AF affects between 2.7 millio n and 6.1 million adults2, and that number is expected to double over the next 25 years.3 Prolonged AF may lead to electrical, mechanical, and structural changes to the left atrium, which may then progress to tachycardia -induced cardiomyopathy, heart fail ure and persistent AF. Persistent AF represents approximately 25% of AF cases.4 The prognosis is related to the underlying cause of the disease, with idiopathic causes having the best prognosis and ischemic cardiomyopathy having a poor prognosis. The mor tality rate in patients with AF is twice that of patients without AF, and the risk of AF -related stroke is 5 - fold compared to the risk in patients without AF.5 In comparison to patients with PAF, patients with persistent AF are at a significantly greater risk for cardiac mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19- 4.73) and all -cause mortality (HR, 1.89; CI, 1.30- 2.74). 6 In the US, approved treatment options for patients with persistent AF are presently limited to pharmaceutical therapy and concomitant surgical ablation, which are unsatisfactory for many patients with AF. Per the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation, “Antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) efficacy is modest and asymptomatic AF recurrences are common”. 2 All AADs may result in adverse events requiring therapy discontinuation and, with the exceptions of amiodarone and pro pafenone, increase the likelihood of proarrhythmia. 2 Side effects for AADs include bradycardia, palpitations, fatigue, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, constipation and diarrhea, rash, vision problems, and urinary retention. However, there is a growing body of evidence supporting catheter ablation as a reasonable option for treating persistent AF patients. In 2012, the HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation published a Class IIa Level B recommendation for catheter and surgical ablation o f AF for persistent symptomatic AF ( refractory or intolerant to a t least one Class I or III AAD), stating “the benefits of an AF ablation procedure exceed the risks”. 1 In the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillati on, the level of evidence supporting the recommendation moved to Class IIa, Level A.2 Catheter ablation treatment strategies for AF have evolved over time and currently include pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as a cornerstone of ablation therapy in all types of AF (paroxysmal an d persistent). 7, 8 AF arises primarily from the left side of the heart in (or near) the atrium, particularly where the pulmonary veins (PVs) 2 January C, Wann L, Alpert J, Calkins H, et al. 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline for the management of patients wit h atrial fibrillation: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society.

The fundamental basis for the AF ablation procedure is the creation of myocardial lesions that block the propagation of AF wave fronts from the triggering source. The muscular sleeves within the PVs have been established as a critical source of AF triggers.9 Historically, the stepwise approach was introduced over 10 years ago as the ablation strategy for p atients with persistent AF.8,10 The stepwise strategy assumed that better outcomes were obtained when AF was organized and then broke due to additional ablation and substrate modification. The strategy was observational in nature and presumed better outcomes with a stepwise series of radiofrequency (RF) ablations. However, more recently the entire stepwise strategy has been the topic of reevaluation as outcomes may have been more biased by patient cohorts r ather than ablati on strategy. 11 Three recent studies call into question the stepwise ablation approach as each study reporting benefit using a minimal PVI -only type strategy.12, 13, 14, 15 In the 2C3L study, an extensive ablation group which included complex fractionated electr ograms ( CFE ) ablation had a trend towards worse outcomes compared to a control cohort with less extensive ablation.12 Similarly, in the Wynn et al. 2015 study, PVI alone had a trend towards better outcomes compared to PVI ablation with the addition of linear line ablation. Finally, the pivotal STAR AF II r esults demonstrated the benefits of a PVI -only approach over that of additional linear ablation or CFE ablation. This trial compared the efficacy of three different AF ablation strategies in 589 patients with persistent AF. Subjects were randomized to PVI alone, PVI plus complex fractionated electrograms (PVI+CFE), and PVI plus linear ablation (PVI+Lines). The STAR AF II trial outcomes were: • Additional CFE or Lines ablation increased procedural time • No benefit in AF reduction when additional substrate ablat ion (CFE or Lines) was performed in addition to PVI. • PVI alone achieved freedom from recurrence in 59% of patients at 18 months The stepwise ablation studies may have suffered from the inability to create a robust and durable PVI as a foundational strategy (with historic focal RF ablation catheters), which could have adversely changed the data interpretation of the results. More recent studies have examined and compared the ability of cryoballoon technology to create a robust and durable PVI compared to RF catheters. Aryana et al. in a large, 9 Calkins H. et al.

The safety profile of cryoballoon ablation is also well established. The STOP AF trial17 was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled investigation device exemption (IDE) study designed to compare outcomes of cryoballoon and antiarrhythmic drug therapies in patients with PAF. The cryoballoon arm met its primary safety objective with a serious procedure related event rate of 3.1%. Comparing safety rates versus the AAD arm, 6.1% of cryoballoon subjects experienced a serious procedure -related event or major adverse event versus 8.5% of AAD subjects. An analysis of 149 cryoballoon studi es with 11,242 patients (see Appendix A for literature search methodology) showed similar complication rates to STOP AF for both PAF and persistent AF patients (see Table 5). Table 5 : Safety Summary of Cryoballoon Literature *The complication definition may vary from study to study. Expanded indication s in the US would fulfill an unmet clinical need for symptomatic persistent AF patients in which antiarrhythmic drugs fail or are not tolerated. 6.2.

Primary Efficacy : Demonstrate an acceptable efficacy success rate at 12 months after the pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation procedure. Treatment success is defined as freedom from treatment failure. Treatment failure is defined as any of the following components: o Acute procedural failure o Documented AF/AT/AFL on Holter/TTM/ 12-lead ECG after the 90 day blanking period  Minimum of 30 seconds on Holter/TTM and 10 seconds on 12 -lead ECG o A reablation for the treatment of recurrent AF/AT/AFL after the 90 day blanking period o Class I or III antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) dose increase from the historic maximum ineffective dose (prior to the ablation procedure) or initiation of a new Class I or III AAD after the 90 day blanking period . Note: remaining on the same pre -ablation dose or decreased dose, or re - initiation of a previously failed or not tolerated Class I or III AAD after the 90 day blanking is not considered a failure. o Ablation using RF in the left atrium Blanking period is defined as the first 90 days after the index ablation procedure. Recurrences of atrial arrhythmias during the blanking period will not be counted in the determination of the first clinical failure for the primary endpoint. Within the blanking period, recurrent arrhythmias can be managed with antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion or one cryo re -ablation procedure of the pulmonary veins. Titration of Class I and III antiarrhythmic medications are allowed during the blanking period. Subjects are allowed to remain on Class I or III antiarrhythmic medications at the historic maximum ineffec tive dose (on prior to the ablation procedure) after the 90 day post -procedure blanking period. Acute procedural failure is defined as: o Inability to isolate all accessible targeted pulmonary veins (minimally assessed for entrance block and, where assessable, exit block) during the index procedure o Left atrial non -PVI ablations including but not limited to, ablation of linear lesions complex fractionated electrograms or non -PV triggers 2. Primary Safety : Demonstrate an acceptable safety profile of the pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation procedure.

Rationale The study has primary objective s designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Arctic Front Advance and Freezor MAX Cardiac CryoAblation Catheters for treatment of drug refractory symptomatic persistent AF . In the United States , there are no ablation catheters approved to treat subjects with persistent AF. The study will provide subjects with more options for treatment and the possibility of improving their health, quality of life and a decrease in stroke risk . If successful, the STOP Persistent AF study will demonstrate meaningful therapeutic benefit in this underserved population. This evaluation will support an indication expansion for the treatment of recurrent, symptomatic persistent AF. The study will be considered successful if it meets the primary objectives , contingent upon FDA review and approval. 9. Product Description 9.1.

Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheters Approved indication in the US and Japan: The Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheters are indicated for the treatment of drug refractory recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . Investigational indication in the US and Japan: The Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheters are indicated for the treatment of drug refractory recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation . Approved indication in Europe an d Canada: The Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter is indicated for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation. The catheters are sterile, single use, minimally invasive intravascular balloon catheters specifically designed for tissu e cryoablation. The Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter is used together with the CryoConsole and related devices . Arctic Front Advance catheters are percutaneously advanced to the heart chamber from the femoral access via a transseptal sheath in the vasculature. Once the catheter reaches the left atrium, the balloon is inflated and the cooling segment creates circumferential lesions at the antrum o f the targeted pulmonary veins. 9.1.2. Freezor MAX Cardiac CryoAblation Catheters Approved indication in the US and Japan: The Freezor MAX Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter is used as an adjunctive device in the endocardial treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in conjunction with the A rctic Front Advanc e Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter . Investigational indication in the US and Japan: The Freezor MAX Cardiac CryoAblation Catheters are indicated for use as an adjunctive device in the endocardial treatment of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation in conjunction with the Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter for the following uses: gap cryoablation to complete electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins, cryoablation of focal trigger sites and creation of ablation line between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve. Approved indi cation in Europe and Canada: The Freezor MAX Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter is intended for use in treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The Freezor MAX Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter is a flexible, steerable catheter used to ablate cardiac tissue. It is used t ogether with the CryoConsole and related components. The 8mm tip of the focal Freezor MAX Cryocatheter reaches cryoablation temperatures when refrigerant is injected from the CryoConsole to the tip of the catheter. The catheter tip has an integrated thermocouple for temperature reading capability. The catheter is introduced into the vasculature by traditional minimally invasive techniques. 9.1.3. FlexCath Advance Steerable Sheath The FlexCath Advance Steerable Sheath is a percutaneous introducer fitted with a hemostasis valve to allow for introduction, withdrawal and swapping of catheters and wires while providing a barrier preventing air ingress into the valve and minimizing blood loss. A si de-port with stopcock is integrated into the hemostasis valve to allow continuous drip infusion, injection through the center lumen, flushing, aspiration, blood sampling and pressure monitoring. The FlexCath Advance Steerable Sheath is intended to allow s heath deflection to facilitate catheter positioning. It is supplied sterile and packaged together with a dilator."

Achieve Mapping Catheter The Achieve Mapping Catheter is an intra- cardiac electrophysiology diagnostic catheter indicated for multiple elect rode electrophysiological mapping of the cardiac structures of the heart, i.e., recording or stimulation only. The Achieve Mapping Catheter is designed to obtain electrograms in th e atrial regions of the heart. 9.1.5. CryoConsole The console houses the electronics and software for controlling and recording the ablation procedure, stores and controls delivery of liquid refrigerant under high pressure through the co -axial umbilical to the catheter, recovers the expanded refrigerant vapor from the catheter under vac uum, and disposes of the refrigerant through the hospital scavenging system. The hardware controls the safety monitoring system while the software provides the user interface subject information, procedure temperature, time set point in automatic mode and procedure data information. 9.1.6. Coaxial Umbilical The s terile c oaxial umbilical delivers the Nitrous Oxide (N2O) gas from the console to the catheter and transports refrigerant vapors from the catheter to the console, which is then vented into the hospital scavenging system. 9.1.7. Electrical Umbilical The s terile electrical umbilical is an electrical extension cable that transports: • Temperature feedback from the catheter to the console • Leak detection signals from the catheter to the console • Blood sensor signals from the catheter to the console • Pressure sensor form the catheter to the console 9.1.8. Manual Retraction Kit The M anual R etraction Kit contains one large syringe, one 3 -way stopcock and a coaxial -to-luer adaptor. The kit is used during the rewrap procedure of the Arctic Front Advance catheter if the Investigator cannot retract the catheter using the normal catheter retraction cycle. 9.1.9."

Role of the Sponsor Sponsor representatives may provide support as required for the study under supervision of the Principal Investigator, including: • Provide study training relevant and pertinent to the involvement of personnel conducting study activities and Investigator responsibilities • Technical support during the procedures under the supervision of a study I nvestigator, but no data entry, shall be p erformed by Medtronic personnel or their representatives at center s • Monitoring and auditing activities 14.3. Subject Consent Patient informed consent (PIC) is defined as a legally effective documented confirmation of a subject’s (or their legally authorized representative except in Europe) voluntary agreement to participate in a particular clinical study after information has been given to the subject on all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the subject’s decision to participate. This process includes obtaining a PIC F orm and an Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health Information that has been approved by the study center’s IRB/MEC and signed and dated by the subject or their legally authorized representative (except in Europe) . A subject may only consent after information has been given to the subject on all aspects of the clinical investigation that are relevant to the subject’s decision to participate. Informed consent may be given by the ir legally authorized representative (except in Europe) only if a subject is unable to make the decision to participate in a clinical investigation. In such cases, the subject shall also be informed about the clinical investigation within his/her ability to understand. Prior to enrolling subjects, the PIC Form must have been approved by each center’s IRB/MEC. Each site must also use an Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health Information/Research Authorization/other privacy language as required by law . The PIC Form must be controlled (i. e. versioned and/or dated) to ensure it is clear which version(s) were approved by the IRB/MEC. Any adaptation of the sample PIC Form must be reviewed and approved by Medtronic and the IRB reviewing the application prior to enrolling subjects. The I nvest igator must notify the subject (or their legally -authorized representative) of any significant new findings about the study that become available during the course of the study which are pertinent to the safety and well -being of the subject . This could imp act a subject’s willingness to participate in the study. If relevant, approval may be requested from subjects to confirm their continued participation. Prior to initiation of any study -specific procedures, documented informed consent must be obtained from the subject (or their legally authorized representative). Likewise, privacy or health information protection regulation may require subjects to sign additional forms to authorize centers to submit subject information to the study sponsor. The informed consent process must be conducted by the principal I nvestigator or an authorized designee, and the PIC Form and the Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health Information/Research Authorization /other privacy language as required by law must be given to the subject (or their legally authorized representative) in a language he/she is able to read and understand. The process of informed consent must be conducted without using coercion , undue or improper influence on , or inducement of the subject to participate by the I nvestigator or other center personnel. The informed consent process shall not wa ive or appear to waive the subject’s legal rights. The language used shall be as"
37,page_37,"056-F275, Clinical Inves tigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 Page 38 of 115 Version 4 , 10NOVO016 Confidential non -technical as possible and must be understandable to the subject and the impartial witness, where applicable. The subject must have ample time and opportunity to read and understand the PIC F orm, to inquire about details of the study, and to decide whether or not to participate in the clinical study. All questions about the study sh ould be answered to the satisfaction of the subject. When the subject decides to participat e in the clinical study, the PIC Form and the Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health Information/Research Authorization /other privacy language as required by law must be signed and personally dated by the subject (or their legally authorized representative) and either the Investigator or the I nvestigator’s authorized designee, as required by local law . If applicable, witness shall also sign and personally date the consent form to attest that the information in the PIC Form was accurately explained and clearly understood by the subject, and that informed consent was freely given. In Europe and Japan, include a personally dated signature by the Principal I nve stigator or authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed consent process. The Principal I nvestigator or designee must conduct the informed consent discussion. A copy of the PIC Form and the Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health Information/Research Authorization /other privacy language as required by law , signed and dated as required by law, must be provided to the subject. If consent is obtained the same day the subject begins participating in study -related procedures, it must be documented in the subject’s case history that consent was obtained prior to participation in any study - related procedures. It is best practice for the informed consent process to be documented in the subject’s case history, regardless of circumstance. In the event the subject cannot read and/or write, a witnessed (impartial third party) PIC F orm will be allowed, provided detailed documentation of the process is recorded in the subject’s case history and the witness signs and dates the PIC F orm . In Europe, when a subject cannot read and/or write, an independent witness shall be present throughout the process, the written PIC Form and any other information shall be read aloud and explained to the prospective subject. The subject should “make his mark” (sign or otherwise physically mark the document so as to indicate consent) on the PIC Form as well. The PIC F orm should document the method used for communication with the prospective subject and the specific means by which the prospective subject communicated agreement to participate in the study. The original of the signed PIC Form and the Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health Information/Research Authorization /other privacy language as required by law must be filed in the hospital/clinical chart and/or with the subject’s study documents. PIC Form (in Japan, the signature page only) and the Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health Information/Research Authorization/other privacy language as required by law should also be available for mon itoring and auditing. Any Medtronic Field personnel who support the study procedure must be able to review the subject’s signed and dated PIC F orm and verify its completeness prior to proceeding with the procedure. In the event the Medtronic Field personnel identify a PIC F orm as being incomplete, the study procedure will not be allowed to occur until the consent of the subject can be adequately and appropriately obtained. In Japan, only the monitor assigned to the study may be able to review the signed PIC Form prior to the study procedure."

Enrollment, Baseline and Pre- ablation When a patient and the Principal I nvestigator or authorized designee , as required , have signed and dated the PIC F orm, the patient is considered a subject enrolled in the study. The date the subject signed the PIC Form and Authorization to Use and Disclose Personal Health Information/Research Authorization/other privacy language as required by law must be documented in the subject’s medical records. The baseline visit can be a standalone visit or can be performed on the same day but prior to the cryoablation procedure. The following evaluations will be performed after consent, unless previously performed as part of routine clinical evaluations within the specified windows: Within 6 months prior to consent date: • Trans -thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) for the collection of left atrial size, left ventricular ejection fraction, an d mitral valve impairment. A repeat TTE procedure for the purpose of the study after the consent date is not required if a TTE was performed within 6 months of the consent date and all data are available. After consent date but prior to procedure: Note: The time between the consent date and the procedure should not exceed 30 days . • Assessment of all factors specified for evaluation under Inclusion Criteria and Exclusion Criteria (Section 12 ) • Demographics • Medical history • Physical examination • Pregnancy screen (female subjects of child bearing potential only) • 12- lead ECG • Review of AF and anticoagulation medications • SF-12 health s urvey and AFEQT Questionnaire • Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) o When performed, the TEE should occur within one day (on the day of or within th e day prior to) the planned ablation procedure. o A TEE should be performed in all subjects with atrial fibrillation more than 48 hours in duration or of an unknown duration if adequate systemic anticoagulation has not been maintained for at least 3 weeks prior to the ablation procedure. o Performance of a TEE in subjects who are in sinus rhythm at the time of ablati on or eligible subjects that have been in AF for 48 hours or less prior to AF ablation may be considered but is not mandatory. o The subject will not proceed with the study ablation procedure and will be exited from the study if a left atrial thrombus is visualized. • if enrolled in the sub- study (see Appendix B)"

Procedure Perform the pulmonary vein isolation procedure using Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter . If needed, a Freezor MAX Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter may also be utilized for gap ablation to complete electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins and creation of ablation line s between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve . The Investigator is to perform the procedure according to the procedural steps in this CIP and the Instructions for Use for the Arctic Front Advance and Freezor MAX Cardiac CryoAblation Catheters . Appropriate sedation and venous access should be attained at the Investigator’s standard practice acco rding to their institution’ s pre -established procedures/guidelines at the time of the procedure. Current recommendations for anticoagulation are found in the 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of Atrial Fibrill ation1, 2014 Focused Update on the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation18 and Guidelines for indications and procedural techniques of catheter ablation.19 Only the Medtronic FlexCath sheath family should be used with the Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter. The use of other sheaths may damage the device. The Investigator may choose compatible guidewires and mapping catheters at his or her discretion. 14.5.1. Esophageal Visualization and Temperature Monitoring a. Ensure an esophageal temperature monitor is used for each cryoablation application. Cease cryoablation if the te mperature reaches ≤15°C. 14.5.2. Peri -procedural Anticoagulation a. Heparin should be administered prior to or immediately following transseptal puncture during AF ablation procedures and adjusted to achieve and maintain an ACT of 300 to 400 seconds or per standard c enter guidelines . b. Performance of AF ablation in a subject systemically anticoagulated with warfarin or novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) does not alter the need for intravenous heparin to maintain a therapeutic ACT during the procedure . c. Administration of protamine following ablation to reverse heparin should be considered . 14.5.3. Diaphragm Movement a. Continuous p hrenic nerve pacing must be performed for all right sided pulmonary vein cryoapplications and should be considered for all cryoapplications . Additional method s of phrenic nerve monitoring are recommended. 18 Verma, A, MD, et al. 201 4 Focused Update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation.

Every effort consistent with subject welfare should be made to treat all PVs or their anomalous equivalents . b. The Arctic Front Advance will be advanced into the left atrium over the Achieve catheter or guidewire and inflated. Once inflated, the catheter will be tracked over the Achieve catheter or guidewire and positioned at the entrance of the PV . c. Assess the positioning, contact and occlusion of the PV by the ca theter’s balloon by injection of contrast material, ultrasound imaging, or other technique. Reposition as needed . d. Each pulmonary vein should be minimally assessed for entrance block and, where assessable, exit block to demonstrate electrical isolation . e. It is recommended that the Investigator use cryoapplications of three (3) minutes each. Once PV isolation has been achieved , one (1) additional application of three (3) minutes at the same PV should be performed; however, it is up to the operator’s discretion to assess application time and necessity of a bonus freeze given factors such as time to isolation of first application, temperature of first applic ation, risk of collateral damage, etc. f. Upon the Investigator’s assessment of procedure completion, Isop roterenol and/or adenosine may be used to assess pulmonary vein isolation. 14.5.5. Other Ablations during Index Procedure a. Ablation of the c avotricuspid isthmus, with the goal of achieving bi -directional isthmus block, is required for subjects with a history of typical atrial flutter or inducible cavotricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter. It is recommended to attempt an induction of cavotricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter if the subject does not have a history of this arrh ythmia. A ny commercially released catheter deemed appropriate for the procedure may be used . b. Left atrial non -PVI ablations including but not limited to, ablation of linear lesions, complex fractionated electrograms or non -PV triggers will be treated as a primary endpoint failure . Ablation using RF in the left atrium will be treated as a primary endpoint failure. c. Additional right atrial ablations may be performed if clinically necessary. 14.5.6. Cardioversion a. Electrical or pharmacological c ardiovers ion to sinus rhythm must be attempted following the PVI portion of the procedure if sinus rhythm wasn’t restored. 14.5.7. Procedure Documentation During the procedure the I nvestigator will document the following:"
41,page_41,"056-F275, Clinical Inves tigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 Page 42 of 115 Version 4 , 10NOVO016 Confidential • Catheter s used (i.e. Arctic Front Advance, Freezor MAX and Achieve Mapping Catheter, etc. ) • Minimum temperature for each cryoapplication • Minimum esophageal temperature for each PV • Duration of each cryoapplication • Vein location for each cryoapplication (e.g. right superior PV) • Use of phrenic nerve pacing or o ther phrenic nerve monitoring technique for each cryoapplication, specifically those cryoapplications surrounding the RS and RI PVs • Demonstrated electrical block and, if real -time signals are available, time to isolation • Adjunctive catheters, mapping or visualization devices, sedation type, procedure information, esophageal temperature, ACT, cardioversion use and fluoroscopy time will be collected 14.6. Hospital Discharge At or shortly before hospital discharge, the following will be performed and collected: • Adve rse event assessment • Review medications • 12- lead ECG • Review study requirements with the subject to help ensure compliance with follow -up procedures Systemic anticoagulation with warfarin or a direct thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitor is recommended for at least two months following the AF ablation procedure, however the anticoagulation treatment will be at the Investigator’s discretion according to established guidelines. Decisions regarding the continuation of systemic ant icoagulation agents more than two months following ablation should be based on the subject’s risk factors for stroke a nd not on the presence of AF.1,21,22 14.7. Medications It is recommended to discontinue the use of Class I and III antiarrhythmic medication by the end of the 90 day post -procedure blanking period. Up -titration of the dose is allowed only in the 90 day post -procedure blanking period . Info rmation regarding medications prescribed for anticoagulation or to treat atrial arrhythmias, including the medication name, purpose for use, start and stop dates, and route of administration , will be collected from subject enrollment through study exit ."
42,page_42,"056-F275, Clinical Inves tigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 Page 43 of 115 Version 4 , 10NOVO016 Confidential 14.7.1. Class I and III antiarrhythmic medication use after the 90 day post -procedure blanking period • Subjects are allowed to remain on Class I or III antiarrhythmic medication s at the historic maximum ineffective dose (on prior to the ablation procedure) after the 90 day post -procedure blanking period . • Subjects may re -initiat e, at any point during follow -up, a Class I or III antiarrhythmic medication that failed or was not tolerated prior to the ablation procedure at the same or lower dose. • Initiati on of a new Class I or III anti arrhythmic medication after the 90 day post -procedure blanking period will be treated as a primary endpoint failure . • Remaining on a dose higher than the historic maximum ineffective dose (on prior to the ablation procedure) after the 90 day post -procedure blanking period will be treated as a primary endpoint failure. All medications are permitted in the study with the exception of investigational drugs that may confound the study results. 14.8. Permissible Repeat Cryoablations Pulmonary vein isolation using Arctic Front Advance following the same procedure described in 14.5 is allowed one time in the 90 day post -procedure blanking period. Right atrial ablations may be performed using any catheter deemed appropriate for the procedure. Left atrial ablations of non -PV triggers, complex fractionated electrograms and ablation of linear lesion s will be treated as a primary endpoint failure. Ablation using RF in the left atrium will be treated as a primary endpoint failure. Repeat ablation procedure s will be documented on a n electronic case report form ( eCRF ). The subject’s procedures and follow -up windows will continue based on the index cryoballoon ablation procedure date. 14.9. Cardioversions Electrically and pharmacologically c ardioverting the subject to sinus rhythm is allowed with in the 90 day post -procedure blanking period at the discret ion of the Investigator. 14.10. Scheduled Follow -up Visits After receiving notice of completed study procedure, Medtronic will provide the target dates and windows for each visit to the center . Should a subject miss a visit or the visit fall outside the pre -speci fied window, a study deviation must be reported and the original follow -up schedule maintained for subsequent visits. Data analyses include follow -up visits, regardless of whether the visit occurs within the window. Therefore, a late visit is preferred over a missed visit but must be accompanied by a deviation. Follow -up visit windows are listed in Table 8 and are based on days after the index ablation procedure."

Assessment of Safety The primary safety objective is based on the Adverse Event data collected. Further information on the collection of Adverse Events is discussed in Section 18. 14.17. Recording Data The study will collect data using Oracle Clinical, an electronic data management system for clinical studies. Centers will enter data onto case report forms ( CRFs) within an Oracle Clinical database. The Holter /TTM /12-lead ECG core lab will also enter data onto CRFs within a separate Oracle Clinical database. Data reported on the CRFs shall be derived from source documents, which may include worksheets, quality of life questionnaires, patient medical records and ECG data . Thes e source documents must be created and maintained by the center personnel . Further detail on data management is provided in Section 20.2. 14.18. Deviation Handling A study deviation is defined as an event within a study that did not occur according to the CIP or the Clinical Trial Agreement. Prior approval by Medtronic is expected in situations where the I nvestigator anticipates, contemplates, or makes a conscious decision to deviate. In countries following ISO 14155:2011, prior approval for study deviations will be reported to local authorities and ethics boards per local requirements. If the deviation affects subject’s rights, safety and well -being, or the scienti fic integrity of the study, prior approval from ethics board and/or competent authority is also required, depending on local legislations. Prior approval is not required when a deviation is necessary to protect the safety, rights or well -being of a subject in an emergency or in unforeseen situations beyond the I nvestigator’s control (e.g. subject failure to attend scheduled follow -up visits, inadvertent loss of data due to computer malfunction, inability to perform required procedures due to subject illnes s). A study deviation is not required if a subject misses a weekly TTM transmission. For medically justifiable conditions which preempt a subject’s ability to complete a study -required procedure, it may be permitted to report only one deviation which will apply to all visits going forward. This may also apply for other unforeseen situations (e.g. the subject permanently refuses to complete a study required procedure and the data will not contribute to the primar y end point analysis). However, prior approval from Medtronic is required for such situations. All study deviations must be reported on the eCRF regardless of whether medically justifiable, pre- approved by Medtronic, an inadvertent occurrence, or taken to protect the subject in an emergency. The dev iation description must be recorded with an explanation for the deviation. In the event the deviation involves a failure to obtain a subject’s consent, or is made to protect the life or physical well- being of a subject in an emergency, the deviation must be reported to the IRB/MEC as well as Medtronic within five (5) working days. In Japan, the deviation must be immediately reported to Head of Medical Institute ( HOMI ), to the Ethics Board via the HOMI, and to Medtronic. Reporting of study deviations shoul d comply with IRB/MEC policies , local laws and/or regulatory agency requirements and must be reported to Medtronic as soon as possible upon the center becoming aware of the deviation. Refer to Investigator Reports, Section 20.5.2, for specific deviation reporting requirements and timeframes for reporting to Medtronic and/or regulatory bodies."
47,page_47,"056-F275, Clinical Inves tigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 Page 48 of 115 Version 4 , 10NOVO016 Confidential Medtronic is responsible for analyzing deviations, assess ing their significance, and identifying any additional corrective and/or preventive actions (e.g. amend the CIP , conduct additional training, and terminate the investigation). Repetitive or serious Investigator compliance issues may result in initiation of a corrective action plan with the I nvestigator and center , and in some cases, necessitate suspending enrollment until the problem is resolved or ultimately terminating the I nvestigator's participation in the study. Medtronic will provide center -specific reports to I nvestigators summarizing information on deviations that occurred at the investigational center on a periodic basis. 14.19. Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation A subjec t can withdraw from the study or the sub -study at any time. If the subject wishes to exit from the study (i.e. the subject revokes consent), the center is required to docu ment the reason for exit on an e CRF. In addition, c ent ers shall follow the regulations set forth by their IRB/MEC . It is recommended to follow the subject until all ongoing device and/or procedure- related adverse events are resolved or unresolved with no further actions planned. For countries following ISO, permis sion may be requested to follow -up with the subject outside of the study due to withdrawal based on problems related to the study device safety or performance. Following exit, subjects will continue to receive standard medical care. All data avail able through the time of the subject’s exit will be used for analysis. Reasons for study exit include : • Subject has completed follow -up • Subject lost to follow -up • Subject did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria after consent and did not undergo an ablation procedure • An Ar ctic Front Advance catheter was not used during the subject’s ablation procedure • Subject did not provide consent or data use protection authorization • Subject chooses to withdraw (e.g., consent withdrawal, relocation to another geographic location) • Investigator deems withdrawal necessary (e.g., medically justified, inclusion/exclusion criteria not met, failure of subject to maintain adequate study compliance) • The sponsor decides the study will be closed or a particular center will be closed The following information is required to be collected at study exit: • Reason for exit must be documented on the e CRF and in the subject’s medical record In the case that the subject is determined to be lost to follow -up, details of a minimum of two attempts and the method of attempt (e.g., one letter and one phone record or two letters) to contact the subject must be recorded. An unscheduled office visit should be attempted if the subject exits the study outside of a scheduled follow - up visit."

Potential Risks Medtronic follows rigorous Quality Assurance and Control procedures throughout the life of a product, from the business analysis phase through development, market release, and post -market surveillance. The residual risks associated with the Arctic Front Adva nce and Freezor MAX Cardiac CryoAblation Catheters have been found to be acceptable and have been mitigated to the fullest extent possible. The potential benefits related to the use of the Ar ctic Fron t Adva nce and Freezor MAX Cardiac CryoAblation Catheters have been determined to outweigh any potential risks. Neither device has been recalled. There are potential risks and side effects associated with ablation procedures. The I nvestigator shall describe risks in further detail when asked by the subject. The risks must be continuously monitored, assessed and documented by the Investigator. Possible additional risks for participating in the study include the following (although others are possible): • Anemia -deficiency of red blood cells or of hemoglobin in t he blood resulting in weariness • Anxiety -a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease • Back pain -pain felt in the lower or upper back • Bronchitis, cough, pneumonia -inflammation of t he lungs can b e caused by a virus or bacteria • Cardiac tamponade -pressure on the heart as a result of fluid collecting in the sac surrounding the heart • Cardiopulmonary arrest -cessation of blood circulation and/or respiration due to dysfun ction of the heart and/or lungs • Chest discomfort/pain/pressure -includes a range of feeling from sharp stabbing to dull ache in the chest • Cold feeling -having a low or inadequate temperature • Complications associated with contrast agents -adverse effects of contrast agents used during the procedure (e.g. allergic reaction or radio contrast nephropathy) • Complications associated with medications commonly utilized during the procedure -known risks of medications commonly used during the procedure (e.g. narcotics, anxiolytics, other p ain medi cations, anti -vasospasm agents) • Complications at catheter insertion site in the groin: o AV fistula -an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein (i.e., cause by needle insertion through the femoral artery and vein) o Hematoma/Bruising -a collecti on of blood in the tissue surrounding the catheter insertion site o Infection -localized redness, heat swelling and pain at the catheter insertion site o Pain -discomfort at the catheter insertion site tha t can range from mild to severe"

Risk Minimization Medtronic has attempted to minimize the potential risks to subjects in the study by taking the following actions:"
51,page_51,"056-F275, Clinical Inves tigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 Page 52 of 115 Version 4 , 10NOVO016 Confidential • Selecting qualified Investigators and training study personnel on the CIP • Requiring that I nvestigators be actively involved in the procedure and follow -up of the subjects who undergo a study procedure • Providing guidelines for s ubject selection and evaluati on • Requiring that subjects be followed at regular intervals following the ablation procedure to monitor for recurrence of atrial arrhythmias a nd to assess for adverse events 15.3. Potential Benefits The Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter may redu ce or eliminate persistent atrial fibrillation in subjects; however , some subjects may not receive this benefit. The information gained from the study could result in improved management of atrial fibrillation. 15.4. Risk -Benefit Rationale The cohort of subjects for inclusion in the study is symptomatic as a result of their persistent atrial f ibrillation and the failure of C lass I or I II antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Cryoa blation therapy offers the opportunity to reduce the episodes o f atrial fibrillation and therefore reduce the subject’s risk of stroke and symptoms. In the United States , there are no ablation catheters approved to treat subjects with persistent atrial fibrillation. If successful, the STOP Persistent AF study could demonst rate meaningful therapeutic benefit in this underserved population. In Japan, there are limited options for physicians to choose for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation. If successful, the STOP Persistent AF study could demonstrate meaningful therapeutic benefit in this underserved population. In Canada and Europe, t he Arctic Front Advance ablation catheters are approved to treat subjects with persistent atrial fibrillation. If successful, the STOP Persistent AF study could confirm meaningful therapeutic benefit in this underserved population. 16. Adverse Event and Device Deficiencies Assessment Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information for clinical studies are crucial for the protection of subjects. Reporting and analysis of safety data are mandated by regulatory authorities worldwide. Medtronic has established procedures in conformity with worldwide regulatory requirements to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information. The study is conducted in accordanc e with these procedures and regulations. Since the safety reporting requirements and classification systems vary for each regulatory agency, requirements from all geographies are taken into account for the collection and reporting of safety information."

Device Deficiencies Device deficiency (DD) information will be collected throughout the study and reported to Medtronic. Note that device deficiencies that result in an adverse device effect (ADE) to the subject should be captured as an Adverse Event only. Device deficiencies that did not lead to an AE but could have led to a Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) (i.e., if suitable action had not been taken, if intervention had not been made, or if the circumstances had been less fortunate) require immediate reporting. For AEs/DDs that require immediate reporting, initial reporting may be done by contacting the study sponsor per the sponsor contact information . 16.4. Processing Updates and Resolution For any changes in status of a previously reported adverse event (i.e. change in actions taken, change in outcome, change in relatedness), an update to the original AE must be provided. All adverse events must be followed until the adverse event has been resolved, is unresolved with no further actions planned, the subject exits the study or until study closure, whichever occurs first. In the event that a subject is exited from the study prior to study closure, all efforts should be made to continue follow ing the subject until all unresolved procedure or system related adverse events, as classified by the I nvestigator, are resolved or they are unresolved with no further actions planned. At the time of study exit, all adverse events with an outcome of “Unresolved, further actions or treatment planned” must be reviewed and an update to the original AE must be reported. At a minimum, if there are no changes to the description, relatedness, test and procedures or actions taken, the outcome must be updated to reflect “Unresolved at time of study closure.” 16.5. Reporting of Adverse Events and Device Deficiencies All reported adverse events and device deficiencies will be reviewed by a Medtronic repr esentative. AEs will be classified according to the definitions provided. Upon receipt of adverse events at Medtronic, a Medtronic representative will review the adverse event/device deficiency for completeness and accuracy and when necessary will request clarification and/or additional information from the Investigator. Medtronic will utilize MedDRA, the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, to assign a MedDRA term for each adverse event based on the information provided by the I nvestigator. Regu latory reporting of AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE will be completed according to local regulatory requirements. Refer to Section 20.5 for a list of required I nvestigator and Medtronic reporting requirements and timeframes.

Subject Death All subject deaths must be reported by the Investigator to Medtronic on an adverse event eCRF (AE with outcome of death) as soon as possible after the Investigator first learns of the death. There should be one AE with the outcome of death . A copy of the death certificate, if available and allowed by state/local law, should be sent to the Medtronic clinical study team. When a death occurs in a hospital, a copy of the death summary report and all relevant hospital records should be sent to the Medtronic clinical study team, if available. If an autopsy is conducted, the autopsy report should also be sent to the Medtronic clinical study team if available and allowed by state/local law. When the death occurs at a remote center, it is the investigative center’s responsibility to attempt retrieval of information about the death. In summary, the following data will be collected: • Date of death • Detailed description of death • Cause of deat h • Relatedness to device and/or procedure • Death summary/hospital records (if available and allowed by state/local law) • Autopsy report (if available and allowed by state/local law) • Death certificate (if available and/or allowed by state/local law) 16.6.1. Death Cla ssification and Reporting Sufficient information will be required in order to properly classify the subject’s death. The Investigator shall classify each subject death per the following definitions: • Cardiac Death : A death directly related to the electrical or mechanical dysfunction of the heart. • Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD): Natural death due to cardiac causes, indicated by abrupt loss of consciousness within one hour of the onset of acute symptoms; preexisting heart disease may have been known to be present, but the time and mode of death are unexpected. If time of onset cannot be determined, SCD will alternatively be defined as any unexpected cardiac death occurring out of the hospital or in the emergency room as dead on arrival. • Non -sudden Cardiac Death : All cardiac deaths that are not classified as sudden deaths, including all cardiac deaths of hospitalized subjects on inotropic support. • Non -cardiac Death: A death not classified as a cardiac death. • Unknown Classification: Unknown death classification is i ntended for use only when there is insufficient or inadequate information to classify the death. The CEC will review deaths and provide a final adjudication of the primary cause of death and cardiac classification. Regulatory reporting of Subject Deaths will be completed according to local regulatory requirements. 16.7. Product Complaint Reporting In geographies where devices are market -released, product complaint reporting is applicable. This includes when an AE is related to a market -released device during the study. The reporting of product complaints is"

Refer to local regulations for reporting requirements. Product Complaint: Any written, electronic or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of a medical device that has been placed on the market. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to report all product complaint(s) associated with a medical device distributed by Medtronic, regardless whether they are related to intended use, misuse or abuse of the product. Reporting must be done immediately and via the regular channels for market -released pro ducts. Medtronic will notify the regulatory authorities (e.g. FDA) as applicable for the following incidents immediately upon learning of them: • Any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequac y in the labeling or instructions for use which led or might have led to the death or serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user, or other person. • Any technical or medical reason resulting in withdrawal of a device from the market by t he manufacturer. • A serious deterioration in the state of heath includes: o Life -threatening illness or injury o Permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure o A condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to preven t permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure The Investigator and Medtronic must abide by the reporting requirements shown in Section 20.5 . 17. Data Review Committees At regular intervals, an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will review and adjudicate, at a minimum, all system (cryoablation and ) related and all procedure related adverse events, as well as all deaths for subjects participating in the study. The CE C will consist of a minimum of three (3) non -Medtronic employed physicians that are not participating Investigator s for the study, including a CEC chairperson. Medtronic personn el may facilitate and participate in a CEC meeting but will be non -voting members. For adverse events and deaths reviewed by the CE C, Medtronic will provide the CE C with the Investigator’s description and classification. The CE C is responsible for reviewin g the Investigator’s assessment and supportive documentation (when available), reviewing applicable definitions, and determining final classifications for all adjudication parameters. Associated imaging studies (i.e. CT, MRI, x -ray, etc.) may be requested, if available, for all serious adverse events with possible relatedness to the system or procedure listed in Section 18.3.2 to support adjudication. Additionally, the CEC will provide an adjudication of the death classification for all reported deaths including primary cause of death and cardiac classification . If the CEC disagrees with the Investigator ’s classification of the event, the rationale will be provided to the Investigator . If the Investigator agrees with the CEC’s adjudication, the eCRF documenting the event will be updated accordingly."
64,page_64,"056-F275, Clinical Inves tigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 Page 65 of 115 Version 4 , 10NOVO016 Confidential If the Investigator does not agree with the CE C’s adjudication classification, both determinations will be provided within the final report; however, the CE C’s adjudication will be used for data analysis. The disagreement will also be included in reporting to IRB/MECs and regulatory authorities, if required. 18. Statistical Design and Methods 18.1. General Considerations Two analysis cohorts have been defined for this study: 1. PMA -S cohort ( US/Canada/Europe cohort ) – subjects from US, Canada, and Europe centers 2. PMDA cohort ( US/Canada/Europe/Japan cohort ) –subjects from US, Canada, Europe , and Japan centers Analysis methods are detailed for all objectives in sections 18.1 - 18.5 . The same methods will be used for both the PMA-S cohort, and also the PMDA cohort. The estimated sample sizes are 150 subjects for the PMA -S cohort, and 165 subjects for the PMDA cohort . The PMDA cohort will have a slight increase in statistical power given 165 subjects will be utilized versus 150. The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be created prior to data analysis and include a comprehensive description of the statistical methods to be included in study report s. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the CIP will require an amendment only if it changes a principal feature of the CIP. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the CIP, and the justification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report. Medtronic employees or their designated representatives will perform all statistical analyses. 18.2. Analysis Timing 18.2.1. PMA -S Submission At the completion the last 12 month visit from the enrolled and treated US, Canada and Europe subjects, a PMA -S will be submitted to the FDA. Study data from the Japanese centers will not be included in the PMA -S submissio n but will be made available . 18.2.2. PMDA Submission At the completion the last 12 month visit from the enrolled and treated Japan subjects, a report will be submitted to Japan PMDA. Study data from all enrolled and treated subjects (US, Canada, Europe, and Japan) will be included. 18.3. Primary Objectives 18.3.1. Primary Efficacy Objective Demonstrate an acceptable efficacy success rate at 12 months after the pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation procedure. Hypothesis"
65,page_65,"056-F275, Clinical Inves tigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 Page 66 of 115 Version 4 , 10NOVO016 Confidential The following hypothesis will be tested in a one -sided t est at the 0.025 significance level: Ho: PS ≤ 40% Ha: PS > 40 % Where PS is the probability of treatment success at 12 months. Endpoint Definition Treatment success is defined as freedom from treatment failure. Treatment failure is defined as any of the following components: o Acute procedural failure o Documented AF/AT/ AFL on Holter /TTM /12-lead ECG after the 90 day blanking period  Minimum of 30 seconds on Holter/TTM and 10 seconds on 12 -lead ECG o A reablation for the treatment of recurrent AF/AT/AFL after the 90 day blanking period o Class I or III antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) dose increase from the historic maximum ineffective dose (prior to the ablation procedure) or initiation of a new Class I or III AAD after t he 90 day blanking period . Note: remaining on the same pre -ablation dose or decreased dose, or re - initiation of a previously failed or not tolerated Class I or III AAD after the 90 day blanking is not considered a failure. Subjects are allowed to remain o n Class I or III antiarrhythmic medications at the historic maximum ineffective dose (on prior to the ablation procedure) after the 90 day post -procedure blanking period. o Ablation using RF in the left atrium Blanking period is defined as the first 90 days after the index ablation procedure. Recurrences of atrial arrhythmias during the blanking period will not be counted in the determination of the first clinical failure for the primary end point. Within the blanking period, recurrent arrhythmias can be managed with antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion or one cryo re -ablation procedure of the pulmonary veins. Titration of Class I and III antiarrhythmic medications are allowed during the blan king period. Acute procedural failure is defined as: o Inability to isolate all accessible targeted pulmonary veins (minimally assessed for entrance block and, where assessable, exit block) during the index procedure o Left atrial non -PVI ablations including b ut not limited to, ablation of linear lesions, complex fractionated electrograms or non -PV triggers Analysis Methods The probability of a subject achieving effectiveness success at 12 months (365 days) will be estimated using survival analysis, the Kaplan -Meier method. The standard error will be approximated using Greenwood's formula. A two -sided 95% log -log confidence interval for the probability will be constructed. For every treated subject, day 0 is defined as the day of the index cryoablation proce dure . For subjects with treatment failure, the survival date will be set to the date of the treatment failure . For subjects without treatment failure through 12 months , those subjects will be censored at the last study contact date"
66,page_66,"056-F275, Clinical Inves tigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 Page 67 of 115 Version 4 , 10NOVO016 Confidential recorded on CRF which may include the last study visit, the exit date, or death date. If a subject without a treatment failure is lost to follow -up, the censoring date will be set to the last known study visit date. For the component of the endpoint, documented AF/AT/ AFL , if this documentation resulted from rhythm monitoring occurring at the 12 -month visit within the 12 -month visit window, the date of recurrence will be set to 365 days from the study ablation procedure so that these events will be counted as treatment fai lures in the 12 -month Kaplan -Meier analysis. Performance Requirements If the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval at 12 months is greater than the performance goal of 40% , the objective will be considered met . Rationale for Performance Criteria The choice of twelve month follow -up and acceptable success rate of 40% performance criteria was selected based on the 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation: Recommendations for Patient Selection, Procedural Techniques, Patient Management and Follow -up, Definitions, Endpoints, and Research Trial Design, provides recommendations for success rates in clinical trials. The recommendation for evaluating the efficacy of a treatment for persistent AF is a s follows: “If minimum chronic success rate is selected as an objective effectiveness endpoint for a clinical trial, we recommend that the minimum chronic acceptable success rate for persistent AF at 12 -month follow -up is 40%.”1 Additionally, there is mounting evidence in published literature on the use of catheter ablation in the treatment of persistent AF. Table 12 displays a summary of published literature where the publications report ed on utilizing Arctic Front and Arctic Front Advance catheters for the treatment of patients with persistent AF. The summary includes results published as manuscripts in peer reviewed medical journals. The search criteria were publications on studies where the therapy was the use of the Cryoballoon for a PVI - only approach for persistent AF. There were variations in endpoint definition s and use of antiarrhythmic medications in the reported studies , but on average the data support the criteria from the 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus Statement. A weighted average was calculated at the bottom of the table, resulting in an average efficacy rate of 59.3% . None of the studies utilized weekly TTMs, so due to the additional arrhythmia monitoring, the point estimate for this study has been set to 54%. The weighted average lower 95% confidence bound is 43.8%, and in combination of additional arrhythmia monitoring, support the lower confidence bound OPC of 40%."

The summary estimates 12 -month efficacy to be 59.3%. Due to more stringent endpoint definition, increased monitoring, and the potential for publication bias, this study protocol assumes a 12 month efficacy rate of 54% for the sample size calculation. With 150 enrolled and treated subjects , minus an assumed 10% attrition rate, t he expected number of subjects with 12 months of follow -up at the final analysis is 135. For the US/Canada/Europe/Japan cohort, 165 treated subjects affords 92% power to test the primary endpoint based on the same assumpt ions. With 165 enrolled and treated subjects , minus an assumed 10% attrition rate, t he expected number of subjects with 12 months of follow -up at the final analysis is 148 . Determination of Subjects/Data for Analysis All enrolled subjects who have the Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter inserted into vasculature will be included . Sensitivity Analyses A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to estimate the potential impact of subjects with less than 12 months of follow -up at the final analysis. The mortality rate in this patient population is anticipated to be low. The total assumed attrition rate thr ough one year is 10%. Because the primary endpoint will be tested using survival methods, all treated subjects are included in the primary analysis, and therefore no subjects will have complete missing data. For subjects that exit early, a tipping point analysis will be conducted to estimate the potential impact of subjects with less than 12 -months of follow -up. These subjects will be defined as subjects with partial data. The tipping point analysis methods will be as follows. For each subject with less than 12 -months of follow -up, each subject will be set to treatment failure (failure date set to date of study exit). The 12 -month Kaplan -Meier estimate will be re -calculated with the earliest (closest to index ablation) sequentially added to the Kaplan -Meier analysis, and the results presented in table format. The tipping point will be defined as the number of additional failures in which the 40% OPC is crossed by the lower 95% confidence bound. 18.3.2.

Endpoint Definition A primary safety event is defined as a serious procedure -related or serious system -related adverse event including the following: • Transient ische mic attack (within 7 days of ablation procedure) • Cerebrovascular accident ( within 7 days of ablation procedure) • Major bleeding that requires transfusion (within 7 days of ablation procedure) • Cardiac perforation, tamponade or pericardial effusion ( within 7 days of ablation procedure) • Pulmonary vein stenosis ( >75% reduction within 12 -months of ablation procedure) • Myocardial infarctio n (within 7 days of ablation procedure) • Phrenic nerve injury (unresolved at 12-months ) • Atrio -esophageal fistula ( within 12 -months of ablation procedure ) • Death (within 7 days of ablation procedure) Analysis Methods The probability of a safety event at 12 months (365 days) will be estimated using survival analysis, the Kaplan -Meier method. The standard error will be approximated using Greenwood's formula. A two -sided 95% log -log confidence interval for the probability will be constructed. For every treated subject, day 0 is defined as the day of the index cryoablation procedure . For subjects with a safety event, the survival date will be set to the date of the safety event. For subjects without a safety event, those subjects will be censored at the last study contact date recorded on CRF which may include the last study visit, the exit date, or death date. If a subject without a safety event is lost to follow -up, the censoring date will be set to the last known stud y visit date. For subjects with a repeat ablation within 12 months, the start of the survival analysis will not reset. Day 0 will remain the day of the index cryoablation procedure. Safety events related to the repeat ablation procedure occurring on or prior to 365 days post the index cryoablation procedure will be counted as safety events and count against the primary safety objective. Performance Requirements If the upper bound of the two- sided 95% confidence interval at 12 months is less than the perf ormance goal of 13%, the objective will be considered met.

With 165 enrolled and treated subjects , minus an assumed 10% attrition rate, the expected number of subjects with 12 months of follow -up at the final analysis is 148. Rationale for Performance Criteria The safety endpoint definition is based on the Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff20. The estimated safety rate of 5% was selected based on current rate observed in the STOP AF Post Approval Study (PAS) . Table 13 summarizes the safety event rate in STOP AF PAS. The safety event rate is 2.3% in STOP AF PAS based on the 2015 FDA Annual Report. The study was not complete and follow -up was ongoing at the time of the 2015 annual report. Therefore the event rate may be slightly higher when the study is completed due to additional events reported, the persistent AF population being studied under this protocol has further advanced AF disease, and therefore the estimated rate for the STOP Persistent AF study has been estimated to be 5%. The OPC of 1 3% is based on the mea ningful clinical difference of 8% (i.e., if the safety rate of the cryoballoon in this population is 5 %, the study will have adequate power to demonstrate a difference from 1 3%) 20 Clinical Study Designs for Percutaneous Catheter Ablation for Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.

The Hommel procedure is a stepwise procedure and will be implemented following the below. The three hypothesis will be defined as H(1), H(2), and H(3). For each of the hypoth eses, p -values will be calculated and sorted p(1) < p(2) < p(3). The decision rule to accept or reject each hypothesis will follow the step -up algorithm, where α =0.025: Step 1: If p(3) > α , accept H(3) and go to Step 2, otherwise reject all hypotheses and stop Step 2: If p(2) > α/2, accept H(2) and go to Step 3, otherwise reject all remaining hypotheses and stop Step 3: If (1) α/2 < p(2) ≤ 2α/3 and p(1) ≤ α/2 or (2) p(1) ≤ α/3, reject H(1); otherwise accept H(1) 18.4.1.

74,page_74,"056-F275, Clinical Investigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 Page 75 of 115 Version 4, 10NOV 2016 Confidential The AFEQT questionnaire will be utilized for this objective. The questionnaire is an atrial fibrillation specific health -related quality of life questionnaire to assess the impact of AF on a subject’s life. The overall score ranges from 0 – 100, with 0 co rresponds to complete disability and 100 corresponds to no disability. Analysis Methods Change in AFEQT score is defined as 12 -month AFEQT score minus baseline AFEQT score. Change in AFEQT scores will be assessed utilizing a one -sample t -test. A two -sided 95% confidence interval will be calculated based on the t -distribution. Additionally, s ummary statistics (e.g. mean, SD, median, range) and graphical methods will be used to summarize the change in AFEQT scores from baseline through 12 months . Performan ce criteria If the p -value from the one- sample t -test after adjusting for the Hommel procedure is < 0.025, the objective will be considered met. Determination of S ubjects/Data for Analysis All enrolled subjects who have the Arctic Front Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter inserted into vasculature and have completed baseline and 12 month questionnaires will be included. Additional Analyses The AFEQT questionnaire has three subscale scores, Daily Activities Subscale, Treatment Concern, and Treatment satisfaction. Each subscale ranges from 0 – 100, where 0 corresponds to low quality -of-life and 100 corresponds to high quality of life. Change in AFEQT subscale score is defined as 12 -month AFEQT subscale score minus ba seline AFEQT subscale score.

Statement (s) of Compliance The study will be conducted in compliance with international ethical and scientific quality standards, known as good clinical practice (GCP). GCP includes review and approval by an independent Ethics Board/Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Medical Ethics Committee ( MEC )/Head of Medical Institution (HOMI) before initiating a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an Ethics Board, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of a subject before initiating the study. The study was designed to reflect the GCP principles outlined in ISO 14155:2011 and other international clinical requirements outlined below. These include the protection of the rights, safety and well -being of human subjects, controls to ensure the scientific conduct and cr edibility of the clinical investigation and the definition of responsibilities of the sponsor and Investigator s. In accordance with ISO standard, the sponsor shall avoid improper influence on, or inducement of, the subject, monitor, any Investigator (s) or other parties participating in or contributing to the clinical investigation. All Investigator s shall avoid improper influence on or inducement of the subject, sponsor, monitor, other Investigator (s) or other parties participating in or contributing to th e clinical investigation. The ISO standard also informed study design in the areas of device deficiency reporting and risk evaluation, with the exception (to Section 6.4 of the ISO standard) that only those Adverse Events (AEs) which are cardiovascular, s erious, system (cryoablation and ) related and procedure related will be collected. This ensures any AEs w hich could potentially be relevant will be collected. There is a second exemption (to Section 18.1 of the ISO standard) that device accountability will not be performed in Europe or Canada and only upon package opening in the US (full device accountability will take place in Japan starting with distribution ). The study will be conducted according to federal, national and local laws, regulations, standards, and requirements of the countries/geographies where the study is being conducted. In Europe, t he study will also be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 2013. For all geographies, t he principles of the Declaration of Helsinki have been implemented through the patient informed consent (IC) process, Ethics Board/IRB/MEC approval, study training, clinical trial registration, preclinical testing, risk -benefit assessment and publication policy."

The foreseeable adverse events information consists of two parts: a listing of potential adverse events associated with cryoablation therapy/procedure and adverse event rates reported in published literature for same therapy/procedure (see Appendix A). An evaluation of potentially anticipated events and reported events in literature may be used in combination with device labeling/IFU, current event reporting information, and other published data to assess for an un expected occurrence. The cryoablation procedure involves surgery, therefore, standard adverse events associated with a surgical procedure may be experienced (e.g. anesthesia complications, injury, infections, bleeding, exacerbation of pre -existing conditions, healing complications, etc.). The focus of this section is to specifically address in more detail, those events that are foreseeable due to the use, performance, and/or presence of the Arctic Front Advance Cryo Ablation Catheter under investigation. Additional potential risks associated with the Arctic Front Advance C ryo Ablation Catheter , as well as risk minimization are discussed within Section 15.2 . Treatment required for procedure and/or system related adverse events that are experienced may include medication or other surgical and medical remedies. The adverse events associated with t he use of the Arctic Front Advance Cryo Ablation Catheter include but are not limited to those in Table 23 and Tab le 24 . Table 23 pertains to the foreseeable/anticipated adverse events that may be observed in the study and may assist in identifying those adverse events that are unexpected in nature.
