This study will also provide important information regarding the safet y and health related quality of life with this two- drug regimen. This trial is designed to demonstrate the non -inferior antiviral activity of switching to DTG/3TC FDC once daily compared to continuation of CAR over 48 weeks."

The study will include a Screening Phase (up to 28 day s), a Randomized Phase up to Week 52, and a Continuation Phase (post We ek 52) (Section 1.2). The Continuation Phase is not applicable for participants in Sweden and Denmark. Approximately 490 adults living with HIV who are on a stable CAR will be randomized 1:1 to switch to DTG/3T C FDC once dail y for up to 52 weeks, or to continue their CAR for 52 weeks. To control for treatment related factors that may impact study outcomes, randomization will be stratified by baseline third agent class (protease inhibitor [PI ], integrase inhibit or [INI], or n on-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI ]). For participants randomized to CAR, provisions will be in place, as needed and after discussion with the study team, to assist participants in obtaining CAR during the stud y. The primar y endpoint for the study is the virologic failure endpoint as per FDA Snapshot category at Week 48 using the Intent -to-Treat Exposed (ITT- E) population. The Week 48 primary anal ysis will take place after the last participant has had their Week 48 viral load assessed, including any retests. Participants randomized to DTG/3TC FDC will receive DTG/3TC FDC up to Week 52. All participants in the DTG/3TC FDC arm who successfull y complete up to 52weeks of treatment will have the opportunity to continue receivi ng DTG/3TC FDC once dail y in a Continuation Phase (See Section 4.3). The Continuation Phase is not applicable for participants in Sweden and Denmark.

A goal of this study is to enroll populations who are underrepresented in clinical studies including 2 0% women and approximately 20% of participants who are ≥50 y ears of age. Another goal is to enroll approximately 20% of participants taking efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. The stud y will limit the enrolment of participants with current or pr ior exposure to DTG to approximately 20%. Intervention Groups and Duration: The study will include a Screening Phase (up to 28 days), a Randomized Phase up to Week 52 , and a Continuation Phase (post Week 52) (Section 1.2). The Continuation phase is not applicable for participants in Sweden and Denmark. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to switch to DTG/3TC FDC once dail y for up to 52weeks, or to continue their CAR for 52 weeks. To control for treatment rela ted factors that may impact study outcomes, randomization will be stratified by baseline third agent class (protease inhibitor [PI ], integrase inhibitor [ INI], or n on-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI ]). All participants in the DTG/3TC FDC armwho successfull y complete up to 52weeks of treatment will have the opportunity to continue receiving DTG/3TC FDC once dail y in a Continuation Phase (See Section 4.3). Participants in the CAR arm will compl ete the study at Week 52. The Continuation Phase is not applicable for participants in Sweden and Denmark. No dose reductions, modifications, or changes in the frequency of any components of each regimen will be allowed during this study with the excepti on of a switch from a PI boosted with ritonavir to the same PI boosted with cobicistat and vice versa. A switch from lamivudine to emtricitabine and vice versa is also permitted. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3), are essential and required for stud y conduct. If deviations are required for the management of immediate safet y concerns, these should be communicated promptl y to the study medical monitor.

INTRODUCTION Current human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)treatment guidelines recommend antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens consisting of two nucleoside/nucleotide analogue reverse transcript ase inhibitors (NRTI s) as a “backbone” combined with a third agent from the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI ), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or protease inhibitor (ritonavir- boosted) (PI/RTV) classes [BHIVA , 2016 ; DHHS , 201 8; EACS , 201 7;Gunthard, 201 6]. These regi mens are highl y efficacious, generall y well tolerated, and have led to remarkable declines in morbidity and mortality in people living with HIV. However, since these regimens will need to be taken life -long, there is growing concern about their long-term toxicities and cost. Lifelong ART has been associated with higher rates of non -acquired immune -deficiency syndrome (AIDS) -defining events (NADEs) such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease and cancer. In addition, as people living with HIV live longer, aging -associated co-morbidities are being seen with grea ter frequency , and this multi- morbidity often requires concomitant use of other medications. As the potential for toxicities and cost are directly related to the number of antiretrovirals (ARVs) used, there is great interest from people living with HIV andclinicians in regimens that minimize ARV -relate d long -term toxicities and drug -drug interactions (DDIs) without sacrificing long -term antiviral efficacy . Improvements in the clinical efficacy and safety profiles of new ARV drugs have enabled the conside ration of two -drug regimens as replacements for ≥3-drug ART regimens to streamline therap y and potentially minimize ARV -related long -term toxicities from cumulative drug exposures and DDIs . Improvements in tolerability may have a big impact on adherence to life-long treatment regimens. Additionally , the preservation of future ARV options and the lower cost associated with taking one less drug for the lifetime of a person living with HIV may have substantial individual and societal cost benefits. The 2 -drug regimen, dolutegravir/lamivudine ( DTG/3TC )fixed dose combination ( FDC ), has a robust antiviral activity , safety profile, high barrier to resistance, low potential for DDIs, and can be administered as a once -daily single tablet regimen ( STR). Emerging data supports DTG/3TC FDC as a viable option for both ART- experienced and naive people living with HIV -1. LAM IDOL , a single -arm open-label stud y (n=110), evaluated a switch from suppressive first-line ART to DTG/3TC FDC [Jol y, 2017]. Participant s initially switched the third agent in their regimen to DTG (50 mg once daily ) for 8 weeks, then (if HIV RNA remained <50 copies /millilitre (c/mL))switched from 2 NRTI s to 3TC. 97% of participant s who switched to 2- drug therapy maintai ned viral suppression after 40 weeks. Three participant s had HIV RNA >50 c /mL; none of these had INSTI mutations, one had an NRTI mutation. ASPI RE, an open -label, randomized, multicentre pilot study (n=89), evaluated a switch from 3 drug regimens (cART) to DTG + 3TC. In the primary analy sis at week 24, treatment failure occurred in 3 of 44 (6.8%) receiving DTG/3TC and 3 of 45 (6.7%) receiving cART (0.15% di fference; 90% CI, −9.8 to 10.2), demonstrating noninferiority"
22,page_22,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 22of DTG/3TC. The onl y participant with virologic failure ( VF) (DTG/3TC arm at week 24) had no emergent RT or integrase resistance mutations, and this participant remained viremic after switching to darunavir -cobicistat plus abacavir -3TC. Using the FDA snapshot algorithm, VL was <50 copies/mL at week 24 in 41 of 44 participants in the DTG/3TC arm (93.2%) versus 41 of 45 (91.1%) in the cART arm (difference, 2.1%; 95% CI, 11.2%– 15.3%; P = .71); and at week 48 in 90.9% versus 88.9% (difference 2.0%; 95% CI, −12.6% to 16.5%; P = .76) [ Taiwo , 2018]. An investigator -initiated 48 -week pilot study , the PADDL E trial (NCT02211482), has provided data on the efficacy of a once -daily DTG/3TC FDC 2 -drug regimen for 20 HIV treatment -naïve participa nts with no genot ypic resistance to 3TC and a viral load of <100,000 c/mL at Screening. In this study , participants were enrolled in two separate groups of 10, allowing close evaluation of response while employ ing a set of stopping rules with intensive follow -up in each cohort. By Week 8, all 20 participants, including 4 participants with a Baseline HIV -1 RNA of >100,000 c/mL, had reached a viral load <50 c/mL [Figueroa , 2015]. At Week 48, 18 participants (90%) reached the primary endpoint of a plasma viral load <50 c/mL [Cahn, 2017]. The regimen was well tolerated and no toxicity issues were observed. All 18 participant s who completed 48 weeks were included in an extension phase up to Week 96. At Week 96, al l 18 participants maintained plasma viral load <50 c/mL [ Figueroa , 2017]. Data from larger studies isavailable from two ongoing Phase III trials (GEMI NI-1 and - 2) in naive participants . 714 and 719 adults were ran domised and treated in GEMINI - 1&2, respectivel y. Based on a 10% non- inferiority margin, DTG+3TC was non -inferior to DTG+TDF/FTC at Week 48 in both GEMINI -1&2 and in the pooled ana lysis. Response rates in participant s with baseline HIV -1 RNA >100,000 c/mL w ere high and similar between arms. Across both studies, 6 participants on DTG+3TC and 4 on DTG+TDF/FTC met protocol -defined virologic withdrawal criteria through Week 48; none had treatment -emergent primary integrase -strand transfer inhibitor or NRTI resistance mutations. Overall rates of AEs were similar between arms, with low rates of withdrawals due to AEs for both DTG+3TC and DTG+TDF/FTC. More drug related AEs were reported with DTG+TDF/FTC [ Cahn, 2018]. Data is also available from a third ongoing Phase III trial (TANGO) in ART -experienced participant s. 743 adults were enrolled and 741 received ≥1 dose of study drug (DTG/3TC, N=369; TAF -based regimen, N=372). At Week 48, proportion of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL treated with DTG/3TC was 0.3% (1/369) vs 0.5% (2/372) with a TAF -based regimen (adjusted treatment difference [95% CI ], −0.3 [−1.2, 0.7]), meeting non - inferiority criteria. No participants receiving DTG/3TC and 1 receiving a TAF -based regimen met confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria , with no emergent resistance at time offailure . Drug -related grade ≥2 adverse events and a dverse events leading to stud y withdrawal were reported in 17 (4.6%) and 13 (3.5%) participants with DTG/3TC and 3 (0.8%) and 2 (0.5%) with a TAF -based regimen, respectivel y. 2.1. Study Rationale This study is being conducted to establish if adults living with HIV-1with virologic suppression on a ≥3 drug current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) remain suppressed upon switching to DTG/3TC FDC . This study will also provide important information regarding the safet y and health related quality of life with this two-drug regimen. This"
23,page_23,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 23trial is designed to demonstrate the non -inferior antiviral activity of switching to DTG/3TC FDC once daily compared to continuation of CAR over 48 weeks. DTG/ 3TC FDC may provide an effective and well -tolerated two- drug regimen for ART -experienced people living with HIV, limiting the risk of man y common adverse reactions associated with other ARV drugs. This regimen could be particularly valuable for p eople with co -morbid conditions such as bone or cardiovascular disease, and in resource -limited settings due to DTG’s known efficacy advantages and both drugs’ tolerability and long -term safet y profiles, as well as ease of use (once daily dosing, no food dosing effects/requirements, and limited potential for DDIs ). The e xpected efficacy and safet yof DTG/3TC FDC will make it suitable for both treatment- naïve individuals and as a replacement tre atment for ≥3-drug ART in virologicall y suppressed (“switch”) participants. By limiting the number of ARV’s to which a p articipant is chronicall y exposed, 2 -drug therap y has the potential benefit of preserving future treatment options, minimizing potentia l long-term toxicity and decreasing the likelihood of DDIs. These benefits could have a large impact on tolerability and adherence and thus prevent drug resistance. 2.2. Background FDCs and STRs have greatly simplified the treatment of people living with HIV, and may be of greater importance in people with lifesty les or care commitments that may impair adherence to dosing schedules, including some women and those in underserved populations. In a stud y by Paterson et. al. [ Paterson, 1999], a linear relationship between levels of adherence and viral load suppression was observed. Adherence to therap y is essential to achieve viral suppression and prevent emergence of resistance mutations. Among regimens of comparable efficacy , physicians and people living with HIV -1who receive ART rate total pill burden, dosing frequency , and safet y concerns among the greatest obstacles to achieving adherence. Drug resistant virus eventually emerges in most people who struggle with consistent ad herence. To achieve successful long -term treatment, the prevention of drug resistance has become the most significant challenge. DTG is a potent dual cation binding INSTI, exhibiting rapid reduction in viral load, best in class efficacy , and a high barrier to resistance. These properties and its safet y profile make it an optimal core agent for 2- drug regimens. I n addition, due to its mechanism of metabolism, DTG lacks many of the frequent DDIs associated with other medications commonly taken b y people livi ng with HIV. To date, the efficacy , pharmacokinetics (PK), safet y and drug interaction potential of DTG has been evaluated in an extensive program of Phase I to IIIB clinical trials [ TIVIC AY Package Insert, 2017 ; GlaxoS mithKline Document Number RM2007/00683/11; GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N352880_00; GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N352880_01]. 3TC is a potent cy tidine nucleoside analogue wit hout major side effects and has a well proven safety profile. Available since 1995 as a single agent (EPIVIR) [ EPIVIRPackage Insert, 2017], it is also available as part of three FDC products (zidovudine (ZDV)/3TC, COMBI VIR, abacavir (ABC)/3TC, EPZICOM/KIVEXA, ABC/3TC/DTG, TRI UMEQ). 3TC monotherapy is known to select for resistance due to a single point mutation that"
24,page_24,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 24reduces antiviral activit y. However, it is predicted that 3TC, when combined with DTG with its high barr ier to resistance and abilit y to confer a very rapid decline in HIV -1 RNA, may be less likely to select for resistance consistent with clinical studies combining DTG, 3TC and ABC [ Walmsley , 2013; Walmsley , 2015 ; Cahn 2018 ]. Chronic exposure to NRTI s may lead to telomerase and mitochondrial dysfunction, processes that may lead to accelerated aging, lipody strophy , steatohepatitis and other aging -related morbidities [ Solomon , 2014]. NRTIs have been linked to reduced telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from people living with HIV [Leeansyah, 2013 ]. Of a multitude of NRTI s studied in vitro, tenofovir at therapeutic concentrations produced the most significant inhibition of telomerase leading to accelerated shortening of telomere length in activated PBMCs [ Leeans yah, 2013; Stella -Ascariz , 2017]. I t is of note that current tenofovir alafenamide ( TAF )-regimens deliver four -foldhigher intracellular levels of tenofovir -diphosphate (the active entity for both HIV - reverse transcriptase ( RT)and human telomerase) than TDF -regimens and thus pose a greater concern for its effects on telomerase and normal cell proliferation. In addition, many of the current TAF- based single tablet regimens incorporate a boosting agent, cobicistat, while PI -containing regimens require boosting with ritonavir. The use of cobicistat -and ritonavir -containing regimens further increase the risk of potential DDIs from pol ypharmacy. One of the potential risks of a two -drug regimen, such as DTG/3TC FDC , is the increase in virologic failure associated with the emergence of resistance. DTG, with its higher barrier to resistance, may reduce treatment -emergent resistance in participants taking a two-drug regimen. The overall efficacy data from the pivotal Phase III studies of DTG in ART -naïve participant s are extensive, with no resistance mutations being identified through 144 weeks of treatment (SINGLE, ING114467) [ Walmsley , 2015]. The absence of treatment -emergent mutat ions to DTG or background agents in ART -naïve individuals, rapid virologic response demonstrated for DTG -based regimens, and the in vitro potency and well -tolerated safet y profile of both DTG and 3TC all provide a strong rationale for the development of a DTG/3TC STR as atreatment option for people living with HIV. Several studies have demonstrated the tolerabilit y and durability of the virologic response of a 2 -drug ARV regimen as replacement for a ≥3-drug ARV regimen in individual s who were previousl y suppressed on triple drug therap y. One such stud y was the Only Lopinavir and Epivir (OLE) study which was an open- label study in 250 virologically suppressed individuals living with HIV (HIV-1 RNA <50c/mL) receiving a lopinavir (L PV)/r plus 3TC or emtrici tabine (FTC) containing 3-drug regimen who were randomized to continue their current triple based regimen or have their therap y simplified to a 2- drug regimen of LPV/r + 3TC [ Arribas , 2015]. The primary endpoi nt wa s the proportion of participants free of therapeutic failure at 48 weeks. In a modified I ntent to Treat (m- ITT) anal ysis, 2-drug therapy with L PV/r + 3TC demonstrated non -inferior efficacy and comparable safet y to LPV/r + 2 NRTI s, as maintenance therap y invirologicall y suppressed participant s (91.5% vs. 90.9% respectivel y; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): - 0.6% to 8.1%)."
25,page_25,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 25The Simplification to Atazanavir/Ritonavir+Lamivudine as Maintenance Therapy (SAL T) study [Perez -Molina , 2015] was a 96 -week multicenter, randomized, open- label, clinical trial that compared atazanavir/ritonavir ( ATV/r ) + 3TC with ATV/r + 2NRTIs (selected at the discretion of the investigator) in 286 people living with HIV on a stable 3 - drug regimen who switch therap y because of toxicity , intolerance, or simplification. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the non -inferior efficacy of m aintenance therap y with ATV/r + 3TC compared to ATV/r + 2 NRTIs at 48 weeks (noninferiorit y margin, –12%) using the time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) algorithm. At 48 weeks, 78.4% of participant s receiving tri ple therap y vs. 83.6% of participant s switched to 2-drug therap y had maint ained HIV -RNA levels < 50 c/mL thus establishing non- inferiority between these t wo treatment arms (difference between the arms 5.2; -4.8 to 15.2). Treatment discontinuations (2%) were less frequent in the 2-drug therapy group (vs 7% in the triple therap y group). An IN STI-containing oral 2 -drug regimen, cabotegravir (CAB) + rilpivirine (RPV), was evaluated as a maintenance therap y in people living with HIV who had virologic suppression after 24 weeks of 3 -drug ART [ Margolis, 2015]. The CAB + RPV arms showed comparative antiviral efficacy as the efavirenz ( EFV )+ 2 NRTIs arm. Following 72 weeks of two -drug maintenance therap y (Week 96), in the ITT maintenance = exposed population, 86% of CAB + RPV participants and 83% of EFV + 2 NRTIs participants remained virologically suppressed. Virologic fail ure was seen in 4% of the CAB arm and 2% of the EFV+2 NRTI arm. The SWORD -1 and SWORD -2 studies [ Llibre, 2017] are ongoing 148- week open- label, multicenter Phase III, non -inferiorit y studies evaluating the efficacy and sa fety of switching from a 3 or 4- drug current antiretroviral regimen (CA R) to DTG + RPV in 1024 participants. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participant s with p lasma HIV-RNA levels < 50 c/mL at Week 48. Switching to DTG + RPV was found to be non - inferior to continuing CAR in pooled analy sis of both the intent -to-treat exposed (ITT-E) population [95% vs. 95% ; difference: -0.2% (95% CI : -3.0%, 2.5%)] and the per -protocol population [96% vs. 96% ; difference: -0.7% (95% CI : -3.3%, 1.8%) ]. For the pool ed studies, 23% and 21% of participants were female in the DTG +RPV and CAR arms, respectivel y. Efficacy remained high in the female subgroup (93% vs. 91%). At Week 100 in the Earl y Switch group, 456 (89%) had VL < 50c/mL ; low rate of snapshot virologic non -response was observed (3%); 6 (1.2%) participants met Confirmed Virologic Withdrawal (CVW) criterion. One participant with RPV resistance at CVW (Earl y Switch group, Wk100) had pre -existing NNRTI mutations at baseline. No participants developed INSTI resistance [ Aboud, 2018]. 2.3.

Potential Risk of Clinical SignificanceSummary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategya Investigational Product (IP) [DTG and 3TC] Refer to Investigator Brochures ( IBs)for additional information DTG: Hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) and rashDTG: HSR has been observed uncommonly with DTG. Rash was commonly reported in DTG Phase IIb/III clinical trials; episodes were generally mild to moderate in intensity; no episodes of severe rash, such as Stevens -Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and erythema multiforme were reported. Participants with history of allergy/sensi tivity to any of the study intervention sare excluded. Specific/detailed toxicity management guidance is provided for rash (Section 11.3.1.6 ). The participant informed consent form (ICF) includes information on this risk and the actions participants should take in the event of a HSR or associated signs and symptoms DTG: Drug induced liver injury (DILI) and other clinically significant liver chemistry elevations 3TC: Use in HBV co- infected participant s and emergence of HBV variants resistant to 3TCDTG: Non-clinical data suggested a possible, albeit low, risk for hepatobiliary toxicity with DTG. Drug -related hepatitis is considered an uncommon risk for ART containing DTG regardless of dose or treatment population. For participants with hepatit is B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co -infection, improvements in immunosuppression as a result of HIV virologic and immunologic responses to DTG -containing ART, along with inadequate therapy for HBV co -infected participants , likely contribute d to significant elevations in liver chemistries .A review of postmarketing data found that the number of cases reporting particularly severe liver dysfunction was found to be very low in the context of exposure to DTG and DTG/ABC/3TC. The reported cases of severe liver dysfunction (including acute hepatic failure) are complex with potential confounding factors but in a very small number of cases, drug-induced liver injury is likely and the role of DTG containing regimens cannot be ruled out particularly i n those involving DTG Participants meeting any of the following criteria during the screening period ar e excluded from participating. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT  3xULN and bilirubin 1.5x ULN (with >35% direct bilirubin) Participants positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (+HBsAg ) Participants negative for HBsAg and anti -HBsAg and p ositive for anti-HBc and HBV DNA Anticipated need for any hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy during the randomized phase of the study, or anticipated need for HCV therapy with a potential for adverse drug -drug interactions with DTG or 3TC Specific/detailed liver stopping criteria and toxicity management guidance is provided for suspected DILI or other clinically significant liver chemistry elevations (Secti on 11.9 )."

Emergence of HBV variants associated with resistance to 3TC has been reported in HIV -1- infected participant s who have received 3TC -containing antiretroviral regim ens in the presence of concurrent infection with HBV. Additionally, discontinuation of 3TC in HBV co- infected participants can result in severe exacerbations of hepatitis B. DTG: Psychiatric disordersDTG: Psychiatric disorders including suicidal ideation and behaviours are common in people living with HIV . Events of suicidal ideation, attempt, behaviour and completion were observed in clinical studies of DTG, primarily in participants with a pre -existing history of depression or other psychiatric illness. The psychiatric profile for DTG (including suicidality, depression, bipolar and hypomania, anxiety and abnormal dreams) was similar to RAL -or favourable compared with EFV -based regimens. The reporting rate for insomnia was statistically higher for blinded DTG+ abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) compared to EFV/TDF/FTC in ING114467; however, this was not duplicated in any other Phase IIb/III study conducted with DTG. Participants who in the invest igator’s judgment, pose a significant suicidality risk, are excluded from participating. Because of the elevated risk in the population of people living with HIV, treatment emergent assessment of suicidality will be monitored during this study through the end of the continuation phase. Investigators are advised to consider mental health consultation or referral for participants who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour (See Section 8.2.5 ). The participant informed consent form includes information on the risk of depression and suicidal ideation and behaviour . DTG: Increased rates of virologic failure/ Virologically suppressed participants switching from stable ART to DTG/3TC FDC may experience virologic failure/breakthrough and Participants with any switch to a second line regimen due to previous virologic failure and particip ants with evidence of"

DTG: Week 96 and Week 144 analyses for the Phase III/IIIb clinical studies supported the efficacy findings from earlier analyses, and demonstrated robust maintenance of viral suppress ion with no finding of HIV -1 resistance in treatment -naïve participants . 3TC: M184V is the common single mutation that leads to full resistance to 3TC. pre-existing viral resistance mutation (including M184I/V) are excluded from this study. Genotypic resistance testing results be reviewed by ViiVVirology toensure participants with exclusionary mutations are not randomized. Participants will have HIV -1 RNA measured at routine study visits. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC )will be instituted to ensure external objective medical and/or statistical review of efficacy . DTG: Theoretical serious drug interaction with dofetilide , pilsicainide and fampridineCo-administration of DTG may increase dofetilide/pilsicainide and fampridine plasma concentration via inhibition of organic cation transporter (OCT -2), resulting in potentially life -threatening toxicity. The co -administration of DTG with dofetilide , pilsicainide or fampridine is prohibited in the study ( Section 11.6). DTG and 3TC: Renal functionDTG : Mild elevations of creatinine have been observed with DTG which are related to a likely benign effect on creatinine secretion with inhibition of OCT -2. DTG has been shown to have no significant effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or effective renal plasma flow. 3TC: 3TC is eliminated by renal excretion and exposu res increase in participant s with renal dysfunction. 3TC is not recommended to treat participant s with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min.Specific/detailed toxicity management guidance is provided for participants who develop a decline in renal function (Section 11.3.1.3 ). Creatinine clearance is calculated in all participant s prior to initiating therapy and renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) will be monitored at all subsequent study visi ts. Participants with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min are excluded from participation in this study. Safety events, including laboratory toxicities will be monitored closely in participants with creatinine clearance between 30 -49mL/min, as outlined in th e Schedule of Activities table."

Careful monitoring of events will be conducted using serious adverse event (SAE) reports and alerts for Grade 3/4 laboratory toxicities (per Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome [DAIDS] toxicity gradings for HIV -infected participant s). Serious/severe events will be managed appropriately including, but not limited to, withdrawal of stud y intervention , and will be followed to resolution as per Sponsor’s st andard medical monitoring practices. b.Clinical Safety Data will be routinely reviewed in GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) /ViiV Safety Review Team meetings.

30,page_30,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 302.3.2. Benefit A ssessment Individuall y, DTG and 3TC are conveniently dosed once daily withoutregard to meals, without need for a PK booster, and with limited safety implications resulting from theoretical or actual DDIs compared to other ART agents (including EFV and those requiring a PK booster). In addition, the high barrier to resistance observed with DTG should help protect against the development of resis tance to both components of the DTG/ 3TC FDC regimen. I ndividuall y, DTG and 3TC in combination with other ARVs have demonstrated durable virologic and immunologic response. In general, switching participants to a DTG/ 3TC FDC regimen from a dual NRTI -based 3-drug regimen may increase tolerability , reduce the frequency of adverse events associated with NRTI -based regimens and/or DDIs . Study participants also may benefit from the medical tests and screening procedures performed as part of this study . 2.3.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to participants participating in this study , the potential risks identifi ed in association with DTG/3TC FDC are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to study participants switching to this 2- drug regimen."

Overall Design This is a 52- week, Phase III, randomized, open- label, active -controlled, multicenter, parallel -group stud y to assess the non- inferior antiviral activity and safety of switching from CAR to DTG/3TC FDC in adult sliving with HIV who are virologically suppressed and stable on CAR. The study will include a Screening Phase (up to 28 day s), a Randomized Phase up to Week 52, and a Continuation Phase (post Week 52)(Section 1.2). The Continuation Phase is not applicable for participants in Sweden and Denmark. Approximately 490adults living with HIV who are on a stable CAR will be randomized 1:1 to switch to DTG/3TC FDC once dail y for up to 52 weeks, or to continue their C AR for 52 weeks .To control for treatment related factors that may impact study outcomes, randomization will be stratified by baseline third agent class (protease inhibitor [PI ], integrase inhibitor [ INI], or n on-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI ]). For participant s randomized to CAR, provisions will be in place, as needed and after discussion with the study team, to assist participant s in obtaining CAR during the stud y. The primary endpoint for the study isthe virologic failure endpoint as per FDA Snapshot category at Week 48 using the Intent -to-Treat Exposed (ITT- E)population. The Week 48 primary anal ysis will take place after the last participan t has had their Week 48 viral load assessed, including any retests. Participants randomized to DTG/3TC FDC will receive DTG/3TC FDC up to Week 52. All participant s in the DTG/3TC FDC arm who successfull y complete up to 52weeks of treatment will have the opportunity to continue receiving DTG/3TC FDC once dail y in a Continuation Phase (See Sect ion 4.3). Participants in the CAR arm will complete the study at Week 52. The Continuation Phase is not applicable for participants in Sweden and Denmark. No dose reductions, modifications, or changes in the frequency of any components of each regimen will be allowed during this study with the exception of a switch from a PI boosted with ritonavir to the same PI boosted with cobicistat and vice versa . A switch from lamivudine to emtricitabine and vice versa is also permitted. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3), are essential and required for study conduct. If deviations are required for the management of immediate safet y concerns, these should be communicated promptl y to the study medical monitor. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be instituted to ensure external objective medical and/or statistical review of efficacy to protect the ethical interests and well-being of participant s and to protect the scientific validity of this study . A sub -study of Virologic Response to Subsequent ART after Discontinuation from 208090 for M eeting CVW or PVW Criteri awill be conducted. Details are provided in Section 11.2."
34,page_34,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 344.2. Number of Participants Assuming 20% screen failure rate, approximately 622adult participants living with HIV will be screened to achieve appr oximately 490 randomized participants for a total of 245 evaluable participants per treatment group (See Section 9.3). A goal of this study is to enrol populations who are underrepresented in clinical studies including at least 20% women and approximately 20% of participants who are ≥50 y ears of age . To provide sufficient data to determine whether women respond differentl y than male participants and whether participants who are ≥50 y ears of age respond differently than those < 50 years of age , sites are expected to consider women and participants ≥50 years of age in their screening strategies. Another goal of the study is to enrol approximately 20% of participants taking efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disopro xil fumarate to reflect on its continued use as first line ARV of choice in many countries . Enrolment may be allowed to continue at select sites to attempt to reach targets in the se key study population s. The study will limit the enrolment of participant s with current or prior exposure to DTG to approximately 20%. 4.3. Participant and Study Completion Participants are considered to have completed the study if they satisfy one of the following: Randomly assigned to either treatment group, completed the Randomi zedPhase including the Week 52visit, and did not enter the Continuation Phase; Randomly assigned to DTG/3TC FDC , completed the Randomized Phase including the Week 52visit, entered and c ompleted the Continuation Phase, defined as remaining on stud y until : DTG and 3TC are each locally approved for use as part of a 2- drug regimen, and each of the single entities of DTG and 3TC are available through public health services or through the participant’s usual health insurance pay er,or the actual DTG/3TC FDC ta blet, if required b y local regulations, is available, or the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, or the par ticipant meets a protocol -defined reason for discontinuation, or development of the DTG plus 3TC 2-drug regimen is terminated The Continuation Phase is not applicable for participants in Sweden and Denmark. An in -clinic Follow -Up visit will be conducted approximately 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication for participants with ongoing AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs) regard less of attributability , and any laboratory abnormalities that are considered to be AEs or potentially harmful to the participant, at the last on -study visit. Assessments at the Follow -up visit should reflect an y ongoing complaints (e.g., blood draws to fo llow a"
35,page_35,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 35laboratory abnormality ). The Follow -Up visit is not required for successful completion of the study . 4.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design The design of this study (1:1 randomized, open- label, active -controlled, multicenter, parallel group, non -inferiority study ) is well established for confirming the non-inferiorit y of an investigational agent compared with an active ART standard -of-care regimen and generally is accepted b y regulatory authorities as rigorous proof of antiviral activity . The primar y endpoint, proportion of partic ipants defined as virologic failures by the FDA Snapshot algorithm, is recommended in the FDA’s 2015 guidance document for assessing efficacy in Switch Trials [CDER , 2015] . The key seco ndary endpoint, proportion of participant s at Week 48 with plasma HIV-1 RNA<50 c/mL, is also a well - established surrogate endpoint for prognosis of HIV-1 infection and disease progression [CDER , 2015 ]. Several studies have demonstrated the value/feasibility of a switch study design, an approach that has been shown to generate valuable data supporting ARV combinations that allow dosing flexibility , reduced toxicity and/or drug interactions or a reduction in pill burden. A simplified ARV regimen may also contribute to increased medication adherence and reduced HIV transmission. A potential disadvantage of a switch study design is that effective, well-tolerated ART is discontinued at the time of switching to the simplifie d regimen [ Carr, 2012]. Previous studies have shown the non- inferiority of a 2 -drug regimen in maintaining virologic suppression when participants who were virologicall y suppressed on a 3 -drug regimen were switched to a 2-drug regimen (See Section 2.2). In this stud y, participant s will be randomized 1: 1 to switch to DTG/3TC FDC from CA R at Day 1 or stay on their CAR for up to 52 weeks. The primary endpoint will be evaluated at Week 48 using a 5% non -inferiority (NI) margin. The rationale for this decision is provided in Section 9.2.1. This study is evaluating the rate of Snapsho t algorithm measured virologic failure in already suppressed particip ants to test the hypothesis that maintenance of the suppression of HIV -1 replication by DTG/3TC FDC will be non -inferior to that observed in the CAR arm of the study through Week 48. This study will also evaluate the safet y and tolerability of this 2- drug regimen in persons with a creatinine clearance of between 30 –49 mL/min/1.73m2. The DTG 50mg dose is approved for persons with a creatinine clearance of as low as 30 mL/min/1.73m2. 3TC plasma concentrations area under the curve (AUC) are increased in participant s with moderate to severe renal impairment due to decreased clearance, and the current label recommends a dose of150mg once a day for a creatini ne clearance of between 30-49mL/min/1.73m2. However, several randomized controlled studies that hav e compared a total 3TC daily dose of 600 mg/day to 300 mg/day showed only small, statistically non- significant differences between the treatment arms in the frequency of AEs, drug -related AEs, SAEs, Grade 3/4 clinical and laboratory toxicities and withdra wals due to AEs [Eron , 1995; GlaxoWellcome Document Number UCR/95/003, 1995; GlaxoWellcome Document Number GIO/94/005 , 1995]. Ourstudy will allow"
36,page_36,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 36inclusion of participants with creatinine clearance of ≥30 mL /min/1.73m2to confirm these earlier observations. The protocol includes extensive serum and urine renal function laboratory testscollected at each stud y visit, and has management procedures for specified change (decrease) in renal function. This study will aim to enrol 20% females to provide safet y and efficacy data to help inform clinicians about use of this ART regimen in women. While women comprise approximately 50% of people living with HIV globally , the number of wo men in most HIV clinical trials remains low, and recruiting and retaining women into antiretroviral clinical studies remains a challenge. The reasons are multiple, but may reflect differences in lifest yle, care commitments, behaviour and socioeconomics be tween women and men living with HI V. Additionally , women may metabolize and respond to antiretroviral agents differently than men; women may have higher drug exposure, be at greater risk for some adverse events (i.e., lactic acidosis, hepatotoxicity /rash, and osteoporosis), and have an added potential for drug -drug interactions (i.e., oral hormonal contraceptives/or estrogen ). The open- label design best suits the objectives of this study . A double -dummy design could not be undertaken given the increase in pill burden that would result from blinding, the differing requirements for dosing a variety of CAR with food, and wide variet y of potential DDIs . An increase in pill burden could hinder compliance substantially and discourage participant enrolment . The use of the FDA snapshot algorithm for assessing the proportion of participant s with virologic failure as an objective primary endpoint will help reduce biases inherent to an open-label stud y design. 4.5. Justification for Dose To date, the efficacy , PK, saf ety, and drug interaction potential of DTG and 3TC as individual agents have been evaluated in two extensive clinical development programs of Phase I to III clinical trials. As individual agents, DTG and 3TC are both approved and marketed as T IVICAY 50 mgonce dail y and EPIVI R300 mg once dail y, respectivel y. These doses will be used in the current stud y. Comprehensive clinical studies have been conducted with the individual DTG and 3TC products, including clinical pharmacology studies evaluating potent ial DDIs between each of these active ingredients and other agents. There are no known clinically relevant PK interactions between DTG and 3TC with concomitant dosing. A summary of the overall clinical development for both products is available in the most recent version of the IBs and or Product Insert(s) for the respective products [see DTG IB: GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RM2007/00683/1 1; GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N352880_00; GlaxoSmithKline Docume nt Number 2017N352880_01; Dolutegravir (TIVIC AY ) Product I nsert ; 2017; EPIVIR Product Insert, 2017]. Based on the preliminary results of the pivotal bioequivale nce study (204994), a bilay er tablet formulation with a core which utilizes the same formulation in the respective lay ers as the single entity tablets was selected. When administered in the fasted state, the bilay er tablet demonstrated bioequivalence to t he single entit y tablets for dolutegravir area under the curve zero to infinity (AUC(0- ∞)) & maximum concentration (Cmax) and"
37,page_37,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 37lamivudine AUC(0 -). However, the bilay er tablet showed a modest increase in lamivudine Cmax compared to the single entity tablet, which is not considered to be clinically significant."

Notwithstanding these minimum inclusion and exclusion criteria, Investigators must also follow country specific guidelines where they exist when making decisions about participant s who are eligible for study participation. 5.3. Lifest yle Restrictions This section is not applicable to this study . 5.4. Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequentl y randomized. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demograph y, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and an y serious adverse even ts (SAEs ). Participants are allowed to re -screen for this study one time (except where screen HIV -1 plasma RNA  50 c/mL or where exclusionary HIV -1 resistance was present). Re-screening will require a new subject number. A single repeat test (re -test) p er anal yte or assessment is allowed during the screening period to determine eligibility . However, a repeat HI V-1 RNA, if HIV -1 RNA was ≥50c/mL is not allowed. Laboratory results provided from central laboratory services will be used to assess eligibility . In exceptional circumstances only , if a central lab result cannot be generated, local labs can be review ed and approved by the Medical Monitor, for consideration of participant eligibility , except for plasma HIV -1 RNA. Source documentation to verify entry criteria must be reviewed by the Principal Investigator or designee prior to randomization. Source documents from other medical facilities must be located/retrieved during the screening period. Under nocircumstances may a participant be randomized in the absence of source documentation including prior qualify ing viral load data (as outlined in the Inclusi on Criteria). 6.

Method of Treatment A ssignment Informed consent must be obtained prior to an y study procedures, including an y screening assessment. Participant s wil l be assigned to study intervention in accordance with the computer - generated randomization schedule. The central randomization schedule will be generated by Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) using a validated SAS developed program."
46,page_46,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 46Randomization and study intervention assignment will be facilitated b y the interactive voice/web recognition system (IVRS/I WRS). Following confirmation of fulfilment of study entry criteria, study site personnel will be required to contact the IVRS/I WRS to register participant s.Participant s will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to DTG/3TC FDC or the CAR arm , in accordance with the computer -generated randomization schedule. To control for treatment related factors that may impact study outcomes, r andomization will be stratified b y baseline third agent class (protease inhibitor [PI], integrase inhibitor [INI], or non -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI ]). Each participant will be assigned a unique identifier (designating the participant ’s randomization code) and a unique treatment number which matches the randomize d treatment assignment. Participant s who are randomly assigned into the trial and subsequentl y withdrawn may not be rescreened. Once a randomisation number has been assigned it must not be re-assigned. 6.4. Blinding This is an open- label study ; potential bias will be reduced by the following steps: central randomization. No summaries of the stud y data according to actual randomized treatment groups will be available to sponsor staff prior to the planned Week 24 preliminary analysis. Public presentation of the Week 24 anal ysis will not be done until after the last participant completes their last visit for the primary Week 48 anal ysis. 6.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability No specia l preparation of study intervention is required. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study interventions must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled stor age conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for stud y intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study intervention are provided in the SRM . Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study interven tionis not expected to pose significant safety risks to site staff . A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the investigator, where this is req uired b y local laws, or is available upon request from ViiV/ GSK."
47,page_47,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 47IP accountability will be evaluated using pill counts of unused DTG/3TC FDC only and not CAR . This assessment will be conducted each time the participant receives a new (refill) supply of DTG/3TC FDC through the Withdrawal visit or study completion. I Paccountability records must be maintained throughout the course of the study . These data will be recorded in the participant ’s eCRF but will not be summarised for analy sis purposes. Please ref er to Appendix 14 in Section 11.14 for study management information during the COVID -19 pandemic. 6.6. Treatment Compliance When participants self -administer study intervention s at home, compliance with DTG/3T C FDC or CAR will be assessed through query ing the participant during the site visits and documented in the source documents and eCRF. A record of the number of DTG/3TC FDC tablets dispensed to and taken b y each participant must be maintained andreconcil ed with study intervention and compliance records. Intervention start and stop dates, including dates for treatment delay s will also be recorded in the case report form ( eCRF )for both DTG/3TC FDC and CAR . 6.7. Concomitant Therapy Refer to Appendix 6for a full list of prohibited medications. The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy . Participant s should be advised to notify their investigator of any current or proposed concomitant medication, whether prescribed or over- the-counter , because of the potential DDIs between such treatments and the study intervention s. The investigator should evaluate an y potential DDI sat every visit, including reviewing the most cu rrent version of the U.S. or local prescribing information for DTG, 3TC and CAR, especially if any new concomitant medications are reported b y participant s. All concomitant medications (including oral contraception, implants or oral or topical hormone rep lacement therap y) taken during the stud y will be recorded in the eCRF. The minimum requirement is that the drug name, route, and the dates of administration are to be recorded. Concomitant medications (prescription and non- prescription) should be prescri bed b y the relevant health care provider/investigator and administered only as medically necessary during the Randomized and Continuation phases of the study (except prohibited medications described in Section 11.6). Chemoprophy laxis for HIV-associated conditions is encouraged, if appropriate, at the discretion of the participant and their physician. All concomitant medications, blood products, and vaccines taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF with dates of administration. 6.7.1. Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Because non- HIV vaccines may cause a temporary increase in the level of HIV -1 plasma RNA, it is highly recommended that a vaccine, if necessary , be given during or immediately after a scheduled visit after all laboratory tests have been drawn and only"
48,page_48,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 48when scheduled visits are ≥4 weeks apart. This approach will minimize the risk of non - specific increases in the level of HIV -1 plasma RNA at the next scheduled assessment. DTG/3TC FDC should be administered 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking antacid or laxative products containing pol yvalent cations (e.g. aluminium and magnesium) , sucralfate , or calcium supplements. Proton pump inhibitors and H2 -antagonists may be used in place of ant acids with no scheduling restrictions. Concurrent administration with multivitamins is acceptable. Iron supplements can be taken with IPprovided that all are taken together with a meal. Under fasted conditions, DTG +3TC should be given 2 hours prior to OR 6 hours after iron supplements. Metformin concentrations may be increased by DTG. A dose adjustment of metformin should be considered when starting and stopping co- administration of dolutegravir with metformin, to maintain glycaemic control. Clinical m onitoring is recommended for participants taking methadone, as methadone maintenance therap y may need to be adjusted in some participant s. Non-protocol defined treatments or medical interventions (e.g., ph ysical therap y, radiotherap y, surgical procedures) are permitted during the stud y for appropriate medical management of the participant. 6.8. Treatment after the End of the Study The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the participant ’s medical c ondition, whether or not ViiV is providing specific post -study treatment. All participant s on DTG/3TC FDC who successfully complete 52 weeks of treatment will have the opportunit y to receive DTG/3TC FDC once dail y in aContinuation Phase until : DTG and 3TC are each locally approved for use as part of a 2- drug regimen, and each of the single entities of DTG and 3TC are available to participant s (e.g., through public health services or through their usual health insurance pay er),or the actual DTG/3TC FDC tablet, if required b y local regulations, is available, or the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, or theparticipan t meets a protocol -defined reason for discontinuation, or development of the DTG plus 3TC 2-drug regimen is terminated . The Cont inuation Phase is not applicable for participants in Sweden and Denmark. The purpose of the Continuation Phase is to ensure provision of DTG /3TC FDC . Assessments during the Continuation Phase are limited and will include some safet y laboratory assessment s."

Discontinuation of Study Intervention Participant s permanent ly discontinuing study intervention s are considered to be withdrawn from the study. Similarly , participant s who enter the Continuation Phase but permanentl y discontinu e participation in the Continuation Phase prior to transitioning to commerciall y available DTG + 3TC are considered to be w ithdrawn from study intervention and from the study . Withdrawn participant s will not be replaced. 7.1.1. Virologic Criteria for Participa ntManagement and Viral Resistance Testing For the purposes of clinical management in this study , suspected virologic withdrawal (SVW) and confirmed virologic withdrawal (CVW) criteria are defined here, wherein the virologic withdrawal criteria are based on the HIV -1 RNA cut -off of 200 c/mL . Clinical management for precautionary virologic withdrawal (PVW) criteria are based onconsecutive viral loads ≥50 and <200 c/mL. Suspected Virologic Withdrawal criteria one assessment with HIV -1 RNA  200 c/mL after Day 1 with an immediately prior HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL Confirmed Virologic Withdrawal criteria one assessment with HIV -1 RNA  200 c/mL after Day 1 with an immediately prior HIV -1 RNA ≥50 c/mL Precautionary Virologic Withdrawal criteria may be met after two consecutive assessments with HIV-1 RNA 50 and <200 c/mL without an identifiable, non -virologic cause (immunization, illness, non-adherence) and after discussion with Medical Monitor, OR will be met with three consecutive assessments with HIV-1 RNA 50 an d <200 c/mL 7.1.1.1. Participant s Meeting Virologic Management Criteria Participant s with HIV -1 RNA plasma levels  50 c/mL at any visit after Day 1 meet “virologic management” criterion and must have plasma HIV -1 RNA levels re -assessed using the algorithm shown in Figure 2. Plasma HIV -1 RNA values determined by the central laboratory only will be used to assess virologic management criteria. Please refer to Appendix 14 in Section 11.14 for study management information during the COVID- 19 pandemic. Upon notification that a participant ’s HIV -1 RNA plasma level qualifies him/her as meeting a “virologic management” criterion, the Investigator should query the participant regarding intercurren t illness, recent immunisation, or interruption of therapy . All cases meeting “virologic management” criterion must be confirmed by a second measurement performed at least two weeks but not more than 4 weeks apar t from"
50,page_50,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 50the date of the original sample , unless delay is necessary to meet the requirements of confirmatory HIV -1 RNA testing as outlined below. The following guidelines should be followed for scheduling confirmatory HIV-1 RNA testing in an effort to avoid false- positive results: Confirmatory testing should be scheduled 2 to 4 weeks following resolution of any intercurrent illness , during which time the participant should rece ive full doses of all study intervention s. Confirmatory testing should be scheduled 4 weeks following an y immunisation , during which time the participant should receive full doses of study intervention s. If therap y is interrupted due to toxicity management, non -compliance, or other reasons, confirmatory testing should be scheduled 2 to 4 weeks following resump tion of full dose s of study intervention s. The participant should have r eceived full doses of study intervention s for at least 2weeks at the time confirmatory plasma HIV -1 RNA is done. Sites should c ontact the Medical Monitor to discuss individual participant s, whenever necessary. 7.1.1.2. Managing Participant s Meeting Precautionary Virologic Withdra wal (PVW) or Confirmed Virologic Withdra wal(CVW) Criteria Once a participant has been confirmed as meeting PVW or CVW criteria, a ‘plasma for storage’ sample from the earliest viral load ≥200 c/mL [if such is available for a PV W case), or from the SVW visit [ if ≥200 c/mL ) for a CVW case] will be sent as soon as possible for genot ypic and phenotypic resistance testing and the result made known to the Investigator if and when availab le.Plasma samples for storage also will be obtained at unscheduled visits including the time of CVW criteria (see Figure 2). Participant s may continue to receive stud y intervention at the discretion of the investigator until res ults of resistance testing are available at which time the participant must be discontinued from the study , except in cases where participant samples have HIV-1 RNA <500 c/mL, as noted below. A participant who meets a PVW or CVW criterion must be discont inued from the study. Selection of post -study ART regimen for participant s meeting virologic withdrawal criteria will be recorded in the eCRF . To collect additional information on participants who meet CVW or PVW criteria, please see details on the Sub-study of Virologic Response to Subsequent ART after Discontinuation from 208090 for Meeting CVW or PVW Criteria in Section 11.2. The protease (PRO)/reverse transcriptase (RT)/integrase assay s used in this study are not validated for plasma HIV -1 RNA levels <500 c/mL. Nevertheless, for all participant s who meet CVW criteria, plasma samples will be analy sed in an attempt to obtain genot ype/phenot ype data on samples with HIV -1 RNA ≥200 c/mL , as possible. Participant s with confirmed HI V-1 RNA levels between 200 c/mL and <500 c/mL shoul d be transitioned off stud y intervention within 30 days even if no resistance testing data becomes available, as genoty pe/phenot ype data may not be reliabl y generated from plasma samples collected from t hese participant s. If the confirmed HIV -1 RNA level is ≥50 and <200 c/mL, and the decision is taken to withdraw the participant , resistance"
51,page_51,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 51testing will not be done and the participant shoul d be transitioned off study intervention as soon as possible. If a participant is prematurely discontinued from participation in the study , the Investigator must make every effort to perform the evaluations outlined in the Schedule of Activities. These data will be recorded, as they comprise an essential evaluation that needs to be done before discharging any participant from the study ."

Investigators should not schedule reassessment blood draws in the presence of f actors that could be associated with virologic blips, such as intercurrent infection, treatment interruption due to toxicity management or non-compliance , or vaccination. Participant s should have received full doses of study inte rvention for at least 2 weeks at the time of plasma HIV -1 RNA reassessment. b. In case of withdrawal, a sample from the initial visit where the HIV -1 RNA plasma level is50 c/mL will be used for resistance testing only if HIV- 1 RNA level is 200 c/mL. If resistance testing will not be done, withdrawing participant s should be transitioned off study intervention as soon as possible. c. The medical monitor and investigator should consider intercurrent illness, recent immunization, interruption of therapy or ot her non-virologic reasons associated with transient elevated HIV -1 RNA measurements 50 and <200 c/mL. If no non -virologic reasons are identified to explain the lack of virologic suppression, the participant must be withdrawn. If the Investigator and the medi cal monitor agree that the participant is experiencing a slow re -suppression due to one of the above issues, then a retest HIV -1 RNA measurement is required in approximately 2 -4 weeks. If the HIV -1 RNA remains 50 c/mL on a second retest (the third consecu tive HIV -1 RNA assessment) , the participant must be withdrawn. d. Participant s with confirmed HIV -1 RNA results in the range 200 c/mL to <500 c/mL, shoul d be transitioned off study intervention and withdrawn from study within 30 days regardless of whether re sistance testing has been reported as genotype/phenotype data may not be reliably generated from plasma collected from these participant s"

Participants are not obligated to state the reason for withdrawal. However, a reason for withdrawal must be documented by the Investigator on the Completion/Withdrawal section of the electronic case report form (eCRF). Every effort should be made by the Investigator to follow -up participants who withdraw from the study . 7.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to r eturn for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to fol low up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up."

STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROC EDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) (Section 1.3). Please refer to Appendix 14 in Section 11.14 for study management information during the COVID -19 pandemic. Protocol waiver s or exemptions are not allowed Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue o r discontinue study intervention . Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participan t’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood count) and obtained before signing of I CF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. Screening Assessments Written informed consent must be obtained from each potentiall y eligible participant by study site personnel prior to the initiation of any Screening procedures as outlined in this protocol. The consent form must have been approved by the IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC). After signing an informed consent, participants will complete Screening assessments to determine participant eligibility . Each participant being screened for enrolment evaluation will be assigned a participan t number at the Screening visit. This number will be given sequentiall y in chronological order of participant presentation according to a numeric roster provided by PPD. Eligibility criteria must be assessed carefull y at the Screening visit. Physical exam inations should be conducted as part of normal routine clinical care but will not be collected s ystematicall y in the eCRF. Cardiovascular medical history /risk factors, including vital signs (as detailed in the eCRF) will be assessed at the Screening visit and assessments will include height, weight, blood pressure, smoking status and history , pertinent medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus), and family history of premature cardiovascular disease. Background information to be collected at Screening includes demograph y (year of birt h, sex, race and ethnicity ), prior ART history , medical history and current medical conditions, menopause his tory,concomitant medications, assessment of CDC HIV -1 classification, a 12 -lead ECG and laboratory assessments as detailed in Section 1.3. Eligible participants may be randoml y assigned immediately as soon as all Screening assessments are complete and the results are available and documented. All participants"
58,page_58,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 58will complete the Screening period up to 28 day s prior to Baseline (Day 1) during which all clinical and laboratory assessments of eligibility must be performed and reviewed. The Screening period of up to 28 day s is to accommodate availability of all Scr eening assessment results, completion of source document verification to satisfy the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria including the required previous HI V-1 RNA values, and scheduling. All Screening results must be available prior to randomization. All in formation about the participant’s current and any past regimen must be available for review by the Principal Investigator or designee prior to randomization . Source documents from other medical facilities must be located/received during the 28- dayscreeni ng period and under no circumstances may the participant be randomized in the absence of source documentation, even if there are delays in receipt of this information. A participant may be re -screened if the source documentation is obtained after the scree ning window closes. Details regarding prior resistance data must be noted in the source documentation. Resistance testing reports with genot ypic data must be provided to ViiV after screening and before randomization for review b y ViiV. Sites must wait fo r the study virologists to confirm the lack of exclusionary resistance mutations, which will be provided to the site before the screening window closes. Details for tracking historic resistance report availability and sending to ViiV Virology for evaluatio n are described in the S RM. Details regarding baseline or prior resistance data must be noted in the source documentation. If a participant is identified as having been mistakenly screened/randomized with exclusionary resistance, they will be withdrawn. Participants with chronic active hepatitis B virus infection are excluded. Evidence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is based on the results of testing at Screening for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibod y (anti -HBc), hepatit is B surface antibod y (anti -HBs), and HBV DNA. HBV DNA testing will only be performed for participants with positive anti -HBc and negative HBsAg and negative anti- HBs (past and/or current evidence). All participants will be screened for s yphilis at screen ing. Participants with untreated syphilis infection, defined as a positive Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) without clear documentation of treatment, are excluded unless they complet e treatment during the 28-day screening window and 7 day s prior to randomization . Participants who complete treatment after the screening window closes may be rescreened. Participants who meet all entry criteria are randomized and assigned a randomization number. Participants not meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria at initia l screen may be rescreened and receive a new participant number one time unless they were excluded for reason of having exclusionary historic genot ypic resistance or for a viral load ≥50c/mL at time of screening. Participants who are randomized into the trial and subsequently withdrawn from the study for any reason may not be rescreened."
59,page_59,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 59Baseline Assessments At Day 1 and prior to randomization, any changes to the eligibility parameters must be assessed and an y results required prior to randomization (e.g., Day 1 urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential) must be available and reviewed. Other baseline information to be collected at Day 1 includes assessment of HIV risk factors and mode of transmission, general medical history and current medic al conditions, and menopause history . Laboratory and health outcomes assessments will also be collected. Questionnaire/survey s are recommended to be administered at the beginning of the visit before an y other assessments are conducted. Refer to Section 1.3 for a summary of all procedures at the Baseline (Day 1) visit. 8.1. Efficacy Assessments Plasma HIV -1 RNA Plasma for quantitative HIV- 1 RNA will be collected according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3). Methods to be used may include but are not limited to the Abbott Realtime HIV -1 Assay lower limit of quantitation 40 c/mL . In some cases, (e.g., where the plasma HIV -1 RNA is below the lower limit of detection for a given assay ) additional exploratory methods may be used to further characterize plasma HIV -1 RNA levels. Lymphocyte Subsets Lym phocy te subsets will be collected for assessment by flow cytometry (total lymphocy te counts, percentage, and absolute CD4+ and CD8+ ly mphocy te counts, CD4+/CD8+ ratio ) according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3). CDC HIV -1 Classification and HIV Associated Conditions HIV-associated conditions w ill be recorded as per the S chedule of Activities (Section 1.3). HIV associated conditions will be assessed according to the 2014 CDC Revised Classification Sy stem for HIV Infection in Adults (see Section 11.12 ). When assessing CDC stage at Screening/B aseline, consider onl y the latest available CD4 T -cell count, except when the participant had an active Stage 3 event in the 6 months pri or to Screening. Indicators of clinical disease progression are defined as: CDC S tage 1 at enrolment → Stage 3 event; CDC Stage 2 at enrolment → Stage 3 event; CDC Stage 3 at enrolment → New Stage 3 Event; CDC Stage 1, 2 or 3 at enrolment → Death. 8.1.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary endpoint w ill be the proportion of participants wit h virologic failure endpoint as per FDA snapshot category at week 48 for the ITT -E population. Virologic"
60,page_60,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 60failure will include the following events; data in window not below 50 c/mL, discontinued for lack of efficacy , discontinued for other reason while no t below 50 c/ mL, and change in background therap y. 8.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Proportion of participants with plasma HIV- 1 RNA <50 c/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 using the Snapshot algorithm for the ITT -E population Percentage of participants with viral failur e endpoint as per FDA snapshot category at Weeks 24 Change from Baseline in CD4+ ly mphocy te count and in CD4+/CD8+ cell counts ratio at Weeks 24 and 48 Incidence of disease progression (HIV -associated conditions, AI DS and death). 8.2. Safet y Assessments Plann ed time points for all safety assessments are provided in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) (Section 1.3). 8.2.1. Physical Examinations Physical exams should be conducted as part of normal routine clinical care but will not be collected s ystematicall y in the eCRF. Abnormalities noted during an y exam must be recorded in the eCRF (e.g. in the current medical conditions or AE logs). 8.2.2. Vital Signs At the Screening visit, vital signs including height, weight and Bod y Mass Inde x (BMI) will be measured. The sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured in semi -supine position after 5 minutes rest. Body weight and BM I will also be assessed at each visit according to the Schedule of Activities (SoA) (Section 1.3). 8.2.3. Electrocardiograms A baseline 12-lead ECG will be conducted at the Screening visit, for possible use as a reference during the study (i.e. in evaluation of any pertinent cardiovascular event). 8.2.4. Clinical Safety Laborator y Assessments Refer to Appendix 7for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA (Section 1.3)for the timing and frequency . All protocol required laboratory assess ments must be performed by central laboratory services, with the exception of exceptional circumstances during screening noted in Section 5. Please refer to Appendix 14in Section 11.14 for study management information during the COVID- 19 pandemic. Laboratory assessments must be conducted in accordance with the Laboratory Manual, and SoA (Section 1.3).Laboratory requisition forms must be completed and samples"
61,page_61,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 61must be clearl y labelled with the subject number, protocol number, site/centre number, and visit date. Details for the preparation and shipment of samples will be provided b y Q2Solutions and a re detailed in the laboratory manual. Reference ranges for all safet y parameters will be provided to the site by Q2Solutions. If additional non -protocol specified laboratory assessments are performed at the institution’s local laboratory and result in a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant b y the investigator (e.g. SAE or AE or dose modification) the results must be recorded in the eCRF. Please refer to Appendix 14 in Section 11.14 for study management information during the COVID -19 pandemic. Labs will be graded automatically by the central lab according to the DAIDS toxicity scales (See Section 11.11 “Division of AIDS Tabl e for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events”). The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record an y clinicall y relevant changes occurring during the stud y in the AE section of the eCRF. The laborator y reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's c ondition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the s tudy or within 5 days after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered significantl y abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. Refer to the SRM for appropriate processing and handling of samples to avoid duplicate and/or additional blood draws. Haematology , clinical chemistry , urinal ysis and additional parameters to be tested are listed in Section 11.7. 8.2.5. Suicidal Risk Monitoring Participants with HIV infection occasionally may present with s ymptoms of depression and/or suicidality (suicidal ideation or behaviour ). In addition, there have been some reports of depression, suicidal ideatio n and behaviour (particularl y in p eople with a pre-existing history of depression or ps ychiatric illness) in some people being treated with I NIs, including DTG. Therefore, it is appropriate to monitor participants for suicidality before and during treatme nt. Participants should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for suicidal ideation and behaviour or any other unusual changes in behaviour . It is recommended that the"
62,page_62,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 62investigator consider mental health consultation or referral for participants who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour . Participants presenting with new onset/treatment emergent depression should be advised to contact the investigator immediately if symptoms of severe acute depression (including suicidal ideation/atte mpts) develop, because medical intervention and discontinuation of the study medication may be required. Assessment of treatment -emergent suicidalit y will be monitored during this study using the electronic version of the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rati ng Scale (eC -SSRS). The definitions of behavioural suicidal events used in this scale are based on those used in the Columbia Suicide History Form [ Posner , 2007]. Questions are asked on suicidal behaviour , suicidal i deation, and intensity of ideation. Day 1 (Baseline) visit questions will be in relation to lifetime experiences and current experiences (within the past 2months); all subsequent questioning is in relation to the last assessment. The eC -SSRS is to be adm inistered as a participant completed questionnaire specified in the SoA. The eC-SSRS will be conducted electronicall y by telephone or b y computer/tablet connected to the internet. Additionally , the investigator will collect information using the Possible S uicidality - Related AE (PSRAE) eCRF form in addition to the AE (non -serious or SAE) eCRF form on any participant that experiences a possible suicidality -related AE while participating in this study . This may include, but is not limited to, an event that in volves suicidal ideation, a preparatory act toward imminent suicidal behaviour , a suicide attempt, or a completed suicide. The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an event is possibly suicide-related. PSRAE forms should be completed and reported to ViiV/GSK within 1 week of the investigator diagnosing a possible suicidality -related AE. 8.2.6. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of stud y intervention andending at the final Follow- up visit . If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform ViiV/GSK/PPD within 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Section 11.4.3 . Any pregnancy that occurs during stud y participation must be reported using a clinical trial pregnancy form. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and child(ren). Pregnancy compli cations and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE sand must be reported . Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention after the participant has completed the study and considered by the investigator as possibly related to the study intervention must be reported promptly to ViiV/GSK (or designee). GSK’s central safet y department will forward this information to the ART Pregnancy Registry . The international registry is jointly sponsored by manufacturers or licensees of"
63,page_63,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 63ARV products. Additional information and a list of participating man ufacturers/licensees are available from http://www.apregistry .com/. 8.3. Adverse Events (AE) and Serious A dverse Events (SA Es) The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 8. The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or the study , or that caused the participa nt to discontinue the study (see Section 7). Please refer to Appendix 14 in Section 11.14 for study management information during the COVID -19 pandemic. 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SA E Information All SAEs will be collected from the start of treatment until the follow- up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). However, an y SA Es assessed as related to stud y participation (e.g., study intervention, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a ViiV/GSK product will be recorded from the time a participant consents to participate in t he stud y. All AEs will be collected from the start of treatment until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervent ion but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the case report form (e CRF) not the AE section. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 8. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the proc edures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided i n Appendix 8."
64,page_64,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 648.3.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AEoccurren ce. 8.3.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non- serious AEs of special interest will be followed until the event is resolve d, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). Further information on follow - up procedures is given in Appendix 8. 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study intervention under c linical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information e.g. , summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.3.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detaile d inSection 11.8.3 and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regard ing cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non- cardiovascular death. The CV e CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion."
65,page_65,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 65The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 8.3.6. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as SA Es The events or outcomes listed in the CDC Classification Sy stem for HIV- 1 Infections (Section 11.12 )will be recorded on the HIV -Associated Conditions eCRF page if they occur. However, these individual events or outcomes, as well as an y sign, sy mptom, diagnosis, illness, and/or clinical laboratory abnormality that can be linked to any of these events or outcomes are not reported to ViiV/GSK as AEs and SAEs even though such event or outcome may meet the definition of an AE or SAE, unless the following conditions apply : The investigator determines that the event or outcome qualifies as an SAE under part ‘f’ of the SAE definition ( see Section 11.8),or The event or outcome is in the investigator’s opinion of greater intensity , frequency or duration than expected for the individual participant, or Death occurring for any reason during a stud y, including death due to a disease -related event, will alway s be reported promptly . Lym phomas and invasive cervical carcinomas are excluded from this exemption; they must be reported as SAEs even if they are considered to be HI V-related. 8.4. Treatment of Overdose For this open- label study , any tablet intake exceeding the randomized daily number of tablets for DTG/3TC FDC will be considered an overdose [ Dolutegravir (TIVIC AY ) Product I nsert, 2017; EPIVI RProduct Information, 2017]. ViiV Healthcare does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose of DTG/3TC FDC . As appropriate, the Investigator should use clinical judgment and also refer to the prescribing information for the individual drugs used for CAR in treating overdose in the CAR arm. For the purposes of this study , an overdose is not an AE unless it is accompanied by a clinical manifestation associated with the overdose. If the clinical manifestation presents with se rious criteria, the event is a SAE ( see Section 11.8). If an overdose occurs and is associated with an adverse event requiring action, all study medications should be temporaril y discontinued until the adverse event resolves. In the event of an overdose, the investigator or treating ph ysician should: Contact the Medical Monitor immediately . Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until DTG/3TC FDC can no longer be detected s ystemically (at least 2 day s). Obtain a plasma sample for PK anal ysis within 60 hours from the date of the last dose of study intervention if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case -by- case basis)."
66,page_66,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 66Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 8.5. Pharmacokinetics Liver Eve nt As part of the follow -up for any liver stopping event, a blood sample for PK anal ysis will be collected if it can be obtained within 60 hours of the last dose (See Section 11.9.1 ). Overdose Only if reque sted b y the Medical Monitor, as part of the follow -up for any suspected overdose, a blood sample for PK anal ysis will be collect ed if it can be obtained within 60 hours from the date of the last dose of stud y intervention (See Section 8.4). 8.6. Pharmacody namics Pharmacod ynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 8.7. Genetics Genetics are not evaluated in this study . 8.8. Biomarkers Blood and urine are being collected to perform renal , bone and inflammatory biomarker assessments. Renal biomarkers : Cystatin C (blood) Retinol Binding Protein (RBP, urine), Beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M, urine ) Urine RBP/creatinine ratio Urine B2M/creatinine ratio urine albumin/creatinine ratio, urine protein/creatinine ratio,"
67,page_67,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 67urine phosphate, and serum creatinine. Bone biomarkers (blood) : bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, procollagen t ype 1 N -propeptide, type 1 collagen cross -linked C- telopeptide, osteocalcin Inflammatory Biomarkers (blood): Interleukin -6 (IL -6) High -sensitivity C reactive prot ein (hs -CRP) D-dimer Soluble CD14 (sCD14) Soluble CD163 (sCD163) HbA1c and i nsulin and glucose for HOMA -IRcalculation Other Biomarkers: Whole blood will be used for measurement of telomere length. Since the intention is to utilize these biomarkers for research purposes and the clinical significance of these results is uncertain, the Sponsor will not be reporting real time results of these assessments to the investigator except for C ystatin C (Day 1 only )and HbA1c . 8.9. Health Economics and Outcomes Resear ch Health outcomes assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Activities (SoA) (Section 1.3). In the event of translations being unavailable, no such assessments will be conducted and the responses will be considered as missing in the final anal yses. Assessments are recommended to be administered at the beginning of the visit prior to collection of blood for analysis and other scheduled assessments. Questionnaires will be administered on paper ex cept the willingness to switch survey , which will be a verbal question. The following health outcomes assessments will be utilized in this study :"
68,page_68,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 68To assess the reason(s) for their participation and facilitate an understanding of participant ’s willingness to switch, participant s will be asked a single item question prior to randomization. The HIV treatment satisfaction questionnaire (HIV TSQ) (status version) [ Woodcock , 2001; Woodcock , 2006] is a 10- item self -reported scale that measures overall satisfaction with treatment and by specific domains e.g., convenience, flexibility . The Sy mpto m Distress Module (also called the HIV Sy mptom Index or Sy mptoms Impact Questionnaire ) is a 20-item self -reported measure that addresses the presence and perceived distress linked to sy mptoms commonly associated with HIV or its treatment [ Justice , 2001]. 8.10. HIV-1 Poly merase Viral Genoty ping and Phenoty ping Whol e venous blood samples will be obtained from each participant to provide plasma for storage samples according to the Schedule of Activities (for potential viral genoty pic and phenot ypic analyses). Participants meeting CVW criteria will have plasma samples tested for HIV -1 PRO and RT genotype and phenoty pe and HIV -1 integrase genot ype and phenot ype from samples collected at the time of meeting SVW criteria; these results will be reported to the investigator as soon as available to provide guidance for elect ion of an alternative regimen Details concerning the handling, labelling and shipping of these samples will be supplied separately . Genot ypic and phenotypic anal yses may be carried out by Monogram Biosciences using, but not limited to, their Standard Phen oSense and GenoSure testing methods for PRO, RT, and integrase assay s. A secondary endpoint of the study will be the incidence of observed genoty pic and phenoty pic resistance to DTG or 3TC and to CAR for participants meeting Virologic Withdrawal criteria. The virologic endpoint may also be assessed based on third- agent class. 8.10.1. HIV-1 Exploratory Analysis HIV-1 exploratory anal ysis may be carried out for participants meeting virologic failure criteria, and for all participants to more broadl y assess the contri bution of Baseline genot ypic information on study results. These tests may be carried out on whole blood or stored plasma samples collected at Baseline and/or on stored plasma samples from other relevant time points as long as this is feasible per local country and laboratory practices . These exploratory tests and analyses may include but are not limited to additional viral genoty ping and/or phenot yping, as well as other virologic evaluations such as linkage and minority species anal yses, low level HIV -1RNA quantitation , viral DNA quantitation and measurement of viral replicative capacit y. HIV-1 PRO and RT genot ype and phenot ype and HIV -1 integrase genoty pe and phenot ype will also be determined on the last on -treatment isolates from participants who hav e HIV -1 RNA 400 c/mL regardless of confirmatory HIV-1 RNA ."

Statistical Hy potheses This study is designed to show that the antiviral effect of switching to a simplified two - drug regimen of DTG/3TC FDC once -daily is not inferior t o continuation of their CAR at week 48 in ART -experienced participant sliving with HIV -1. Non-inferiorit y will be concluded if the upper bound of a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in virologic failure rates between the two treatment ar ms is smaller than 5%. If r d is the virologic failure rate on DTG/3TC FDC and r f is the virologic failure rate on the CAR regimen, then the hy potheses can be written as follows: H0: rd– rf ≥5% H 1: rd– rf<5% 9.2. Sample Size Determination 9.2.1. Sample Size A ssumptions Theoriginal sample size calculation required approximately 300 participants per arm (from a target of 857 screened participants) based on a true virologic failure rat e of 2.25% perarm, a non-inferiority margin of 4%, and a 2.5% one -sided significance level to provide approximately 91% power to show non- inferiorit y for the proportion of participants with virologic failure (per FDA’s snapshot algorithm for assessing HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL ) at Week 48. The COVID -19pandemic of 2019/2020 occurred during screening ,and enrolment. Because of the COVID -19 pandemic, there is potential impact on participant compliance with study visits, study drug adherence, and data quality , and then consequently the virologic failure rate could be higher than originally expected. With the increase of assumed true virologic failure rate, we propose to change non -inferiorit y margin from 4% to 5%. Assuming a virologic failure rate of 3%, a non -inferiorit y margin of 5%, and a 2.5% one -sided significance level, a sample size of 245 participant s per arm would provide approximately 90% power to show non- inferiorit y for the proportion of participants with virologic failure (per FDA’s snapshot algorithm for assessing HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL ) at Week 48 . Based on the sample size recalculation and both statistical and practical consideration sdue to COVID -19 pandemic, a decision was made to terminate the stud y enrolment. At the time of enrolment termination, approximately 445 participants were randomized and 53 were in screening. Assuming a 20% screen failure rate the final number of participants is expected to be approximately 490(245per arm). Rationale for non -inferiority margin According to the FDA’s 2015 guidance document (Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Infection: Development of ART Drugs for Treatment, November 2015), the margin for switch trials is driven by the largest clinicall y tolerable virologic failure rate and could be from 4% to 6% depending on virologic failure rate . Per the FDA document, t ypical rates of virologic failure seen in switch studies range from 1 to 3 percent and a margin of 4%"
70,page_70,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 70for virologic failure rate wasoriginally considered tolerable [CDER ,2015]. However due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the virologic failure rate could be higher than originall y expected and hence the increase in the margin to 5%. 9.2.1.1. Response and virologic failure rate assumptions Table 2 shows Snapshot response (HIV-1 RNA<50 c/mL )rates and Snapshot virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL )rates in previous switch studies in ART- experienced participant sliving with HIV -1. Taken together and without considering the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic , these data suggest that a reasonable assumption for the true failure rate for the current ART control arm and the switch arm is 2.25%.Taking into consideration of the impact of COVID -19,we assume a virologic failure rate of 3% in both the CAR control arm and the switch arm ."

Participant s will be assessed according to their randomized treatment, regardless of the treatment they rece ive. Unless stated otherwise, the ITT -E Population will be used for efficacy analyses."
74,page_74,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 74Population Description Per ProtocolThis population will consist of participant s in the ITT -E Population with the exception of protocol deviations which could affect the assessment of antivir al activity.

Safety The Safety Population is defined as a ll randomized participants who take at least 1 dose of study in tervention . Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received. Unless otherwise stated, the Safety Population will be used for safety analyses. 9.4. Statistical A nalyses Additionally , special statistical and data analy sis consider ations may be warranted in the event that the COVID -19 or related epidemics or natural disasters may affect the study and data integrit y. To the extent possible, these will be described in the main study RAP; alternativel y, a separate RAP focusing on modi fied data handling rules (eg, changes to analysis populations, visit windows and endpoints) and anal yses (eg, sensitivity anal yses to assess impact of and account for missing data) may be prepared, taking in to account applicable regulatory guidance and in dustry best practices for handling such situations [FDA , 2020; EMA , 2020a; EMA , 2020b]. 9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods PrimaryFor the primary comparison, adjusted est imates of the difference in the virologic failure rate between the two arms will be presented along with CIs based on a stratified analysis using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) weights. All CIs will be two- sided. For the statistical analysis, three strata (subgroups) will be formed according to the combinations of levels of the following categorical variables:  Baseline third agent: PI  Baseline third agent: INI  Baseline third agent: NNRTI The CMH estimate of the common difference in rates across strata will be calculated as the weighted average of the strata- specific estimates of the difference in response rates between the two arms as follows: If nk is the number of DTG /3TC FDC treated participant s, mk is the number of INI- , NNTRI -, or PI- based ART treated participant s, and Nk = nk + mk is"

The corresponding two -sided 95% CI will be calculated as using the variance estimator given by [ Sato, 1989], which is consistent in both sparse data and large strata. The full equation for this variance e stimate is provided in the RAP. Full details will be contained in the RAP. The weighted least squares chi -squared statistic [ Fleiss , 1981] will be used to test for one -way homogeneity across the levels of each categ orical variable, with each categorical variable considered separately. Following Lui and Kelly [ Lui, 2000], ½ will be added to each cell in any strata for which the stratum -specific rate estimates of either rd or rf are zero, and tests will be one-sided. Any heterogeneity found to be statistically significant will be explored and if necessary results will be reported for each level of the categorical variable. Investigation of heterogeneity will be confined to the primar y endpoint using the Week 48 Snapshot analysis. Tests of homogeneity will be assessed at the one -sided 10% level of significance. Further efficacy analyses to assess the sensitivity of the primary endpoint will be performed. Details of the sensitivity analyses will be included in the RAP and will include the responder endpoint as per FDA snapshot category, ‘time to event’ methods which censor participant s who discontinue from the study with viral load <50 c/mL or for non -efficacy -treatment related reasons. In these analyses, participant s will be considered to have had an event i f they have a confirmed viral load ≥50 c/mL or discontinue for efficacy related reasons."

Interim Analyses One anal ysis will be conducted to evaluate the primary objective of the protocol when all participant s have completed their Week 48 visit. An interim anal ysis will be conducted when all participant s have completed their Week 24 visit. To minimise bias, the Week 24 results will not be shared with participant s and investigators, or presented externally until after the last participant completes their last visit for the primary Week 48 anal ysis. Further data cuts and analy ses may be conducted as necessary to support regulatory submissions and publications. The Week 48 anal ysis will be primary. No adjustment for multiplicity caused b y repeated evaluation of the primary endpoint will be made as the Week 24 anal yses wil l be secondary . 9.5.1. Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC) AnIDMC will be instituted to ensure external objective medical and/or statistical review of efficacy in order to protect the ethical interests and well -being of participants and to protect the scientific validity of the stud y. An ad -hoc review of data b y the IDMC will be triggered whenever the number of participants meeting CVW criteria in the DTG/3TC FDC arm exceeds thresholds pre -specified in the IDMC charter , to ensure that participants are not being sub -optimally treated. Full details of the methods, timing, decision criteria and operating characteristics will be pre -specified in the IDMC Charter. The Reporting and Anal ysis Plan will describe the planned interim anal yses in greater detail ."
78,page_78,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 789.5.2. Analysis Datasets The primary anal ysis set of data is based on virologic failure defined b y the FDA snapshot algorithm. With the exception below, virologic failure includes participants who changed an y component of background therap y to a new drug class, changed background components that were not permitted per protocol, or changed an y background drug in the regimen because of lack of efficacy (perceived or documented) before Week 48; participant s who discontinued study intervention or study before Week 48 for lack or loss of efficacy and participant s who are equal to or above 50 c/mL in the 48- week window. A secondary anal ysis set of data is based on participants’ responses at <50 c/mL calculated according to the FDA’s snapshot algorithm. This algorithm t reats all participants without HIV -1 RNA data at the visit of interest (due to missing data or discontinuation of I P prior to visit window) as non -responders, as well as participants who switch their concomitant ART prior to the visit of interest, since no switches (with the exception below) are allowed in the protocol. Note: A switch from a PI boosted with ritonavir to the same PI boosted with cobicistat (and vice versa) is permitted per protocol and a switch from lamivudine to emtricitabine and vice ver sa is also permitted and will not be considered as a change in background ART hence, will not incur a penalty in the Snapshot algorithm, regardless of reason or date of switch, as these agents are expected to have similar boosting effect and no impact on overall efficacy of the regimen. Otherwise, virologic success or failure will be determined by the last available HIV -1 RNA assessment while the participant is on- treatment within the visit of interest window (to be specified in the RAP). Full details of this snapshot algorithm will be contained in the RAP. Another secondary set of data will treat participants as censored if they discontinue for reasons other than those related to treatment (AEs, tolerability and lack of efficacy ). This data set will be the Treatment Related Discontinuation = Failure data set. The observed case (OC) dataset, which uses onl y data that are available at a particular time point with no imputation for missing values, will be the primary dataset for assessing safety and will a lso be used for some analy ses of efficacy and health outcomes. Further details will be provided in the RAP. 9.5.3. Treatment Comparisons 9.5.3.1. Primary Comparison of Interest The primary anal ysis will be based on the ITT- E population using the Snapshot virologic failure dataset. The primary comparison will be made at a one -sided 2.5% level of significance. Treatment with DTG/3TC FDC will be declared non -inferior to the CAR if the upper bound of a two -sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two grou ps in virologic failure rates at Week 48 lies below 5%."
79,page_79,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 799.5.3.2. Other Comparisons of Interest The anal ysis described above will also be performed using the PP population and the results will be compared for consistency with the results from the ITT- E population. If both analy ses show non -inferiorit y,then the h ypothesis that the antiviral effect of treatment with DTG/3TC FDC is superior to the CAR treatment will be tested using the same level of significance as for the tests of non -inferiorit y. Superiorit y will be declared if the upper bound of the confidence internal is below 0%. The following key secondary comparison will be tested: Non-inferiorit y of switching to DTG/3TC FDC compared to continuation of CAR with respect to virologic success endpoint as per FDA s napshot category using a -12% non -inferiority margin. No multiplicity adjustments for statistical testing of secondary endpoints will be performed; however, all tests will be pre- specified in the RAP."

Rationale for CVW and PVW Sub-study This sub- study will evaluate and determine the virologic response to subsequent regimens of participants who have virologic failure to DTG/3TC FDC . The evaluation period wil l start from the time the participan t is discontinued from the 208090 study for confirmed virologic withdrawal ( CVW ) or precautionary virologic withdrawal (PVW) criteria while on DTG/3TC FDC , and will last for up to 12 months. The results of this study may provide informat ion that will help guide treatment decisions for people living with HIV who virologically fail a DTG/ 3TC FDC regimen. 11.2.2. Sub-study Objectives and Endpoints Objectives Endpoints Exploratory To determine the drug regimens that are used after CVW or PVW with D TG/3TC FDC .Incidence of drug regimens used as subsequent regimens after CVW or PVW with DT G/3TC FDC.

93,page_93,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 9311.3. Appendix 3: Toxicity Management Adverse events that occur during the trial should be evaluated b y the investigator and graded according to the DAIDS toxicity scales ( see Section 11.11 ). Additional information regarding detecting, documenting and reporting AEs and SAEs are available in Section 11.8. Study intervention may be interrupted at the discretion of t he investigator and according to the severit y of the AE. If one or more ART medication is held due to toxicity or AEs, all ART medications should be held to reduce the risk of development of resistance taking into account the length of the planned interruptions and the PK half- life of each ART of the regimen, in order to minimize the risk of development of resistance. No toxicity -related dose reductions of study interventions will be allowed. Study interventions should be restarted as soon as medically appropriate; in general, this should be no longer than 4 weeks after interruption (unless Grade 3 or 4 toxicities persist). Decisions regarding sequential reintroduction of study interventions or temporary interruption of one but not all drugs within the ART regimen should be made with the understanding that these changes may result in incomplete viral suppression and selection of resistant virus. Guidance is provided below on participant management and study intervention interruptions based on the severity of the AE for specific toxicities. All changes in stud y intervention must be accurately recorded in the participant’s eCRF. Grade 1 or Grade 2 Toxicity/Adverse Event Participants who develop a Grade 1 or Grade 2 AE or toxicity may continue study intervent ion at the discretion of the investigator. Participants who choose to withdraw from the study due to a Grade 1 or 2 AE should have study withdrawal and follow -up evaluations completed. Grade 3 Toxicity/Adverse Event Participants who develop a Grade 3 AE or toxicity should be managed as follows: If the investigator has compelling evidence that the Grade 3 AE or toxicity has not been caused b y stud y intervention, dosing may continue after discussion with the medical monitor. Participants who develop a Grade 3 AE or toxicity that the investigator considers related or possibly related to the interventions should have study intervention withheld and be rechecked each week until the AE returns to Grade 2. Once the AE is Grade ≤2, study intervention may be resta rted. Should the same Grade 3 AE recur within 28 day s in the same participant, study intervention should be permanently discontinued and the participant withdrawn from study . Participants experiencing Grade 3 AEs requiring permanent discontinuation of study intervention should be followed weekl y until resolution of the AE and have withdrawal study evaluations completed. A Follow -up visit should be performed 4weeks after the last dose of study interventions."
94,page_94,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 94Participants with asy mptomatic Grade 3 laborat ory abnormalities should be investigated for all potential non -drug related causes, and, following discussion with the medical monitor, may continue study intervention if the investigator has compelling evidence that the toxicity is not related to study intervention. Exceptions are noted for lipid abnormalities in Section 11.3.1.7 andrash in Section 11.3.1.6 . Grade 4 Toxicity/Adverse Event Participants who develop a G rade 4 AE or toxicity should have study intervention discontinued. However, if the investigator has compelling evidence that the AE is not causall y related to the study interventions, dosing may continue after discussion with and assent from the medical m onitor. Participants should be rechecked each week until the AE returns to Grade 2. Participants experiencing Grade 4 AEs requiring permanent discontinuation of study intervention should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE and encouraged to complete the withdrawal and follow -up study evaluations as noted above. Participants with asymptomatic Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities should be investigated for all potential non -drug related causes, and, following discussion with the medical monitor, may continue therapy if the investigator has compelling evidence that the toxicity is not related to study intervention. Exceptions are noted for lipid abnormalities in Section 11.3.1.7 . An in-clinic Follow -Up visit will be conducted approximately 4weeks after the last dose of study medication for participants with ongoing AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs) regardless of attributability, and an y laboratory abnormalities that are considered to be AEs or potentially harmful to the participant , at the last on -study visit. 11.3.1. Specific Toxicities/Adverse Event Management General guidelines for the management of specific toxicities that are considered to be related or possibl y related to study intervention are provided below. Participants who permanently discontinue study intervention for reasons of toxicity should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE and encouraged to complete the withdrawal and Follow -up study evaluations (see Section 7.2). 11.3.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping and Follo w-up Criteria Liver chemistry threshold stopping criteria have been designed to assure participant safet y and to evaluate liver event aetiology during administration of study intervention and the follow-up period.

Restarting Study Intervention Refer to Section 11.9.2 for details on drug restart following transient resolving liver events not related to study intervention. 11.3.1.3. Decline in Renal Function Participants who experience an increase in serum creatinine from Baseline of 45 micromoles/liter ( Mol/L ) (or 0.5 milligrams/deciliter [mg/d L]) should return for a confirmatory assessment within 2 to 4 weeks. A urinaly sis, urine albumin/creatinine and urine total protein/ creatinine ratios, serum cy statin C and an estimated GFR using the CKD -EPI (cystatin C) [ Inker , 2012] should also be done at this confirmatory visit. If the creatinine increase is confirmed, the investigator should contact the study medical monitor to discuss additional follow-up and medical management. Participants who experience progres sion to an estimated GFR (using the CKD -EPI- creatinine) of <30 mL/min/1.73m2must return for a c onfirmatory assessment within 2weeks [ Leve y, 2009]. A urinaly sis, urine albumin/creatinine and urine protein/creatinine ratios, serum cy statin C and an estimated GFR using the CKD -EPI (cystatin C) [ Ink er , 2012] should be done at this confirmatory visit. If an estimated GFR of <30 mL /min/1.73m2is confirmed using the CKD -EPI (cy statin C), then study intervention should be discontinued and the participant withdrawn from the study (as dose adjustment is needed for NRTIs, which is not possible in a study of a fixed -dose combination tablet). 11.3.1.4. Proteinuria Participants with an abnormal urine a lbumin/creatinine ratio (>0.3 mg/mg, >300 mg/g, or >34 mg/mmol) that represents a change from Baseline and no associated increase in creatinine, should have a repeat spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio performed within 2-4 weeks. If confirmed, then consid eration should be given to additional evaluation after consultation with the study medical monitor. Additional evaluation may include a 24- hour urine protein and creatinine measurement and nephrology referral. Participants with an abnormal urine albumin/creatinine ratio (>0.3 mg/mg, 300 mg/g, or >34 mg/mmol and representing a change from Baseline) and a serum creatinine increase >45 μmol/L (or 0.5 mg/dL) should have confirmation of both results within 2 weeks. If confirmed, the stud y medical monitor should be contacted immediatel y. Agreement on further management should be agreed between the investigator and medical monitor. 11.3.1.5. Allergic reaction Participants may continue study intervention for Grade 1 or 2 allergic reactions at the discretion of the Investigat or. The participant should be advised to contact the Investigator immediatel y if there is an y worsening of sy mptoms or if further sy stemic signs or s ymptoms develop. Antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, or antipruritic agents may be prescribed."
96,page_96,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 96Participants with Grade ≥3 allergic reactions that are considered to be possibly or probably related to the study intervention should permanentl y discontinue study intervention and the participant should be withdrawn from the stud y. Participants should be tre ated as clinicall y appropriate and followed until resolution of the AE. 11.3.1.6. Rash Mild to moderate rash is an expected adverse reaction for DTG- containing ART. Episodes generally occur within the first ten weeks of treatment, rarel y require interruptions or di scontinuations of therap y and tend to resolve within two to three weeks. No instances of serious skin reaction, including SJS, TEN and ery thema multiforme, have been reported for DTG in clinical trials. For further characterisation of HSR and rash observ ed with DTG -containing ART, please see the current version of the IB and any IB supplements [ GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RM2007/00683/11, GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N352880_00, GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N352880_01]. Participants with an isolated Grade 1 rash may continue study intervention at the Investigator’s discretion. The participant should be advised to contact the Investigator immediately if there is a ny worsening of the rash, if any systemic signs or sy mptoms appear, or if mucosal involvement develops. Participants may continue study intervention for an isolated Grade 2 rash. However, study intervention (and all other concurrent medication(s) suspecte d in the Investigators causality assessment) should be permanentl y discontinued for an y Grade ≥2 rash that is associated with an increase in ALT. The participant should be advised to contact the physician immediatel y if rash fails to resolve (after more than two weeks), if there is an y worsening of the rash, if any systemic signs or allergic s ymptoms develop, or if mucosal involvement develops. Participants should permanently discontinue study intervention [and all other concurrent medication(s) suspected in the I nvestigators causality assessment] for an isolated Grade 3 or 4 rash, except where the aetiology of the rash has been definitively diagnosed as NOT attributable to study intervention (see below), and the participant should be withdrawn from the stu dy. Participants should be treated as clinically appropriate and followed until resolution of the AE. Every effort should be made to collect as much information as possible about the evolution of the event and an y relationship with potentially related medical events (e.g., viral infection) or start of concomitant medication. The rash and an y associated sy mptoms should be reported as adverse events and appropriate toxicity ratings should be used to grade the events (based on DAIDS toxicity gradings, Sectio n 11.10 . However, if the aetiology of the rash has been definitively diagnosed as being unrelated to study intervention and due to a specific medical event or a concomitant infection or a concomitant non -study medication, routine management should be performed and"

Collection of Pregnancy Information Female Participants who become pregnant Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who becomes preg nant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to ViiV/GSK/PPD within 2 weeks of learning of a participant's pregnancy . Participants will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . The investigator will collect follow up information on participant and neonate, which will be forwarded to ViiV/GSK/PPD. Generall y, follow -up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks bey ond the estimated delivery date. GSK’s central safety departme nt will forward this information to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry . The international registry is jointly sponsored b y manufacturers and licensees of antiretroviral products. Additional information and a list of participating manufacturers/licen sees are available from http://www.apregistry .com/. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure. While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, an y pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE s and must be reported . Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy which is considered reasonabl y related to the study intervention b y the investigator, will be reported to ViiV/GSK/PPD as described in Appendix 8. While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting. Any female participant who become s pregnant while participating will be wit hdrawn from the study ."

Definition of A E AE Definition An A E is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safety assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator ( i.e., not related to progression of underly ing disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomita nt medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pha rmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE."
107,page_107,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 107Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medica l or surgical procedure ( e.g., endoscopy , appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluct uations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 11.8.2. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met ( e.g., hospi talization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occu rred, or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from"
108,page_108,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 108baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability mean s a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and ac cidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised i n deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediatel y life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allerg ic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 11.8.3. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill ou t the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral a rterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization"
109,page_109,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 10911.8.4. Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation ( e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF. It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to ViiV/GSK/PPD in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE eCRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y ViiV/GSK/PPD. I n this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to ViiV/GSK/PPD. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the categories in the Division of AI DS Table for Grading the Severi ty of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (“DAIDS AE Grading Table”) in Section 11.10 : Grade 1/ Mild Grade 2/ Moderate Grade 3/ Severe Grade 4/ Potentially life threatening Grade 5/ Death An event is defined as ‘ serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe."
110,page_110,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 110Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment t o determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provide d an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to ViiV/GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of c ausality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to ViiV/GSK/PPD. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment. Thecausality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medicall y indicated or as requested b y ViiV/GSK/PPD to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the investigator will provide ViiV/GSK with a cop y of any post-mortem findings including histopathology ."
111,page_111,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 111New or updated information will be r ecorded in the originally completed eCRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to ViiV/GSK/PPD within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 11.8.5. Reporting of SA E and other events to ViiV/GSK/PPD Reporting of SAEs and other events to ViiV/GSK/PP D The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to ViiV/GSK/PPD will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event with in 24 hours. The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. The investigator or medically -qualified sub -investigator must show evidence within the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the relationship of each SAE to IP/study participation (causality ) within 72 hours of SAE entry into the eCRF. After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of ne w data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this inf ormation on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to the medical monitor by telephone. Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the SRM SAE Reporting to GSK via Paper CRF If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for greater than 24 hours, the site wil l use the paper SAE data collection tool and scan and email it to the Medical Monitor Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the SRM"

Appendix 1 3: Country -specific requirements United Kingdom This requirement has been included bas ed on requests from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to include information on the specific duration of the Continuation Phase/Study Intervention for similar Phase III trials being conducted with dolutegravir. Study Duration In this study , the date of last study intervention administration in the UK will be determined by the completion of the 52week randomized phase of the study for the last UK participant enrolled (it will not be determined by the completion of the Continuati on Phase). The last participant will be enrolled b y Q1 2020/Q 2 2020, and hence the last study intervention administration will occur by Q1 2021/Q2 2021. (Note: The Continuation Phase is intended to provide participants receiving DTG/3TC FDC with post-study access to DTG/3TC FDC until DTG plus 3TC is approved as a 2-drug regimen in their local countries. For participants in the UK, the Continuation Phase is not anticipated to be required as the 2- drug regimen of DTG /3TC FDC is anticipated to be approved by Q3/Q4 2020 . Sweden and Denmark A country specific protocol amendment ,208090 Amendment 03/SWE -DEN -1,was previously published on 29 -July-2019 for Sweden and Denmark to remove all reference s to the Continuation Phase.

Appendix 14: COVID -19 Pandemic and Clinical Trial Continuit y Background The COVID -19 pandemic presents significant logistical challenges for many clinical sites around the world, with variable restrictions being placed on site resources and ope rations, and on an individual participant’ s ability to attend clinic visits. I n some places, medical visits are occurring, and in others, research clinics are operating with only emergency staff. Based on these challenges, it may be necessary to adopt add itional measures and procedures to protect participant safet y,and to ensure that there are no gaps in HIV -1 treatment for participants enrolled in this clinical study , through continuous access to antiretroviral therap y. In order to maintain the scientifi c integrity of the study , and adhere to updated guidance from regulators, procedures have also been put into place to ensure that the actions taken to mitigate against an y impact of COVID -19 are well documented in the trial database. A “Memo to Dolutegravi r Clinical Trial Investigators and Study Staff ” was issued on March 25th, 2020 and served as a record of approved emergency actions being taken within this clinical trial to manage issues related to COVID- 19. That memo continues to serve as record of appr oved actions which can be fully implemented b y Investigators, in advance of this protocol guidance. This appendix will remain consistent with the guidance provided within the March 25, 2020 “Memo to Dolutegravir Clinical Trial Investigators and Study Staff” and will also serve to provide additional protocol documentation requirements and procedures. This appendix outlines the measures which are approved for implementation within this clinical trial, to protect patient safet y and to ensure the integrity of the clinical trial, as a result of COVID -19 onl y. These measures may be implemented in accordance with an y requirements and expectations set out by local Independent Review Boards/I ndependent Ethics Committees and National Competent Authorities, as necessa ry. This appendix does not apply toparticipant management issues that are unrelated to a specific, and documented, impact from COVID -19. 11.14.1. Changes to Study Visits and Study Procedures When site staff resources are limited due to COVID -19, abbreviated study visits may proceed without conducting all protocol- specified additional assessments (e.g. lab tests, questionnaires, etc.) . If lab oratory testing will be missed for more than one consecutive visit, medical monitor pre- notification is required, and all efforts should be made to find alternative approaches for lab testing. Consider alternative travel options for participants, if possible."
158,page_158,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 158When central lab oratory testing is not possible at a particular visit, tests for management of participant safet y, incl uding HIV -1 RNA may be performed at an appropriatel y authorised/accredited local laboratory (or other relevant clinical facility ), if this can be done within local restrictions on phy sical distancing. The site should proactively inform PPD/ thesponsor about such instances. Local laboratory results done as per routine follow -up, including HIV -1 RNA ,may be used to inform safet y and patient management decisions. Results should be retained in source records and added to the eCRF . oIf labs are collected on site and cannot be processed (either via central lab shipping, or local labs), freeze (and maintain at correct temperature for later processing) those samples that are sent frozen. Please safel y discard ambient samples per site standards. When on- site visits a re reduced, it is important that the investigator continue collecting relevant clinical information, including AEs/SAEs , from the participant through alternative means, e.g. b y telephone contact . The assessment should include inquiries to determine if the participant has been impacted b y COVID -19. Other protocol assessments and procedures as specified in the Schedule of Activities should be completed where possible (e.g. answer questions, update concomitant medications, emphasize adherence, plan/schedule participants return for next scheduled visit). This information should be placed in source records and entered intothe eCRF when next possible. If the eC -SSRS assessment is able to be completed as part of the remote telephone visit, participants can comple te the eC-SSRS at home by providing them with the activation code and the phone number or URL. Where possible, the site should be in contact with the participant before and after the completion of the assessment to ensure proper follow -up of positive alerts and have plans in place for addressing an y positive results, and referring for care as necessary .The HIV TSQ and SDM questionnaires may be completed over the phone. There may be cases where the current principal investigator (PI) of a site is indispose d for a period and may need to delegate parts of his/her duties temporaril y, e.g. to a sub -investigator. An y such changes should be documented in the site’s source records . Any permanent changes in PI should be communicated to the sponsor. There may also b e circumstances where immediate actions are required by the sponsor and/or investigator, outside of what is contemplated in the protocol, in order to protect a stud y participant from immediate hazard. Any such measures will be carefully documented and cond ucted in accordance with the National Competent Authority (NCA)/I RB/IEC regulations. 11.14.2. Changes to Informed Consent Informed consent should continue per normal procedure and as described in the main body of the protocol, to the extent possible. However, ther e may be circumstances where re-consent of participants is needed, and a physical signature on site is not possible. I n these cases, alternative way s of obtaining such re -consent should be considered, such as"
159,page_159,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 159the investigator contacting the participant b y telephone or video call and obtaining verbal consent, supplemented with email confirmation. Any alternative informed consent procedure must be undertaken only after site IRB/Ethics Committee agreement and approval . Any updated informed consent form or ot her participant -facing materials should be provided to participants by e-mail, mail or courier before re -consent is obtained. Any consent obtained this way should be documented in source records and confirmed by way of normal consent procedure at the earliest opportunity when participants attend their next on -site study visit. The changes to the protocol, including COVID -19 related changes may be implemented before an ICF including COVID -19 related updates will be signed. 11.14.3. Direct -To-Patient (DTP) Shipment o f Study IP If a participant is unable to attend a study visit or to come to the site to pick -up investigational product (IP) due to site restrictions, or due to an inability to travel to the site (for personal precaution/sequestration, or government manda ted travel restrictions, etc.), sites can consider DTP shipments of drug, from the site, to the participant, to ensure access to medicines. All other options, including alternative travel options for participants, should be considered before reverting to DTP shipments. If the stud y site is considering DTP shipment of IP, the site must first verify if DTP I P dispensing by investigators/hospital pharmacies is locall y permitted and whether it requires regulatory and/or local ethics pre- approval, or post -hoc notification. The study participant should express his/her agreement for DTP shipment and the sharing of their personal information with any third -party couriers (as applicable), in accordance with local requirements. This agreement should be documented in source records. Enough IP to bridge to the next scheduled study visit can be supplied. For example, if the next visit is 12 weeks away , a 12- week suppl y can be dispensed via the I RT s ystem NOTE: When the visit interval is only 4 weeks, then at least 8 we eks of IP can be provided to the participant Ensure local courier vendors, or vendors of hospital pharmacies, can ensure proper in-transit temperature monitoring, have enough shipper boxes and temperature loggers and can document storage conditions during IP transportation. Where temperature monitoring is not available, oral DTG/3TC FDC can be shipped at ambient temperatures with couriers that can provide shipper boxes capable of maintaining the shipment temperature storage requirements as described in the study guides. The risk of going outside of the excursion ranges"
160,page_160,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 160listed in the study guide should be evaluated and documented. Proper documentation of the shipment should be maintained. In all cases IP accountability must be maintained, and all DTP dispensi ng documentation should be reflected in source records and dispensing logs per GCP. Please refer to your CRA or local study manager for support with the DTP process, ensuring reference to current sponsor guidance and arrangement of a courier that can suppo rt shipment of I P directly to participants. Remember that an y courier deliveries can be affected by limitations of movements imposed by governments in relation to COVID -19. Local courier vendors should be equipped to reduce risks of COVID -19 contamination during transportation. 11.14.4. COVID -19 Experimental A gents If any treatments for COVID -19 are planned for a study participant, please consult with the study medical monitor to ensure that relevant drug interactions are considered and to ensure that continued st udy participation remains appropriate. If any participants are being considered for enrolment into clinical studies for COVID -19 treatment or vaccinations, please consult with the study medical monitor to ensure that relevant drug interactions are consider ed and to ensure that continued study participation remains appropriate. The protocols do not allow for enrolment in other interventional studies, though, there may be exceptions in this pandemic. Please discuss with the study team and Medical monitor. 11.14.5. COVID-19 Specific Data Capture 11.14.5.1. Capturing COVID -19 Specific Protocol Deviations In order to summarise the impact of COVID -19 in a sy stematic way and in line with regulatory authorities’ recommendations, any study -level impact around COVID -19 will be documente d as a protocol deviation. This will include the permissible actions summarized in this Appendix, which are taken to protect patient safet y,including DTP supply of IP and remote study visits as well as missed visits and assessments as a result of logistic al challenges resulting from COVID- 19. Although the conduct of remote visits and the continuity of antiretroviral therap y, via DTP supply of IP , are being utilized to protect patient safet y, these events fall outside of the intent of the original protocol design, may have an impact on data interpretation, and thus will be characterized as protocol deviations for the purposes of data summary and analysis. Any protocol deviations resulting from COVID -19 should be clearl y identified as such within the protocol deviation description and summarised separatel y."
161,page_161,"2017N331008_06 CONFIDENTIA L 208090 161All deviations need to be documented in the participant’s source records and placed in a dedicated COVID -19 folder. The site should continue to manage and submit protocol deviations per local requiremen ts. 11.14.5.2. Capturing COVID -19 Specific A Es and SA Es It is important for the study team to describe COVID -19 related adverse events/serious adverse and their impact on study data and outcomes. Standardization of case definitions will facilitate future data anal ysis. Please use the following guidance: 1. AEs should continue to be evaluated as to whether they meet SAE criteria as defined in the protocol, and if so, submitted according to established SAE reporting requirements. SAEs and AEs should be submitted follow ing usual study procedures and timelines. 2. When an in-person clinic visit is not possible, please conduct a remote telehealth visit to assess for, and document an y AEs/SAEs. 3. Investigators should use the WHO definition to classify COVID -19 cases . The definition below, released March 20, 2020, represents a time point for standardized collection. We recognize definitions are likel y to continue to evolve. When reporting both serious and non- serious adverse events (related to COVID - 19 infection ), investigator s should use the following Verbatim terms: a)Suspected COVID -19 infection; or b)Probable COVID -19 infection; or c)Confirmed COVID -19 infection 4. Sites should contact the study Medical Monitor for questions related to definitions and reporting, and decisions a round impact to study drug continuation. 5. A new COVID -19 infection Case Report Form will be added to the eCRF to collect additional details about the reported COVID -19 AE or SAE data. It is important to collect the correct information from each participan t reporting a COVID -19 AE or SAE . Therefore ,please use the CRF templates to help you collect this information for all C OVID -19 related AEs/SAEs , once available."
