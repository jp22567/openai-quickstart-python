Added new key secondary endpoint: Proportion of subjects achieving central read facial -VASI75 (de fined as at least 75% improvement in central read facial -VASI from baseline) at Week 24. Rationale: As this is an unprecedented indication, there has bee n limited clinical trial experience with the VASI and facial -VASI scoring for de -pigmented vitiliginous lesions. Discrepancies have been identified by an external blinded expert consultant in preparation for the protocol specified interim analy sis. Base d on the digital photographs available, total body VASI scores cannot be evaluated b y a central reader. Due to this limitation and in order to preserve the scientific integrit y of the study , the primary endpoint is changed from the percent change from baseline in total body VASI at W eek24 to percent change from baseline in central read facial -VASI at W eek24. Central read facial-VASI75 score will be added as a key secondary endpoint . In the Section 2 Study Objectives and Endpoints, added new explor atory endpoi nt: proportion of subjects achieving “very much improved” on patient global impression of change in vitiligo (PGI C-V). Rationale: This change is to correct the editorial error and to be consistent with the scaling of PGIC on evaluation of improvem ent ass essed as"

The phosphory lated receptors serve as docking sites for the signal transducer and activator of the transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. The STATs are phosphory lated and subsequently translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific gene promoters to activate transcription of a range of tar get genes .35,36 PF-06651600 is an orall y bioav ailable small molecule that inhibits, by irreversibly blocking the ATP binding site, JAK3 and the tyrosine kinase expres sed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC )kinase family (bruton’s ty rosine kinase [ BTK ], bone marrow -expressed ki nase [BMX ], inducible T -cell kinase [ ITK], TEC, resting l ymphocy te kinase [R LK/TXK ]), with high selectivity over the other three JAK isoforms, JAK1 , JAK2, and TYK2, as well as over the broader kinome. PF-06651600 is currentl y being investigated in patient s with rheumatoid arthritis , alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, and C rohn’ s disease and will be investigated in vitiligo . Considering the pathog enesis of vitiligo and mechanisms of action for PF -06651600, the h ypothesis is to determine if PF -06651600 wi ll have a clinically meaningful effect on treating active non -segmental vitiligo. PF-06700841 is a dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor with a good selectivity profile over the other human kinases including JAK2. TYK2 /JAK1 play critical roles in interferon gamma ( IFN) signaling that regulate the signal transduction pathway s triggered by several cy tokines implicated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo.21 Study Objectives and Endpoints Study Objectives a nd Endpoints during Dose Ranging Period Prim ary Obj ective s: Prim ary Endpoint s: To evaluate the effi cacy of PF -06651600 dose/dosing regimens at Week 24 in adult subjects w ith active non -segmental vitiligo.Percent change from baseline in central read facial -vitiligo area scoring index ( facial -VASI) at Week 24. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06651600 over time in adult subjects with active non -segm ental vitil igo.Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) up to Week 24. Incidence of specific clinica l laboratory abnormalities including but not lim ited to anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, changes in l ipid profile, and liver function tests (LFTs) up to Week 24."

INTRODUCTION 1.1.Mechanism of Ac tion/ Indication PF-06651600 is an orall y bioavailable small molecule that inhibi ts, by irreversibly blocking theATP binding site, JAK3 and the TEC kinase family (BTK, BMX, ITK, TEC, RL K/TXK), with high selectivit y over the other three JAK isoforms, JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, as well as over the broader kinome. PF-06651600 is currently being investigated in patients wit h rheumatoid arthritis, alo pecia areata, ulcerativ e colitis , and C rohn’s disease and will be investigated in vitiligo . PF-06700841 is a dual in hibitor of human ty rosine- protein kinase 2 (TYK2) and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) that is currentl y being investigated in patients with psoriasis , alopecia areata, ulce rative colitis , and C rohn’s disease and will be investigated in vitiligo . 1.2.Background and Ratio nale The JAK family , including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, is a group of cy toplas mic tyrosine kinases that mediat e signal transduction via i nteractions with Ty pe 1 and Ty pe2 cytokine receptors which are critical for leukocy te activation, proliferation, sur vival and function .35,36 Upon binding of the cy tokine to its receptor, the associated JAKs are activated, and phosphory late each other and the receptor. The phospho rylated receptors serve as docking sites for the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. TheSTATs are phosphorylated and subsequently translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific gene promoters t o activate transcription of a range of target genes.35,36 PF-06651600 po tently inhibits signaling of the common -chain receptors for IL-2, IL-15, and IL-17, which ha ve been implicated in the pathogenic pathway s of vitiligo.2,13 Consider ing the pathogenesis of vitiligo and mec hanisms of action for PF -06651600, the hypothesis is t o determine if PF -06651600 will have a clinicall y meaningful effect on treating active non -segmental vitiligo. PF-06700841 is a dual TYK 2/JAK1 inhibitor with a go od selectivity profile over the other human kinases including JAK2. TYK2 /JAK1 play critical r oles in IFNsignaling that regulate the signal transduction pathway s triggered by several cy tokines implicated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo.21 1.2.1. Study Background Vitiligo is an acquired h ypopig mented disorder with or wi thout autoimmune comorbidities including thyroid disease, alopecia areata, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, t ype1 diabetes mellitus and pernicio us anemia .29 The worldwide prevalence of vitilig o ranges between 0.5% and 2.0% .19Lesions are depigmented completel yat the initiation phase and pigmented orifices of hair follicles are seen at the recovering phase. Differentia ldiagnoses include Vogt -Koyanagi-Harada disease, halo nevus/nevi, malignancy -induced hypopigmentation (melanoma and my cosis fungoides), postinflammatory hypopigmentation, pityriasis alba (a m inor manifestation of atopic dermatitis), senile leukoderma (age -related"

Stressed melanocy tes may initiate the activated innate immunity via natural killer cells and nearb y dendritic cells, followe d by the ac tivation of adaptive immunity .26The presence of CD8+ T cells in close apposition to melanocytes suggests that the pathogenesis of vitiligo is T cell mediated although antibody -mediated pathogenesis is also proposed .33Recent review proposes the h ypothesis that CD8+ T cells produce IFN , which activate the releas e of CXCL9/10/11 from keratinocy tes, which in turn activate the function of CD8+ T cells via t he activati on of CXCR3 .26Cytokines involved in vitiligo include IFN , IL-2, IL -17, IL -15 and IL -4. Of note, IL -2 and IL -15 are suggested to activate CD49a+/CD8+ resident memory T cells in vitiligo skin and to induce per forin and granz yme B in those T cells, which induce melanocy te apoptosis .2 There are currently no approve d treatments specifically to treat active non-segmental vitiligo. Current treatment options , which are limited and may be inefficacious, include topical corticosteroid s, topical vitamin D3, topical calcineurin inhibitor s, systemic corticosteroid s(to treat rapidl y progressive active lesions), phototherapy, surgical treatments (to treat small and stable lesio ns) and camouflage .6,26,29Recent case reports have suggested potential utility of JAK inhibitors in treating vitiligo. Tofacitinib a JAK inhibitor, appears to have a repigmentation effect on vitiligo, noting that concomitant phototherapy may be necessary .3,8,18,20 Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, also seems to have a similar effect.10,17,28 Considering the pathogenesis of vitiligo and mechanisms of action for PF -06651600 and PF-06700841 , the h ypothesis is to d etermine if PF-06651600 and PF- 06700841 will have a clinical lymeaningful effect on treating a ctive non-s egmental vitiligo. 1.2.2. Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism 1.2.2.1. Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of PF-06651600 Following intravenous and oral administration of PF- 06651600 to rats and dogs, absorption was rapid with high bioavailab ility in bo th species (approximately 85-100%). The high oral bioavailability indicated high absorption from the gut, consistent with its high in -vitro passive pe rmeability properties. Plasma clearance (CL) was approximately 69 and 13mL/min/kg in rat and dog respec tively. Half -life was approximately 0.33 and 1.1 hour in rat and dog respectivel y.

Renal excretion of parent PF -06651600 was limited in the rat and dog. Biliary excretion of parent PF -06651600 was limited in the rat. PF-06651600 binding to pla sma proteins was approximately 10 to 30% across speci es (fraction unbound values for rat, dog, and human were 0.67, 0.82 and 0.86 respectivel y). Invitro and in vivo metabolite profiling suggested that the primary clearance mechanisms for PF-06651600 were cytochrome P450 mediated oxidation and glutathione r elated conjugation. No unique human metabolites were observed in vitro compared to metabolite pro files in rat and dog. Reaction phenoty ping in recombinant enzy me sy stems identified CYP3A4 as the predom inant CYP450 isoform responsible for the metabolism of PF -06651600, with minor contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP3A5. I n addition, glutathione -S-transferase (GST) conjugate was formed in a time dependent manner in recombinant GST mu 1 -1 and pi 1-1 incubat ions. PF-06651600 showed a low risk of inhibition and induction of the major CYP450 enzy mes as well as the major uridine 5’ -diphospho- glucuronosy ltransferase enz ymes. However, in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, PF -06651600 sh owed evidence of time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. This CYP3A4 inhibition indicated a potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions for which CYP 3A constitutes the primary mechanism of clearance. Further details of the non -clinical pharma cokinetics and metabolism of PF-0 6651600 are provided in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 1.2.2.2. Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of PF-06700841 Thepharmacokinetic ( PK)of PF -06700841 have been studied in rat where the compound has shown a plasma clear ance of 31 mL/min/kg, a volume of distribution of 2.0 L/kg, and oral bioavailability of approximately 80-100%. The high oral bioavailability indicated high absorption from the gut, consistent with its high in -vitro passive permeability properti es. Rat invivo clearance was pr edicted within approximately 2-fold b y both in vitro rat liver microsomes and hepatocyte intrinsic clearance highlighting the importance of CYP450 metabolism. Sy stemic exposures of PF -06700841 as measured b y C maxand AUC 24in repeat oral pivotal toxicology studies increased with increasing dose in rats (up to 55 mg/kg/day ) and monkey s (up to 45 mg/kg/day ). Renal and biliary elimin ation of parent PF -06700841 was limited in rat. Plasma protein binding of PF -06700841 was con sistent acr oss rat, monkey , and h uman with a fraction unbound (fu) of approximately 0.6-0.7. Values of fu were lower in mouse (fu=0.51) and rabbit (fu = 0.36). Oxidative metabolites of PF -06700841 accounted for the primary routes of biotransformation inrat, monke y, and human consisten t with CYP450 as the primary clearance route. No unique human metabolites of PF -06700841 were evident compared to the safet y spe cies of rat and monkey ."

Most TEAEs reported in the SOCs of GI disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and nervous s ystem disorders (5 subjects in each SOC) were treatm ent-related. There were generall y few TE AEs in the SAD period, most of which occurred in a single subject, with the exception of headache and nasophary ngitis (experienced by 5subjects each) and orophary ngeal pain (experienced by 4subjects). Most of the TEAEs were mild in severit y except for t he following AEs that were moderate in severit y: 1AE each in the PF-06651600 5 mg (orophary ngeal pain), 20 mg (musculoskeletal pain) , and 200 mg (subcutaneous abscess) treatment groups; 2 AEs in the placebo group (dry skin and limb injury ); 3AEs in the P F-06651600 400 mg treatment group (nasophary ngitis, pilonidal cyst, and headache), and 5 AEs in the PF -06651600 100 mg treatment grou p (abdominal pain, arthralgia, rash maculopapular, and 2 AEs of headache). MAD Peri od: during the MAD period, 35 subjects had a total of 90 TEAEs, 75 of which were considered to be treatment -related.

The geometric mean value for the accumulation ratio ( Rac) ranged from 1.0 to 1.8 for the QD dosing and was 1.7 for the 100 mg BID dosing. This ratio compare s AUC taufor multiple dose administration to AUC taufor single dose administratio n, and assesses the ma gnitude of accumulation with multiple dose administration. Similar R acratios were observed for C max (RacCmax), which ranged from 0.9 to 1.4 for QD dosing and was 1.0 for 100 mg BID dosing. The stead y state accumulation ratio (R ss) compares AUC taufor multiple dose administration to AUC inffor single dose administration, and assesses the linearit y in PK exposure from a single dose to stead y state. Geome tric mean R ssvalues were consistentl y ≥1, ranging from 1.0 to 1.8, suggesting th at there may be a grea ter than dose proportional increase in PF-06651600 exposure with multiple dose administration. However, based on R acand RacCmax, the increase in exposure after 14 days of multiple dosing is less than 2-fold for an y of the dosing reg imens studied. Steady state generally appears to have been reached by Day 4 for the QD regimens and Day 6 for the BID regimens based on similar median trough (predose) concentrations on Day s6, 8, 10, 12 and 14. Urinary recovery of PF -06651600 was low, wi th approximately <8% o f the dose recovered unchanged in urine on Day 14 across all doses (geometric mean amount of drug excreted from time zero to time tau, the dosing interval [Ae tau]% of 4.1% to 7.0%). Renal cle arance ranged from 42.9 mL/min to 63.1 mL/min. The relative bioa vailability (B7981003) of 50 mg PF-06651600 tablets was compared to 50mg oral suspension. The ratio (90% confidence interval [ CI]) of adjusted geometric mean was 93.4% (87.8, 100) for AUC infand 90.4% (72.2, 113) for C maxunder fasted conditions. When t he 50 mg tablets were administered under fed conditions, T maxwas slightly delay ed with a median value of 1.0 hours, compared to a median T max0.5hours under fasted conditions. For the 50 mgtablets fed vs. fasted, the ra tio of adjusted geometric means f or AUC infand C maxwas 102% (95.2, 109) and 61.5% (48.5, 77.8), respectively. On Day 1 following the first morning oral dose of PF -06651600 200 mg under fasted conditions to healthy Japanese, PF-06651600 absorption was rapid with a median T maxof 0.525 hours and a range of 0.500-1.00 hours. Overall, exposures as measured b y AUC tau based on geometric mean were 3779 ng•hr/mL and for C maxof 1803 ng/mL on Day 1 after a single dose. Mean t ½was 1.69hours an d it was calculated based on a 24 –hour sampling. Trough (predose) concentrations on Day s 4, 6,8 and 10 for all subjects were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) (<1.00 ng/mL).

The geometric me an values for AUC tauand C max were 4983 ng•hr/mL and 1790 ng/mL, respectively . Median T max was similar to Day 1 with a value of 0.500 hours with no range for Day 10. Following the attainment of C max, concentrations appeared to decline in monophasic fashi on. A short mean t ½was observed with an estimate of 1.8 hours. Based on AUC taucalculation, mean apparent total body clearance of the drug from plasma (CL/F)was 40.1 L/hr and mean apparent volume of distribution during terminal phase after non-intravenous administration ( Vz/F)was 103 L."

In the completed first -in-human study (B7931001), 41 healthy volunteers were exposed to single doses and 26 of the 4 1subjects received multiple daily doses of PF -06700841 over 10 days; a small cohort of plaque PsO patients (n=21) were treated once dail y with PF -06700841 for 28daysat 30 mg and 100 mg dose s. An additional health y volunteer cohort was included to suppo rt the evaluation of the relative BA of a tablet formulation of PF- 06700841, and assessment of a high fat meal on tablet BA. Twelve healthy subjects participated in t his BA assessment, and re ceived single doses of open label PF -06700841 in a 3 -way cross over design (PF -0670841 tablet fasted, PF-06700841 solution/suspension fasted, and PF- 06700841 tablet under fed conditions). PF-06700841 was generall y safe and well tole rated in the Phase 1 clin ical study B7931001. The most commonly reported all causality TEAEs across active subjects in both SAD and MAD cohorts were increased blood creatinine, and decreased neutrophil count. In the SAD period, 1 subject in the PF -0670084 1 100 mg group had serum creatinine (Scr) values meeting the crite ria for high levels (>1.3 X ULN).

When the 100 mg tablets were administered under fed conditions, T maxwas delayed with a median value of 4.0 hours, compared to 0.5 hours under fasted conditions. For 100 mg tablets fed versus fasted, the ratio (90% CI) of adjusted geometric means for AUC infand C maxwas 82.33% (73.45%, 92.29%) and 64.25% (55.98%, 73.75%), respectivel y. Following single oral dose of PF-06700841 100 mg under fasted conditions in Japanese subjects , absorption wa s rapid with a median T maxof 1hour and a range of 0.5-2 hours on Day 1. Geometric mean AUC infwas 8725 ng•hr/mL and C maxwas1035 ng/mL. Mean terminal t ½was 5.7 hours based on a 24 -hour sampling . On Day 10 following multiple oral dosing, median T maxwas 0.76 hours with a range of 0.5-4.0hours. Both AUC tauand C maxincreased slightly compared to Day 1, with geometric mean values of 9888 ng•hr/mL and 1114 ng/mL, respectivel y. Mean terminal t ½was 8.9hours. Steady -state generall y appear edto have bee n achieved by Day 6. Urinary recovery of PF -06700841 was low, w ith less than 16% of the dose recovered unchanged."

Summary of Benefits and Risks There are currently no approved treat ments specifically to treat active non -segmental vitiligo. Recent case reports have suggested potential utility of JAK in hibitors in treating vitiligo a s detailed in Section 1.2.1 . Both PF -06651600 and PF -06700841 inhibit signal transduction pathway s triggered by several cy tokines implicated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Considering the me chanisms of action for PF -06651600 and PF -06700841 and the vitiligo pathogenesis, both I Ps are expected to have a cl inically meaningful effect for the treatment of active non -segmental vitiligo. The dose rationales for PF -06651600 and PF -06700841 are deta iled in Section s 1.2.4.1 and 1.2.4.2 , respectivel y. PF-06651600 and PF- 06700841 are generally safe and well tolerated as supported by the totality of safety data to da te. Over all, the safety profile observed during the P hase 1 program for PF- 06651600 appears to be acce ptable at dosages up to 200 mg administered orally QD. The safet y profile observed during the Phase 1 program for PF- 06700841 appears to be acceptable a t dosages up to 175 mg administered orally QD. In the ongoing Phase 2a proof -of-concept Study B7931005 in adult patients with alopecia areata (AA), preliminary data showed that both PF -06651600 and PF-0 6700841 met its primary endpoint of improvement in severity of alopecia tool ( SALT ) 30score relative to placebo at Week 24. PF -06651600 and PF-0 6700841 ap peared generall y safe and well tolerated as suggested b y adverse event (AE) number and profile. Both PF -06651600 and PF-06700841 had a favorable benefit: risk profile and provided meaningful clinical benefit in AA, another dermatological disease with simi lar underly ing pathogenesis and psy chological burden as vitiligo.47,48 In the Stud y B7981019, events requiring review, including opportunistic infections, cardiovascul ar, and malignancy events will be externall y evaluated using the same adjudication committee as in the ongoing Phase 2b AA Study B7981015 as detailed in Section 9.9 . Based on the current clinica l and nonclinical experience with PF-06651600, PF -06700841, and other information from other JAK inhibitors (eg, Xeljanz®(tofacitinib), Jakafi® (ruxolit inib), baricitinib, GL PG0634, and VX -509), the potential risks for PF -06651600 and PF-06700841 include: (1) viral reactivation; (2) serious infection and opportunistic infections; (3) malignancy and l ymphoproliferative disorders; (4) decreased ly mphocy te counts; (5) change in neutrophil counts; (6) decreased platelet count; (7) alterations in the lipid prof ile; (8) de rmatologic effects (rash/acne); (9) interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ;(10) fertility , pregnancy , and l actation."

In addition, the investiga tor or designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if 1 or both of the selected contraception methods is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the subject or partner. Highly Effective Meth ods: 1.Oral, injectable, or implantable p rogestogen-onl y hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulat ion. 2.Intrauterine device (IUD). 3.Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS). 4.Bilateral tubal occlusion or bilateral tubal ligation . 5.Vasectomiz ed partner. Vasectomized partner is a hi ghly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highl y effective method of contraception shoul d be used. The spermatogenesis cy cle is approximately 90days. 6.Combined (estrogen- and progestogen -containing) ho rmonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with inhibition of ovulation used in combination with a barrier method."

Male condom and female condoms should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction) . 7.Sexual abs tinence: Sexual abstinence is considered a highl y effective method only if defined as refraining from heteros exual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evalua ted in relation to the duration of the s tudy and the preferred and usual lifesty le of the participant. Additi onall y, contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations or guidance regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those participatin g in clinical trials. 4.5.Sponsor ’sQualifi ed Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's approp riately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the study portal. To facilitate access to app ropriatel y qualified medical personnel o n study -related medical questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, subject study numbers, contact inf ormation for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigat or site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the subject’s participation in the stud y. The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathway s betw een the investigator site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study .The contact number is not intended for use by the subject directly , and if a subject calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site. 5.STUDY TREATMENTS For the purposes of this study , and per Interna tional Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) guidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical f orm o f an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing aut horization when used or assembled (formu lated or packaged) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (I CH E6 1.33)."
89,page_89,"PF-06651600 and PF -06700841 B7981019 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 26June 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENT IAL Page 90For this study , the investigatio nal product(s) are PF -06651600 and PF -06700841 (PF-06700841 for Extension Period only ). Phototherap y will be used for subjects who will be allocated to nbUVB add -on therap y during Extension Period. 5.1.Allocation to Treatment Allocation of subjects to treatme nt groups will occur through the use of an interactive response technology (IRT) sy stem (interactive W eb-based res ponse [I WR]). The site personnel (stud y coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID ) and password, the protocol number, and the subject number. The site per sonnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when investigati onal product is being supplied via the I RT s ystem. The IRT sy stem will provide a confirmation report containing t he subject number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. The study -specific I RT reference manual wi ll provide the contact information and further details on the use of the I RT sy stem. 5.2.Breaking the Blind The study will be double blind (sponsor, subject and investigator blinded) during the Dose Ranging Period. During the Extension Period, the group 1 (PF-06700841 arm) and group 2 (PF-06651600 with nbUVB arm) will be open label while the other 3 arms (group 3, 4 and 5) will be double blind .Group 6 is for observation only . No IP will be administered. At the initi ation of the study, the investigator sit e will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The method wil l be an electronic process. Blinding codes should be broken onl y in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatm ent code is absolutely essential for further managem ent of the subject. Investigators are encouraged to discuss with a member of the study team if they believe that unblinding is necessary . However, discussion with a member of the study team in advance o f unblinding is not required. When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully documented and entered on the case r eport form (CRF). Details of unblinding plan for possible interim analy sis will be specified in interim analy sis plan. 5.3.Subject Com pliance For self-administration of PF -06651600 or PF- 06700841 at home, subject compliance will be verified b y the accounting o f investigational product at each visit. When investigational product is administered at the study site, it will be administered under the supervision of study personnel."

Compliance will be documented on the source document . If compliance is <80% or >120% , the investigator or designee is to counsel the subject and ensure steps are take n to improve compliance. Subjects interrupting investigational product for more than 4 consecutive day s or for a total of more th an 7 days between visits are to be discussed with th e sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study . 5.4. Investigational Product Supplies 5.4.1. Dosage Form(s) and Packaging Blinded PF -06651600 tablets and matching placebos will be provided as tablets for oral administration. PF-06700841 will be provided as tablets for oral administration . The designation “PF- 06651600 -15” and “PF -06700841 -15” may appear on labeling and indicates a salt. The PF -06651600 10mg and 50mg tablets and their matching placebos will be supplied in bl isters and labeled according to local re gulatory requirements. The PF-06700841 5 mg and 25 mg tablets will be sup plied in bottles and labeled according to local regulatory requirements. Subjects will receive blinded labeled supplies for PF-06651600 throu ghout the study including the Extension Period. PF -06700841 supplies will be open label . 5.4.2. Preparation and Dispensi ng The investigational product (I P) will be dispensed using an IRT drug management sy stem at each visit according to Schedule of Activities. A qualified staf f member will dispense the investigational product via unique container nu mbers on the bottles or blister labels provided, in quantities appropriate for the stud y visit schedule. The subject/caregive r should be instructed to maintain the product in bottle s or blisters provided throughout the course of dosing and return the bott les or blisters to the site at the next study visit. 5.5.Administration Subjects will receive IP as outpatients. PF- 06651600 tablets and matchin g placebo for oral administration will b e dispensed in blisters. PF-06700841 tablets for oral administration will be dispensed in bottles . Subjects will be provided clear dosing instructions. Sites will be trained on how subj ects should take tablets at home through an I P manual and/or other vehicle(s). Sites are responsible for communicating this information and s ite staff should review the dosing instructions with subjects at every study visit. Subjects should take t he medication orall yonce daily ; Subjects should swallow the tablets with am bient temperature water to a total volume of approximately 240 mL(2.4DL or 1cup); Subjects will swallow the investigational product whole, and will not manipulate or chew the medication prior to swallowing ; Subjec ts will be encouraged to take the medication after breakfast whenever possible even though IP may be taken with or without food; however, forstudy visit days , subjects are to be instructed to refrain from dosing at home, and ar e to take the dose in the cl inic(from the containers being returned to the site [ie,dispensed at the previous stud y visit]) ."
91,page_91,"PF-06651600 and PF -06700841 B7981019 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 26June 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENT IAL Page 92If a dose is mi ssed and the interval to the next dose is less than 8 hours, the missed dose should not be administered. Study treatment may be temporaril y withheld (or adjusted) for a maximum of 4 consecutive days at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects interrup ting investigational product for more than 4 consecutive day s or 7days between visits are to be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study . 5.6.Investigational Pr oduct Storage The investigator or an approved representative, eg, pharmac ist, will ensure that all investigational products are stored in a secured area with contro lled access under required storage conditions and i n accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Investigational products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with the labels. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded b y the storage conditions stated on the product label. Site sy stems must b e capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room -tempera ture products). This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study . Even for continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluati on for excursions should be available. The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximu m temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion oc curred since the last evaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or vi ew the minimum/maximum temperature for all non- work ing day s upon return to normal operation s. The operation of the temperature -monitoring device and storage unit (f or example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularl y inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order. Any excursions from t he product label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery . The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as s oon as possible. Deviations from the storage requi rements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to Pfizer. Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permiss ion to use the investigational product. It will no t be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to Pfizer approval will be consider ed a protocol deviation. Specific details regardin g information the site should report foreach excursion will be provided to the site. Receipt of materials, door o pening and closing, and other routine handling operations where the products are briefl y out of the temperature range described in the labelin g are not considered excursions."

Investigational Product Accountability The investigator site must maintain adequate records documenting the recei pt, use, loss, or other disposition of t he investigational product supplies. All investigational products will be accounted for using a drug accountabilit y form/record. All IPsmust be returned to the investigator by the subject at every applicable visit and at the end of the trial. 5.7.1. Destructi on of Investigational Product Supplies The sponsor or designee will provi de guidance on the destruction of unused investigational product (eg, at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investi gator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any special instructi ons provided by Pfizer, and all destruction must be adequatel y documented. Forall blisters/bottles returned to the in vestigator by the subject, the investigator will maintain the returned sup ply until destruction is authorized. Pfizer will provide instru ctions as to the disposition of any unused investigational product. 5.8.Concomitan t Treatment(s) Medications that are taken in the Screening period (after informed consent is obtained and before t he first dose of IP) will be documented as prior medications. M edications taken after the first dose of IPhas been administered will be documented as concomitant medications. All concomitant medications taken during the study must be recorded in study r ecords with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of administration. Subjects will be queried about concomitant medication (including topical medications and treatments, over-the-counter and prescription medications and treatments, and vaccinat ions) at each study visit. Any new concomitant medications or d ose changes to current concomitant medications should be evaluated for potenti al new or worsening adverse events. The start date, stop date, and indication for all therapies will be recorded o n the CRF. 5.8.1. Narrow Band Ultraviolet B Light ( nbUVB) The use of na rrow band ultraviolet b light (nbUVB) phototherapy may be an important compone nt in the Extension Period to enhance me lanocy te growth and differentiation. In the Extension Period, subjects wh o have signed a consent form for the nbUVB will have a chance to receive an induction dose of 200 mg QD plus standardized nbUVB add- on therapy for 4 weeks followed b y maintenance dos ing of 50 mgQD plus standardized nbUVB add -on therap y for 20 weeks. This arm will be an unblinded arm since the other 4 arms in the Extension Period will not use nbUVB. Sunexposure is prohibited during nbUVB phototherap y."

Subjects who have <10% improvement in percent chang e in VASI at Extension Week 12 from baseline at We ek 24 Dose Ranging Period will be discontinued from the treatment and enter Follow -up Period. 5.8.2. Permitted Concomitant Medications Acet aminophen may be used intermittently (not to exceed 1 g/day ). For the pur poses of this protocol, dietary supplements are defined as vitamins, minerals, and purified food substances with pharmaceutical properties. Vitamins, minerals and purified food substances are allowed in amounts not known to be associated with adverse effe cts (such as hy pervitaminosis). A subject who is receiving metformin as concomitant medication must allow at least two hours to elapse after taking the medication and before taki ng investigational product . A subject who is receiving a permitted concomitant medication for an y reason must be on a locally -approved medication and dose for the treated indication, and this must be documented in the C RF. Subjects are not allowed any other investigational drugs or treatments during the study . Subjects should refr ain from starting new or changing doses of permitted prescription or non-prescription drugs, vitamins, and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1 and throughout the study , unless otherw ise noted below. Subje cts will be provided a sunscreen at the Baseline V isit. Subjects will use the sunscreen Day 1 through to the End of Study Visit as needed. If a subject has a history of intolerabil ity or currently does not tolerate the sunscreen or if the product is unav ailable, the investigator should contact the Pfizer clinician or designee for approval to use an alternative topical sunscreen ; The approved alternative sunscreen should be documente d in study records. Subjects should report any changes to permitted medica tions during the study to the investigator as soon as they occur. Medication changes must be documented in the subject’s record and CRF. Unless a prohibited medication or treatment , subjects may be administered any other medications necessary for the tre atment of concomitant medical disorders as deemed necessary by the treating phy sician. Following Day 1, addition of concomitant medications or an y change in the dosage should be limited to those considered medicall y essential. 5.8.3. Prohibited Medications and Treatments Subjects will abstain from all concomitant medic ations as described in the Inclusion and Exclusion sections of the protocol and Appendix 2Prohibited Concomitant Medications."

A subject who is receiving simvastatin as concom itant medication should be switched at least 7 days prior to baseline to an alternative statin drug . Treatment with simvastatin -containing products should not be initiated during pa rticipation in this study . All medications and treatments that could affe ct vitiligo must be discontinued. S ubjects must also avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and avoid the use of tanning booths, sun lamps or other ultraviolet light sources other than provided/requested b y the study team during the stud y. Herbals supplements are only allow ed on a case -by-case basis; please contact the Pfizer staff. Herbal medications with unknown properties or known beneficial effects for vitiligo or that are known t o have an effect on drug metabolism (eg,St. John’s Wort )must be disconti nued at least 1 week or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of investigational product. Restrictions on certain vaccin ations are described in Section 5.8.4 . 5.8.4. Vaccinations Vaccination with live virus, attenuated live virus, or an y live viral components is prohibited within the 6 weeks prior to the first dose of IP, during the study , and for 6weeks aft er the last dose of investigational product . Similarly , current routine h ousehold contact with individuals who have been vaccinated with live vaccine components should be avoided during treatment and for 6weeks f ollowing completion of treatment. Such va ccines include but are not limited to : FluMist®(intranasal influenza vacc ine), attenuated rotavirus vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, attenuated typhoid fever vaccine, oral polio vaccine, MMR (measles, mump s, rubella) vaccine and vaccinia (smallpox ) vaccine. Following vaccination with live component vaccines, the virus may be shed in bodily fluids, including stool, and there is a potential risk that the virus may be transmitted. 5.8.5. Rescue Medication Since c urrently there are no approved treatmen ts in vitiligo (other than phototherap y), no rescue therap y willbe mandated by the sponsor . Subjects requiring rescue medication during the Dose Ranging Period or Extension Period will be discontinued from IP (PF -06651 600 or PF-06700841 or placebo) and will enter the Follow -up Period. Subjects requiring rescue medication during the Follow -up Period should also complete the Follow -up Period. 6.

End of Study Visit will occur 4 week s after the FU Visit 1or Early Termin ation (ET) Visit . For earl y termina ted subjects, End of Study (EOS) Visit will occur 4 weeks (with a visit window of +7days based on the ET Visit) after the Earl y Termination (ET) Visit and no FU1 Visit will be perfo rmed. The procedures scheduled for ET Visit will be performed on the last day the subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possible thereafter. For follow -up and end of study procedures, see Schedule of Activities Table6and Section 7 . 6.5.Subject Withdrawal/Early Termination Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be withdr awn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also the Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol -required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site. Subjects who are request edtodiscontinue study treatment from the Dose Ranging Period or Extension Period (except for Group 6) will enter into the Follow -up Period with their End of Study V isit occurring 4 weeks after the ET Visit . The procedures scheduled for ET Visit will be performed on the last day the subject takes the investi gational product or as soon as possible thereafter. Subjects in G roup 6 who requested to discontinue study from the Extension Perio d will have the End of Study Visit occurring 4 weeks after the last visit. No follow up visit will be performed."

The ET Visit only applies to subjects who are randomized , received at least one dose of IP,and then are p rematurely withdrawn from the stud y treatment. If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact th e subject. All attempts to contact the su bject and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the subject’s medical record. In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigat or should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational produc t(s), request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding an y unresolved adverse even ts (AEs). Withdrawal of consent : Subjects who reques t to discontinue receipt of study treatment from the Treatment P eriod or Extension Period will enter the Follow -up Period with their EOS visit occurring 4 weeks after the ET Visit and to be followed for p rotocol specified follow- up procedures. The procedu res scheduled for ET Visit will be performed on the last day thesubject takes the investigational product or as soon as possible thereafter. The onl y exception to this is when a subject specifically withdraws consent for an y further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the subject to provide this information. Subjects should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow -up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records b y the investigator, as to whe ther the withdrawal is only from further receipt of investigational product or also from study procedures and/or post treatment study follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF pa ge. In the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriatel y directed in accordance with local law. If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future informatio n, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of co nsent. Lost to follow -up: All reasonable efforts must be made to locate s ubjects to determine and report their ongoing status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost tofollow -up is defined by the inabilit y to reach the subject after a minimum of 2documented phone calls, faxes, or e-mails as well as lack of response b y the subject to 1 registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the su bject has died, the site will use locally permissible methods to obtain the date and cause of death. I f the investigator’s use of a third -party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the study has be en include d in the subject’s informed cons ent, then the investigator may use a sponsor- retained third -party represen tative to assist site staff with obtaining the subject’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary to"

The site sta ff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. I f, after all attempts, the subject remains lost to fo llow-up, t hen the last -known- alive date as determined b y the investigator should be reported and documented in the s ubject’s medical records. Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced at the discretion of the investigator upon consultation with the sponso r. 7.ASSESSMENTS Every effort sho uld be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside of the control of the investig ator that may make it unfeasible to perfor m the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safet y and well -being of the subject. When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and pre ventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. For samples being collected and shipped, de tailed collection, processing, s torage, and shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study . 7.1.Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy tests are required to be done (if applicable) as spe cified in the Sched ule of Activities. All pregnancy tests used in this study , either urine or serum, must have a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL and must be performed by a certified laboratory . For female subjects of childbearin g potential, 2 negative pregnancy tests ar e required before receiving study treatment(s) (1 negative pregnancy test at screening and 1 at the baseline visit immediately before stud y treatment administration). Following a negative pregnancy test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and the second negative pregnancy test result will then be re quired at the baseline visit before the subject may receive the study treatment. In the absence of regular menstrual bleeding, t he study candidate should have used 1form of contrac eption for at least 1 month before the second pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests will also be repeated at every applicable visit and at the end of the study to confirm that the subject has not become pregn ant during the study . Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cy cle is missed during the active treatment period and when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected, and may be repeated if requested by institutional review boards (IRBs)/eth ics committ ees (ECs) or if required b y local regulati ons. I n the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy , the subject will be w ithdrawn from administration of investigational product but may remain in the study for follow up."

Measurements should be taken on the same arm at each visit (preferabl y non -dominant). Subjects should refrain from smoking or ingest ing caffeine during the 30 minutes precedi ng the measurements. Measurements should begin after at least 5 minutes of rest. Pulse should be measured at approximately the same time as BP for a minimum of 30seconds. When the timing of BP and pulse (heart) rate measurements coincides with a blood collection or other study procedure, BP and pulse (heart) rate should be o btained first. 7.3.2. Medical History, Physical Exam, Height, and Weight Complete vitiligo disease history includes collection of details of vitiligo at Screening: background, vitiligo history, vitiligo diagnosis, the use of topical treatments, sy stemic treatments and other treatments for vitiligo (up to 2 y ears, if possible) . Medical history , in additi on to vitiligo history , including history of dr ug(up to 2 years, if possible) , alcohol, tobacco use , auditory , skin rash, skin infection, and any dermal abnormal ities that may predispose to infection will be collected at Screening and Baseline (if applicable). Smoking status and average weekly alcoho l consumption (units/week) will also be co llected. Height and wei ght will be measured without the subject wearing s hoes. Height (inches or centimeters) and weight (lbs or kgs) will be measured and recorded in the source document at the Baseline Visit. Complete phy sical examinations must be perfo rmed by the investigato r, sub -investigator or a qualified health professi onal per local guidelines. Complete phy sical examinations consist of assessments of general appearance; skin; head, eyes, ears, nose and thr oat (HEENT); mouth, heart; lungs; breast ( optional); abdomen; ext ernal genitalia (optional); extremities; neurologi c function, back, and l ymph nodes. In addition, dermatological full body exam must be performed b y the investigator, sub -investigator or a q ualified health professional per local guidelines. Dermatologica l examinations may include visual inspection of the breasts and external genitalia. Targeted ph ysical examinations must be performed by the investigator, sub -investigator or a qualified healt h professional per local guidelines and should include skin, hear t, lung, neurologic function , and abdomen and exam ination of body systems where there are symptom complaints by the subject. Subjects with clinically meaningful changes from baseline in neurologic signs or s ymptoms should be referre d to a neurologist to undergo a formal neurologic evaluation.

Documentation of the official reading must be located and available in the source do cumentation. 7.3.4. Electrocardiogram Single 12- lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the Schedule of Activities . All scheduled ECGs shou ld be performed after the subject has rested quietly for at least 10minutes in a supin e position and prior to any blood collection. The baseline ECG values wil l serve as each subject’s baseline values. To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified medical personnel at the investigator site will ma ke comparisons to baseline measurements. A paper or digital cop y of the ECG should be filed in the subject’s chart and must be available to the sponsor upon request. Any clinically significant changes will be recorded and evaluated further, as clinically warranted. In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as co ntributing to the ECG abnormality . 7.3.5. Tuberculosis Testing Subjects could be screened for TB using either test listed below. 7.3.5.1. Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) Tuberculin Test Subje cts may be screened for TB using an IGRA per local guidelines. Interfero ngamma release assay will be tested during screening or within 12 weeks prior to Day 1. The following are acceptable IGRA assay s: QuantiFER ON®-TB Gold test (QFT- G), QuantiFERON®-TB Gold I n-Tube test (QFT -GIT) and T -SPOT®TB test. Site personnel should f ollow the processing and anal yses steps based on the assa y chosen. Ensure incubation steps are followed as appropriate. An IGRA is preferred for subjects with a prior BCG vaccination, but may be used for any subject. Documentation of IGRA product used an dthe test result must be in the subject’s source documentation. If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may be repeated, and ifa negative result is obtained, enrollment may proceed. A positive test on repeat is exclusionary . Subjects wit h repeat indeterminate IGRA results may be enrolled after consultation with pulmonary or infectious disease specialist that determines low ri skof infection (ie, subject would be acceptable for immunosuppressant (eg, anti- TNF) treatment without additional action)."

Subjects reporting potential drug -related rash should assess itch on a 10- point numeric rating scale (NRS) provi ded by Pfizer where 0 is no itch ingand 10 is worst possible itching (Appendix 8). The i nvestigator will enter this assessment into the data collection tool. Investigators will complete a questionnaire (provided by the study team) and take appropriate photographs of the rash. All de -identified biopsy results, culture results, photographs, and any additional releva nttest results will be forwarded to Pfizer (or designee) for review within 30 days of receipt by the investigator . An independent dermatologist contracted b y Pfizer may review all relevant data and summarize the data at the end of the stud y. 7.3.6.2. Creatinine, Cy statin C, and estimates of Glomerular F iltration Rate (eGFR) Serum creatinine is the best known standard test for monitoring renal function. However, serum creatinine based estimates of glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) may be affected b y factors other th an renal function, including chronic and acute illness. Serum c ystatin C is a test that can be used either as an adjunct to or a replacement for serum creatinine. The most reliable estimates of GFR use both test results.12 Serum c ystatin C is a low molecular weight protein that is used as an alternative to serum creatin ine for monitoring of renal function. It seems to correlate more closely with GFR than serum creatinine concentration and may be a more sens itive detector of early renal dysfunction.4,24While use of cy statin C has been l imited, its independence of demographic factors (eg, race) has made it an interestin g means of determining changes in renal function in clinical settings and it is included in the 2012 Kidney Disease :Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO) guidelines. Estimate d GFR may be calculated via the 2012 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaborati on(CKD -EPI) creatinine, cy statin C, or creatinine -Cystatin C equations.14 Serum creatinine will be measured as part of serum chemistry at times specified in the Schedule of Activities section of the protocol. Creatinine elevations above the ULN will be followed until resolution or baseline. Serum c reatinine based eGFR will be calculated. Serum cy statin C will be measured and cy statin C based eGFR will be calculated at times specified in the Schedule of Activities sectionof the protocol."

Audiometry All subje cts will have audiometry assessment at times specified in the Schedule of Activities. Audiometr yassessment taken a t Screening or within 8 weeks prior to Day 1 must have results available prior to Day 1. In addition to audiogram, information including auditory medical history and additional examinations (ie, otoscopic exam) willbe collected. For subjects that termin ate earl y from the stud y, efforts must be made to complete the audiometry testing and obtain the results. When poss ible, the subject should have the audiogram performed at the same evaluation center during the stud y. At subsequent visits, audiograms will beperformed; based upon results, additional audiometry assessments may be required and performed by qualified medi cal personnel based on local guideline or equivalent. If there is a clinicall y-meaningful, treatment-related decline in hearing from baselin e,the subject will be followed up off treatment with appropriate testing at regular intervals, until hearing retur ns to baseline or is determined to be clinically stable. Treatment- relatedness (or causality ) will be assessed by the investigator as descri bed in Section 8.1.5 . The information from the audio gram will be entered into the data collection tool. Any de-identified audiogram results/reports and any additional relevant test results (if applicable) willbe requested to be forwarded to Pfizer (and/or designee) at any time during the study . 7.3.8.

To assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information ma y be requeste d from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of th e event in the context of the clinical study . 8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF All events detailed in the table abo ve will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of S AE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent man ner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF a nd the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information. 8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed AEs and all AEs sp ontaneously reported b y the stud y subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner. 8.1.3. Withdrawal from the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject Withdrawal/Early Termination section) Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. When a subject withdraws from the stu dy because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on theCRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the Requirements section above. 8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting A Es and SAEs ( “active collection period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing an y study -related procedure and/or receiving inve stigational p roduct), through and including a minimum of 28 calenda r day safter the last administration of the investigational product. For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends w hen screen failure status is determined."

Report ing SAEs to P fizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form. SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection pe riod has e nded are reported to Pfizer Safety ifthe investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product must be reported to Pfizer Safety . Follow up by the investigator continues thr oughout and a fter the active collection period and until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. 8.1.4.2. Recording Non -serious AEs and S AEs on the CRF During the active coll ection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF. Follow -up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfi zer concurs with that assessment. 8.1.5. Causality Assess ment The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such an assessment in acco rdance with the SAE reporting require ments, if app licable. An investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; g enerall y the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a ca usal relation ship should be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational pr oduct” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the sponsor. If the inves tigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study records. In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reportin g requirements. 8.1.6. Spons or’s Reporting Requirements to Regula tory Authorit ies AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations."

Adverse Events An AE is an y untoward medical occu rrence in a study subject administere d a product or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: Abnormal test findings; Clinically significant sig ns and sy mptoms; Changes in ph ysical examination f indings; Hypersensitivity ; Progression/worsening of underl ying disease; Drug abuse; Drug dependency . Additionally , AEs may include signs and s ymptoms resulting from: Drug overdose; Drug withdrawal; Drug mis use; Drug interactions; Extravasation; Exposure during pregnancy (EDP); Exposure via breastfeeding; Medication error; Occupational exposure. 8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following conditions are met: Test result is associa ted with acco mpan ying symptoms; and/or"
123,page_123,"PF-06651600 and PF -06700841 B7981019 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 26June 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENT IAL Page 124Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation from th e study , sign ificant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor. Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require recording as an AE. 8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: Results in dea th; Is life -threatening (immediate ri sk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life func tions); Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect . Or that is considered to be: An important medical event. Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in deat h or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important med ical event should be repor ted as serious. Examples of such even ts are intens ive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4. Adverse React ions and Serious Adverse Reactions Anadverse reac tion (AR) is any untoward and unintended responses to an investigational medicinal product (IMP) related to an y dose administered. This implies a reasonable possibility of a causa l relationship between the event and the IMP."
124,page_124,"PF-06651600 and PF -06700841 B7981019 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 26June 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENT IAL Page 125A serious adverse reaction (S AR) is an adverse reaction which meets the criterion of ‘seriousness’ as described in Section 8.2.3 . Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious adverse rea ctions (SARs) that are unexpected per the reference s afety information (RSI ) in the respective IBs for PF -0665 1600 and PF -06700841. 8.2.5. Hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent h ealthcare fac ility, or any prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurologica l floor to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit is assessed for medical importance. Hospitalization doe s not include the following: Rehabili tation facilities; Hospice facilities; Respite care (eg, caregiver relief); Skilled nursing facilities; Nursing homes; Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures). Hospitalization or prolongation o f hospitalization in the absence of a precipitatin g clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for workup of a persistent pretr eatment labor atory abnormality ); Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep); Administrative ad mission (eg, for yearly physical examination); Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by the study protocol); Optiona l admission n ot associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective cosmetic surgery ); Hospita lization for observation without a medical AE;"

These should be noted in the baseline documentation for th e entire prot ocol and/or for the individual subject . Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not be reported as SAEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedu re was performed should be reported i f it meets th e definition of an SAE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the reportin g period should be reported if the SAE requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as t reatment of the AE. 8.3.Severity Assessme nt If require d on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SE VERE to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency , these intensity grades are defined as follows: MILD Does not interfere with subject' s usual function. MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function. SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function. Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above. 8.4.Special Situations 8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adve rse Events There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study . All SAEs wi ll be reported to Pfizer Safety by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y database. 8.4.1.1. Potential Cases of Drug- Indu ced Liver Inj ury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determine d by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some subjects, transaminase elevations a re a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are ""susceptible"" to progressive and serious liver injury , commonly referred to as drug -induced liver injury (DILI). Subjects who experience a tra nsaminase ele vation above 3 times the upper limit of normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransfe rase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by several days or weeks. The increase in TBili ty picall y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili va lues will be elevated within the same lab sample)."
126,page_126,"PF-06651600 and PF -06700841 B7981019 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 26June 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENT IAL Page 127In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been ex cluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s individu al baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as pote ntial DILI (Hy ’s law) cases to defini tively determ ine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: Subject s with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR AL T values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value >2×ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and a n alkaline phosphatase value <2×ULN or not available; For subjects wit h baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, dependin g on which values are above the ULN a t baseline: Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal rang e: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is smaller; Preexisting values of TBili above the normal ran ge: TBili level increased from baseli ne value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 × ULN (whichever is smaller). Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment ; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferabl y within 48 hours from awaren ess of the abnormal results. This evaluation shou ld include laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferas e (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized rat io (INR), total bile acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood an d an anticoag ulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology . A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminoph en (either b y itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over- the-counter medications) ,"

Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and live r imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the labo ratory criteria of AST/AL T and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found. Such potential DI LI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespectiv e of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) c ase becomes a confirmed case onl y after all result s of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology . 8.4.2. Potential Cases of Decreased eGFR In the PF -06700841 FIH study B7931001, serum creatinine elevation was reported across dose levels in both healthy volunteer and psoriasis patients. The proposed mechanism for the observe d serum creatinine increases in study B7931001 is inhibition of creatinine transport in the kidney (ie, transporter -mediated rather than direct nephrotoxicity ). All subjects who are a ssigned to re ceive PF -06700841 in the Extension Period will have serum creatinine based and serum cy statin -C based eGFR calculated at EXD1 Visit upon entry into the study . Abnormal values in serum creatinine concurrent with absence of increase in b lood urea nitrogen (BUN ) that meet the below criteria, in the absence of other causes of kidney injury , are considered important medical events. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine (2009 CKD- EPI eGFR) {Levey , 2009 #25} and serum cy statin C (2012 CKD- EPI eGFR)14will be determined at times specified in the Schedule of Activities. If an individual subject who is assigned to receive PF -06700841 in the Exten sion Period demonstrates a CONCOMITANT s erum creatini ne based AND serum cystatin C based eGFR decline of ≥30% compared to the subject’s baseline eGFR , then the subject should not be further dosed and adequate, immediate, supportive measures and immediate e valuation by nephrologist (preferably wi thin 24 hours) with appropriate management should be taken for ev aluation and treatment as clinically indicated. If the subject cannot be seen b y a nephrologist within 24 hours, then the subject should be sent to a loc al emergency room for assessment of renal function . Results should be repeated as indicated b y the ne phrologist or weekly at a minimum until the eGFR returns to baseline ±15% or the renal parameters are deemed to be stable by the nephrologist and/or PI . eGFR results will be communicated to the treating ph ysician."

This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history , and ph ysical assessment. I n addition to repeating serum creatinine and serum cy statin C, laboratory tests should also include: serum BUN, serum CK, serum electrol ytes (including at a minimum potassium, sodium, phosphate/phosphorus, calcium), in addition to urine dipstick, urine micros copic examination, and urinary indices. All cases confirmed on repeat test ing as meeting the above pre -set laboratory criteria, with no other cause(s) of laboratory abnormalities identified should be co nsidered as important medical event irrespective of a vailabilit y of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal serum creatinine. All relevant t est results will be forwarded to Pfizer for review within 30 days of receipt by the PI . This requirement applies to all s ubjects assigned to receive PF -06700841 in the Extension Period. 8.4.3. Exposure t o the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfee ding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the investigational produ ct under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of in vestigator awareness. 8.4.3.1. Exposure During Pregnancy For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure d uring pregnancy (EDP) occurs if: A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg , because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the in vestigational product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregna nt after discontinuing and/or being expose d to the investigational product . An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregna nt woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products). A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigat ional product prior to or around the time of conception and /or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy . If a subject or subje ct’s partner becomes or is found to be pre gnant during the subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigato r must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT S AE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information"
129,page_129,"PF-06651600 and PF -06700841 B7981019 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 26June 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENT IAL Page 130regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregn ant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safety using the EDP suppl emental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information su bmitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below fo r information related to termination of pr egnancy ). Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it s outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pr egnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Saf ety of the outcome as a follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case o f a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, th e reason(s) for termination should be spec ified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus sh ould be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous aborti on, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenita l anomal y [in a live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine f etal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information abo ut pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safet y asSAEs follows: Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion; Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality , as SAEs . In addit ion, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possib ly related to exposure to the investigatio nal product. Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify deve lopmental delay s). In the case of paterna l exposure, the investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Releas e of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The inves tigator must document in the source documents that the subject was gi ven the Pregnant Partner Release of Inform ation Form to provide to his partner. A special safet y concern (SSC), fetal cleft lip, was reported in the B7931004 (investigating PF-06700841 to treat psoriasis) trial affecting a singleton pregnancy of a subject on multiple concomitant medications including an herbal supplement which carried a pregnancy warning."

Exposure During Breastfee ding Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be rep orted, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, to Pfizer S afety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord wi th authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.4.3.3. Occupation al Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performa nce of job duties, a person (whether a hea lthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. An oc cupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of t he investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. Since the informat ion does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the comple ted CT SAE Report Form is maintained in th e investigator site file. 8.4.4. Medication Errors Other exposures to the investigational pr oduct under study may occur in clinical trial settings, such as medication errors. Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safety Wi thin 24 Hours of Awareness Medication errors All (regardless of whether associated w ith an AE)Only if associated with an SAE 8.4.4.1. Medication Error s Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the investigational product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Medication errors include : Medication errors involving subject exposure to th e investigational product; Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the participating subject. Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page. In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately ."

Interim Analysis durin g the Dose Ranging Period The statistical anal ysis plan and the interim analy sis plan for this protocol may include an interim analy sis using percent change from baseline in VASI score for allactive treatments. Details regarding the analy sis procedures t o be used for the interim anal ysis will be provided in the interim analysis plan (IAP). The interim analy sis may be performed when approximately 50% of subjects have completed or had the chance to complete the Week 24 visit. Theobjective of this interim analy sis is to determine if there is evidence of lack of differentiation ( “futility ”)for the active treatments compared to placebo. Theinterim analysis will bebased on a total of approximately 165 s ubjects who compl ete or had the chance to complete Week 24. 9.8.Data Monitoring Committee This study will use an internal review committee (IRC) . The I RC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safet y of su bjects in the study according to the charter. The I RC will review accumulating renal safet y data and may propose changes to the protocol as needed to ensure subject safety . The IRC may also review results of an y interim analy ses as described in Section 9.6. The recommendations made b y the IRC to alter the conduct of the stud y will be forwarded to Pfizer management for final decision. Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may include summ aries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safet ydata that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. 9.9.Safety Adjudi cation Committee s The identification of events requiring submission to an adjudication/review committee may bemade b y the stud y site and communicated to Pfizer or desi gnee. Events requiring review, including opportunistic infections, cardiovascular, and malignancy events may also be identified by the Pfizer Study Team or designee during the review of subject da ta listings or by site monitors during routine monitoring o fsubject’s stud y records. The Pfizer Study Team or designee will notify the study site of an y events should they identify . The Pfizer Study Team or designee will provide a listing of specific do cuments needed to support event adjudication by the Adjudica tion/Review Committees. Obtaining and submitting the documentation will be the responsibility of the study site. Event documentation will vary with the event requiring adjudication and may inclu de (but not be limited to): hospital discharge summaries, o perative reports, clinic notes, diagnostic tests, pathology reports, autopsy reports and death certificate information, as applicable. 10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during stud y conduct toensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs areaccurate. The investiga tor and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its a gents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This verification may also occur after study completion."

The i nvestigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will coop erate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, whenever feasible, to be pr esent during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the stud y data and the subject's medical records. The inves tigator will promptl y provide copies of the inspection find ings to Pfizer or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings. It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections a nd that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING 11.1. Repo rt Forms/Data Collection Tools/Electronic Data Record As us ed in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study . A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. T he completed original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The inv estigator shall ensure that the CRFs are securel y stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or pa per form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access b yunauthorized third parties. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safet y, and laboratory data entered on the C RFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are ac curate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consiste nt, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are true. An y corrections to entries made in the CRF sor source documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the origi nal entry .

In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator site and at Pfizer that clearl y identifies those data that will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulat ory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identi ty of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, source documents, detailed records of treatment dispositio n, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e g, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be retained by the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer. The investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securel y for so long as they are retained. Ifthe investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer sho uld be prospectivel y notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, su ch as another investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arrang ed by Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a mini mum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable loca l regulations. The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposin g of an y records, even if retention requirements have been met. 12.ETHICS 12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent docume nts, and other relevant documents, eg,recruitment advertis ements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the investi gator f ile. Copies of IRB/EC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the implementation."

Such measures will include omitting subject names or other directl y identifiable data in an y reports, publications, or other disclosures, exc ept where required b y applicable laws. The personal data w ill be stored at the study site in encry pted electronic and/or paper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to ensure that only authorized study staff have access. The study site will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data can be recovered in the event of disaster. In the event of a potential personal data breach, the study site shall be responsible for determining whet her a personal data breach has in fact occurred and, if so, providing breach notifications as required by law. To protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, when study data are compiled for transfer t o Pfizer and other authorized parties, subject names will b eremoved and will be replaced b y a single, specific, numerical code, based on a numbering s ystem defined by Pfizer . All other identifiable data transferred to Pfizer or other authorized parties w ill be identified by this single, subject- specific code. The investigator site will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the study , linking each subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity . In case of data transfer, Pfi zer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and pro tection of subjects’ personal data consistent with the Clinical Study Agreement and applicable privacy laws. The informed consent documents and an y subject recruitment materials must be in complian ce with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal r equirements, including applicable privacy laws. The informed consent documents used during the informed consent process and any subject recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by Pfizer , approved by the IRB/EC before use, and available fo r insp ection. The investigator must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the stud y, the sharing of data relating to the study and possible risks associated with participation, including the risks associated wi th the processing of the subject’s personal data. The investigator further must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about his or her right to access and correct his or her personal data and to withdraw consent for the processing of his or her perso nal data."

Alternative Measures During Public Emergen cies Thealternative st udy measures described in this section areto be followed during public emergencies, including the COVID -19 pandemic. This appendix applies for theduration of the COVI D-19 pandemic globall y and will become effective for other public emergencies only upon written notification from Pfizer. Use of these alternative study measures are expected to cease upon the return of business as usual circumstances (including th e lifting of an y quarantines and travel bans/advisories). Eligibility Study B7981019 has been fully recruited and the eligibility criteria are not impacted by any public emergencies, including theCOVID -19 pandemic. Telehealth Visits In the event that in-clinic study visits cannot be conducted, every effort should be made to follow up on the safet y of study participants at scheduled visits per the Schedule of Activities or unscheduled visits. The p articipant site visits may be cha nged to telehealth visi ts(if permitted by law or local guidance) to reduce risk of potential participant exposure to COVID -19. Telehealth visits may be used to continue to assess participant safety and collect data points. Telehealth includes the exchan ge of healthcare inform ation and services via telecommunication techn ologies (e g, audio, video, video- conferencing software) remotel y, allowing the participant and the investigator to communicate on aspects of clinical care, including medical advice, remin ders, education, and sa fety monitoring. The following assessments mustbe perfor med during a telehealth visit: Review and record stud y intervention(s), including compliance and missed doses. Review and record an y AEs and SAEs since the last contact. Refer to Section 8 . Review and record an y new concomitant medications or changes in concomit ant medications since the last contact. Review and record contraceptive method and results of pregnancy testing. Confirm that the participant is adhering to the contracep tion method(s) required in the protocol. Refer to Section 4.4.1 and Section 7.1regar ding pregnancy tests. Evaluate VASI and facial -VASI (site assessment) . Refer to Section 7.4.1, 7.4.2 , and 7.4.3 . Aself-captured photos by the subject may aide in assessment of facial-VASI . Complete PRO measures in the following order: VitiQoL , PGIC -V, and VNS. Refer to Section 7.6."

Alternative Facilities for Safety Assessm ents Laboratory Testing If a stud y participant is unable to vis it the site for protocol -specified safety laboratory evaluations, testing may beconducted at a local laboratory if permitted by local regulations. The local laboratory may be a standalone i nstitution or within a hospital. The following safet y laboratory evaluat ions may be performed at a local laboratory : Clinical laboratory tests listed in Section 7.3.8.2, including hematology , blood chemistry, urinal ysis and other protocol specified tests . Special safet y assessment of serum creatinine and cy statin C, for estim ation of eGFR . If a local laboratory is used, qualified stud y site personnel must order, receive, and review results. Site staff must collect thelocal laboratory reference ranges and certifications/ accreditations for filing at the site. Laboratory test r esults are to be provided to the site staff as soon as poss ible. Thelocal laboratory reports should be filed in th e participant’s source documents/medical records. Relevant data fro mthe local laboratory report should be recorded on the CRF. If a part icipant requiring pregnancy testing cannot visit a local lab oratory for pregnancy testing, a home urine pregnancy testing kit with a sensitivity of at least 25 IU/mL may be used by theparticipant to perform the test at home, if compliant with loc al regula tory requirements. The pregnancy test outcome should be doc umented in the participant’s source documents/medical records and relevant data recorded on the CRF. Confirm that the partic ipant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol . Imaging If the participant is unable to visit the study site for imaging assessment(s), the self captured photo APP (called “Pfizer Vitiligo Study B7981019” powered by Tissue Analy tics) used by the subject may aide in assessment of f acial -VASI . Quali fied study site personnel must order, receive, and review re sults. Electrocardiograms If the participant is unable to visit the study site for single 12 -lead ECGs , the participant ma y visit a n alternative facility to have the ECGs performed. Qualified st udy site personnel must order, receive, and review results."

In situations where pa rticipants are qua rantined or self- isolating, arrangements to send investigational product via courier may be implemented where allowable by law or by local guidance and with the participant’s v erbal consent. Investigational product appropriate for the in dividual participant based on the study period and treatment group, may beshipped by courier to study participants if per mitted by local regulations and in accordance with storage and transport ation requirements for the investigation al product . Pfizer does not permit the shipment of investigational product by mail. The tracking record of shipments and the chain of custod y ofinvestigational product must be kept in the participant’s source documents/medical records. Similar to investigational product dispensed at the clinical site, PF- 06651600 tablets and matching placebo for oral administration will be in blisters and PF -0670 0841 tablets for oral administration will be in bottles. Investigati onal products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with the labels. Participants will take t he medication orall y once daily. Participants should swallow the tablets whole with 1cup (240 mL or 2.4 DL) of ambient temperature wate r, without an y manipulat ionor chew ing. Participants will be encouraged to take the investigational product after breakfast whenever possible even though it may be taken with or without food. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events If a participant has COVID -19 during the study , this should be reported as an adver se event (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE) and appropriate medical intervention provided. Temporary discontinuation of thestudy intervention may be medicall y appropriate until the participa nt has recovered from COVID-19 . It is recommended that the in vestigator discuss temporary or permanent discontinuation of study intervention with the study medical monitor. Efficacy Assessments The efficacy assessments will be conducted to the best abili ty with available telehealth modality and calculate VASI and facial -VASI .If possible, obtain photographs of the target lesion with the best possible compliance with the Photograph y Instructions."
