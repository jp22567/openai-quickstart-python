Clarification was prov ided in the overall design to specify that subjects randomized to TBR will switch to DTG + 3TC at Week 52 if HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 48 (or upon retest b y Week 52). Biomarkers of inflammation and mitochondrial function were removed as exploratory endpoints. A Week 96 endpoint was added to the measurement of biomarkers of telomerase function in a subset of subjects. Cardiovascular biomarker measurements were removed as exploratory endpoints. Inclusion Criteria #5 was edited for clarity . Section 6.2, Protocol Permitted Substitutions, added. The text defining the TBR comparators as investigational medicinal product was removed; TBR comparators will be provided in designated, specific countries only , as needed. The Time and Events Table was modified to clarify that whole blood samples may be utilized for virology and for telomere length measurements, and cry opreserved PBMCs will be used to evaluate telomerase activity . Updated version of Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severit y of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (v2.1), March 2017, was provided in Section 12.9. Changes were made to the protocol text to reflect the addition of Country Specific requirements for Japan. Minor revisions were made to the text to correct errors and improve accuracy . 2015N242992_02 2017-JUN-13 Amendment No. 2 The impetus for this protocol amendment was to update Appendix 5, Appendix 6 and Appendix 8 based on the ViiV Healthcare templates for these appendices which are appropriate for the HIV patient population. The prior versions of these appendices were based on a general GSK template and were not appropriate. During this process, other updates were made to the protocol which are summarized in Appendix 11. 2015N242992_03 2017-AUG-24 Amendment No.3 Amended to inclu de: Addition of CD8+ Ly mphocyte assessments, addition of inflammatory biomarkers assessments as new exploratory endpoints, revision of the sample size based on updated estimates for the primary endpoint for the investigational arm, and minor clarifications and corrections of t ypographical errors. 2019N409553_01"

(Division of AIDS t able for Grading Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events). This change has no impact on the investigator’s evaluation of adverse events. Minor revisions were made to the text to provide updated information, correct errors and improve accuracy and consistency . Text was edited in Appendix 10, Section 13.10.2. to clarify wording for the country specific requirement for Japan. 2015N242992_05 2018-JUN-14 Amendment No. 5 Changes were made to the protocol to manage and mitigate risks following identifica tion of a potential safety issuerelated to neural tube defect sin infants born to women with exposure to dolutegravir at the time of conception. Changes were also made to include updated text to address a higher number of participants screened than plann ed, to update references to the DTG IB to reflect the most current versions and to add clarification and correct minor ty pos. The Risk Assessment table (Section 4.6.1) was updated to include language regarding risk and mitigation of neural tube defects. The withdrawal criteria (Section 5.4) were updated to include a reminder that females of reproductive potential who change their minds and desire to be pregnant , or who state they no longer are willing to comply with the approved pregnancy avoidance methods,should also be withdrawn from the study. The Time and Events table (Section 7.1). was updated to include a reminder for investigators to check at every visit that females of reproductive potential are avoiding pregnancy . The modified list of highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in FRP (Section 13.3.1) was updated to exclude the double barrier method of contraception, which does not meet updated GSK/ViiV criteria for a highl y effective method. The Type andNumber of Subjects (Section 4.3 ) and Sample Size Assumptions (Section 9.2.1) wereupdated to address a higher number of participants screened than planned. 2015N242992_06 2018-AUG-29 Amendment No. 6 Changes were made to the protocol to update the study design to extend the Randomized Early Switch Phase through to 148 weeks instead of Week 52, delay ing the late switch to Week 148 with long term follow- up through to completion of the study at Week 200. 2019N409553_01"

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS FOR STUDY 204862 Rationale Study 204862 is being conducted to establish if human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected adult subjects with current virologic suppression on a ≥3-drug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based regimen (TBR) remain suppressed upon switching to a two - drug regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg + lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg. This study also will provide important information regarding the safet y of, and patient satisfaction with this two-drug regimen. This trial is de signed to demonstrate the non -inferior antiviral activity of switching to DTG + 3TC once daily compared to continuation of TBR over 48 weeks. This study also will characterize the long- term antiviral activity , tolerability and safety of DTG + 3TC compared to TBRthrough Week 144 and characterize the long - term antiviral activity , tolerability and safet y of DTG + 3TC through Week 200. Objective(s)/Endpoint(s) Objective Endpoint Primary To demonstrate the non -inferior antiviral activity of switching to DTG +3TC once daily compared to continuation of TBR over 48 weeks in HIV -1 infected, ART therapy (ART) - experienced, virologically suppressed subjectsVirologic failure endpoint as per FDA snapshot category at Week 48 Secondary To demonstrate the antiviral ac tivity of switching to DTG +3TC once daily compared to continuation of TBR over 48 weeks Proportion of subjects with plasma HIV -1 RNA <50copies c/mL at Week 48 using the Snapshot algorithm for the ITT- E population To demonstrate the antiviral activity o f switching to DTG + 3TC once daily compared to continuation of TBR over 24 weeks , 96 weeks and 144 weeksVirologic failure endpoint as per FDA snapshot category at Week s24, 96 and 144 Proportion of subjects with plasma HIV -1 RNA <50c/mL at Weeks 24, 96and 144 using the Snapshot algorithm for the ITT -E population To evaluate the immune effects of DTG + 3TC once daily compared to continuation of TBR over 24, 48, 96 and 144 weeksChange from Baseline in CD4+ cell count and in CD4+/CD8+ cell counts ratio at Weeks 24 , 48, 96 and 144 Incidence of disease progression (HIV - associated conditions, AIDS, and death) through Weeks 24 , 48, 96, and 144 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of DTG + 3TC once daily compared to TBR over timeIncidence and severity of AEs and laboratory abnormalities through 144weeks Proportion of subjects who discontinue treatmen t due to AEs through 144 weeks To evaluate the effects of DTG + 3TC once daily on fasting lipids over time compared to TBRChange from Baseline in fasting lipids at Weeks 24,48, 96 and 144 2019N409553_01"
12,page_12,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 13Objective Endpoint To assess viral resistance in subjects meeting Virologic Withdrawal CriteriaIncidence of observed genotypic and phenotypic resistance to ARVs for subjects meeting Virologic Withdrawal Criteria To evaluate renal (in ur ine and blood) and bone (in blood) biomarkers in subjects treated with DTG + 3TC compared to TBRChange from Baseline in renal and bone biomarkers at Weeks 24, 48, 96 and 144 To assess health related quality of life for subjects treated with DTG + 3TC com pared to TBRChange from Baseline in health status using EQ - 5D-5L at Weeks 24 ,48, 96 and 144 (or Withdrawal from the study) Overall Design This is a 200- week, Phase III, randomized, open -label, active -controlled, multicenter, parallel-group stud y to assess the non- inferior antiviral activity and safety of replacing a TBR with a two-drug regimen of DTG + 3TC in HIV- infected adults who are virologicall y suppressed and stable on a TBR. The study will include a Screening Phase (up to 28 day s), a Randomized Early Switch Phase (Day 1 up to Week 148), a Randomized L ate Switch Phase (Week 148 up to Week 200), and a Continuation Phase (post Week 200)ifDTG + 3TC fixed dose combination ( FDC)is not yet approved and available locall y. Approximately 550 HIV -1 infected adults who are on a stable TBR will be randomized 1:1 to switch to DTG + 3TC once dail y (DTG + 3TC arm) for up to 200weeks, or to continue their TBR for 148weeks, at which time and if HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 144(or upon retest by Week 148), thes e subjects will switch to DTG+3TC up to Week 200.For subjects randomized to the TBR, provisions will be in place, as needed and after discussion with the study team, to assist patients in obtaining their TBR during the study . For subjects who switch t o DTG + 3TC at Week 148, a separate Late Switch Phase Time and Events Table is provided in Section 7.1.2as these participants will be monitored closely for the first 24 weeks post -switch. Subjects who remain on DTG + 3TC will follow a separate Late Switch Phase Time and Events Table in Section 7.1.3. The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of participants who meet the Snapshot virologic failure criteria at Week 48 using the Intent- to-Treat Exposed (ITT -E) population . The Week 48 primary analysis will take place after the last subject has had their Week 48 viral load assessed, including an y retests. Subjects randomized to DTG+3TC will receive DTG + 3TC up to Week 200. Subjects random ized to TBR will have a Week 148 switch visit, allowing approximately 4 weeks for subjects who have a viral load ≥50 c/mL at Week 144 to have a retest prior to switch. The study will continue for at least 200 weeks. The sample size is such that the study has 90% power to demonstrate non- inferiority using a 4% margin, assuming a true 2 % virologic failure rate at Week 48 and using a 2.5% one -sided alpha level. A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy in the DTG+3TC arm will be conducted to evaluate DTG and 3TC concentrations using a sparse PK sampling approach at designated visits 2019N409553_01"
13,page_13,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 14(See Section 11). In addition, intensive PK samples will be collected from a subgroup of subjects (approximately 30) enrolled at selected sites with the capability to perform intensive PK sampling. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be instituted to ensure external objective medical and/or statistical review of efficacy and safet y to protect the ethical interests and well -being of subjects and to protect the sc ientific validity of this study . Treatment A rms and Duration The study will include a Screening Phase (up to 28 day s), a Randomized Early Switch Phase (Day 1 up to Week 148), a Randomized Late Switch Phase (Week 148up to Week 200) and a Continuation Phase(post Week 200)ifDTG + 3TC FDC is not yet approved and available locally . Subjects randomized to DTG + 3TC will receive DTG + 3TC up to Week 200. Subjects randomized to TBR will continue to take their current regimen up to Week 144, at which time and if HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 144(or upon retest b y Week 148), these subjects will switch to DTG + 3TC up to Week 200. Randomization will be stratified by baseline third agent class (protease inhibitor [PI ], integrase inhibitor [INI], or non-nucleoside r everse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]). The primary analysis at Week 48 will take place after the last subject completes up to 52 weeks on therap y, to allow for the collection of a confirmatory viral load measurement in subjects presenting with HIV- 1 RNA 50 c/mL at the Week 48 visit. The secondary analysis at Week 24 will take place after the last subject completes up to 28 weeks on therapy, to allow for the collection of a confirmatory viral load measurement in subjects presenting with HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL at the Week 24 visit. Further secondary analyses will take place at Week 96, 144 and 196. All subjects who successfully complete 200 weeks of treatment will complete the study and transition to locally approved and available DTG + 3TC fixed -dose combination (FDC)andbe managed as per standard of care at their study site.Prior to completion of the Week 200 visit, s iteswill need to have confirmation that DTG + 3TC FDC is locally available for study subjects. If DTG + 3TC FDC is not yet approved and available locally, ViiV Healthcare will continue to provide study drug in a Continuation Phase until: DTG+ 3TC FDC islocally approved for use as a 2-drug regimen, and available to subjects (e.g., through public health services or through their usual healt h insurance pay er), or the subject no longer derives clinical benefit, or the subject meets a protocol- defined reason for discontinuation, or development of the DTG plus 3TC dual regimen is terminated. Assessments during the Continuation Phase are lim itedand will include plasma HIV -1 RNA and collection of AEs/SAEs. No dose reductions, modifications, or changes in the frequency of any components of each regimen will be allowed during this study with the exception of a switch from a PI 2019N409553_01"

Therefore, adherence to the stud y design requirements is essential and required for stud y conduct. Type and Number of Subjects The target population to be enrolled is virologically suppressed subjects with HIV-1 infection on a stable TAF -based antiretroviral therapy (ART) with no evidence or history of drug resistance. Assuming 30% screen f ailure rate, approximately 800 HIV-1-infected adult s ubjects will be screened to achieve 550 randomized subjects for a total of 275 evaluable subjects per treatment group. The study closed screening on 18 May 2018 with a total of 933 screened subjects and a total of 743 subjects wererandomised. Analysis This study is designed to show that the antiviral effect of switching to a simplified two-drug regimen of DTG + 3TC once -daily is not inferior to continuation of TBR at week 48 in HIV -1 infected ART -experienced subjects. Non-inferiority can be concluded if th e upper bound of a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in failure rates between the two treatment arms is smaller than 4%. If r d is the virologic failure rate on DTG + 3TC and r f is the virologic failure rate on the current ART regimen, th en the hypotheses can be written as follows: H0: rd-rf ≥ 4% H 1: rd-rf< 4% The primary analysis at Week 48 will take place after the last subject has had their Week48 viral load assessed, including a retest if required. The primar y analysis method for the proportion of virologic failure at Week 48 will be a Cochran -Mantel Haenszel test stratified by baseline third agent class (PI, INI, or NNRTI) . A non-inferiority margin of 4% will be used for this comparison, where if the upper b ound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in failure rate between the 2 study arms is not more than 4%, non-inferiority will be demonstrated. 2019N409553_01"

INTRODUCTION Current human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment guidelines recommend antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens consisting of two nucleoside/nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI s) as a “backbone” combined with a third agent from the non -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), protease inhibitor (ritonavir-boosted) (PI /RTV), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) classes [BHIVA, 2016; DHHS , 2016; EACS, 2015; IAS-USA, 2016]. These regimens are highl y efficacious and generally well tolerated. However, since these regimens will need to be taken life-long, there is growing concern about their long -term toxicities and cost. As the potential for toxic ities and cost are directl y related to the number of antiretrovirals (ARVs) used, there is great interest from patients and clinicians in regimens that minimize the number of ARVs without sacrificing long -term antiviral efficacy . Dolutegravir (DTG) is a potent dual cation binding INSTI, exhibiting rapid and potent (2.5 log 10) reduction in viral load and a high barrier to resistance. In addition, DTG lacks many of the frequent drug interactions associated with other medications commonly taken by HIV-positive patients. The efficacy , pharmacokinetic (PK), safet y and drug interaction potential of DTG has been evaluated in an extensive program of Phase I to IIIB clinical trials [ TivicayPackage Insert, 2017 ]. DTG’s ef ficacy and high barrier to resistance has been demonstrated in several DTG- based trials [ Raffi, 2013; Walmsley , 2013; Clotet, 2014]. Lamivudine (3TC) is a potent cy tidine nucleoside analogue with a favorable long -term safety profile. Available since 1995 as a single agent (EPIVIR), it is also available as part of three backbone fixed -dose combination (FDC) products (COMBIVIR, EPZICOM/KI VEXA and TRI UMEQ). Although 3TC monotherapy quickly selects for resistance due to a single point mutation at position M184V, 3TC retains residual antiviral activity against such mutants and helps prevent the emergence of resistance to other NRTI’s [ Eron, 1995; Kuritzkes, 1996]. A single tablet regimen (STR) of two potent, well -characterized and well- tolerated ARVs, DTG plus 3TC, may provide a novel 2-drug regimen that provides effective long-term antiviral suppression while limiting the risk of adverse reactions associated with ARV’s. The combination of 3TC with DTG, with its high barrier to resistance, and ability to confer a rapid decline in HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA), m ay be less likely to select for resistance. The expected efficacy and safety of a dual STR of DTG plus 3TC will make it sui table for both treatment -naïve individuals, and as a replacement treatment for ≥3-drug ART in virologically suppressed (“switch”) patients. 2.1. Study Rationale Contemporary potent 3-drug antiretroviral treatment has led to remarkable declines in morbidity and mortality in treated HIV -infected persons. However, this longer life expectancy has been accompanied by higher rates of non -acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) -defining events (NADEs) such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease and cancer. These NA DES are now the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among treated HIV -infected persons. The aetiologies of these NADEs are multi -factorial and 2019N409553_01"
16,page_16,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 17may include chronic inflammation and immune activation, behavioural and lifesty le- related factors, co -morbidities and the adverse effects of ART. In addition, as HIV- infected persons live longer, aging- associated co -morbidities are being seen with greater frequency , and this multi -morbidity often requires concomitant use of other medications. As ART needs to be taken life long, there is an unmet need for streamlined regimens that can minimize antiretroviral- related long -term toxicities and drug -drug interactions while maintaining viral suppression. Even modest improvements in side effects will have a big impact on the tolerability of, and adherence to life -long treatment regimens. Two-drug antiretroviral regimens may maintain virologic suppression while minimizing the adverse effects from cumulative drug exposure and preserving future antiretroviral treatment opt ions. While contemporary regimens avoid many of the liabilities of older agents, the consequences of long -term exposure to a 2-NRTI backbone remain uncertain. Compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)- based regimens, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based regimens (TBRs) are associated with short -term improvements in renal and bone biomarkers in both treatment -naive and treatment- experienced persons [ Genvoya, 2016]. However, the use of TAF leads to much higher intr acellular tenofovir diphosphate (DP) levels compared to TDF, and the consequences of the long -term exposure to high intracellular tenofovir levels are unknown. Chronic exposure to NRTI s may lead to telomerase and mitochondrial dy sfunction, processes that m ay lead to accelerated aging, lipodystrophy, steatohepatitis and other aging -related morbidities [ Solomon, 2014]. NRTIs have been linked to reduced telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV -infected patients [ Leeansyah, 2013]. Of a multitude of NRTIs studied in vitro, tenofovir at therapeutic concentrations was found to produce the most significant inhibition of telomerase leading to accelerated shortening of telomere length in activated PBMCs [ Leeansyah, 2013; Stella -Ascariz,2017]. It is of note that current TAF- regimens deliver four fold higher intra cellular levels of tenofovir -DP (the active entity for both HIV-RT and human telomerase) than TDF -regimens and thus pose a greater concern for its effects on telomerase and normal cell proliferation. In addition, many of the current TAF -based single tablet regimens incorporate a boosting agent, cobicistat, while PI -containing regimens require boosting with ritonavir. With the increasing incidence of aging -related co -morbidities that comes with longer lifespan, drug-drug interactions from poly pharmacy are anincreasingl y important issue. The use of cobicistat -and ritonavir -containing regimens may increase the risk of potentially harmful drug-drug interactions, and hence the need for optimized regimens involving drugs with minimal potential for such interacti ons. Finally, if a 2-drug ART regimen is shown to be as effective and safe as conventional 3-drug regimens, the lower cost associated with taking one less drug for the lifetime of an HIV-infected person will have substantial individual and societal indivi dual benefits. One of the potential risks of a 2 -drug regimen is the increase in virologic failure associated with the emergence of drug resistance. DTG, with its higher barrier to resistance, may reduce the risk of treatment -emergent resistance in patien ts taking a 2-drug regimen. The pivotal Phase 3 studies of DTG in naïve subjects have shown the absence of treatment-emergent INI or NRTI resistance mutations through 144+ weeks of treatment [ Walmsley , 2013]. The absence of treatment emergent mutations to DTG or background agents in ART -naïve individuals, the potency of both DTG and 3TC, and the 2019N409553_01"
17,page_17,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 18well-tolerated safet y profile of both drugs provides a strong rationale for the development of the DTG + 3TC STR as an i mportant treatment option for patients. The overall objective of the DTG + 3TC clinical development program is to develop a single tablet, fixed -dose, two- drug combination therap y regimen that is as effective as 3- drug ART in treating HIV-1 infection, is s afe and well tolerated in the long -term,and has a high barrier to the emergence of viral resistance. A DTG + 3TC two -drug strategy may be effective in maintaining virologic suppression among treatment experienced subjects, while improving long -term safet y and tolerability, and preserving future HIV -1 treatment options. Study 204862 is being conducted to establish if human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected adult subjects with current virologic suppression on a TBR remain suppressed upon switching to a two- drug regimen with DTG + 3TC. This trial is designed to demonstrate the non- inferior antiviral activity of switching to DTG + 3TC once daily compared to continuation of a TBR over 48 weeks. To better understand the long-term differences in an tiviral efficacy, safe ty and tolerability between DTG + 3TC and TAF-based regimens, the comparative phase of the study will be extended to 148 weeks. The originally planned Week 52 Switch Visit in the TBR arm will be moved to Week 148 to allow for 2 additi onal years of comparative follow -up. This study will also characterize the long- term antiviral activity , tolerability and safet y of DTG + 3TC through Week 200. 2.2. Brief Background By limiting the number of ARV’s to which a patient is chronically exposed, 2 -drug therapy has the potential benefit of preserving future treatment options, minimizing potential long term toxicity and decreasing the likelihood of drug- drug interactions (DDIs).Several studies have assessed the tolerability and durability of the virolo gical response of a 2- drug ARV regimen as replacement for a ≥3-drug ARV regimen in individuals who were previously undetected on triple drug therap y. One such study was the OLE study which was an open label study in virologicall y suppressed HIV -1 infected individuals (HIV -1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) receiving a lopinavir (L PV)/r plus 3TC or emtricitabine (FTC) containing 3 -drug regimen who were randomized to continue their current triple based regimen or have their therapy simplified to a dual regimen of L PV/r + 3TC [Arribas, 2015]. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients free of therapeutic failure at 48 weeks. In a modified Intent to Treat (m -ITT) analysis, dual therapy with LPV/r + 3TC demonstrated non -inferior efficacy and comparable safety to LPV/r + 2 NRTIs, as maintenance therap y in virologically suppressed patients (91.5% vs. 90.9% respectively ; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -0.6% to 8.1%). The SALT study [Perez-Molina, 2015] was a 96 -week multicenter, randomized, open - label, clinical trial that compared atazanavir (ATV/r + 3TC with ATV/r + 2NRTI s (selected at the discretion of the investigator) in HIV- infected patients on a stable 3 -drug regimen who switch therapy because of toxicity , intolerance, or simplification. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the non -inferior efficacy of maintenance therap y with ATV/r + 3TC compared to ATV/r + 2 NRTIs at 48 weeks (noninferiorit y margin, –12%) using the time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) algorithm. At 48 weeks, 78.4% of 2019N409553_01"
18,page_18,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 19patients receiving triple therap y vs. 83.6% of patients switched to dual therapy had maintained HIV -RNA levels < 50 copies/mL thus establishing non -inferiority between these two treatment arms (difference between the arms 5.2; -4.8 to 15.2). More recentl y, an INI-containing oral 2 -drug regimen, cabotegravir (CAB) + rilpivirine (RPV), was evaluated as a maintenance therap y in HIV-infected persons who had virologic suppression after 24 weeks of 3 -drug ART [ Margolis, 2015]. The CAB + RPV arms showed comparative antiviral efficacy as the EFV + 2 NRTIs arm. Following 72weeks of two -drug maintenance therap y (Week 96), in the ITT maintenance = exposed population, 86% of CAB + RPV subjects and 83% of EFV + 2 NRTIs subjects remained virologicall y suppressed .Virologic failure was seen in 4% of the CAB arms and 2% of the EFV+2 NRTI arm. GEMINI-1 and GEMINI -2 are two identical global, double -blind, multicentre Phase III studies evaluating the efficacy and safet y of DTG + 3TC once dail y in treatment -naïve HIV-1-infected a dults with Screening HIV -1 ≤500,000 c/mL . At 48 weeks, dual therap y with DTG + 3TC demonstrated non-inferior efficacy to DTG + TDF/FTC ( in the primary endpoint: p roportion of subjects with plasma HIV -1 RNA<50 c/ml by FDA Snapshot in the pooled ITT-E population[DTG/3TC n=716;DTG/TDF/FTC n= 717]91% vs. 93% respectivel y, adjusted difference (95% CI) - 1.7 (-4.4, 1.1). Across both studies, 6 participants on DTG + 3TC and 4 participants on DTG + TDF/FTC met protocol -defined virologic withdrawal criteria and none had treatment -emergent INSTI or NRTI resistance mutations. Overall, the rates of AEs were similar between arms, with low rates of withdrawals due to AEs for both arms [ Cahn, 2018]. TAF, a HIV -1 nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), is a novel targeted prodrug of tenofovir that has demonstrated antiviral efficacy similar to and at much lower dose than that of TDF. TAF has also shown improvement in surrogate laboratory markers of renal and bone safet y as compared to TDF in clinical trials in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Combinations of TAF -containing regimens including rilpivirine/FTC/TAF (Odefsey ), elvitegravir (EVG)/cobicistat/FTC/TAF (Genvoya) and FTC/TAF (Descov y) + a 3rdagent (INI, NNRTI or bo osted PI) are indicated for the treatment of HIV -1 infection in adults and pediatric patients 12 y ears of age and older who have no ART history or to replace the current ARV regimen in those who are virologically -suppressed (HIV -1 RNA<50 copies/mL ) on a stable ARV regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance [ Odefsey, 2016; Genvoy a, 2016; Descovy , 2016]. 2019N409553_01"

The study willinclude a Screening Phase (up to 28 day s), an Earl y Switch Phase (Day 1 up to Week 148) a Late Switch Phase (Week 148 up to Week 200), and a Continuation Phase (post Week 200)if DTG + 3TC FDC is not yet approved and available locally . Approximately 550 HIV-1 infected adults who are on a stable TBR will be randomized 1:1 to switch to DTG + 3TC once dail y (DTG + 3TC arm) for up to 200 weeks, or to continue their TBR for 148weeks, at which time and if HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 144(or upon retest by Week 148),these subjects will switch to DTG + 3TC up to Week 200 . For subjects randomized to the TBR, provisions will be in place, as needed and after discussion with the study team, to assist patients in obtaining their TBR during the study . For subjects wh o switch to DTG+ 3TC at Week 148, a separate Late Switch Phase Time and Events Table is provided in Section 7.1.2as these participants will be monitored closely for the first 24 weeks post -switch. Subjects who remain on DTG + 3TC will follow a separate Late Switch Phase Time and Events Table in Section 7.1.3. The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of participants who meet the Snapshot virologic failure criteria at Week 48 using the In tent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT- E) population. The Week 48 primary analysis will take place after the last subject has had their Week 48 viral load assessed, including an y retests. Subjects randomized to DTG + 3TC will receive DTG + 3TC up to Week 200. Subjects randomized to TBR will have a Week 148 switch visit, allowing approximately 4 weeks for subjects who have a viral load ≥50 c/mL at Week 144to have a retest prior to switch. The study will continue for at least 200weeks. All subjects who successfully complete 200 weeks of treatment will complete the study and transition to locally approved and available DTG + 3TC fixed -dose combination (FDC)andbe managed as per standard of care at their study site. Prior to completion of the Week 200 visit, s iteswill need to have confirmation that DTG + 3TC FDC is locally available for study subjects.IfDTG + 3TC FDC is not yet approved and available locally, ViiV Healthcare will continue to provide study drug in a Continuation Phase as outlined in Section 4.2.4. No dose reductions, modifications, or changes in the f requency of any components of each regimen will be allowed during this study with the exception of a switch from a PI boosted with ritonavir to the same PI boosted with cobicistat and vice versa. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1), are essential and required for stud y conduct. If deviations are required for the management of immediate safety concerns, these should be communicated promptly to the study medical monitor. 2019N409553_01"

Following the Week 144visit, subjects will stay on DTG + 3TC or their TBR for another 4 weeks so that the result from the Week 144HIV-1 RNA testing is known. All subjec ts with a viral load 50 c/mL must have plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels re -assessed within approximately 2-4 weeks. This will allow any subject in the TBR arm with a viral load 50 c/mL at Week 144to have their viral load confirmed by a second measurement performed within approximately 2-4 weeks while still on their TBR regimen. The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes up to 52 weeks on therapy, to allow for the collection of a confirmatory viral load measurement in subjects presenting with HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL at the Week 48 visit. I f the retest HIV -1 RNA is <50 c/mL , then the subject will be considered to have met the criteria for virologic responder b y Food Drugs and Administration (FDA)’s Snapshot algorithm at Week 48. If the retest HIV-1 RNA is 50 c/mL, then the subject will be considered to be a virologic non-responder at Week 48 by Snapshot . The secondary analysis at Week 24 will take place after the last subject completes up to 28 weeks on therap y, as needed, to allow for t he collection of a confirmatory viral load measurement in subjects presenting with HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL at Week 24. The secondary analysis at Week 96 will take place after the last subject completes up to 100 weeks on therapy, as needed, to allow for the col lection of a confirmatory viral load measurement in subjects presenting with HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL at Week 96. The secondary analysis at Week 144 will take place after the last subject completes up to 148 weeks on therapy, as needed, to allow for the collecti on of a confirmatory viral load measurement prior to Week 148 switch visit in subjects presenting with HIV- 1 RNA 50c/mL at Week 144. If the retest HIV -1 RNA is <50 c/mL ,subjects in the TBR arm will be considered eligible to switch to DTG + 3TC at Week 148. If the retest HIV -1 RNA is  50 c/mL, the subjects in the TBR arm will be considered ineligible to switch to DTG + 3TC. Subjects who are ineligible to switch will be withdrawn from the study . Thus, the treatment extension up to Week148 will allow f or as complete an assessment as possible of treatment response in the analysis at Week 144within the Snapshot window. 4.2.3. Late Switch Phase (Week 148to Week 200) At Week 144, subjects randomly assigned to DTG + 3TC and with HIV -1 RNA <50c/mL will continue o n that treatment through Week 200. At Week 148, subjects randomly assigned to continue their TBR and with HIV- 1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 144 (or upon retest) will switch to DTG + 3TC once daily and be followed up to Week 200. For subjects who switch to DTG + 3TC at Week 148, a separate Late Switch Phase Time and Events Table is provided in Section 7.1.2as these participants will be monitored closely for the first 24 weeks post -switch.

Continuation Phase (Post Week 200) At the end of the stud y at Week 200, subjects will transition to locally approved and available DTG + 3TC FDC and be managed as per standard of care at their study site. Prior to completion of the Week 200 visit, s iteswill need to have confirmation that DTG+ 3TC FDC is locally available for stud y subjects. IfDTG + 3TC FDC is not yet approved and available locally , ViiV Healthcare will continue to provide study drug in a Continuation Phase until: DTG+ 3TCFDCislocally approved for use as a 2-drug regimen, and available to subjects (e.g., through public health services or through their usual health insurance pay er), or the subject no longer d erives clinical benefit, or the subject meets a protocol- defined reason for discontinuation, or development of the DTG plus 3TC dual regimen is terminated. Assessments during the Continuation Phase are limited and will include plasma HIV -1 RNA and col lection of AEs/SAEs. 4.3. Type and Number of Subjects The target population to be enrolled is HIV-1 infected adults who are v irologically suppressed on a TBR (As a first -line regimen with specific allowed switches as defined in inclusion criterion 5) and with no evidence or history of ARV drug -resistance. Assuming 30% screen failure rate, approximately 800 HIV -1-infected adult subjects will be screened to achieve 550 randomized subjects for a total of 275 evaluable subjects per treatment group. The study closed screening on 18 May 2018 with a total of 933 screened subjects and a total of 743 subjects were randomized. 4.4. Design Justification The design of this study (1:1 randomized, open- label, active -controlled, multicenter, parallel group, non -inferiority study) is well established for confirming the non-inferiority of an investigational agent compared with an active ART standard -of-care regimen and generally is accepted by regulatory authorities as rigorous proof of antiviral activity. The primary endpoint, p roportion of subjects defined as virologic failures b y the FDA Snapshot algorithm, is recommended in the FDA’s 2015 guidance document for assessing efficacy in Switch Trials [ CDER, 2015]. The key secondary endpoint, proportion of subjects at Week 48 with plasma HIV -1 RNA<50 c/mL, is also a well - established surrogate endpoint for prognosis of HIV -1 infection and disease progression [CDER, 2015]. 2019N409553_01"
26,page_26,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 27Several studies have demonstrated the value/feasibility of a switch study design, an approach that has been shown to generate valuable data supporting ARV combinations that allow dosing flexibility , reduced toxicity and/or drug interactions or a reduction in pill burden. A simplified ARV reg imen may also contribute to increased medication adherence and reduced HIV transmission. A potential disadvantage of a switch study design is that effective, well-tolerated ART is discontinued at the time of switching to the simplified regimen [ Carr, 2012]. Previous studies have shown the non- inferiority of a 2-drug regimen in maintaining virologic suppression when HIV -infected persons who were virologicall y suppressed on a 3-drug regimen were switched to a 2 -drug regi men. In OLE, switching to a 2- drug regimen of LPV/r + 3TC/FTC was non- inferior to continuing a 3 -drug regimen of L PV/r + 2 NRTIs in HIV -infected persons who were virologicall y stable on LPV/r + 2 NRTIs [Arribas, 2015]. Protocol -defined virologic failure was 2.7% in either arm. In SALT, ATV/r + 3TC was non -inferior to a ATV/r + 2 NRTI s in maintaining virologic suppression in HIV -infected patients who switched ART for reasons of toxicity , intolerance or simplification; virologic failure was seen in 4% and 3% of the 2 -and 3- drug arms, respectivel y [Perez-Molina, 2015]. More recentl y, an INI-containing oral 2 - drug regimen, cabotegravir (CAB) + rilpivirine (RPV), was evaluated as a maintenance therapy in HIV-infected persons who had virologic suppression after 24 weeks of 3- drug ART [Margolis, 2015]. The CAB + RPV arms showed comparative antiviral efficacy as the EFV + 2 NRTIs arm. Following 72 weeks of two- drug maintenance therap y (Week 96), in the ITT maintenance = exposed population, 86% of CAB + RPV subjects and 83% of EFV + 2 NRTIs subjects remained virologically suppressed. Virologic failure was seen in 4% of the CAB arms and 2% of the EFV+2 NRTI arm. TAF-based regimens including rilpivirine/FTC/TAF, EVG/cobicistat/FTC/TAF, and FTC/TAF + either INI, NNRTI or boosted PI are indicated for the treatment of HIV -1 infection in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older who have no ART history or to replace the current ARV regimen in those who are virologically -suppressed (HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/mL ) on a stable ARV regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resis tance [Odefsey, 2016; Genvo ya, 2016; Descov y, 2016]. S witching to EVG/cobicistat/FTC/TAF from one containing either TDF/FTC/EFV, TDF/ FTC/ATV/r, TDF/FTC/ATV/cobicistat or TDF/FTC/EVG/cobicistat was non-inferior for maintenance of viral suppression and led to improvements in surrogate markers of bone and renal function [ Mills, 2016]. Similarly, switching the background regimen from TDF/FTC to TAF/FTC was non- inferior in maintaining virological suppression [ Gallant, 2016].TBR’s are not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min, or in patients with severe hepatic impairment. In this stud y, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to switch to DTG + 3TC from a TBR at Day 1 or stay on their TBR for up to 148 weeks. The primary endpoint will be evaluated at Week 48 using a 4% non- inferiority (NI) margin. This study is evaluating the rate of Snapshot algorithm measured virological failure in alread y suppressed subjects to test the hypothesis that maintenance of the suppression of HIV -1 replication by DTG + 3TC will be non-inferior to that observed in the TBR arm of the study through Week 48. To assess 2019N409553_01"
27,page_27,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 28the durability of HIV-1 RNA suppression by DTG + 3TC, subjects will remain on DTG + 3TC through Week 200. After Week 96, stud y visits will be extended to every 6 months (instead of 12 weekl y visits)except in countries where visits are required every 3 months per standard of care . For subjects who switch to DTG + 3TC at Week 148, a separate Late Switch Phase Time and Events Table is provided in Section 7.1.2as these participants will be monitored closely for the first 24 weeks post -switch. Subjects who remain on DTG + 3TC will follow a separate Late Switch Phase Time and Events Table in Section 7.1.3. This amended design will allow a longer period of comparison of antiviral efficacy , safety and tolerability between DTG + 3TC and TAF -based regimens. Long-term comparison of outcomes between regimens is important in a disease where treatment is provided life - long. The open- label desig n best suits the objectives of this study . A double -dummy design could not be undertaken given the increase in pill burden that would result from blinding, the differing requirements for dosing a variety of TBRs with food, and wide variet y of potential drug -drug interactions. An increase in pill burden could hinder compliance substantially and discourage subject enrolment. The use of the FDA snapshot algorithm for assessing the proportion of subjects with virologic failure as an objective primary endpoint will help reduce biases inherent to an open label study design. 4.5. Dose Justification To date, the efficacy , PK, safet y, and drug interaction potential of DTG and 3TC as individual agents have been evaluated in two extensive clinical development programs of Phase I to III clinical trials. As individual agents, DTG and 3TC are both approved and marketed as T IVICAY 50 mg once dail y and Epivir 300 mg once dail y, respectively. These doses will be used in the current stud y. Comprehensive clinical studies havebeen conducted with the individual DTG and 3TC products, including clinical pharmacology studies evaluating potential drug -drug interactions between each of these active ingredients and other agents. There are no known clinically relevant PK interactions between DTG and 3TC with concomitant dosing. A summary of the overall clinical development for both products is available in the IBs and or Product Insert( s) for the respective products ( refer tothe most current version of product inserts andof the IB and any IB supplements [ GSK Document Number RM2007/00683/11 ,GSK Document Number 2017N352880_00 , GSK Document Number 2017N352880_01]; Dolutegravir Product Insert, 2017; EpivirProduct Insert, 2017 ). A double- dummy design could not be undertaken given the increase in pill burden that would result from blinding, and the variable dosing requirements with food for each unique TBR. Based on the preliminary results of the pivotal bioequivalence study (204994), a bilay er tablet formulation with a core which utilizes the same formulation in the respective lay ers as the single entity tablets was selected. When administered in the fasted state, the 2019N409553_01"
28,page_28,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 29bilayer tablet demonstrated bioequivalence to the single entit y tablets for dolutegravir area under the curve zero to infinity (AUC(0-∞))& maximum concentration ( Cmax)and lamivudine AUC(0-). However, the bilayer tablet showed a modest increase in lamivudine Cmax compared to the single entity tablet,which is not considered to be clinically significant. PK of the FDC components will be evaluated using a combination of intensive and sparse sampling. 4.6.

Potential Risk of Clinical SignificanceSummary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategya Investigational Product (IP) [DTG and 3TC] Refer to IBs for additional information DTG: Hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) and rashDTG: HSR has been observed uncommonly with DTG. Rash was commonly reported in DTG Phase IIb/III clinical trials; episodes were generally mild to moderate in intensity; no episodes of severe rash, such as Stevens -Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and erythema multiforme were reported. Subjects with history of allergy/sensitivity to any of the study drugs are excluded. Specific/detailed toxicity management guidance is provided for rash (Section13.2.1.6 ). The subject informed consent form (ICF) includes information on this risk and the actions subjects should take in the event of a HSR or associated signs and symptoms DTG: Drug induced liver inj ury (DILI) and other clinically significant liver chemistry elevations 3TC: Use in HBV co- infected patients and emergence of HBV variants resistant to 3TCDTG: Non-clinical data suggested a possible, albeit low, risk for hepatobiliary toxicity with D TG. Drug -related hepatitis is considered an uncommon risk for ART containing DTG regardless of dose or treatment population. For subjects with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co -infection, improvements in immunosuppression as a res ult of HIV virologic and immunologic responses to DTG -containing ART, along with inadequate therapy for HBV co -infected subjects, likely contributed to significant elevations in liver chemistries. 3TC: Current treatment guidelines [DHHS , 2016; EACS, 2015] do not recommend monotherapy with 3TC for patients with HBV infection, which is what subjects randomised to DTG plus 3TC, would effectively be receiving. Emergence of HBV var iants associated with resistance to 3TC has been reported in HIV -1-Subjects meeting any of the following criteria during the screening period are excluded from participating. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT  3xULN and bilir ubin 1.5x ULN (with >35% direct bilirubin) Subjects positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (+HBsAg) Subjects negative for HBsAg and anti -HBsAg and positive for anti-HBc and HBV DNA. Anticipated need for any hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy during the fir st 48 weeks of the study, and for HCV therapy based on interferon or for any drugs that have a potential for adverse drug-drug interactions with study treatment throughout the entire study period.

Additionally, discontinuation of 3TC in HBV co -infected subject s can result in severe exacerbations of hepatitis B.guidance is provided for suspected DILI or other clinically significant liver chemistry elevations (Section 13.2). DTG: Psychiatric disordersDTG: Psychiatric disorders including suicidal ideation and behaviors are common in HIV -infected patients. Events of suicidal ideation, attempt, behaviour and completion were observed in clinical studies of DTG, primarily in subjects with a pre -existing history of depression or other psychiatric illness. The psychi atric profile for DTG (including suicidality, depression, bipolar and hypomania, anxiety and abnormal dreams) was similar to RAL -or favorable compared with EFV -based regimens. The reporting rate for insomnia was statistically higher for blinded DTG+ aba cavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) compared to EFV/TDF/FTC in ING114467; however, this was not duplicated in any other Phase IIb/III study conducted with DTG. Subjects who in the investigator’s judgment, pose a significant suicidality risk, are excluded from participating. Because of the elevated risk in the HIV -infected population, treatment emergent assessment of suicidality will be monitored during this study through the end of the continuation phase. Investigators are advised to consider mental health consu ltation or referral for subjects who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour (See Section 7.4.7 ). The subject informed consent form includes information on the risk of depression and suicidal ideatio n and behavior. DTG: Increased rates of virologic failure/ Observed ResistanceVirologically suppressed subjects switching from stable ART to DTG + 3TC may experience virologic failure/breakthrough and development of resistance. DTG: Week 96 an d Week 144 analyses for the Phase III/IIIb clinical studies supported the efficacy findings from earlier analyses, and demonstrated robust maintenance of viral suppression with no finding of HIV -1 resistance in treatment -naïve subjects. 3TC: M184V is the common single mutation that leads to full resistance to 3TC. Subjects with any switch to a second line regimen due to previous virologic failure and subjects with evidence of pre -existing viral resistance mutation (including M184I/V) are excluded from th is study. Genotypic resistance testing results must be reviewed by ViiV Virology to ensure subjects with exclusionary mutations are not randomized. Subjects will have HIV -1 RNA measured at routine study visits. An IDMC will be instituted to ensure ex ternal objective medical and/or statistical review of efficacy and safety. 2019N409553_01"

The co -administration of DTG with dofetilide or pilsicainide is prohibited in the study (Section 6.11.2.1 ). DTG and 3TC: Rena l functionDTG : Mild elevations of creatinine have been observed with DTG which are related to a likely benign effect on creatinine secretion with blockade of OCT- 2. DTG has been shown to have no significant effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or effective renal plasma flow. 3TC: 3TC is eliminated by renal excretion and exposures increase in patients with renal dysfunction. Specific/detailed toxicity management guidance is provided for subjects who develop a decline in renal function (Section 13.2.1.3 ). Creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy and renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) will be monitored at all subsequent study visits. Subjects with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min are excluded from participation in this study. DTG: Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) elevationsAsymptomatic CPK elevations mainly in association with exercise have been reported with DTG therapy.Specific detailed toxi city management guidance is provided for subjects who develop Grade 3 to 4 CPK elevations (Section 13.2.1.8 ).

Benefit A ssessment Individuall y, DTG and 3TC are conveniently dosed once daily, without need for a PK booster, and with limited safet y implications re sulting from theoretical or actual drug:drug interactions compared to other ART agents (including EFV and those requiring a PK booster). In addition, the high barrier to resistance observed with DTG should help protect against the development of resistance to both components of the DTG + 3TC regimen. Individuall y, DTG and 3TC in combination with other ARVs have demonstrated durable virologic and immunologic response. In general, switching subjects to a DTG + 3TC regimen from a dual NRTI -based 3-drug regimen may increase tolerability , reduce the frequency of adverse events associated with NRTI-based regimens and/or drug- drug interactions. Study participants also may benefit from the medical tests and screening procedures performed as part of this study . 4.6.3. Overall Benefit:Risk Conclusion Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects participating in this study, the potential risks identified in association with DTG + 3TC are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to s tudy subjects switching to this 2- drug regimen. 2019N409553_01"

Screening Failures Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clini cal trial but are never subsequently randomized. I n order to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, and respond to queries from Regulatory authorities, a minimal set of screen failure information is required including Demograph y, Screen Failure details, Eligibility Criteria, and an y Serious Adverse Events (see Section 7.4.1.6). Subjects are allowed to re -screen for this study one time (except where screen HIV -1 plasma RNA  50 c/mL or where exclusionary HIV-1 resistance was present). Re-screening will require a new subject number. A single repeat test (re- test) per anal yte or assessment is allowed during the s creening period to determine eligibility . However, a repeat HIV -1 RNA, if HIV -1 RNA was ≥50-c/mL is not allowed. Laboratory results provided from central laboratory services will be used to assess eligibility . In exceptional circumstances only , if a central lab result cannot be generated, local labs can be reviewed and approved b y the Medical Monitor, for consideration of participant eligibility , except for plasma HIV -1 RNA. Source documentation to verify entry criteria must be reviewed by the Principal Investigator or designee prior to randomization. Source documents from other medical facilities must be located/retrieved during the screening period. Under nocircumstances may a subject be randomized in the absence of source documentation including prio r qualifying viral load data (as outlined in the Inclusion Criteria). 5.4. Withdrawal and Stopping Criteria Subjects permanentl y discontinuing study treatments are considered to be withdrawn from the study . Similarly , subjects who enter the Continuation Phase but permanentl y discontinue participation in the Continuation Phase prior to transitioning to commerciall y available DTG + 3TC are considered to be withdrawn from study treatment and from the study. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. A subject may withdraw consent and discontinue participation in this study at any time at his/her own request. The investigator may also, at his or her discretion, discontinue the subject from participating in this study at any time (e.g. safet y, behavioral or administrative reasons). If a subject withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of an y samples taken, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Subjects are not obligated to state the reason for withdrawal. However, a reason for withdrawal must be documented by the Investigator on the Completion/Withdrawal section of the electronic case report form (eCRF). Every effort should be made b y the Investigator to follow -up subjects who withdraw from the study . 2019N409553_01"
39,page_39,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 20486 2 40Subjects may havea temporary interruption to their study treatment for management of toxicities. Such interruption of study treatment does not require withdrawal from the study. However, consultation with the Medical Monitor is required. Subjects may be prematurely di scontinued from the study for any of the following reasons: Subject or Investigator non -compliance; At the request of the subject, Investigator, GSK or ViiV Healthcare; The subject requires concurrent prohibited medications during the course of the study. The subject may remain in the study if in the opinion of the Investigator and the medical monitor, such medication will not interfere with the conduct or interpretation of the study or compromise the safety of the subject. Subjects must be discontinued fr om the study for any of the following reasons: Virologic withdrawal criteria as specified in Section 5.4are met; For subjects in the TBR arm during the Early Switch Phase, plasma HIV- 1 RNA 50c/mL at Week 144with a confirmatory retest (see Section 5.4) Subject is identified as having been mistakenl y screened/randomized with exclusionary resistance (see Section 5.2) Subject requires substitution or dose modification of DTG, 3TC or an y component of their TBR; Liver toxicity where stopping criteria met and no compelling alternate cause is identified; Renal toxicity are met and no compelling alternate cause is identified; Grade 4 clinical or laboratory AE considered causally related to study drug; Allergic reaction or Rash criteria are met and no compelling alternate cause is identified. Pregnancy (intrauterine), regardless of termination status of pregnancy (Section 7.4.2). As a reminder, females of re productive potential who change their minds and desire to be pregnant , or who state they no longer are willing to comply with the approved pregnancy avoidance methods, should also be withdrawn from the study . If a subject is prematurely or permanently withdrawn from the study , the procedures described in the Time and Events Table for the in- clinic Withdrawal visit are to be performed. All data from the Withdrawal visit will be recor ded, as they comprise an essential evaluation that should be done prior to discharging an y subject from the study . An in-clinic Follow -Up visit will be conducted 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication for subjects with ongoing AEs, for any serio us adverse events (SAEs) regardless of attributability , and also for an y laboratory abnormalities that are considered to be AEs or potentially harmful to the subject, at the last on -study visit. 2019N409553_01"
40,page_40,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 20486 2 41The following actions must be taken in relation to a subject who fails to attend the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the subject and re- schedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site must counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule a nd ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study. In cases where the subject is deemed ‘lost to follow- up’, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, three telephone calls and if necessary a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical record. Should the subject continue to be unreachable, only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow -up”. 5.4.1. Virologic Criteria for Subject Management and Viral Resistance Testing For the purposes of clinical management in this study , suspected virologic withdrawal (SVW)and confirmed virologic withdrawal (CVW)criteria are defined here, wherein the virologic withdrawal criteria are based on the HIV -1 RNA cut -off of 200 c/mL . Clinical management for precautionary virologic withdrawal (PVW)criteria are b ased on consecutive viral loads ≥50 and <200 c/mL. Suspected Virologic Withdrawal criteria one assessment with HIV -1 RNA  200 c/mL after Day 1 with an immediately prior HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL Confirmed Virologic Withdrawal criteria one assessment with HIV -1RNA 200 c/mL after Day 1 with an immediately prior HIV -1 RNA ≥50 c/mL Precautionary Virologic Withdrawal criteria may be met after two consecutive assessments with HIV -1 RNA 50 and <200 c/mL without an identifiable, non- virologic cause (immunization, illness, non- adherence) and after discussion with Medical Monitor, OR will be met with three consecutive assessments with HIV- 1 RNA 50 and <200 c/mL 5.4.1.1. Subjects Meeting Virologic Management Criteria Subjects with HI V-1 RNA plasma levels  50 c/mL at any visit after Day 1 meet “virologic management” criterion and must have plasma HIV -1 RNA levels re -assessed using the algorithm shown in Figure 2. Plasma HIV -1 RNA values determined by the central laboratory only will beused to assess virologic management criteria. Upon notification that a subject’s HIV -1 RNA plasma level qualifies him/her as meeting a 2019N409553_01"
41,page_41,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 20486 2 42“virologic management” criterion, the Investigator should query the subject regarding intercurrent illness, recent immu nisation, or interruption of therap y. All cases meeting “virologic management” criterion must be confirmed by a second measurement performed at least two weeks but not more than 4 weeks apart from the date of the original sample , unlessdelay is necessar y to meet the requirements of confirmatory HIV -1 RNA testing as outlined below. The following guidelines should be followed for scheduling confirmatory HIV -1 RNA testing in an effort to avoid false- positive results: Confirmatory testing should be schedul ed 2 to 4 weeks following resolution of any intercurrent illness, during which time the subject should receive full doses of all study drugs. Confirmatory testing should be scheduled 2 to 4 weeks following any immunisation , during which time the subject sh ould receive full doses of study drugs. If therapy is interrupted due to toxicity management, non -compliance, or other reasons, confirmatory testing should be scheduled 2 to 4 weeks following resumption of full doses of study drugs. The subject should have received full doses of study drugs for at least 2 weeks at the time confirmatory plasma HIV -1 RNA is done. Sites should contact the Medical Monitor to discuss individual subjects, whenever necessary . 5.4.1.2. Managing Subjects Meeting Precautionary Virologic Withdrawal (PVW) or Confirmed Virologic Withdra wal (CVW) Criteria Once a subject has been confirmed as meeting PVW or CVW criteria, a ‘plasma for storage’ sample from the earliest viral load ≥200 c/mL [if such is available for a PVW case), or from the SVW visit (if ≥200 c/mL ) for a CVW case] will be sent as soon as possible for genot ypic and phenotypic resistance testing and the result made known to the Investigator if and when available. Plasma samples for storage also will be obtained at unscheduled visi ts including the time of a CVW criteria (see Figure 2). Subjects may continue to receive study drug at the discretion of the investigator until results of resistance testing are available at which time the subject must be discontinued from the study , except in cases where subject samples have HIV- 1 RNA <500 c/mL , as noted below. A subject who meets a PVW or CVW criterion must be discontinued from the study. Selection of post -study ART regimen for subjects with vi rologic failure will be recorded in the eCRF. The protease (PRO)/reverse transcriptase (RT)/integrase assay s used in this study are not validated for plasma HIV -1 RNA levels <500 c/mL. Nevertheless, for all subjects who meet CVW Criteria, plasma samples will be anal ysed in an attempt to obtain genotype/phenotype data on samples with HIV -1 RNA ≥200 c/mL , as possible. Subjects with confirmed HIV -1 RNA levels between 200 c/mL and <500 c/mL should be transitioned off study drug within 30 day s even if no resistance testing data becomes available, as genoty pe/phenoty pe data may not be reliably generated from plasma 2019N409553_01"
42,page_42,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 20486 2 43samples collected from these subjects. If the confirmed HIV -1 RNA level is ≥50 and <200 c/mL , and the decision is taken to withdraw the subject, resistance testing will not be done and the subject sho uld be transitioned off study drug as soon as possible. If a subject is prematurely discontinued from participation in the study , the Investigator must make every effort to perform the evaluations outlined in the Time and Events Schedule. These data will be recorded, as they comprise an essential evaluation that needs to be done before discharging an y subject from the study .. 2019N409553_01"

Investigators should not schedule reassessment blood draws in the presence of factors that could be associated with virologic bli ps, such as intercurrent infection, treatment interruption due to toxicity management or non compliance, or vaccination. Subjects s hould have received full doses of study drug for at least 2 weeks at the time of plasma HIV -1 RNA reassessment. b. In case of withdrawal, a sample from the initial visit where the HIV -1 RNA plasma level is50 c/mL will be used for resistance testing only if HIV -1 RNA level is 200 c/mL. If resistance testing will not be done, withdrawing subjects should be transitioned off study drug as soon as possibl e. c. The medical monitor and investigator should consider intercurrent illness, recent immunization, interrupt ion of therapy or other non -virologic reasons associated with transient elevated HIV -1 RNA measurements 50 and <200 c/mL. If no non -virologic reasons are identified to explain the lack of virologic suppression, the subject must be withdrawn. If the Inve stigator and the medical monitor agree that the subject is experiencing a slow re -suppression due to one of the above issues, then a retest HIV -1 RNA measurement is required in approximately 2 -4 weeks. If the HIV -1 RNA remains 50 c/mL on a second retest ( the third consecutive HIV -1 RNA assessment), the subject must be withdrawn. d. Subjects with confirmed HIV -1 RNA results in the range 200 c/mL to <500 c/mL, should be transitioned off study drug and withdrawn from study within 30 days regardless of whether r esistance testing has been reported as genotype/phenotype data may not be reliably generated from plasma collected from these subjects. 2019N409553_01"

Investigational Product and Other Study Treatment The term ‘stud y treatment’ is used throughout the protocol to describe any combination of products received b y the subject as per the protocol design. Stud y treatment may therefore refer to the individual study treatments or the combination of those study treatments. All study treatments will be adm inistered at the approved dosages The investigational study drugs DTG and 3TC will be supplied by GSK/ViiV Healthcare as the fixed dose combination tablet DTG + 3TC. Subjects randomly assigned to continue their TBR for up to 148 weeks will not have drug provided as clinical trial material. The individual components of the TBR will be recorded on the Concomitant ART Therap y (ConART) eCRF page. For subjects randomized to the TBR, provisions will be in place, as needed and after discussion with the study team, to assist patients in obtaining their TBR during the stud y. DTG + 3TC must be stored in a secure area under the appropriate phy sical conditions for the product. Access to and dispensing of the DTG + 3TC FDC will be limited to the investigator and autho rized site staff. Study treatment must be dispensed or administered only to subjects enrolled in the study and in accordance with the protocol. For further details on storage, access and administration of study treatments, refer to the S RM. Study Treat ment (Open Label Randomised Phase, Day 1 to Week 200) Product name: DTG + 3TC FDC Formulation description: Clinical Trial Material Dosage form: Tablet Unit dose strength(s)/Dosage level(s): 50mg/300mg Route of Administration: Oral Dosing instructions : Take one tablet daily. Physical description: White, oval, film -coated tablets with ‘SV 137’ debossed on one face. The tablets are packed in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with induction seals , 2gm desiccant, and child - resistant closures. Eac h 60mL bottle contains 30 tablets. 6.2. Protocol- Permitted Substitutions A switch from a PI boosted with RTV to the same PI boosted with cobicistat is allowed. A switch from a PI boosted with cobicistat to the same PI boosted with RTV is allowed. 6.3. Treatment A ssignment Informed consent must be obtained prior to an y study procedures, including an y screening assessment. Subjects will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the computer- generated randomization schedule. The central randomization schedule will be generated by Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) using a validated SAS developed program. 2019N409553_01"
49,page_49,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 50Randomization and study treatment assignment will be facilitated b y the interactive voice/web recognition system (IVRS/I WRS).Following confirmation of fulfilment of study entry criteria, study site personnel will be required to contact the IVRS/IWRS to register subjects. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to DTG + 3TC or to the continued TBR arm, in accordance with the computer generated rand omization schedule. Each subject will be assigned a unique identifier (designating the subject’s randomization code) and a unique treatment number which matches the randomized treatment assignment. Subjects who are randomly assigned into the trial and su bsequentl y withdrawn may not be rescreened. Once a randomisation number has been assigned it must not be re-assigned. 6.4. Planned Dose A djustments No dose adjustments are permitted in this study for DTG + 3TC or for TBR. 6.5. Blinding This will be an open -label study and therefore no blinding is required. No summaries of the study data according to actual randomized treatment groups will be available to sponsor staff prior to the planned Week 24 preliminary analysis. Public presentation of the Week 24 anal ysis will not be done prior to last subject’s week 48 visit. 6.6. Packaging and Labeling The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. 6.7. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability No special preparation of study treatment is required. Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and onl y authorized site staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure environmentally controlled and monitored (manual or autom ated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. The investigator, designated site staff, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study treatment accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e. receipt, reconciliation and final disposition records). Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in the Study Reference Manual (SRM) . Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study treatment is not expected to pose significant safet y risks to site staff. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational hazards and recommended handling pr ecautions either will be provided to the 2019N409553_01"

Study treatment accountability will be evaluated using pill counts of unused DTG + 3TC. This assessment will be conduc ted each time the subject receives a new (refill) supply of DTG + 3TC through the Withdrawal visit or study completion. Study treatment accountability records must be maintained throughout the course of the study. These data will be recorded in the subject’s CRF but will not be summarised for analysis purposes. 6.8. Compliance with Study Treatment A dministration When the individual dose for a subject is prepared from a bulk supply, the preparation of the dose will be confirmed by a second member of the study site staff. When subjects self- administer study treatment(s) at home , compliance with I P will be assessed through query ing the subject during the site visits and documented in the source documents and CRF. Treatment start and stop dates also will be record ed in the CRF. Additionally , a record of the number of DTG + 3TC tablets dispensed to and taken by each subject must be maintained and reconciled with study treatment and compliance records. 6.9. Treatment of Study Treatment Overdose For this open- label study , any tablet intake exceeding the randomized daily number of tablets for DTG + 3TC will be considered an overdose [ Dolutegravir Product Information, 2017; EpivirProduct Informa tion, 2017]. ViiV does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose of DTG + 3TC. As appropriate, the Investigator should use clinical judgment and also refer to the prescribing information for the individual drugs used in the TBR in treating overdos e in the TBR arm; ViiV are unable to recommend specific treatment. For the purposes of this study , an overdose is not an AE unless it is accompanied by a clinical manifestation associated with the overdose. If the clinical manifestation presents with serious criteria, the event is a SAE (see Section 7.4.1). If an overdose occurs and is associated with an adverse event requiring action, all study medications should be temporaril y discontinued until the adverse e vent resolves. In the event of an overdose the investigator or treating ph ysician should: contact the Medical Monitor immediately closely monitor the subject for adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) and laboratory abnormalities until DTG + 3T C can no longer be detected sy stemically (for at least 2 day s). obtain a plasma sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) anal ysis within 60 hours from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case -by-case basis) 2019N409553_01"
51,page_51,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 52document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the CRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical eva luation of the subject. 6.10. Treatment after the End of the Study The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the subject’s medical condition . At the end of the stud y at Week 200, subjects will transition to locally approved and available DTG + 3TC FDC and be managed as per standard of care at their stud y site. Prior to completion of the Week 200 visit, siteswill need to have confirmation that DTG + 3TC FDC is locall y available for study subjects. If DTG + 3TC FDC is not yetapproved and available locally , ViiV Healthcare will continue to provide study drug in a Continuation Phase until local availability . Assessments during the Continuation Phase are limited (see Time and Events schedule, Section 7.1). 6.11. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Subjects should be advised to notify their investigator of any current or proposed concomitant medication, whether prescribed or over- the-counter, because of the potential drug:drug interactions between such treatments and the study drugs. The investigator should evaluate an y potential drug:drug interactions at every visit, including reviewing the most current version of the U.S. or local prescribing information for DTG, 3TC and the subjects’ TBR, especially if any new concomitant medications are reported by subjects. All concomitant medications taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF. The minimum requirement is that the drug name, route, and the dates of administration are to be recorded. 6.11.1. Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Concomitant medications (prescription and non- prescription) should be prescribed b y the relevant health care provider/investigator and administered only as medically necessary during the Randomized and Continuation phases of the study (except prohibited medications described in Section 6.11.2). Chemoprophy laxis for HIV-associated conditions is encouraged, if appropriate, at the discretion o f the subject and their physician. All concomitant medications, blood products, and vaccines taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF with dates of administration. Because non- HIV vaccines may cause a temporary increase in the level of HIV -1 plasma RNA, it is highly recommended that a vaccine, if necessary , be given during or immediately after a scheduled visit after all laboratory tests have been drawn and only when scheduled visits are ≥4 weeks apart. This approach will minimize the risk of no n- specific increases in the level of HIV -1 plasma RNA at the next scheduled assessment. 2019N409553_01"
52,page_52,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 53DTG + 3TC should be administered 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking antacid or laxative products containing pol yvalent cations (e.g. aluminium and magnesium), sucralfate, or calcium supplements. Proton pump inhibitors and H2 -antagonists may be used in place of antacids with no scheduling restrictions. Concurrent administration with multivitamins is acceptable. Iron supplements can be taken with study treatment provided that all are taken together with a meal. Under fasted conditions, DTG +3TC should be given 2 hours prior to OR 6 hours after iron supplements. Metformin concentrations may be increased by DTG. A dose adjustment of metformin should be considered when starting and stopping co -administration of dolutegravir with metformin, to maintain gly cemic control.

The consent form must h ave been approved by the IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC). After signing an informed consent, subjects will complete Screening assessments to determine subject eligibility . Each subject being screened for enrollment evaluation will be assigned a sub ject number at the Screening visit. This number will be given sequentially in chronological order of subject presentation according to a numeric roster provided b y PPD. Medical/medication/family history will be assessed as related to the inclusion/exclusio n criteria listed in Section 5. If they are being utilised in the study , Patient Reported Outcomes questionnaires should be completed b y subjects before an y other assessment at a clinic visit, in the order spec ified. 7.2.1. Screening A ssessments Eligibility criteria must be assessed carefull y at the Screening visit. Physical examinations should be conducted as part of normal routine clinical care but will not be collected s ystematicall y in the eCRF. Cardiovascular me dical history /risk factors (as detailed in the CRF) will be assessed at Baseline and assessments will include height, weight, blood pressure, smoking status and history , pertinent medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus), and family history of premature cardiovascular disease. Background information to be collected at Screening includes demograph y (year of birth, sex, race and ethnicity ) and prior ART history . Eligible subjects may be randomly assigned immediately as soon as all Screening assessments are complete and the results are available and documented. All subjects will complete the Screening period of approximately 28 days prior to Baseline (Day 1) during which all clinical and laboratory assessments of eligibility must be performe d and reviewed. The Screening period of up to 28 day s is to accommodate availability of all Screening assessment results, completion of source document verification to satisfy the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria including the required previous HIV -1 RNA values, and scheduling. All Screening results mustbe available prior to randomization. All information about the subject’s current and any past regimen must be available for review by the Principal Investigator or designee prior to randomization . Source documents from other medical facilities must be located/received during the 28 day screening period and under no circumstances may the subject be randomized in the absence of source documentation, even if there are delays in receipt of this information. A subject may be re -screened if the source documentation is obtained after the screening window closes. Details regarding prior resistance data must be noted in the source documentation and eCRF. Resistance testing reports with genot ypic data mustbe provided to ViiV after screening and before randomization for review b y ViiV. Sites must wait for the study virologists to confirm the lack of exclusionary resistance mutations, which will be provided to the site before the screening window closes.

Details regarding baseline or prior resistance data must be noted in the source documentation. If a subject is identified as having b een mistakenly screened/randomized with exclusionary resistance, they will be withdrawn. Subjects with chronic active hepatitis B are excluded. Evidence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is based on the results of testing at Screening for Hepatitis B s urface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and HBV DNA. HBV DNA testing will only be performed for subjects with positive anti -HBc and negative HbsAg and negative anti- HBs (past and/or current evidence). All subjects will be screened for s yphilis at screening. Subjects with untreated sy philis infection, defined as a positive Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) without clear documentation of treatment, are excluded unless they complete treatment during the 28-day screening window and 7 day s prior to randomization. Subjects who complete treatment after the screening window closes may be rescreened. Subjects who meet all entry criteria are randomized and assigned a randomization number. Subjects not meeting al l inclusion and exclusion criteria at initial screen may be rescreened and receive a new subject number one time unless they were excluded for reason of having exclusionary historic genot ypic resistance or for a viral load ≥ 50c/mL at time of screening. S ubjects who are randomized into the trial and subsequently withdrawn from the study for an y reason may not be rescreened. 7.2.2. Baseline A ssessments At Day 1 and prior to randomization, any changes to the eligibility parameters must be assessed and an y results r equired prior to randomization (e.g., Day 1 urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential) must be available and reviewed. Other baseline information to be collected at Day 1 includes general medical history and current medical conditions. L aboratory and health outcomes assessments will also be assessed. Questionnaire/survey s are recommended to be administered at the beginning of the visit before an y other assessments are conducted. 7.3. Efficacy 7.3.1. Efficacy Evaluations Plasma HIV -1 RNA Plasma for qu antitative HIV -1 RNA will be collected according to the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). Methods to be used may include but are not limited to the Abbott Realtime HIV -1 Assay lower limit of quantitation 40 c/mL. In some cases (e.g., where the plasma HIV -1 RNA is below the lower limit of detection for a given assay ) additional exploratory methods may be used to further characterize plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels. 2019N409553_01"

Cardiovascular and Death Events For any CV events, whether or not they are considered SAEs, and all deaths, specific CV and Death sections of the CRF are required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding CV (including sudden cardiac death) and non -CV death. The CV CRFs a re presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms.The CV information should be recorded in the specific CV section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death CRF is provi ded immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 7.4.1.5. Disease- Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as S AEs The events or outcomes listed in the CDC Classification Sy stem for HIV- 1 Infections (Section13.7) will be recorded on the HIV -Associated Conditions eCRF page if they occur. However, these individual events or outcomes, as well as an y sign, sy mptom, diagnosis, illness, and/or clinical laboratory abnormality that can be linked to any of these events or outcomes are not reported to ViiV/GSK as AEs and SAEs even though such event or outcome may meet the definition of an AE or SAE, unless the following conditions apply : The investigator determines that the event or outcome qualifies as an SAE under part ‘f’ of the SAE definition (see Section 13.8.2), or The event or out come is in the investigator’s opinion of greater intensity , frequency or duration than expected for the individual subject, or 2019N409553_01"

Lymphomas and invasive cervical carcinomas are excluded from this exemption; they must be reported as SAEs even if they are considered to be HIV-related. 7.4.1.6. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to ViiV/GSK (or desig nee) of SAEs related to study treatment (even for non- interventional post -marketing studies) is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of subjects and the safety of a product under clinical investigation are met. ViiV has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. ViiV will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and investigators. Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and ViiV/GSK policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other specific safet y information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from ViiV/GSK (or designee) wi ll file it with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 7.4.2. Pregnancy Information on the occurrence of pregnancies in female subjects will be collected over the period starting at Screening and ending at the final Fo llow-up visit. Pregnancies that occur following the first dose of study drug will be reported to the Medical Monitor. Follow-up information will be collected for pregnancies occurring from Day 1 to the final Follow-up visit. Beginning after Week 96, if study visits are 24 weeksapart, participants who are women of child bearing potential must also do a home-based urine pregnancy testapproximately every 12 weeks between study visits at approximately Weeks 108, 132, 160 and 184. Site staff must contact th e participant s who are women of child bearing potential to remind them to complete the test and to verify and record pregnancy test results in the source documents. Site staff must complete the pregnancy status eCRF if a pregnancy occurs. If a pregnancy is reported then the investigator should inform ViiV/GSK within 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Section 13.3.2. Any female who becomes pregnant (intrauterine) whi le participating in this study must be withdrawn from the study and must discontinue study drug immediatel y. Any pregnancy that occurs during stud y participation must be reported using a clinical trial pregnancy form. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and child(ren). Pregnancy 2019N409553_01"
70,page_70,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 71complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous abortions must be reported as SAEs. Any SAE occurri ng in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the stud y and considered b y the investigator as possibly related to the study treatment must be reported promptly to ViiV/GSK (or designee). GSK’s ce ntral safet y department will forward this information to the ART Pregnancy Registry. The international registry is jointly sponsored by manufacturers or licensees of ARV products. Additional information and a list of participating manufacturers/licensees are available from http://www.apregistry .com/. 7.4.3. Physical Exams Physical exams should be conducted as part of normal routine clinical care but will not be collected s ystematicall y in the CRF. Abnormalities noted during an y exam must be recorded in the CRF (e.g. in the current medical conditions or AE logs). 7.4.4. Vital Signs At the Screening visit, vital signs will be measured in semi- supine position after 5 minutes rest and will include height, weight, sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure and Body Mass Index (BMI). Bod y weight and BMI will also be assessed at each visit according to the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). 7.4.5. Electrocardiogram (ECG) A baseline 12-lead ECG will be conducted at the Screening visit, for possible use as a reference during the study (i.e.; in evaluation of any pertinent cardiovascular event). 7.4.6. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments All protocol required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section 7.1, must be performed b y central laboratory services, with the exception of exceptional circumstances during screening noted in Section 5.3. Laboratory assessments must be conducted in accordance with the Cen tral Laboratory Manual, and Protocol Time and Events Schedule. Laboratory requisition forms must be completed and samples must be clearl y labelled with the subject number, protocol number, site/centre number, and visit date. Details for the preparation and shipment of samples will be provided b y the central laboratory and are detailed in the laboratory manual. Reference ranges for all safet y parameters will be provided to the site by the central laboratory . If additional non -protocol specified laboratory assessments are performed at the institution’s local laboratory and result in a change in subject management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g. AE, SAE or dose modification) the results must be recorded in the eCRF. Local laboratory services may be used to verify pending laboratory parameters only after consultation and agreement with the study team. Refer to the lab manual for appropriate processing and handling of samples to avoid duplicate and/or additional blood draws. Haematology , clinical chemistry , urinalysis and 2019N409553_01"

All laboratory tests with values that are considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study or within 5 day s after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline. If such values do not return to normal within a period judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. 7.4.7. Suicidal Risk Monitoring Subjects with HI V infection occasionall y may present with sy mptoms of depression and/or suicidality (suicidal ideation or behavior). In addition, there have been some reports of depression, suicidal ideation and behavior (particularl y in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or ps ychiatric illness) in some patients being treated with INIs, including DTG. Therefore, it is appropriate to monitor subjects for suicidal ity before and during treatment. Subjects should be monitored appropriatel y and observed closel y for suicidal ideation and behavior or an y other unusual changes in behavior. It is recommended that the investigator consider mental health consultation or re ferral for subjects who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior. Subjects presenting with new onset/treatment emergent depression should be advised to contact the investigator immediately if symptoms of severe acute depression (including suicidal ideation/attempts) develop, because medical intervention and discontinuation of the study medication may be required. Assessment of treatment -emergent suicidalit y will be monitored during this study using the electronic version of the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (eC -SSRS). The definitions of behavioral suicidal events used in this scale are based on those used in the Columbia Suicide History Form [ Posner, 2007]. Questions are asked on suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, and intensity of ideation. Day 1 (Baseline) visit questions will be in relation to lifetime experiences and current experiences (within the past 2 months); all subsequent questioning is in relation to the last assessment. The eC -SSRS is to be administered as a patient completed questionnaire specified in the Time and Events Table. The eC -SSRS will be conducted electronically by telephone or by computer/tablet connected to the internet. Additionally , the investigator will collect inform ation using the Possible Suicidality - Related AE (PSRAE) eCRF form in addition to the AE (non -serious or SAE) eCRF form on any subject that experiences a possible suicidality -related AE while participating in this study. This may include, but is not limite d to, an event that involves suicidal ideation, a preparatory act toward imminent suicidal behavior, a suicide attempt, or a completed suicide. The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an event is possibly suicide -related. PSRAE forms should 2019N409553_01"
74,page_74,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 75be completed and reported to ViiV/GSK within 1 week of the investigator diagnosing a possible suicidality -related AE. 7.5. Biomarkers Blood and urine are being collected to perform renal and bone biomarker assessments. I n addition to measurements of serum creatinine, estimated GFR, and urinary excretion of albumin, protein, creatinine and phosphate, additional renal biomarkers include: Renal biomarkers: Cystatin C (blood), Retinol Binding Protein (RBP, blood/urine) Beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M, blood/urine). Bone biomarkers: Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase Procollagen ty pe 1 N-propeptide Type 1 collagen cross -linked C-telopeptide Osteocalcin 25 hydroxy-Vitamin D Blood is being collected to perform assessments of insulinresistance , biomarkers of inflammation and telomere function. Inflammation biomarkers : Interleukin -6 (IL-6) High-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs -CRP) D-dimer Soluble CD14 (sCD14) Soluble CD163 (sCD163) Insulin, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR Telomere function: Whole blood will be used for measurement of telomere length. In a subset of sites, PBMCs will be collected, cry opreserved and stored for measurement of telomerase activity . Since the intention is to utilize these biomarkers for research pu rposes and the clinical significance of these results is uncertain, the Sponsor will not be reporting real time results of these assessments to the investigator except for C ystatin C (Day 1 only) and 25 hydroxy-vitamin D. 7.6. HIV-1 Poly merase Viral Genoty ping and Phenoty ping Whole venous blood samples will be obtained from each subject to provide plasma for storage samples according to the Time and Events Table (for potential viral genot ypic 2019N409553_01"
75,page_75,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 76and phenot ypic analyses). Subjects meeting CVW criteria will have pla sma samples tested for HIV -1 PRO and RT genotype and phenoty pe and HIV -1 integrase genot ype and phenot ype from samples collected at the time of meeting SVW criteria; these results will be reported to the investigator as soon as available to provide guidanc e for election of an alternative regimen Details concerning the handling, labeling and shipping of these samples will be supplied separately . Genotypic and phenotypic anal yses may be carried out by Monogram Biosciences using, but not limited to, their Sta ndard PhenoSense and GenoSure testing methods for PRO, RT, and integrase assay s. A secondary endpoint of the study will be the incidence of observed genoty pic and phenotypic resistance to DTG or 3TC and to current ART for subjects meeting Virologic Withdrawal criteria. The virologic endpoint may also be assessed based on third- agent class. 7.6.1. HIV-1 Exploratory Analysis After meeting virologic withdrawal criteria, additional anal yses for HIV -1 resistance may, for example, be carried out on peripheral blood mono nuclear cell (PBMC/whole blood) samples collected at Baseline and/or on stored plasma samples from other relevant time points. These anal yses may include but are not limited to additional viral genotyping and/or phenoty ping, as well as other virologic eva luations such as linkage and minority species anal yses, low level HIV -1RNA quantitation and measurement of viral replicative capacity . HIV-1 PRO and RT genotype and phenotype and HIV -1 integrase genotype and phenot ype will also be determined on the last on-treatment isolates from subjects who have HIV -1 RNA 400 c/mL regardless of confirmatory HIV-1 RNA. 7.7. Value Evidence and Outcomes Health outcomes assessments will be conducted according to the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). Assessments are recommended to be administered at the beginning of the visit prior to collection of blood for anal ysis and other scheduled assessments. Questionnaires will be administered on paper except the willingness to switch surv ey, which will be a verbal question. The following 2 health outcomes assessments will be utilized in this study : To assess the reason(s) for their participation and facilitate an understanding of subject’s willingness to switch, subjects will be asked a single item question prior to randomization. The European Qualit y of Life-5 Dimensions -5 Levels (EQ-5D- 5L), developed by EuroQol group, is a standardized, generic questionnaire that provides a profile of patient function and a global health state rating. T he five-item measure has one question assessing each of five dimensions: mobility , self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety /depression and 5 levels for each dimension including no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe proble ms and extreme problems. The EQ -5D-5L also includes a visual analog scale (VAS) that assesses overall health [ Herdman, 2011]. 2019N409553_01"

77,page_77,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 789. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND DA TA ANALYSES 9.1. Hypotheses This study is designed to s how that the antiviral effect of switching to a simplified two- drug regimen of DTG + 3TC once -daily is not inferior to continuation of their TBR at week 48 in HIV -1 infected ART -experienced subjects. Non-inferiority can be concluded if the upper bound of a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in virologic failure rates between the two treatment arms is smaller than 4%. If r d is the virologic failure rate on DTG + 3TC and r f is the virologic failure rate on the current ART regimen, then the h ypotheses can be written as follows: H0: rd– rf ≥ 4% H 1: rd– rf< 4% 9.2. Sample Size Considerations 9.2.1. Sample Size A ssumptions Assuming a true 2% virologic failure rate in each arm, a non- inferiority margin of 4%, and a 2.5% one- sided significance level, this study requires 275 subjects per treatment arm. This would provide 92% power to show non -inferiority for the proportion of subjects with virologic failure according to the FDA snapshot algorithm at 48 weeks post -switch. If we observed a 2% virologic failure rate for the non -switch subjec ts then non -inferiority would be declared if the observed treatment difference was less than or equal to 1.3 percentage points. While the targeted study size was 550 randomised subjects (from a target of 800 screened subjects), the study was over -enrolled based on an unexpected surge in recruitment in the last week of screening , resulting in a total of 743 subjects randomized. This final sample size will provide 97.3 % power to show non- inferiority with the current assumptions, and non- inferiority can be de clared if the actual observed treatment difference in the trial is less than or equal to 1.6%. 9.2.1.1. Rationale for non -inferiority margin According to the FDA’s 2015 guidance document (Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Infection: Development of ART Drugs for Treat ment, November 2015), the margin for switch trials is driven by the largest clinicall y tolerable virologic failure rate. Per the FDA document, ty pical rates of virological failure seen in switch studies range from 1 to 3 percent and a margin of 4% for viro logic failure rate is considered tolerable. Assuming 2% virologic failure rate in both treatment arms, a 4% non- inferiority margin is considered comparable to a 10% to 12% non -inferiority margin using response rate as 2019N409553_01"
78,page_78,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 79endpoint. A margin of 4% was therefore chosen for the present study assuming 2% failure rate in both arms [ CDER, 2015]. 9.2.1.2. Response and Virologic Failure rate assumptions Table 2shows Snapshot response (HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL) rates and Snapshot virologic failure (HIV -1 RNA ≥50 c/mL ) rates in previous switch studies in HIV-1 infected ART- experienced subjects. Taken together, these data suggest that a reasonable assumption for the true failure rate for the current ART control arm and the switch arm is 2%.

Data Analysis Considerations The following populations will be assessed (the analy sis population for genoty pic and phenotypic analyses will be fully described in the reporting and anal ysis plan [RAP] ): 9.3.1. Analysis Populations 9.3.1.1. Intent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT -E) Population This population will consist of all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication. Subjects will be assessed according to their randomized treatment, regardless of t he treatment they receive. Unless stated otherwise, the ITT -E Population will be used for efficacy analyses. 9.3.1.2. Per Protocol (PP) Population This population will consist of subjects in the I TT-E Population with the exception of significant protocol violators: e.g., violations which could affect the assessment of antiviral activity .The PP population will be used for sensitivity anal yses of the primary efficacymeasure. 2019N409553_01"
80,page_80,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 819.3.1.3. Safety Population The Safet y Population is defined as all subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication. Subjects will be anal yzed according to the actual treatments received. Unless otherwise stated, the Safety Population will be used for safety analyses. 9.3.2. Analysis Data Sets The primary analysis set of data is based on virologic fail ure defined b y the FDA snapshot algorithm. With the exception below, virologic failure includes subjects who changed an y component of background therap y to a new drug class, changed background components that were not permitted per protocol, or changed any background drug in the regimen because of lack of efficacy (perceived or documented) before Week 48; patients who discontinued study drug or study before Week 48 for lack or loss of efficacy and patients who are equal to or above 50 c/mL in the 48 -week window. A secondary analysis set of data is based on subjects’ responses at <50 c/mL calculated according to the FDA snapshot algorithm. This algorithm treats all subjects without HI V- 1 RNA data at the visit of interest (due to missing data or discontinuati on of IP prior to visit window) as non- responders, as well as subjects who switch their concomitant ART prior to the visit of interest, since no switches (with the exception below) are allowed in the protocol . Note: A switch from a PI boosted with ritona vir to the same PI boosted with cobicistat (and vice versa) is permitted per protocol and will not be considered as a change in background ART hence, will not incur a penalt y in the Snapshot algorithm, regardless of reason or date of switch, as these agents are expected to have similar boosting effect and no impact on overall efficacy of the regimen. Otherwise, virologic success or failure will be determined b y the last available HIV -1 RNA assessment while the subject is on- treatment within the visit of interest window (to be specified in the RAP). Full details of this snapshot algorithm will be contained in the RAP. Another secondary set of data will treat subjects as censored if they discontinue for reasons other than those related to treatment (AEs, t olerability and lack of efficacy ). This data set will be the Treatment Related Discontinuation = Failure (TRDF) data set. The observed case (OC) dataset, which uses onl y data that are available at a particular time point with no imputation for missing val ues, will be the primary dataset for assessing safet y and will also be used for some analyses of efficacy and health outcomes. Further details will be provided in the RAP. 9.3.3. Treatment Comparisons 9.3.3.1. Primary Comparison of Interest The primary analysis will be based on the ITT -E population using the Snapshot virologic failure dataset. The primary comparison will be made at a one -sided 2.5% level of 2019N409553_01"
81,page_81,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 82significance. Treatment with DTG + 3TC will be declared non- inferior to the TBR if the upper bound of a two -sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two groups in virologic failure rates at Week 48 lies below 4%. 9.3.3.2. Other Comparisons of Interest The analysis described above will also be performed using the PP population and the results will be compare d for consistency with the results from the ITT- E population. I f both analy ses show non -inferiority then the h ypothesis that the antiviral effect of treatment with DTG + 3TC is superior to the TBR treatment will be tested using the same level of significan ce as for the tests of non -inferiority . Superiorit y will be declared if the upper bound of the confidence internal is below 0%. The following key secondary comparison will be tested: Non-inferiority of switching to DTG + 3TC compared to continuation of TBR with respect to virologic success endpoint as per FDA snapshot category using a -8% non- inferiority margin. No multiplicity adjustments for statistical testing of secondary endpoints will be performed; however all tests will be pre -specified in the RAP . 9.3.4. Interim A nalysis One analysis will be conducted to evaluate the primary objective of the protocol when all subjects have completed their Week 48 visit. An interim anal ysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed their Week 24 visit. To minim ise bias, the Week 24 results will not be shared with subjects and investigators, or presented externally until after the last subject completes their last visit for the primary Week 48 analy sis. Week 96, Week 144 and Week 196 data cuts and anal yses willbe conducted. Further data cuts and anal yses may be conducted as necessary to support regulatory submissions and publications. The Week 48 analy sis will be primary . No adjustment for multiplicity will be made as the Week 24 anal yses will be secondary , and other anal yses are secondary /exploratory and will occur after the primary endpoint anal ysisat Week 48 . An IDMC will be instituted to ensure external objective medical and/or statistical review of efficacy and safety in order to protect the ethical inter ests and well -being of subjects and to protect the scientific validity of the stud y. An ad-hoc review of data by the IDMC will be triggered whenever the number of CVWs in the DTG + 3TC arm exceeds thresholds pre -specified in the IDMC charter.

Efficacy Analyses For the primary comparison, adjusted estimates of the difference in the rate of virologic failures between the two arms will be presented along with CIs based on a stratified analysis using Cochran- Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) weights. All CIs will be two -sided. For the statistical analy sis, three strata (subgroups) will be formed according to the combinations of levels of th e following categorical variables: Baseline third agent: PI Baseline third agent: INI Baseline third agent: NNRTI The CMH estimate of the common difference in rates across strata will be calculated as the weighted average of the strata- specific estimates of the difference in response rates between the two arms as follows: If nkis the number of DTG +3TC treated subjects, m kis the number of I NI-, NNTRI-, or PI-based ART treated subjects, and N k = nk+ mkis the total number of subjects in the kth stratum,then the CMH estimate is given b y Where are CMH weights and are estimates of the differences in response rates between the two treatment arms, r d – rf, for the kthstrata. The corresponding two -sided 95% CI will be calculated as using the var iance estimator given by [Sato, 1989], which is consistent in both sparse data and large strata.

Rationale for Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Preliminary results of the pivotal bioequivalence study (204994) showed that when administered in the fasted state, the bilay er tablet demonstrated bioequivalence t o the single entit y tablets for dolutegravir AUC(0 -∞) & Cmax and lamivudine AUC(0- ). However, the bilay er tablet showed a modest increase in lamivudine Cmax compared to the single entit y tablet, which is not considered to be clinically significant. PK of the FDC components will be evaluated using a combination o f intensive and sparse sampling. 11.1.1. Exploratory Objectives To assess the stead y-state DTG and 3TC exposure in HIV -1 infected patients. To characterize the DTG and 3TC stead y-state PK of the DTG/3TC F DC in HIV - 1 infected patients. 11.1.2. Exploratory Endpoints Steady state plasma PK parameters of DTG and 3TC will be assessed using intensive PK collected at week 4. Population estimates of PK parameters (e.g. apparent clearance [CL /F], apparent volume of distribution [V/F]) using DTG and 3TC intensive and sparse plasma concentrations at Weeks, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 . 11.1.3. Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection For each timepoint two separate blood samples will be collected into di -potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic ac id (K2EDTA) tubes. Table 3and Table 4listthe sampling schedule to be followed for the assessment of intensive and sparse PK , respectivel y.The sub-set of subjects undergoing intensive PK sampling at selected sites will not undergo Sparse PK sampling at Week4, however, these subjects will undergo Sparse PK sampling at other PK visits (Table 3and Table 4).

Pre-dose samples will be collected 20 -28 hours after the prior dose AND approximately 15 minutes before the morning dose which will be taken under observation at the clinic. b. Both sample timepoints must be obtained from each subject c. The 1 to 4 hours sample may be drawn any time between 1 –4 hours post -dose d. The 4 to 12 hours sample may be drawn any time between 4 –12 hours post- dose e. All subjects are expected to participate in sparse PK To allow flexibility in scheduling PK drawswhile maintaining quality and accuracy , the week 8 and week 12 samples can be drawn interchangeabl y (i.e. 1 to 4 hours post- dose drawn at week 12 and the 4 to 12 hours post-dose drawn at week 8) as long as both the 1 to 4 hours post- dose and 4 to 12 hours post -dose samples are obtained for each sub ject.In addition, flexibility is allowed in collecting the post -dose sample an ywhere from 1 to 4 hours and 4 to 12 hours so that a range of sample time can be obtained. To achieve this, the subject may choose to remain in clinic until at least 1 hour after taking the DTG dose and may choose to return to the clinic 4 to 12 hours after taking the medication. It is important to collect PK samples according to the following procedures: To enhance the qualit y of the data, subjects undergoing intensive and/or sparse PK assessments will be asked to complete a diary card with the following information which will be included in eCRF: oThe date and time of the DTG/3TC FDC administration for 3 day s prior to the scheduled PK clinic visit; oWhether or not the doses were t aken with a meal oWhether or not the subject vomited within 4 hours of taking the stud y drug In addition the following informa tion should be recorded in the eCRF: oThe actual date and time of the observed dose taken at the clinic visit; oThe actual date andtime of the PK samples collected For the 3 day s in advance of a PK clinic visit, the subject must be instructed to take the DTG/3TC FDC without regard to food at a time that corresponds with the 2019N409553_01"
91,page_91,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 92scheduled PK visit time to allow for a pre- dose sample collec tion as close to 24 hour after the previous dose. On the day sof theeither intensive PK or sparse pre-dose sample collection , the subjects should not take a dose of the DTG/3TC FDC until instructed at the clinic visit. The subjects participating in intensive PK sampling will be requested to present at the clinic fasted for at least 8 hours at the week 4 visit . Thesesubjects should returnto the clinic next day for the 24 hour spost-dose sample collection, prior to taking a DTG/3TC FDC dose. The 24 hour spost-dose sample may be collected without regard to food. The sparse PK samples will be collected without regard to food (however the fed/fasted status information will be collected and recorded on the eCRF) Note: If a subject presents at the clinic for pre-dose PK sample collection having already taken the dail y dose or having missed doses within the previous 3 days, it is recommended to reschedule PK sampling as earl y as possible within the defined PK visit window. I t is recommended not to collect PK sa mples if date and time of dosing for the previous 3 day s cannot reliably be confirmed. If PK cannot be rescheduled within the pre-defined visit of interest window(specified in the study procedure manual ), no PK sample is to be collected for that visit. 11.1.4. Bioanalysis of DTG and3TC Samples The bioanal ysis of plasma DTG and 3TC samples will be performed by PPD using GSK validated L C/MS/MS assay . 11.1.5. Pharmacokinetic Population s Sparse PK population is defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of DTG/3TC FDC and have evaluable sparse samples with drug concentrations reported. Intensive PK population is defined as the subset of subjects enrolled into intensive PK sampling, who received at least 1 dose of DTG/3TC FDC and have evaluable drug concentrations r eported. The defining of evaluable drug concentrations and further details on the PK populations will be described in the RAP. 11.1.6. Pharmacokinetic Analyses The following intensive PK parameters will be summarized for 3TC and DTG: maximum observed plasma conce ntration (Cmax); time to maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax); observed plasma concentration at the end of a dosing interval (Ctau); observed pre-dose plasma concentration (C0); area under the concentration -time curve in one dosing interval (AUC(0 -)). 2019N409553_01"

Appendix 2: Toxicity Management Adverse events that occur during the trial should be evaluated b y the investigator and graded according to the DAIDS toxicity scales (see Section 13.9). Additional information regarding detecting, documenting and reporting AEs and SAEs are available in Section 7.4. Study drug may be interrupted at the discretion of th e investigator and according to the severity of the AE. If one or more ART medication is held due to toxicity or AEs, all ART medications should be held to reduce the risk of development of resistance taking into account the length of the planned interrupt ions and the PK half -life of each ART of the regimen, in order to minimize the risk of development of resistance. No toxicity -related dose reductions of study drugs will be allowed. Study drugs should be restarted as soon as medicall y appropriate; in gene ral, this should be no longer than 4 weeks after interruption (unless Grade 3 or 4 toxicities persist). Decisions regarding sequential reintroduction of study drugs or temporary interruption of one but not all drugs within the ART regimen should be made w ith the understanding that these changes may result in incomplete viral suppression and selection of resistant virus. Guidance is provided below on subject management and study drug interruptions based on the severity of the AE for specific toxicities. A ll changes in stud y drug must be accuratel y recorded in the subject’s eCRF. Grade 1 or Grade 2 Toxicity/Adverse Event Subjects who develop a Grade 1 or Grade 2 AE or toxicity may continue study treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects who choose to withdraw from the study due to a Grade 1 or 2 AE should have study withdrawal and follow -up evaluations completed. Grade 3 Toxicity/Adverse Event Subjects who develop a Grade 3 AE or toxicity should be managed as follows: If the investigator ha s compelling evidence that the Grade 3 AE or toxicity has not been caused by study treatment, dosing may continue after discussion with the medical monitor. Subjects who develop a Grade 3 AE or toxicity that the investigator considers related or possibly related to the study drugs should have study treatment withheld and be rechecked each week until the AE returns to Grade 2. Once the AE is Grade ≤2, study treatment may be restarted. Should the same Grade 3 AE recur within 28 day s in the same subject, study treatment should be permanentl y discontinued and the subject withdrawn from study . Subjects experiencing Grade 3 AEs requiring permanent discontinuation of study treatment should be followed weekl y until resolution of the AE and have withdrawal study evaluations completed. A Follow -up visit should be perf ormed 4 weeks after the last dose of study drugs. 2019N409553_01"
102,page_102,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 103Subjects with asy mptomatic Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities should be investigated for all potential non -drug related causes, and, following discussion with the medical monitor, may continue study drug if the investigator has compelling evidence that the toxicity is not related to study treatment. Exceptions are noted for lipid abnormalities in Section 13.2.1.7and rash in Section 13.2.1.6. Grade 4 Toxicity/Adverse Event Subjects who develop a Grade 4 AE or toxicity should have study treatment discontinued. However, if the investigator has compelling evidence that the AE is not causally related to the study drugs, dosin g may continue after discussion with and assent from the medical monitor. Subjects should be rechecked each week until the AE returns to Grade 2. Subjects experiencing Grade 4 AEs requiring permanent discontinuation of study treatment should be followed w eekly until resolution of the AE and encouraged to complete the withdrawal and follow- up study evaluations as noted above. Subjects with asy mptomatic Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities should be investigated for all potential non -drug related causes, and, fo llowing discussion with the medical monitor, may continue therap y if the investigator has compelling evidence that the toxicity is not related to stud y treatment. Exceptions are noted for lipid abnormalities in Section 13.2.1.7. An in-clinic Follow -Up visit will be conducted approximately 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication for subjects with ongoing AEs, and SAEs and also any laboratory abnormalities that are considered to be AEs or potentially harmful to the subject, at the last on -study visit. 13.2.1. Specific Toxicities/Adverse Event Management General guidelines for the management of specific toxicities that are considered to be related or possibl y related to study treatment are provided below. Subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment for reasons of toxicity should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE and encouraged to complete the withdrawal and Follow -up study evaluations (see Section 5.4). 13.2.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping and Follo w-up Criteria Liver chemistry threshold stopping criteria have been designed to assure subject safet y and to evaluate liver event aetiology during administration of study drug and the follow - up period.

Decline in Renal Function Subjects who experience an increase in serum creatinine from Baseline of 45 micromoles/liter ( Mol/L) (or 0.5 milligrams/deciliter [mg/dL ]) should return for a confirmatory assessment within 2 to 4 weeks. A urinaly sis, urine albumin/creatinine and urine total protein/albumin ratios, serum cy statin C and an estimated GFR using the CKD-EPI (cystatin C) [ Inker, 2012] should also be done at this confi rmatory visit. If the creatinine increase is confirmed, the investigator should contact the study medical monitor to discuss additional follow-up and medical management. Subjects who experience progression to an estimated GFR (using the CKD -EPI- creatinine ) of < 30 mL/min/1.73m2must return for a confirmatory assessment within 2 weeks [Levey, 2009]. A urinaly sis, urine albumin/creatinine and urine protein/creatinine ratios, serum cy statin C and an estimated GFR using the CKD -EPI (cystatin C) [ Inker, 2012] should be done at this confirmatory visit. If an estimated GFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73m2is confirmed using the CKD -EPI (cystatin C), then study treatment should be discontinued and the subject withdrawn from the study (as dose adjustment is needed for NRTIs, which is not possible in a study of a fixed -dose combination tablet). 13.2.1.4. Proteinuria Subjects with an abnormal urine albumin/creatinine ratio (>0.3 mg/mg, >300 mg/g, or >34 mg/mmol) that represents a change from Baseline and no associated increase in creatinine, should have a repeat spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio and protein/creatinine ratio performed within 2 -4 weeks. If confirmed, then consideration should be given to additional evaluation after consultation with the study medical monitor. Additional evaluation may include a 24- hour urine protein and creatinine measurement and nephrology referral. Subjects with an abnormal urine albumin/creatinine ratio (>0.3 mg/mg, 300 mg/g, or >34 mg/mmol and representing a change from Baseline) and a serum creatinine increase >45 μmol/L (or 0.5 mg/dL) should have confirmation of both results within 2 weeks. If confirmed, the stud y medical monitor should be contacted immediatel y. Agreement o n further management should be agreed between the investigator and medical monitor. 13.2.1.5. Allergic reaction Subjects may continue study drug for Grade 1 or 2 allergic reactions at the discretion of the Investigator. The subject should be advised to contact the Investigator immediately if there is an y worsening of sy mptoms or if further systemic signs or s ymptoms develop. Antihistamines, corticosteroids, or antipruritic agents may be prescribed. Subjects with Grade ≥3 allergic reactions that are considered to be possibl y or probabl y related to the stud y drug should permanentl y discontinue study treatment and the subject should be withdrawn from the study . Subjects should be treated as clinically appropriate and followed until resolution of the AE. 2019N409553_01"

Episodes generally occur within the first ten weeks of treatment, rarel y require interruptions or discontinuations of t herapy and tend to resolve within two to three weeks. No instances of serious skin reaction, including SJS, TEN and ery thema multiforme, have been reported for DTG in clinical trials. For further characterisation of HSR and rash observed with DTG -containing ART, please see the most current version of the DTG IB and any IB supplements [GSK Document Number RM2007/00683/11 , GSK Document Number 2017N352880_00, GSK Document Number 2017N352880_01]. Subjects with an isolated Grade 1 rash may continue study drug at the Investigator’s discretion. The subject should be advised to contact the Investigator immediately if there is any worsening of the rash, i f any systemic signs or sy mptoms appear, or if mucosal involvement develops. Subjects may continue study drug for an isolated Grade 2 rash. However, study drug (and all other concurrent medication(s) suspected in the I nvestigators causality assessment) should be permanently discontinued for any Grade ≥2 rash that is associated with an increase in ALT. The subject should be advised to contact the ph ysician immediately if rash fails to resolve (after more than two weeks), if there is any worsening of the rash, if any systemic signs or allergic s ymptoms develop, or if mucosal involvement develops. Subjects should permanently discontinue study drug [and all other concurrent medication(s) suspected in the I nvestigators causali ty assessment] for an isolated Grad e 3 or 4 rash, except where the aetiology of the rash has been definitively diagnosed as NOT attributable to study drug (see below), and the subject should be withdrawn from the study. Subjects should be treated as clinicall y appropriate and followed unti l resolution of the AE. Every effort should be made to collect as much information as possible about the evolution of the event and an y relationship with potentially related medical events (e.g., viral infection) or start of concomitant medication. The rash and any associated sy mptoms should be reported as adverse events and appropriate toxicity ratings should be used to grade the events (based on DAIDS toxicity gradings, Section 13.9. However, if the aetiology of the rash has been definitively diagnosed as being unrelated to study drug and due to a specific medical event or a concomitant infection or a concomitant non -study medication, routine management should be performed and documentation of the diagnosis pro vided. In this situation, the study drug should be continued. 13.2.1.7. Hypertrigly ceridemia/Hypercholesterolemia Samples for lipid measurements must be obtained in a fasted state according to the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1).

Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation A Grade 3 or higher elevation in CPK should result in a repeat assessment within 2 to 4 weeks to ensure the result is transient or due to exercise and will not require a change in study treatment. A history regarding use of drugs known to cause increase of CPK (such as statins), phy sical activity or exercise preceding the CPK evaluation should be obtained. Grade 4 elevations in CPK should have a repeat assessment after the subject has abstained from exercise for >24 hours. For persistent Grade 4 CPK elevations that are considered possibl y or probably related to the study drugs, stud y treatmen t should be discontinued and the subject withdrawn from the study .

Definition of A dverse Events Adverse Event Definition: An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to t he medicinal product. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an yunfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Events meeting AE defin ition include: Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed af ter study treatment administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study . Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae). ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT meeting definition of an AE include: Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subje ct’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 2019N409553_01"
119,page_119,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 120condition. Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 13.8.2. Definition of Serious A dverse Events If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the dis ease under study , death due to progression of disease, etc). Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a)Results in death b)Is life-threatening NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious ' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypotheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c)Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitaliza tion NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or out -patientsetting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfillsany other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d)Results in disability/incapacity NOTE: The term disability means a substantial di sruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 2019N409553_01"
120,page_120,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 121and accidental trauma (e .g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption e)Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f)Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether report ing is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse g)Is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function defined as: ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin*2xULN (>35% direct), or ALT 3xULN and INR**> 1.5. * Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available; if unavailable, measure urinary bilirubin via dipstick. I f fractionation is unavailable and ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin  2xULN, then the event is still to be reported as an SAE. ** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply to subjects receiving anticoagulants. If INR measurement is obtained, the value is to be recorded on the SAE form. 13.8.3. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrhythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascula r events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization 2019N409553_01"
121,page_121,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 12213.8.4. Sentinel Events Sentinel Event Definition: A sentinel event is a ViiV/GSK - defined SAE that is not necessaril y drug-related but has been associated historically with adverse reactions for other drugs and is therefore worthy of heightened pharmacovigilance. Medical monitor review of all SAEs for possible sentinel events is mandated at ViiV/GSK. The medical monitor ma y request additional clinical information on an urgent basis if a possible sentinel event is identified on SAE review. The current ViiV/GSK -defined sentinel events are listed below: Acquired Long QT Sy ndrome Agranulocy tosis/Severe neutropenia Anaphylaxis and anaph ylactoid reactions Hepatotoxicity Acute renal failure Seizure Stevens Johnson Sy ndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrol ysis (TEN) 13.8.5. Recording of A Es and SA Es AEs and SAE Recording: When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigat or to review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in the CRF It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to ViiV/GSK in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y ViiV/GSK. I n this instance, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to ViiV/GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis will be documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms. 2019N409553_01"
122,page_122,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 12313.8.6. Evaluating AEs and SA Es Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y andwill assign it to one of the categories in the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severit y of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (“DAIDS AE Grading Table”) in Section 13.9: Grade1 / Mild Grade 2 / Moderate Grade 3 / Severe Grade 4 / Potentially life threatening Grade 5 / Death An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre -defined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obliga ted to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. A “reasonable possibility” is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underly ing diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE the investigator mustdocument in the m edical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to ViiV/GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the initial transmission of the SAE data to ViiV/GSK. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SA E data collection tool accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. 2019N409553_01"
123,page_123,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 124Follow-up of AEs and SA Es The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested by ViiV/GSK to elucidate as full y as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obligated to assist. This may include additional laboratory tests or investiga tions, histopathological examinations or consultation with other health care professionals. If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the investigator will provide ViiV/GSK with a cop y of any post-mortem findings, including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to ViiV/GSK within the designated reporting time frames. 13.8.7. Reporting of SA Es and other events t o ViiV/GSK/PPD Reporting of SAEs and other events to ViiV/GSK/PPD Primary mechanism for reporting SAEs to ViiV/GSK/PPD will be the electronic data collection tool If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for greater than 24 hours, the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool and scan and email it to the Medical Monitor. Site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic s ystem as soon as it becomes available. The investigator will be required to confirm review of the SAE causality byticking the ‘reviewed’ box at the bottom of the eCRF page within 72 hours of submission of the SAE. After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to exi sting data If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study subject or receives updated data on a previousl y reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off-line, the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or to the Medical Monitor by telephone. Contacts for SAE receipt can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page. 2019N409553_01"

In this case, the local lab results must be reviewed by the Medical Monitor (Section 5.3). Based on prior experience with studies in similar regions, ViiV Healthcare will allow this exception for study feasibility purposes. This same change was made to the Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments text (Section 7.4.6). The blinding section was updated to reflect the open- label design of the study (Section 6.5). Prior text had conflicting language indicating that some aspects of the study were blinded.

Previous text: Assuming a true 3% virologic failure rate in each arm, a non- inferiority margin of 4%, and a 2.5% one-sided significance level, this study requires 383subjects per treatment arm. This would provide 9 0% power to show non- inferiority for the proportion of subjects with virologic failure according to the FDA snapshot algorithm at 48 weeks post -switch. If we observed a 3% virologic failure rate for the non- switch subjects then non -inferiority would be declared if the observed treatment difference was less than 1.4 percentage points. 9.2.1.1.

175,page_175,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 176According to the FDA’s 2015 guidance document (Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Infection: Development of ART Drugs for Treatment, November 2015), the margin for switch trials is driven by the largest clinicall y tolerable virologic failure rate. Per the FDA document, ty pical rates of virological failure seen in switch studies range f rom 1 to 3 percent and a margin of 4% for virologic failure rate is considered tolerable. Assuming 2% virologic failure rate in both treatment arms, a 4% non- inferiority margin is considered comparable to a 10% to 12% non -inferiority margin using response rate as endpoint. A margin of 4% was e chosen for the present study assuming 3 % failure rate in both arms, which is more stringent than assuming 2% failure rate in both arms [CDER, 2015]. 9.2.1.2.

This addition is based on Preliminary results of the pivotal bioequivalence stud y (204994) comparing the DTG/3TC FDC compared to the single entit y tablets. Deletion of the secondary objective and endpoint assessing the safet y and tolerability of DTG + 3TC once daily in those with creatinine clearance of between 30 – 49 mL/min/1.73m2compared to those with creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73m2because the exclusion criterion 18 has been updated to the higher threshold of creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73m2. Inclusion of additional biomarkers for collection and anal ysis. Change of exclusion criterion 18 to a threshold of creatinine clearan ce of ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73m2based on the approved 3TC prescribing information at the time of this amendment.The rational and corresponding references for lowering this threshold were deleted as no longer relevant. Correction of the Time and event table footn ote for plasma for storage samples to confirm the collection of these samples at the Screening visit; this was an error in the table. Correction of the rational for not making adjustment for multiplicity because o f an error in the original text . Because of the addition of the PK substudy as Section 11, prior Section numbers from number 11 have been update b y an increment of 1. For clarification purposes, the AE severit y gradings in Appendix 8, Section 13.8.6 (Evaluating AEs and SAEs) were updated to be consistent with Appendix 9, Section 13.9. (Division of AIDS table for Grading Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events).

Section 4.4 Design Justification: Previous text: This study also will evaluate the safet y and tolerability of this 2- drug regimen in persons with a creatinine clear ance of between 30 –49 mL/min/1.73m2. The DTG 50mg dose is approved for persons with a creatinine clearance of as low as 30 mL/min/1.73m2. 3TC plasma concentrations area under the curve (AUC) are increased in patients with moderate to severe renal impairm ent due to decreased clearance, and the current label recommends halving the dose to 150 mg once a day for a creatinine clearance of between 30 –49 mL/min/1.73m2. However, several randomized controlled studies that have compared a total 3TC daily dose of 600 mg/day to 300 mg/day showed only small, statistically non-significant differences between the treatment arms in the frequency of AEs, drug -related AEs, SAEs, Grade 3/4 clinical and laboratory toxicities and withdrawals due to AEs [Eron, 1995; GlaxoWell come Document Number UCR/95/003, 1995; GlaxoWellcome Document Number GIO/94/005 , 1995].

The DTG 50mg dose is approved for persons with a creatinine clearance of as low as 30 mL/min/1.73m2. 3TC plasma concentrations area under the curve (AUC) are increased in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment due to decreased clearance, and the current label recommends halving the dose to 150 mg once a day for a creatinine clearance of between 30 –49 mL/min/1.73m2. However, several randomized controlled studies that have compared a total 3TC daily dose of 600 mg/day to 300 mg/day showed only small, statistically non- significant differences between the treatment arms in the frequency of AEs, drug -related AEs, SAEs, Grade 3/4 clinical and laboratory toxicities and withdrawals due to AEs [Eron, 1995; GlaxoWellcome Document Number UCR/95/003, 1995; GlaxoWellcome, Document Number GIO/94/005, 1995 ].

Current text: Based on the preliminary results of the pivotal bioequivalence stu dy (204994), a bilayer tablet formulation with a core which utilizes the same formulation in the respective layers as the single entity tablets was selected. When administered in the fasted state, the bilayer tablet demonstrated bioequivalence to the sing le entity tablets for dolutegravir area under the curve zero to infinity (AUC(0- ∞)) & maximum concentration ( Cmax)and lamivudine AUC(0 -). However, the bilayer tablet showed a modest increase in lamivudine Cmax compared to the single entity tablet, which is not considered to be clinically significant. PK of the FDC components will be evaluated using a combination of intensive and sparse sampling.

The 4 to 12 hours sample may be drawn any time between 4 –12 hours post -dose e. All subjects ar e expected to participate in sparse PK To allow flexibility in scheduling PK draws while maintaining quality and accuracy, the week 8 and week 12 samples can be drawn interchangeably (i.e. 1 to 4 hours post-dose drawn at week 12 and the 4 to 12 hours post-dose drawn at week 8) as long as both the 1 to 4 hours post- dose and 4 to 12 hours post- dose samples are obtained for each subject. In addition, flexibility is allowed in collecting the post - dose sample anywhere from 1 to 4 hours and 4 to 12 hours so tha t a range of sample time can be obtained. To achieve this, the subject may choose to remain in clinic until at least 1 hour after taking the DTG dose and may choose to return to the clinic 4 to 12 hours after taking the medication. It is important to colle ct PK samples according to the following procedures: 2019N409553_01"
195,page_195,"2015N242992_06 CONFIDENTIA L 204862 196• To enhance the quality of the data, subjects undergoing intensive and/or sparse PK assessments will be asked to complete a diary card with the following information which will be included in eCRF: oThe date and time of the DTG/3TC FDC administration for 3 days prior to the scheduled PK clinic visit; o Whether or not the doses were taken with a meal oWhether or not the subject vomited within 4 hours of taking the study drug In addition the following i nformation should be recorded in the eCRF: oThe actual date and time of the observed dose taken at the clinic visit; oThe actual date and time of the PK samples collected • For the 3 days in advance of a PK clinic visit, the subject must be instructed totake the DTG/3TC FDC without regard to food at a time that corresponds with the scheduled PK visit time to allow for a pre -dose sample collection as close to 24 hour after the previous dose. •On the days of the either intensive PK or sparse pre -dose sam ple collection, the subjects should not take a dose of the DTG/3TC FDC until instructed at the clinic visit. • The subjects participating in intensive PK sampling will be requested to present at the clinic fasted for at least 8 hours at the week 4 visit. These subjects should return to the clinic next day for the 24 hours post -dose sample collection, prior to taking a DTG/3TC FDC dose. The 24 hours post- dose sample may be collected without regard to food. • The sparse PK samples will be collected without regard to food (however the fed/fasted status information will be collected and recorded on the eCRF) Note: If a subject presents at the clinic for pre -dose PK sample collection having already taken the daily dose or having missed doses within the previous 3 days, it is recommended to reschedule PK sampling as early as possible within the defined PK visit window. It is recommended not to collect PK samples if date and time of dosing for the previous 3 days cannot reliably be confirmed. If PK cannot be resch eduled within the pre -defined visit of interest window (specified in the study procedure manual), no PK sample is to be collected for that visit. 11.1.5.Bioanalysis of DTG and 3TC Samples The bioanalysis of plasma DTG and 3TC samples will be performed by PPD using GSK validated LC/MS/MS assay. 11.1.6.Pharmacokinetic Populations 2019N409553_01"

This study will also characterize the long -term antiviral activity , tolerabilit y and safet y of DTG + 3TC through Week 100. One of the potential risks of a 2 -drug regimen is the increase in virologic failure associated with the emergence of drug resistance. DTG, with its higher barrier to resistance, may reduce the risk of treatment -emergent resistance in patients taking a 2-drug regimen. The pivotal Phase 3 studies of DTG in naïve subjects have shown the absence of treatment-emergent INI or NRTI resistance mutations through 144+ weeks of treatment [Walmsley , 2013]. The absence of treatment emergent mutations to DTG or background agents in ART -naïve individuals, the potency of both DTG and 3TC, and the well-tolerated safet y profile of both drugs provides a strong rationale for the development of the DTG + 3TC STR as an important treatment option for patients.

Section 7.4.2 Pregnancy Added text: Beginning after Week 96, ifstudy visits are 24 weeks apart, the participants who are women of child bearing potential must also do a home -based urine pregnancy test approximately every 12 weeks between study v isits at approximately Weeks 108, 132, 160 and 184. Site staff must contact the participants who are women of child bearing potential to remind them to complete the test and to verify and record pregnancy test re sults in the source documents. Site staff m ust complete the pregnancy status eCRF if a pregnancy occurs.

Section 9.3.2 Analysis Data Sets Previous text: A secondary analysis set of data is based on subjects’ responses at <50 c/mL calculated according to a Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF) algorithm, as codified b ythe FDA ’ssnapshot algorithm. This algorithm treats all subjects without HIV-1 RNA data at the visit of interest (due to missing data or discontinuation of I P prior to visit window) as non- responders, as well as subjects who switch their concomitant ART prior to the visit of interest, since no switches (with the exception below) are allowed in the protocol .

Section 9.4.1 Efficacy Analyses Removed text: The weighted least squares chi -squared statistic [Fleiss, 1981] will be used to test for one -way homogeneity across the levels of each categorical variable, with each categorical variable considered separatel y. Following Lui and Kell y [Lui, 2000], ½ will be added to each cell in any strata for which the stratum -specific rate estimates of either rd or rf are zero, and tests will be one- sided. Any heterogeneity found to be statistically significant will be explored and if necessary results will be reported for each level of the categorical variable. Investigation of heterogeneity will be confined to the primary endpoint using the Week 48 Snapshot analy sis. Tests of homogeneity will be assessed at the one -sided 10% level of significance. Previous text: Further efficacy analyses to assess the sensitivity of the primary endpoint will be performed . Details of the sensitivity analyses will be included in the RAP and will includethe responder endpoint as per FDA snapshot category , ‘time to event’ methods which censor subjec ts who discontinue from the study with viral load <50 c/mL or for non-efficacy-treatment related reasons . In these analy ses, subjects will be considered to have had an event if they have a confirmed viral load ≥50 c/mL or discontinue for efficacy related reasons.

The proportion of subjects wi th Snapshot virologic failure and changes from baseline in CD4+ lymphocyte count will be summarized by subgroups (e.g., age, gender, race). Data gathered after subjects withdraw from IP will be listed but will not be included in summary tables. Data will be allocated to visit windows using actual visit dates rather than nominal visit numbers. Data collected from extra visits within a window will be listed and will be included in the derivation of the Snapshot response at analy sis visits of interest, but su mmary tables using OC datasets will only use the data captured closest to the target visit date. Detailed explanations of the derivation of visit windows will be included in the RAP. Any deviations from planned anal yses will be detailed in t he clinical stu dy report (CSR).
