The result from the final randomisation visit will be used as the baseline value. bVisits 1, 2, 3 and 5 are all clinical visits that are conducted at the study site, wh ile Visit 4 is conducted by telephone with the patient not at the study site. cPatients may withdraw from participating in the study, or they may discontinue taking study medication early but remain in th e study (ie, continue attending study visits and completing study assessments). As far as possible, all assessments planned for Visit 5 (Final visit) should be also performed at an Early Withdrawal Visit and at an Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit. At a minimum, safety assessments, PROs, and the 6MWT (if the patient is able) should be performed. Patients who discontinue treatment early but remain in the study may resume taking study medication again as so on as they are able to and wish to. An Unscheduled Visit may be performed at any time after randomisat ion, if required in the opinion of the Investigator, with the assessments required given in Section 8. dAll PROs will be administered using a site -based electronic tablet, except for the patient global impression of change in walking ability and the Borg CR10 Scale® score, which will both be administered on paper. To avoid bias in patient responses, all PRO questionnaires must be co mpleted prior to an y other study procedures, following informed consent, except for the Borg CR10 Scale® score, which forms part of the 6MWT. Patients w ill first complete the patient global impression of change in walking ability followed by the PROs on the site - based electr onic tablet, which should all be completed before the 6MWT. eThe 6MWT consists of a suite of assessments that are carried out before and after the 6MWT itself: seated pulse rate, blood p ressure, oxygen saturation and the Borg CR10 Scale® score for dyspnoea and fatigue. fThe 6MWD for each patient, determined from the 6MWT, will first be recorded on paper before being transferred to the eCRF by the Investigator or site staff later. gA number of measures have been introduced to minimise variability in patient per formance of the 6MWT. Prior to initiating testing, ever y effort should be made by the Investigator to establish that the patient is in their “usual” state of health: meaning that the patient has no c oncurrent medical issues (eg, upper respiratory tract inf ection, COPD/chronic heart failure exacerbation, exacerbation of musculoskeletal difficulties, etc) that might adversely affe ct his or her performance of the 6MWT. In the event that such conditions are present, the test should be aborted and rescheduled wi thin a 14 day window, to allow time for the resolution of the acute medical issue and the patient to return to his or her “usual” state of health."

Recent data from cardiovascular outcome studies of sodium-glucose co -transporter -2 inhibitors (empagliflo zin and canagliflo zin) and real world studies (including patients treated with dapagliflozin) indicate that treatment with sodium -glucose co -transporter -2 inhibitors can reduce the risk of cardio vascula r death and hospitalisat ion due to heart failure in patients with Type 2 di abetes m ellitus (T2DM) overall and in patients with T2DM and concomitant heart failure. Addit ional important endpoints in heart failure patients include assessment of change in heart failure symptoms, physical limitat ion, and exercise capacit y. This study will test whether dapagliflozin is superior to placebo for change in any o f the family of 3 primary endpo ints:Kansas Cit y Cardi omyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score (KCCQ -TSS); Kansas Cit y Cardio myopathy Questi onnai re Physical Limi tation Score (KCCQ -PLS) ;or, 6- minute wal k distance (6MWD) fro m baseline at Week 16, in patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class II- IV) and reduced left ventri cular ej ection fraction (≤40%), wi th or wi thout T2DM."

Data Monitoring Committee Due to the short duration of the study and the accumulated safet y profi le of dapagliflozin, a separate independent data monitoring co mmit tee will not be necessary to assess pati ent safet y during thi s study . However, to ensure the safet y of all patients parti cipat ing in AstraZeneca sponsored studies, reviews of all safet y information from all ongo ing clinical dapagliflozin studi es are conducted as they become available, with all reviewers blinded to the study treatm ents. Statistical methods The primary object ives of the study are to determine whether dapagliflozin is superior to placebo in reducing heart failure symptoms, reducing physical limitat ion,or improving exercise capacit y in pat ients with chronic heart failure. The study will randomise approximately 300 patients (approximately 150patients per treatment group). This s ample size est imate is based on the primary efficacy endpoints (change fro m baseline in KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ -PLS, and 6MWD at Week 16).

The intent -to-treat approach is employed to reflect the effect of the init ially assigned randomised study drug, i rrespect ive of exposure to study drug and concomitant treatment as well as subsequent treatment after discontinuat ion of study drug. A com posite variable strategy approach i s empl oyed to accoun t for deaths occurring during the fo llow-up peri od. The family of primary efficacy endpoints (KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ -PLS, and 6MWD) will be analysed based on a rank analysis of covariance model with rank -based change fro m baseline at Week 16 as the dependent variabl e. Rank -based baseline value will be included as a covari ate al ong wi th the stratificat ion factor used in the rando misat ion. Ti es will be assigned the mean of the corresponding ranks. In this analysis, data that are missing due to death will be ranked “wor se” than observed data and data missing for reasons other than death, and the ranking amongst the deceased pat ients will be based on the last value while alive. Missing data due to reasons other than death (eg, missing visit s, early wit hdrawal fro m the stu dy, including lost to fo llow-up) will be replaced by multiple imputation with predictive mean matching. Rank analysis of covariance will then be applied to each imputation dataset and resul ts will be pool ed across datasets. The m agnitude of treatm ent effec t in each of the KCCQ -TSS and KCCQ -PLS will also be presented as the number and percentage of patients by treatment group across the fo llowing categori es of change from baseline: Death Deteri oration from baseline (change fro m baseline ≤-5) Stabl e (-5< cha nge fro m baseline <5) Improvem ent (change from baseline ≥5) The m agnitude of treatm ent effect in 6 -minute walk distance will also be presented as the number and percentage of patients by treatment group across the fo llowing categories of change from basel ine: Death No im provement from baseline (change from baseline ≤0metres) Minimal improvement (0< change from baseline <30 metres) Improvem ent (change from baseline ≥30metres) Clinical meaningfulness has not been demonstrated for the pre -specified categor ies. Therefore, thresho lds for clinically meaningful wi thin-patient change for KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ- PLS, and 6MWD will be assessed using pre -specified methods described in the Statistical Analysis Plan and the derived thresho lds will be the main categories used to assess the magnitude of treatment effect."

Even wit h the best possible treatment, the five -year survival rate for HF patients is worse than for most cancers ( Braunwald 2015 ). Moreover, the prevalence o f chronic HF cont inues to increase globally. An estimated 38 millio n people are affected worldwide ( Braunwald 2015 ), with over 1 millio n hospi talisat ions annually in both the United States and Europe ( Ambrosy et al 2014 ). The annual global economic burden in 2012 was estimated to be $108 billio n (Cook et al 2014 ); this will increase dramat ically as the populat ion ages. HF is a complex syndro me caused by structural and/or funct ional abnormalit ies. It is characterised by dyspnoea, fat igue, and pulmo nary congestion and/or peripheral oedema due to fluid retention. Patients with signs and symptoms of HF are categori sed, based on measurement of left -ventri cular eject ion fraction (LVEF), as having HF wit h reduced LVEF (HFrEF) or HF with preserved LVEF (HFpEF); this study invest igates patients with the former. For the purposes of this study , HFrEF is defined as LVEF ≤40%. Risk of death for HFrEF patients is high ( Shah et al 2017 ). outcom e studi es have provided evidence for treatments for HFrEF that can improve symptoms and h aemodynamics as well as reduce hospitalisations for HF and mortalit y. These treatments include diuret ics, angiotensin convert ing enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin II receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid r eceptor antagonists, and beta -blockers ( Iwaz et al 2016). Recent data from cardio vascular outcome studies of sodium -glucose co -transporter - 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (empagl iflozin and canagliflozin) indicate that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalisat ion due to HF in patients with Type 2 di abetes m ellitus (T2DM) overall , and in pat ients with T2DM and conco mitant HF(Zinman et al 2015 ; Ferrei ra et al 2016 ; Fitchett et al 2016 ;Neal et al 2017 ; Rådho lm et al 2018). In thi s study , pati ents will be treated wi th the SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, or matching placebo and their changes in HF symptoms, physical limitation, and exercise capacit y over 16 weeks will be assessed. Patients’ HF symptoms and physical limitat ionwill be measured using the Kansas Cit y Cardi omyopathy Questi onnai re Total Symptom Score (KCCQ -TSS) and Kansas Cit y Cardi omyopathy Quest ionnaire Phy sical Limi tation Score (KCCQ -PLS) , respectively . Pati ents’ exercise capacit y will be m easured using the 6 -minute walk test (6MWT; the distance a patient can walk in a 6 -minute period, the 6MWD). The 6MWT is a"
21,page_21,"Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00002 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 22of 116standard m ethod ( Holland et al 2014 , American Thoracic Societ y 2002 ) for measuring the exercise response to medical interventions in pat ients with moderate to severe heart or lung disease, having already been used to give pre -treatment and post -treatm ent com parisons for patients wi th HF ( DeBock et al 1994 , O’Keeffe et al 1998). In addit ion, pati ent heal th-related qualit y of life will be assessed using various pat ient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. The intention is to determine whether, with once daily administration over a 16- week period, 10mg dapagl iflozin is superi or to pl acebo for reducing HF symptoms, reducing physical limitation , or im proving exercise capacit y in pat ients wi th HFrEF. 2.2 Background Dapagliflozin is a potent, highly select ive and orally act ive inhibitor of human renal SGLT2. A detaile d descripti on of the chemistry , pharmaco logy, efficacy , and safet y of dapagliflozin is provi ded in the Invest igator’s Brochure. Observat ions from the overall dapagliflozin clinical development programme suggest that dapagliflozin may increase exercise capa city in HFrEF patients (as a surrogate measure of daily act ivity) irrespective of diabetes status. Dapagliflozin lowers glycated haemoglo bin (HbA1c) with a low risk of inducing hypoglycaemia. Possible mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitor benefit in pat ients with HF coul d include osm otic diuresis and reduction in arterial st iffness, weight, sy stolic blood pressure, serum uric acid and albuminuria, conditions which are associated with increased cardiovascular and renal risk (Shigiyama et al 2017 ). Other potential mediators include a shift in fat oxidat ion and increased circulat ing concentrations of ketone bodies which may serve as a more sufficient fuel source forthe failing heart ( Ferrannini et al 2016 ). The al terati ons in haem odynamics and renal physio logy are attributed to glucose -independent mechanisms and can therefore be expected to be similar even in the absence o f diabetes ( Rajasekeran et al 2016 ); dapagliflozin is believed to be nephroprotective through non -glycaemic mechanisms ( Wanner et al 2016 ) which may reduce HF ri sk. The clinical studies in healt hy subjects at high multiple doses also show that, due to the mechanism o f action, dapagliflozin does not induce hypoglycaemia in non -diabet ic subjects; however, pharmacodynamic effects on glucose, sodium, and urinary vo lume are observed. Therefore, the changes in these diabetes -independent mechanisms and intra -renal physio logy are e xpected to be similar, regardless of underlying disease. This is an international, mult i -centre, parallel -group, randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, phase III study in HFrEF patients, evaluat ing the effect of dapagliflozin 10mg versus placebo (g iven once daily in addit ion to background local standard of care therapy , including treatments to con trol co-morbidities) on change in HF symptoms as measured by KCCQ -TSS, physical limitat ionas measured by KCCQ -PLS, and exercise capacit y as measured by 6M WD."

More detailed inform ation about the known and expected benefit s and risks and reasonably expected adverse events (AEs) of dapagliflozin may be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure. The fo llowing is a summary of benefit -risk considerat ions relevant to the HFrEF target populat ion. 2.3.1 Potential risks to patients The safet y profile of dapagliflozin is already well established fro m clinical studies for T2DM and t ype 1 diabetes m ellitus and is generally safe and well -tolerated. Dapagliflozin, as an inhibitor of SGLT2, increases urinary glucose excret ions, which is commo nly believed to i ncrease the risk of urinary tract infect ions. Urinary tract infect ions have been reported in dapagliflozin -treated pati ents in a slight ly higher proportion than in placebo -treated pati ents in so me glo bal phase III studies. Increased urinary glucose excret ion may also lead to an increased risk of developing genital infect ions. Urinary tract infections are considered a commo n side effect (in ≥1/100 to <1/10 patients). Dapagliflozin reduces blood volume and blood pressure from its diuretic effect, which could be a concern in patients with HFrEF, but also be important mechanisms of a potential treatm ent effect. However, in the dapagliflozin T2DM programme, the rate of events related to vol ume deplet ion and impaired renal funct ion have been similar between dapagliflozin and placebo. Loop -diuretics are widely used in the target patient populat ionand are al so all owed in this study . A pool ed analysis o f patients wi th T2DM and HF in the dapagliflozin development programme, showed no increase of volume depletion events, but an increase in renal events, mainly creatinine increases, in pat ients treated with dapagliflo zin (n=171) compared wi th patients treated with placebo (n=149). About half o f the pati ents were on l oop diuretics ( Kosiborod et al 2017 ). An increase in amputations, most ly affect ing toes, was observed in a clinical trial ( Neal et al 2017 ) with another SGLT2 inhibitor. There is no indicat ion from the clinical development programme that dapagliflozin is associated with an increased risk of amputation (further inform ation provi ded in Sect ion8.3.1.1 for the detection and capture of events leading to amputati on). Dapagliflozin has not been shown to induce hypoglycaemia in non -diabet ic pat ients. In clinical pharmaco logy studi es, heal thy subjects have been treated with single oral doses of up to 500 m g and mul tiple oral doses of 100 mg up to 14 days without any hypoglycaemic events. There have been post -marketing reports of ketoacidosis, including diabet ic ketoacidosis, in patients wi th T2DM taking dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhi bitors. Di abetic ketoacidosis is"
23,page_23,"Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00002 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 24of 116considered a rare (in ≥1/10000 to <1/1000 patients) adverse drug reaction for dapagliflo zin in patients wi th T2DM. Patients treated with dapagliflo zin who present with signs and symptoms consistent with ketoacidosis, includ ing nausea, vo miting, abdo minal pain, malaise, and shortness of breath, shoul d be assessed for ketoacidosis, even if blood glucose levels are below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). If ketoacidosis is suspected, interruptio n of dapagliflozin treatment should be consi dered, and the patient should be evaluated prompt ly. Predi sposing factors to ketoacidosis include a low beta- cell funct ion reserve result ing from pancreat ic disorders (eg, type 1 diabetes, history of pancreat itis, or pancreatic surgery), insulin dose reduc tion, reduced cal oric intake, or increased insulin requirements caused by infect ions, illness or surgery and alcohol abuse. Dapagliflozin should be used with caut ion in pat ients in these circumstances. Dapagliflozin is current ly not indicated for the treat ment of patients wi th type-1 diabetes mellitus; these patients are excluded from this study . 2.3.1.1 Protection against risks This study has been designed with appropriate measures in place to monitor and minimise any potenti al risks to parti cipating pat ients. Dat a regarding amputations and AEs potentially placing the pati ent at ri sk of a l ower limb amputation will be collected (Section 8.3.1.1 ). To ensure t he safet y of all patients parti cipat ing in AstraZeneca -sponsored studies, reviews of all safet y informat ion from all ongoing clinical dapagliflo zin studi es are conducted as they beco me available. Because of the short duration of the study and the accumulat ed safet y profile of dapagliflozin, an independent Data Monitoring Co mmittee will not be used in this study . 2.3.2 Potential benefits to patients All patients in the study are expected to be treated optimally according to background local standard of care therap y, including treatments to control co -morbidities. Dapagliflozin or matching placebo will be administered on top of these treatments. All patients participat ing in clinical studies, irrespective of whether treated with active treatm ent or not, generally receive closer medical attention than those in ordinary clinical practi ce which m ay be to thei r advantage. 2.3.3 Conclusion Considering the nonclinical and clinical experience with dapagliflozin and the precaut ions included in the study protocol , parti cipat ion in this study shoul d present a minimal and thus acceptable risk to eligible pat ients. Although hypothesis -generat ing data suggest beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in pat ients with T2DM with HF, no available SGLT2 inhibitor has a treatment indicat ion for pati ents wi th HFrEF. This clinical study will test the hy pothesis that"

An overview of the study design is provi ded in Figure 1, Section 1.3. Details on treatments given during the study are provi ded in Sect ion 6.1. Details on what is included in the efficacy and safety endpoints are provided in Section 3. Adult patients with chronic HFrEF (defined in this study as LVEF ≤40% as diagnos ed by echocardiogram, radionuclide ventriculogram, contrast ventriculography, or cardiac magnet ic resonance imaging [MRI]) and New York Heart Associat ion (NYHA) Functional Class II -IV, aged ≥18years who meet the all o f the inclusio n criteria and none of t he exclusio n criteria, will be rando mised 1:1 to receive either dapagliflo zin 10 mg or matching placebo. Randomised treatment should be started as soon as possible. It is est imated that approximately 600patients will need to be enrolled to reach the targe t of approximately 300 rando mised patients, assuming a screening failure rate of 50%. The rationale for the sample size determinat ion is given in Sect ion9.2. In this study the recruit ment of patients between sites will be co mpet itive. Data on baseline characterist ics, endpo ints and AEs will be collected through a validated web -based data capture system. 4.2 Scientific rationale for study design This is a rando mised, mu lti -centre, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, phase III study . Randomisat ion and double -blinding will minimise potential bias. The study popul ation will include patients both with and without T2DM, as the beneficial haemodynamic effects of dapagliflo zin appear to be independent of the glycaemic effect and can therefore be expected in both groups. Enrolment in the study will be capped on a study level based on the proportion of pat ients with and wi thout T2DM, and atri al fibrillat ion status will be monitored to ensure they are representative. The control group will receive matching placebo. All patients will be treated according to local guidelines on standard of care treatment for patients with HFrEF (either an angiotensin -convert ing enzyme [ ACE] inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB] or"

Each pat ient is to be treated with a diuretic regimen aimed at achieving optimal fluid/vo lume status for that individual (with respect to HF symptoms, renal funct ion, blood pressure, and electroly te status). The study popul ation will include patients with eGFR ≥25 mL/min/1.73m2. Patients with reduced renal funct ion usually present a clinical profile of increased intra -glomerular pressure, hypertensio n, proteinuria and fluid/sodium overload. Through metabo lic-independent mechanisms, SGLT2 inhibit ion can improve all these abnormalit ies. Thus, patients with HF and reduced renal function could be expected to benefit from treatmen t with dapagliflozin. The primary efficacy endpoints of the study are change from baseline in each of KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ -PLS, and 6MWD at Week 16. The KCCQ is a disease -specific PRO measure developed for patients with chronic HF. The KCCQ has shown to be a val id, reliable and responsive measure of HF symptoms (as measured by KCCQ -TSS) and physical limitat ion (as measured by KCCQ -PLS) (Greene et al 2018 , Spertus et al 2005). Such m easures have been shown to be clinically meaningful endpo ints in patients with HF ( Ferreira et al 2016 ). Although the 5 -point thresho ld for clinically meaningful wit hin-patient change has not been demonstrated specifically for the KCCQ- TSS or KCCQ -PLS in published clinical trials, the use of this pre -specified threshold in the DETER MINE studies is supported by its extensive use in other KCCQ scales, including the KCCQ -OSS of which the KCCQ -TSS i s a part (Filippatos et al 2017 , Comin -Colet et al 2013 ). Furtherm ore, i ts use for KCCQ -TSS and KCCQ -PLS is supported by other studi es (Spertus et al 2005 , Drey er et al 2016 ). Appropri ate thresho lds for clinically meaningful within-patient change will be evaluated using anchor- based methods, which are described in the Statist ical Analysis Plan (SAP). The rati onale for assessing change in 6MWD is that the 6MWT (the test used to determine the 6MWD) can act as a surrogate of normal daily act ivity. The 6MWT is a standard method for measuring exercise response ( Holland et al 2014 , American Thoracic Societ y 2002) to medical interventions in pat ients with moderate to severe heart or lung disease, giving clinically meaningful change ( Shoem aker et al 2012 ), having already been used to give pre-treatm ent and post -treatm ent com parisons for pati ents wi th HF ( DeBock et al 1994 , O’Keeffe et al 1998 ). Reviews of the literature for clinically relevant thresho lds for 6MWT in HF support a 30 m thresho ld for clinically important difference ( Shoemaker et al 2013 ). An o lder study of 45 patients ( O’Keeffe et al 1998 ) reported that patients who reported feeling “a bit better” had a mean wit hin-patient change in 6MWD of 24 m, and pati ents who reported “much better” h ad a mean wi thin-patient change of 47 m. Data from chronic respi ratory disease studies provides"
28,page_28,"Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00002 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 29of 116the most com prehensive evi dence base for clinically relevant 6MWT change thresholds. The most recent European Respiratory Soci ety/American Thoracic Societ y Tech nical Standard (Holland et al 2014 ) states that the minimal important difference lies between 25 and 33 metres. Thi s is also consistent with a recent review ( Ferreira et al 2016 ) by leading experts in HF. However, these are based on group -level est imates and not within- patient change. Appropriate thr esholds for clinically meaningful wi thin-patient change in the target populat ion will be evaluated using anchor -based methods, with patient global impressio n of severit y (PGIS) and patient global impressio n of change (PGIC) instruments, which are described in the SAP. Finally , pati ents will also complete a suite of PRO measures (eg, rating of dyspnoea and fatigue, and overall treatment benefit [OTB]), to help support the primary endpoints . 4.3 Justification for dose The 10 m g dose of dapagliflozin has a well -characteri sed efficacy and safet y profile in the T2DM clinical development programme and is the recommended dose in the majorit y of countri es worl dwide. From a pharm acokinetic (PK) perspective, the current ly approved dapagliflozin dose of 10 mg once daily isappropri ate for use in pat ients with HFrEF. Slight ly higher systemic exposure to dapagliflozin is expected in HFrEF patients when symptomat ic, based on the dual renal and hepat ic metabo lism of dapagliflo zin and the lower perfusio n of these organs in this patient group. However, the increase in systemic exposure of 10 mg dapagliflozin is not anticipated to warrant dose adjust ment in HF pat ients. Moreover, the ant icipated slight ly higher systemic exposure to dapagliflozin is likely to be beneficial in HF pat ients, by com pensating for the reduced renal perfusio n and consequent ly lower renal glucose and sodi um filtered l oads in these patients. Doses lower than 10 mg are therefore unlikely to provide as much benefit to patients wi th HF as the 10 -mg dose. Lastly, no changes in dose of concomitant medicat ions in the HFrEF populat ion are needed because there is no evidence of clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions for dapagliflozin wit h current medicat ions used for treatment of patients wi th HFrEF, including s tandard of care medicat ions used to control co -morbidities. In the dapagliflo zin clinical programme, there are no dose -related seri ous adverse events (SAEs) that preclude the use of 10 mg as a preferred dose. Addit ionally, in a post -hoc analysis of data fr om 320 pati ents wi th a docum ented history of HF and concomitant T2DM in placebo -controlled clinical studies, dapagliflo zin 10 m g was f ound to be well -tolerated (Kosiborod et al 2017). The recent ly co mpleted (September 2018) pivotal study DECLARE -TIMI 58 (D1693C00001) assessed cardio vascular outcomes in 17160 patients with T2D and used a dose of 10 mg"
29,page_29,"Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00002 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 30of 116dapagliflozin, the topline results fro m which suggest a reduction in the co mposite endpo int of CV death and hospitalisat ion for HF in favour of dapagliflozin versus placebo. Current research therefore suggests that select ing a 10 -mg dose of dapagliflo zin is reasonable from the perspect ive of tolerabilit y and to demonstrate a clinical effect. 4.4 End of study definition The end o f study is defined as the last visit/contact of the last patient participating in the study . A pat ient is considered to have completed the study when he/she has co mpleted Visit 5 (Final visit) even if the pat ient discont inues treatment during the study, but remains in the study unt il Visit5 (Final visit). By contrast, pati ents who prematurely withdraw, or who are prematurely withdrawn, fro m the study , are consi dered as non -completers. The s tudy may be terminated at individual study sites if the study procedures are not being perform ed according to GCP, or if no patients are recruited. Patients from terminated sites will have the opportunit y to be transferred to another site to continue the s tudy. AstraZeneca may also terminate the ent ire study prematurely if concerns for safet y arise wi thin this study or in any other study with dapagliflozin. Regardless of the reason for terminat ion, all data required by the protocol at the time of discont inuation of fo llow-up will be collected. In terminat ing the study , the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interests. Guidelines for the disseminat ion of study resul ts are given in Appendix A 6. 5 STUDY POPULATION In thi s study , pati ents will usually be recrui ted from sites involved in routine cardiology clinical practice. Prospective approval o f protocol deviati ons to recrui tment and enro lment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. Each patient should meet all o f the inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusio n criteria for this study in order to be randomised to invest igational product (IP). Under no circumstances can there be exceptions to this rule. Patients who do not meet the entry requi rements are screen failures (Section 5.4). In thi s p rotocol , “enrolled” patients are defined as those who sign the informed consent form (ICF). “Rando mised” pat ients are defined as those who undergo randomisat ion and receive a rando misat ion number. Procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled pati ents are given in Section 7.3."

Patients’ background standard of care therapies for HFrEF should be given according to local guidelines, including diuretics when needed to control symptom s and vol ume overl oad, and adequate treatment of co -morbidities such as hypertension and ischaemic heart disease (full details are found in inclusio n criterion #6). Each pati ent is to be treated with a diuretic regimen aimed at achieving optimal fluid/vo lume status for that individual (wit h respect to HF symptoms, renal funct ion, blood pressure, and electroly te status). Background standard of care the rapies will be recorded in the eCRF as conco mitant medicat ion. 6.5.2.2 Anti- diabetes background treatment for patients with T2DM More than 40% of pat ients with established HF are estimated to have T2DM ( Kristensen et al 2016). Therefore, it is expected that a large proportio n of patients will have an established T2DM diagnosis when enrolled in this study and that som e pat ients will develop T2DM during the study . Treatm ent of diabetes shoul d follow established guidelines, such as the glycaemic goals reco mmended by the American Diabetes Association and the European Associ ation for the Study of Diabetes in thei r joint Posit ion Statement ( Inzucchi et al 2012 , Inzucchi et al 2015 ). Diabetes m edicat ions at baseline and during the study will be recorded in the eCRF. Patients with T2DM at randomisat ion will continue their T2DM treatment. SGLT2 -inhibitors are prohibited (Section 6.5.1 ). Patients treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues have a higher risk of experiencing hypoglycaemic events compared with those treated with other anti -diabet ic agents. If needed, T2DM treatments may be adjusted at the discret ion of the Invest igator or diabetes healt h care provider. 6.5.3 Other concomitant treatment Other medication (with the except ion of those described above), which is considered necessary for the pati ent’s safet y and wellbeing, may begiven at the discretion of the Invest igator and recorded in the appropriate sections o f the eCRF."

Rem aining IP will be co llected at that time. Post -study treatm ent will not be provided by the Sponsor. Patients shoul d receive standard of care therapy after Visi t5 (Final visit), at the discret ion of the Invest igator. 7 DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT AND SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL 7.1 Discontinuation of investigational product Discontinuati on from IP is not the sam e as a wi thdrawal from the study . If the patient temporarily or perm anent ly discont inues IP, the patient should remain in the study (ie,continue to participate in scheduled study visit s and evaluat ions) and it is important that the scheduled study visits and data collecti on cont inue according to the study protocol until study closure. Patients m ay be di scontinued from IP in the fo llowing si tuations: Contraindicat ion to further dosing with IP, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, such as AE or other safet y reasons Severe non -compliance wi th the study protocol Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Consider temporarily interrupt ing IP if DKA is suspected. If DKA is confirmed, IP should be discont inued permanent ly (Sect ion8.3.1.2 ) Positive pregnancy test (di scont inue IP and notify Sponsor representative) (Section 8.4.2 ) Patient deci sion: The pat ient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment Table 1outlines data to be collected at the time of treatment discont inuat ion, and any further evaluat ions that need to be completed. 7.1.1 Temporary discontinuation Every attem pt shoul d be made to m aintain patients on IP duri ng the course of the study . If IP has been interrupted, it should be re- introduced as soon as, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, the pati ent’s condit ion is stable. 7.1.1.1 Unexpected acute declines in eGFR If an unexpected, acute decline in ki dney functi on is observe d,the pati ent shoul d be evaluated and tem porary interrupti on of IP shoul d be considered. Volume depletion, hypotensio n, inter-current m edical problems and concomitant medicat ions m ay cause increases in blood"

Urinary tract infect ion and urinary obstructi on shoul d be consi dered (the l atter especially in men). Several drugs may cause a decline in kidney funct ion, especially non-steroi dal anti-inflammatory drugs and certain ant ibiotics such as trimethoprim. If any drug i s suspected of causing or con tribut ing to worsening kidney funct ion, thei r use shoul d be re-considered. 7.1.1.2 Volume depletion/hypotension Patients wi th clinically relevant symptoms/signs o f suspected volume deplet ion and/or hypotension, should, in addit ion to considering temporary interruption of IP, have their regular medicat ion reviewed, and considerat ion shoul d be given to reducing the dose of, or stopping concomitant medicat ions, as assessed on an individual basis, including diuretics and drugs that lower b lood pressure. The need for conventional diuretics (or the dose of diuret ic used) should be re -evaluated in light of the pati ent’s symptoms and signs. 7.1.1.3 Patients at risk of volume depletion Temporary interrupti on of IP m ay be considered in patients thought t o be at risk o f volume depletion/hypotension, such as pat ients with an acute m edical illness potentially causing volume depletion because of inadequate fluid intake or fluid/blood loss (eg, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage), or those undergoin g maj or surgery . 7.1.2 Rechallenge Patients who have temporarily discontinued IP can resume treatment as soon as, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, the patient’s condit ion is stable and the patient wishes to resume. No minimum t ime period is necessary before t reatment can resume. 7.1.3 Procedures for discontinuation of investigational product The Investigator should instruct the patient to contact the site before or at the time if IP is stopped. A patient that decides to discont inue IP will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence o f any AEs. The date of last intake IP should be documented in the eCRF. All IP shoul d be returned by the pat ient at hi s/her next on -site study visit or unscheduled visit. Patients perm anent ly discontinuing IP should be given loc ally available standard of care therapy , at the di screti on of the Investi gator. Discontinuati on of IP, for any reason, does not affect the patient ´s part icipation in the study. The patient should cont inue attending subsequent study visits and data collect ion shoul d continue according to the study protocol . If the patient does not agree to continue study visits in-person, a modified fo llow-up m ust be arranged to ensure the collect ion of endpo ints and safet y informat ion. This could be a telephone contact with the pati ent, a contact with a relat ive or treating physician, or informat ion from medical records. The approach taken should be recorded in the medical records."

To optimise the chance of getting in contact with the patient during the study , Invest igators should record as much contact informat ion as possible at the start of the study including ho me phone, mobile/cell phone, ho liday home phone, family member phone numbers, email address, and social media contact details. The fo llowing acti ons m ust be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: The site m ust attem pt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the pat ient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule. Before a patient is deemed potentially lost to follo w up, the Invest igator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the patient, or the patient’s immediate family, by eg, repeat telephone calls, certified letter to the patient ´s last known mailing address or local equivalent me thods. These contact attem pts shoul d be docum ented in the pati ent’s medical record. Efforts to reach the patient should continue unt il the end of the study. Should the patient be unreachable at the end of the study the pati ent shoul d be considered to be l ost to foll ow up with unknown vital status at end of study and censored at l atest follow -up contact. 7.3 Withdrawal from the study A pat ient may wi thdraw from the study (eg, wi thdraw consent), at any time (IP and assessments) at his/her own request, without p rejudice to further treatment. Withdrawal o f consent should only occur if the patient has received appropriate informat ion about, and does not agree to, any kind of further assessments or contact, including modified fo llow-up opti ons. Discontinuati on of IPin itself is not considered withdrawal of consent. A pat ient who considers withdrawing from the study must be inform ed by the Invest igator about m odified fo llow-up opti ons (eg, tel ephone contact, a contact with a relative or treating physician, or informa tion from medical records). If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future informat ion, the Sponsor may retain and cont inue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal o f consent. If a patient withdraws fro m the study , he or she m ay reque st destructi on of any samples taken, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records. A pat ient who wi thdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AE. The Invest igator will fo llow up patients as medical ly indicated."

Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. If applicable, the patient will return any wearable activit y monitors (accel erometers) that were provi ded for use at home. AstraZeneca or its delegate will request Invest igators to collect informat ion on pati ents’ vital status (dead or alive; date of death when applicable) at study closure f rom publicly available sources, in accord ance with local regulations. Knowledge o f the vital status at study closure in all patients is crucial for the integrit y of the study . Data to be collected at the time of withdrawal fro m the study and any further evaluat ions that need to be completed are listed in Table 1. All IP shoul d be returned by the patient. 7.4 Discontinuation of the study The study may be stopped if, in the judgement of AstraZeneca, study patients are pl aced at undue risk because o f clinically significant findings that: Meet individual stopping criteria or are otherwise considered significant, Are assessed as causally related to IP, and Are not considered to be consistent with cont inuation of the study Regardless of the reasons for terminat ion, all data available for the patient at the time of discontinuat ion of fo llow-up m ust be recorded in the eCRF. In terminat ing the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate considerat ion is given to the protecti on of the pati ents’ interests and wellbeing. Study sites will be cl osed upon study com pletion. A study site is considered cl osed when all requi red docum ents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been p erformed. The invest igator may init iate study -site closure at any time, provi ded there i s reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended terminat ion. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: Failure of the invest igator to comply wit h the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local health authori ties, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines Inadequate recruit ment of parti cipants by the investi gator Discontinuati on of further study intervent ion developm ent"

The web -based data capture system will be used for data collect ion and query handling. The Invest igator will ensure that data are recorded in the eCRFs as specified in the study protocol and in accordance with the eCRF instructions provided. The Investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, legibilit y, and timeliness of the data recorded and ensures the provisio n of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreeme nt. The Investigator will sign the completed eCRF. A copy of the com pleted eCRFs will be archived at the study site. Immediate safet y concerns should be discussed wit h the Sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine whether the patient sh ould continue or discontinue IP. Adherence to the study design requi rements, including those specified in the Schedule of Activities (Table 1), is esse ntial and required for study conduct. The m aximum amount of blood scheduled to be collected from each patient over the duration of the study , excluding any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 28 mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safet y reasons or for technical issues with the sam ples. Enrolment period Visit 1, Enrolment (Week -2; Day -14 ± 7) All screening evaluat ions must be com pleted and reviewed to confirm that potential pat ients meet all eligibilit y criteria. The Inv estigator will maintain a screening log to record details o f all patients screened, and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the patient’s routine clinical management and obtained be fore signing of the ICF may be used for screening or baseline purposes, provided the procedures meet the protocol -specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the Schedule of Act ivities (Table 1)."

It should be noted that this visit is ONLY for pati ents who choose to discontinue treatment early , but who remain in the study (ie,continue attending study visits and com pleting study assessments). The fo llowing assessments and procedures will be completed, where possible: The fo llowing PROs will be administered: KCCQ PGIS in HF symptoms PGIC in HF symptoms PGIC in walking abilit y Dyspnoea and fat igue EQ-5D-5L OTB Changes in conco mitant m edicat ions will be r eviewed and recorded. A physical examinat ion will be conducted. NYHA Funct ional Classificat ion will be evaluated and recorded. Systolic and di astolic blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured and recorded."

The fo llowing clinical outcome assessments will be used in this stu dy: Perform ance outcom e (PerfO) (Section 8.1.1.1 ) PRO (Section 8.1.1.2 ) A PerfO is based on a task performed by a pati ent according to instructions administered by a healt h care professio nal. The PerfO in this study will be the 6MWD. A PRO is any report of the status of a patient’s healt h condit ion that comes directly from the patient, without interpretati on from anyone else. PROs have beco me an essential endpo int when evaluating benefit/risk of treatments in clinical studies. The following PROs will be used in this study : KCCQ PGIS in HF symptoms"

The 6MWD will be measured at the 6MWT, conducted at the time points specified in Table 1. The 6MWD will be measured based on the American Thoracic Societ y (ATS) guidelines (American Thoracic Societ y 2002). First, pati ent pulse rate, blood pressure, and oxy gen saturati on are recorded. Then, immediately before starting the 6MWT, the patient will stand and, using the Borg CR10 Scale® (Secti on8.1.1.2 and Appendix P), assess his or her perceived level of dyspnoea and fatigue before exertion. At selected si tes, a subset of at least 100 patients will wear an act ivity monitor (Moni torA) during the 6MWT. The wearable act ivity monitor will be dist inct fro m the activit y monitors some patients will be given to wear at home. T he activit y monitors worn during the 6MWT will be for use in the clinic only. Data collected by the wearable act ivity monitors will be uploaded to the vendor’s server and then provided to the sponsor. Data collected by the wearable act ivity monitors will n ot be shown to the patient or invest igator. The instructions for using the wearable activit y monitors will be provi ded in a separate document. After complet ing the Borg CR10 Scale®, the patient will walk as far as he or she can in 6minutes. The 6MWD will be assessed under standard test condit ions, in accordance with the ATS gui delines. Whenever possible, the same person will conduct the 6MWT at each visit. The distance walked (metres) will be measured manually and recorded on paper before being transferred to the eCRF. Immediately after complet ing the 6MWT, the patient will use the Borg CR10 Scale® again to reassess his or her perceived level o f dyspnoea and fat igue following exerti on. Finally, pati ent pulse rate, bl ood pressure, and oxy gen saturation will again be recorded. A number of measures have been introduced to minimise variabilit y in pat ient perform ance of the 6MWT. Prior to init iating testing, every effort should be made by the Investigator to establish that the patient is in their “usual” state of healt h: meaning th at the patient has no"

In the event that such condit ions are present, the test should be aborted and rescheduled within a 14 day window, to allow time for the resolut ion of the acute medical issue and the patient to return to his or her “usual” state of health. For both 6MWD and other variables measured as part of the 6MWT, the value recorded at Visit 2a (Randomisat ion A) will be the baseline value, except for patients who were successfully retested for the 6MWT, where it will be the Visit 2b (Rando misat ion B) value. 8.1.1.2 Patient -reported outcomes PROs are descr ibed individually in the fo llowing secti ons. The PGIC in walking abilit y and the Borg CR10 Scale® are administered and recorded on paper separately fro m the other PROs (the KCCQ, PGIS in HF symptoms, PGIC in HF symptoms, Dy spnoea and Fatigue, EQ -5D- 5L, and OTB; the results of these are recorded on a site-based electronic tablet by the pat ient and are termed ePROs). The PGIC in walking abilit y will be recorded by the patient on paper. The Borg CR10 Scale® forms part of the suite of assessments that are perfo rmed before and after the 6MWT (Section 8.1.1.1 ). The ePROs are administered and recorded as fo llows: Patients will perform the ePRO assessments u sing a site -based electronic tablet during clinic visits at the time points given in Table 1before the 6MWT. The ePRO assessments must be completed b y the pat ient as soon as he/she arrives at the study site and will take approximately 10 minutes to com plete. Each site must allocate the responsibilit y for the administrati on of the ePROs to a specific individual and, if possible, assign a backup person t o cover if that individual is absent. A key aspect of study success is to have high PRO compliance. Therefore, it is essent ial that site staff fo llow the Schedule of Act ivities (Table 1) and make sure the device is set up properly (including using the appropriate time zone), charged, and fully funct ional at all t imes in order to minimise missing data. It is important that the site staff explain the value and relevance of PRO data: to hear direct ly from patients how they feel. The foll owing best practi ce gui delines shoul d be f ollowed: Patients m ust not receive help from relat ives, friends, or site personnel to answer or clarify the PRO quest ionnaires, in o rder to avoid bias. The PRO questionnaires must be completed before any other study procedures are conducted at a given visit. The PRO questionnaires must be completed before being seen by the Invest igator. The PRO questionnaires must be completed by the p atient in private."

Therefore, if the pat ient has any medical probl ems, he or she should discuss them wit h the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment . The appointed site personnel must show patients how to use the ePRO device, in accordance with the instructions provided. The appointed site personnel should remind pat ients that there are no right or wrong answers, and the patient should be given suffic ient time to complete the PRO questionnaires at his or her own speed. Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Two of the primary efficacy variables are based on the KCCQ (provided in Appendix H), used to assess HF symptoms and physical limitat ion. The values recorded at Visit 2a (Rando misat ion A) will be the baseline values, except for patients who were successfully retested for the 6MWT, where va lues recorded at Visit 2b (Rando misation B) will be the baseline values. The KCCQ is a 23- item, self -administered disease- specific instrument and has shown to be a valid, reliable and responsive measure for patients with HF ( Greene et al 2018 , Spertus et al 2005). The KCCQ was developed to measure t he patient’s percept ion of their healt h status independent ly, which includes HF -related symptoms (frequency, severit y and recent change), impact on phy sical and social function, self -efficacy and knowl edge, and how the patients’ HF affects their qualit y oflife. Summary scores and domain scores are transformed to a range of 0 to 100. Higher scores represent a better outcome. Patient global impression of severity in heart failure symptoms The PGIS (provided in Appendix I) item assesses how a patient perceives his or her overall current severit y of HF symptom s. Pati ents will choose from 6 response options ranging fro m ‘no symptoms’ to ‘very severe.’ The values recorded at Visit 2a (Rando misat ion A) will be the baseline values, except for patients who were successfully retested for the 6MWT, where the values recorded at Visit 2b (Rando misation B) will be the baseline values. Patient global impression of ch ange in heart failure symptoms The PGIC (provided in Appendix J) item assesses how a patient perceives his or her overall change in HF symptoms since the start of the study. Patients will choose fro m 7 response options ranging fro m ‘much better’ to ‘much worse’ ."

Pati ents will choose from 7 response options ranging fro m ‘much better’ to ‘much wo rse’. Dyspnoea and fatigue The dyspnoea and fat igue (provided in Appendix Land Appendix M, respectively) items are single questions, each asking the patient to rate hi s or her shortness of breath and fatigue, respectively , on a scale from 0 to 10. The values recorded at Visit 2a (Rando misat ion A) will be the baseline values, except for patients who were successfully retested for the 6MWT, where values recorded atVisit 2b (Rando misation B) will be the baseline values. EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D- 5L (provided in Appendix N) is a self -reported questionnaire that is used to derive a standardised measure of healt h status, also referred to as a utilit y score. EQ -5D- 5L utilit y scores are wi dely accepted by reimbursement authorit ies and will be used to support healt h econo mic evaluat ions. The values recorded at Visit 2a (Rando misat ion A) will be the baseline values, except for patients who were successfully retested for the 6MWT, where values recorded at Visit 2b (Rando misation B) will be the baseline values. Overall treatment benefit This i tem (provi ded in Appendix O) consists of 2 questions measuring the patient’s rating of treatm ent benefit. The first question assesses the patient’s impressio n of the benefit s relative to the negat ive effects. The second question assesses whether the patient would elect to continue the treatment after the end of the study if it were an option. Borg CR10 Scale® The Borg CR10 Scale® (provided in Appendix P)is a non -linear scale, ranging fro m 0 (‘nothing at all’) to an un- numbered maximum (‘abso lute maximum; highest possible’), that is used to m easure a patient’s self- assessment of his or her d yspnoea and fat igue immediately before and immediately after each 6MWT. The resul ts will be recorded by site staff first onto paper before transfer into the CRF ( Borg 2007 ). 8.1.2 Oxygen saturation Oxygen saturation forms part of the suite of assessments administered during the 6MWT (Secti on8.1.1.1 ) and will be recorded at the time points given in Table 1.

Pati ents will be instructed to wear their activit y monitor for as l ong as possible (idea lly 24hours per day for 7 days). The purpose of wearing the monitors is to assess the total time spent in light to vigorous phy sical act ivity (secondary efficacy endpoint), and the changes in the amount, duration ,and intensit y of physical act ivity parame ters (expl oratory endpoints) from Visi t1 (Enrolment) at Visit 5 (Final visit; Week 16). Patients will return all of their act ivity monitors to the si te staff. Data collected by the wearable act ivity monitors will be upl oaded to the vendor’s server and will be provided to the Sponsor. Data collected by the wearable act ivity monitors will not be shown to the patients or the invest igators. The specific act ivity monitor endpoints and their analysis are described in the SAP. Summary data recorded during 7 day s from Visit 1 (Enrolment) to Vi sit2a (Rando misation A) will form the baseline values for endpoints derived fro m the wearable act ivity monitor worn at home (Monitor B). 8.1.4 Serum NT -proBNP Blood sam ples f or serum NT-proBNP assessment will be co llected at the ti me points given in Table 1.

Invest igators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. New or worsening abnormalit ies may qualify as AEs (Secti on8.3.7 ). Physical examinat ion findings will be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2.2 Electrocardiograms A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Visit 1 (Enrolment); the rhy thm will be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2.3 Vital signs Systolic and di astolic blood pressure and pulse rate will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1and all results will be recorded in the eCRF. The m easurements shoul d be done before any blood sampling or the 6MWT. The measurements will be assessed in a sitting posit ion with a com pletely autom ated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. The measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the patient in a quiet setting wit hout distractions (eg, televisio n, mobile/cell phones). It should be noted that both blood pressure and pulse rate form part of the suite of assessments that are administered as part of the 6MWT (Section 8.1.1.1 ). Ideally, both measurements shoul d be taken 3 times at a site visit: once for vital signs, then again before and after the 6MWT. However, as all o f these m easurements are taken in a sitt ing posit ion, at the Invest igator’s discret ion, the blood pressure and pulse rate values taken for vital signs can be used for the values before the 6MWT."

If the electroni c/web based data capture system is not available, then the Invest igator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Invest igator/study site staf f how to proceed. Further gui dance on the definit ion of an SAE is given in Appendix B. 8.4.2 Pregnancy and maternal exposure All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca except if the pregnancy is discovered before the study patient has received any IP. If a pregnancy is reported, the Invest igator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning o f the pregnancy. Abnorma l pregnancy outcom es (eg, spontaneous abortion, foetal death, stillbirth, congenital ano malies, and ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. Women of child- bearing potenti al who are not using contraception as defined in Sect ion 5.2, Exclusio n Cri terion19are not allowed to be included in this st udy. Shoul d a pregnancy st ill occur, the IP should be discontinued immediately and the pregnancy reported to AstraZeneca. Dapagliflozin must not be used in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In the time period corresponding to second and third t rimester of pregnancy wit h respect to human renal maturati on, maternal exposure to dapagliflozin in rat studies was associated with increased incidence and/or severit y of renal pelvic and tubular dilatations in progeny . There are no adequate and well -contr olled studi es of dapagliflozin in pregnant women. When pregnancy is detected, IP should be discont inued. 8.4.3 Overdose Dapagliflozin has been well tolerated at doses of up to 500 mg/day in single -dose testing in healt hy vo lunteers and up to 100 mg/day in repeat -dose testi ng for 14 days in healt hy volunteers and patients with T2DM. Suspected single intake of more than 50 tablets of 10 mg dapagliflozin tablets or repeated intake of more than 10 tablets of 10 mg dapagliflozin tablets shoul d be reported on the eCRF overdose m odule. If an overdose is suspected, monitoring of vital functions as well as treatment should be performed as appropriate."

This sample size estimate is based on the primary endpoints, KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ -PLS, and 6MWD, as well as the assumption that mortalit y over the ent ire 16-week treatment period is about 5% in each treatm ent arm . 9.3 Populations for analyses 9.3.1 Enrolled All patients who sign the ICF will be included in the Enro lled Populat ion. 9.3.2 Full analysis set All patients representing the study inclusio n/exclusio n criteria and who have been rando mised to IP will be included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), irres pective of thei r protocol adherence, addition or m odificat ion of background rescue medicat ions, switches to alternative medicat ions, and continued participat ion in the study. Patients will be analysed according to their randomised IP assignment, irrespecti ve of the treatment they actually received.

For any patients given incorrect treatment, ie, rando mised to one of the treatment groups, but actually given the othe r treatm ent, the treatm ent group will be allo cated as follows: Pati ents who received both incorrect and correct treatment will be analysed according to their rando mised treatment. Patients who received only the incorrect treatment will be analysed accordin g to that treatm ent. The Safet y analysis set will be considered the primary analysis set for all safet y variables. 9.4 Statistical analyses 9.4.1 Efficacy analyses The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated under a combined treatment policy (inte nt-to-treat) and composite variable strategy estimand, including differences in the outcom e variable at the end of the 16 -week treatment period. The intent -to-treat approach is employed to reflect the effect of the init ially assigned randomised study drug, irrespect ive of exposure to study drug andconcomitant treatment as well as subsequent treatment after discontinuat ion of study drug. A com posite variable strategy approach i s empl oyed to accoun t for deaths occurring during the fo llow-up peri od. 9.4.1.1 Analysis of the primary efficacy variables The primary efficacy endpoints are change fro m baseline in each of KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ- PLS, and 6MWD at Week 16. Each of these will be analysed based on a rank ANCOVA model with rank -based change from baseline at Week 16 as the outcom e. The rank -based baseline value will be included as a covariate along with the stratification factor used in the rando misat ion; further details are available in the SAP. Ties will be assigned the mean of the corresponding ranks. In thi s analysis, d ata that are missing due to death will be ranked “worse” than observed data and data missing for reasons other than death, and the ranking amo ngst the deceased patients will be based on last value while alive. Missing data due to reasons other than death (eg, missing visit s, early withdrawal from the study , incl uding l ost to f ollow -up) will be replaced by multiple imputation wit h predict ive mean matching. Rank ANCOVA will then be applied to each imputation dataset and results will be pooled. Sensit ivity ana lyses will be performed to assess the robustness of the treatment effect from the handling of missing data and are described in detail in the SAP. The m ean difference in change from baseline 6MWD will also be presented, both as an absolute change and as a percentage of baseline."

Therefore, thresho lds for clinically meaningful wi thin-patient change for KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ- PLS, and 6MWD will be assessed using pre -specified methods described in the SAP and the derived thresholds will be the main categories used to assess the magnitude of treatment effect. To provi de a visual display of the relat ive benefit of dapagliflozin over placebo across different ranges of response at Week 16, empirical cumulat ive di stribut ion functions for each treatm ent group will be presented. 9.4.1.2 Analysis of the secondary efficacy variable Analysis of endpo ints using data retrieved from wearable act ivity monitors will be performed in the same way as for the primary endpoint family. Se nsitivity analysis for the secondary endpo int is described in detail in the SAP. Change in total time spent in light to vigorous physical act ivity from baseline to end of study will be based on wearable act ivity monitor data collected at baseline and at the end of the 16 - week treatm ent peri od. Baseline will be measured for all subjects included in the FAS, at sites with wearable devices, over one week, between enrolment (Visit 1) and the first rando misat ion attem pt (Vi sit 2a). Change from baseline will be measured over one week leading up to Week 16. At each time point, up to seven days o f wearable act ivity monitor data will be analysed. Empirical cumulative distribut ion functions will be presented to show the individual -level effects across a range of def initions of responders at Week 16. The thresho ld"

Safet y data will be summarised descript ively and will not be formally tested. Patients who received IP which is not consi stent wi th the treatm ent he or she was randomised to receive will also be lis ted. The numbers and percentages of patients with AEs, SAEs, DAEs, AEs leading to amputations, and potenti al preceding events for l ower limb amputations will be summarised by treatm ent group, and by system organ class and preferred term. For safet y analyse s, summaries will be provided using both on -treatm ent observat ions and for pre-specified safet y variables using all observat ions, regardless of whether patients are on or off IP. Details o f the analysis and presentation o f data for other safet y variables ( physical examinat ion findings, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, b ody weight, and clinical safet y laboratory assessments) will be provided in the SAP. 9.4.3 Other analyses Exploratory analyses, including subgroup analyses, will not be con trolle d for multiplicity. Details o f the analyses planned for the exploratory endpoints ( Table 2) and a list of subgroup variables and categories are descri bed in the SAP. PK analyses and results will be presented separately from the m ain clinical study report. 9.4.4 Methods for multiplicity control The ty pe I error rate will be controlled to support superiorit y claims for dapagliflozin compared wi th placebo. The o verall t ype I error (alpha) will init ially be split between the KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ- PLS, and 6MWD. Testing will proceed to the secondary endpoint if statist ical significance is demonstrated for at least 1 endpo int in the primary endpo int family . The m ultiplicity testing procedure will be described in detail in the SAP. 9.5 Interim analyses Given the short duration of the study , an interim analysis will not be performed. 9.5.1 Data Mmonitoring committee A data monitoring committee will not be used for this study because of the short study durati on and the accumulated safet y profile o f dapagliflozin."

Subjects m ust be informed that their participation is voluntary . Subjects or their legally authorised representative will be required to sign a statement of inform ed consent that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50 , local regulat ions, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portabilit y and Accountabilit y Act (HIPAA) requi rements, where applicable, and the IRB/IEC or study centre. The m edical record m ust include a statem ent that wri tten inform ed consent was obtained before the subject was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was ob tained. The authori sed person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF. Subjects must be re - consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation in the stud y. A copy of the ICF(s) m ust be provi ded to the subject or the subject’s legally authori sed representative. If a subject declines to participate in any vo luntary exploratory genet ic research component of the study , there will be no penalt y or loss of benefit to the subject and he/she will not be excluded fro m other aspects of the study . The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory samples for optional exploratory research. The Investigator or authorised designee will explain to each subject the object ives o f the exploratory research. Subjects will be told that they are f ree to refuse to participate and may withdraw thei r consent at any time and for any reason duri ng the storage period. The subject will give a sep arate agreem ent to allow any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research. Subjects who decline to participate in this optional research will indicate this in the ICF. If a subject withdraws consent to the use of donated bi ological samples, the samples will be di sposed of/destroy ed, and the acti on docum ented. If samples already have been analysed at the time of the request, AstraZeneca will not be obliged to destroy the resul ts of this research. A 4 Data protection Each subject will be assigned a uni que i dentifier by the Sponsor.

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (eg, an abnorm al laboratory finding), symptom (for exam ple nausea, chest pain), or disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a deteri oration of apre-exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no Study treatment has been administered. B 2 Definitions of SAE An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (i e, run -in, treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfils 1 or more of the fo llowing cri teria: Results in death Is immediately life -threatening Requi res in -subject hospi talisati on or prol ongat ion of exist ing hospitalisat ion Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty Is a co ngenital abnormalit y or birth defect Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may require medical treatm ent to prevent 1of the outcomes listed above B 3 Life-threatening ‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk o f death from the AE as it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the subject’s death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not m ean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatit is tha t resolved wit hout hepatic failure). B 4 Hospitalisation Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operati ons planned be fore or during a study are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study ."

These shoul d usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used. Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatm ent Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine Intensive treatment in an emergency room or a t home for allergic bronchospasm Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalisat ion Development of drug dependency or drug abuse B 6 Intensity rating scale 1mild (awareness of si gn or symptom , but easily tolerated) 2moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities) 3severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform norm al activities) It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix B 2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix B 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix B 2. B 7 A Guide to interpreting the causality question When making an assessment of causalit y, consider the following factors when deciding whether there is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by the drug. Time Course: Exposure to suspect drug. Has the subject actually received the suspect drug? Di d the AE occur i n a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the suspect drug?"
84,page_84,"Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00002 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 85of 116Consistency wit h known drug profile: Was the AE consistent with the previous knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical properti es? De-challenge experience: Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug? No al ternative cause: The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetio logy such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or e nvironmental factors. Re-challenge experi ence: Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge . Laboratory tests: A specific laboratory invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship . In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: Is this a recogni sedfeature of overdose of the drug? Is there a known mechanism? Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the re levant data, there is evidence for a ‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expressio n ‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship. The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough inform ation to m ake an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient informat ion in the case, i t is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’. Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study has deteri orated due to l ack of effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y. B 8 Medication error For the purposes of this clinical study , a m edicati on error i s an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that ei ther causes harm to the participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a h uman-or process -related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or parti cipant."

Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants that affect drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretion; mechanism o f action of the drug; di sease aet iology; and/or mo lecular subt ype of the di sease being treated. Therefore, where local regulat ions and IRB/I EC allow, a blood sample will be co llected for DNA analysis fro m consent ing subjects. AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the response to medicat ions. Genet ic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in healt h care and to the discovery of new diagnosti cs, treatm ents or m edicat ions. In addit ion, co llection of DNA samples from populat ions wit h well described clinical characterist ics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, possibly , to geneti cally -guided treatm ent strategi es. Genet ic research may consist of th e analysis o f the structure of the subject ´s DNA, ie, the entire geno me. The results of genet ic analyses may be reported in the clinical study report or in a separate study summary . The Sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with ade quate m easures to protect confident iality. The samples will be retained while research on HF with reduced eject ion fraction continues but no l onger than 15 y ears or other period in accordance wit h local requi rements. D 2 Genetic research plan and procedures SELECTION OF GENETIC R ESEARCH POPULATION Study selection record All subjects will be asked to participate in this genetic research. Participat ion is voluntary and if a subject declines to participate there will be no penalt y or l oss of benefit. The subject w ill not be excluded from any aspect of the main study ."

Exclusion criteria Exclusio n from this genet ic research may be for any o f the excl usion criteria specified in the main study or any of the fo llowing: Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n in 120 days of genetic sample collection Withdrawal of consent for genetic research Subjects m ay withdraw from this genetic research at any time, independent of any decisio n concerning participat ion in other aspects of the main study .Voluntary withdrawal will not prejudice further treatment. Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Sect ion 7of the main Clinical Study Protocol . Collection of samples for genetic research The blood sample for genet ic research will be obtained fro m the subjects at Visit 2a or Visit2b (Rando misat ion A or Randomisat ion B), as applicable. Alt hough DNA is stable, early sample collect ion is preferred to avoi d introducing bias through excluding subjects who may withdraw due to an AE; such subjects would be important to include in any genetic analysis. If for any reason the sample i s not drawn at Visit 2, it may be taken at any visit until the l ast study visit. Only 1 sample should be co llected per subject for genetics during the study. Samples will be collected, l abelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. Coding and storage of DNA samples The processes adopted for the coding and s torage of samples for genet ic analysis are important to maintain subject confidentialit y. Samples will be stored for a m aximum of 15years, from the date of last subject last visit, after which they will be destroy ed. DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. An addit ional second code will be assigned to the blood either before or at the time of DNA extracti on repl acing the in formation on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will be ident ifiable only by the second, unique number. This number is used to ident ify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, or at the designated organi sation. No p ersonal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca emplo yee or designated organisat ions working with the DNA)."

The link will be used to ident ify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul ts wi th clinical data, all ow regulatory audi t, and permit tracing o f samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent. Ethical and regulatory requirements The principles for ethical and regulatory requi rements for the study , incl uding this genet ics research component, are outlined in Appendix A. Informed consent The genetic component of this study is opti onal and the pati ent may parti cipate in other components of the m ain study without parti cipat ing in the genet ic component. To participate in the genet ic co mponent of the study the pat ient must sign and date both the consent form for the main study and the genet ic co mponent of the study . A copy of the si gned and dated consent form must be given to the pat ient and the ori ginal filed at the study centre. The Principal Invest igator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the patient understands that they may freely withdrawal from the genet ic aspect of the study at any time. Subje ct data protection AstraZeneca will not provide individual genoty pe resul ts to subjects, any insurance com pany, any emplo yer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by law. Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identi ty of the subject. In except ional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal ident ifiers of a subject. For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an A straZeneca Physician or an Invest igator might know a subject’s ident ity and also have access to his or her genet ic data. In addit ion, Regulatory authori ties may requi re access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical informat ion and the genet ic files woul d rem ain physically separate. Data management Any genoty pe data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca and/or designated organizations to analyse the samples. AstraZeneca and its designated organisat ions may share summary results (such as genet ic differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease) fro m this genetic research with other researchers, such as hospitals, academic organisat ions or health insurance co mpanies. This can be done by placing the results in scient ific databases, where they can be combined with the resul ts of similar studi es to l earn even m ore about healt h and disease. The researchers can"

Researchers may see summary resul ts, but they will not be able to see individual subject data or any personal identifiers. Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merged wi th the genet ic data in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database. Statistica l methods and determination of sample size The number of subjects that will agree to participate in the genet ic research is unknown. It is therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal statist ical evaluat ion or whether only descript ive statist ics will be generated. A Statist ical Analysis Plan may be prepared where appropriate."

If there is an agreed alternat ive explanat ion for the ALT or AST and TBL elevat ions, a determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE: If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the appropriate CRF If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF accordingly and fo llow the AstraZeneca standard processes If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations other than the IP: Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard processes. The ‘Medically Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious criteria apply As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned. If there is an unavo idable delay o f over 3 weeks in obtaining the informat ion necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made: Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and causalit y assessment as per above Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary supplementary informat ion is obt ained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are met. Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the review amending the reported term if an alternative explanat ion for the liver biochemistry elevations is determined."
