Amendment 2 (26April 2018) The overall reason for the amendment: To add results of the male and female rat fertility studies. To exclude enrollment of women of childbearing potential (W OCBP). In addition, other minor changes and clarifications related to study procedures were made. Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale: To u pdate nonclinical data Section 1.1.1 Nonclinical Studies (Toxicology); Section 16.1 . Stud y-Specific Design Considerations; References (68-72)Added results from the male and female rat fertility studies and relevant literature references. Rationale: Thefemale rat fertility study suggested that JNJ -42847922 reduced female fertility rates at a ll doses studied. Since it is not known what the relevance of these findings are to a w oman’s ability to become pregnant after taking JNJ -42847922, WOCBP will be excluded from this study until more is learned about the effect of JNJ-42847922 on female repr oduction. Synopsis (Subject Population); Section 3.2. Study Design Rationale; Section 4.1. Inclusion Criteria; Section 16.1. Study -Specific Design ConsiderationsInclusion Criterion #1: Revised the text to indicate that the study population will include men and w omen “of non -childbearing potential (WONCBP)” . Added a definition of WONCBP. Clarified in other relevant sections that the study population will include men and women “ of non -childbearing potential (WONCBP)”. Subject 4.1. Inclusion CriteriaDeleted Inclusion Criteria #11 and #12. (these criteria are no longer required now that the female population is restricted to WONCBP. Relevant information on WONCBP from Inclusion Criterion #11 w as moved to Inclusion criterion #1) Subject 4.2 . Exclusion CriteriaRevised Exclusion Criterion #28 as follow s: Is pregnant ,or breastfeeding , or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in this study or w ithin 1 month after the last dose of study drug. Section 1.4. Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment; Section 3. 2. Study Design Rationale; Section 16.1. Study -Specific Design ConsiderationsAdded text to clarify that WOCBP w ill be excluded from the study and to explain the rationale for excluding these subjects b ased on the nonclinical fertility findings.

Overview; Section 9.1.2. Screening; Section 9.7. Safety EvaluationsThe specific serum and urine pregnancy tests were removed from the Time and Events sc hedule, andthe wording was updated to clarify that pregnancy tests can be performed if determined necessary by the investigator. Footnotes in the Time and Events Schedule were updated as follows: Footnote h: Wom en of childbearing potential only. “Serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed, as determined necessary by the investigator, to establish the absence of pregnancy at any time during the subject’s participation in the study. A FSH test may also be performed at investigator judgment to assist in determining if a woman is of non -childbearing potential. ” (also added FSH to the abbreviations) Footnote ‘i’ was deleted (and the subsequent footnote numbering updated accordingly) Footnote ‘p’ was updated to indicate that menstrual tracking will be performed in “premenopausal women”. Rationale: The maximum age of the study population was increased from 64 years to 70 years to increase the patient population to help with recruitment and to learn about JNJ-42847922 in the elderly with MDD Synopsis (Subject Population); Sectio n 3.2. Study Design Rationale; Section 4.1. Inclusion CriteriaInclusion Criterion #1: Changed the maximum age of the study population from 64 years to “70years ”, inclusive. Corresponding edit swere also m ade in other relevant sections . Rationale: To m ake the evening dosing window less restrictive and to add further instructions on dosing. Synopsis (Description of interventions) ; Time and Events Schedule (footnote g); Table 3Changed the dosing time from “at least” 3 hours after the last meal to “approximately ” 3hours after the last meal. Added that the study drug should be taken with “approximately” 100 mL of water Section 6. Dosage and Administration. Added the following text: “ Subjects will administer the assigned study drug once daily at bed time, approximately 3 hours after the last meal, from Day 1 to Day 167. Subjects are required to record the administration of study drug or any missed doses in subject diaries, which will be checked at each scheduled visit. ”"

Overview of Study Design; Section 4.1. Inclusion Criteria ; Section 9.1.2. ScreeningInclusion Criterion #2: Changed the required length of the current depressive episode from “ ≤1 year” to “≤18 months”. The corresponding change was made in Section 9.1.2., Screening. Inclusion Criterion #3: The text was updated as shown below: “Have had an inadequate response t o at least 1 but no more than 2 “3” antidepressants (see the inclusion criterion below ), adm inistered at an adequate dose and duration in the current episode of depression, as assessed by the MGH - ATRQ. An inadequate response is defined as <50% reduction in depressive symptom severity, as assessed by the MGH -ATRQ. An adequate trial is defined as an antidepressant treatment for at least 4 weeks at at least “or above” the minimum therapeutic dose, as specified in the MGH -ATRQ, for any particular antidepressant . The inadequate response must include the subject’s current antidepressant treatment.” The corresponding change was also made in other relevant sections. Inclusion Criterion #4: Clarified that current antidepressant treatment should be at “a stable dose ( at or above the minimum therapeutic dose level )”for at least 4weeks. Inclusion Criterion #14: The text was updated as shown below : “During the study and for a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as approximately 3 months) after receiving the las t dose of study drug , in addition to the highly effective m ethod of contraception , a man” Section 4.2. Exclusion CriteriaExclusion Criterion #1: Added “(including narcolepsy)” after neurologic. Changed the HbA1c threshold for w ell-controlled diabetes mel litus from a HbA1c of “ ≤7%” to HbA1c of “ ≤7.5% ” at screening. Exclusion Criterion #8: Added the following text to define the criteria for lack of response: “as indicated by no or minimal ( ≤25% improvement in symptoms) when treated with an antidepressant of adequate dose (per MGH -ATRQ) and duration (at least 4 weeks).” Rationale: To clarify that concomitant therapies do not need to be recorded for subjects who fail screening unless there is an adverse event. To add additional medications to the list of p rohibited medications and timing of their discontinuation to add additional clarity for investigators. Section 8. Prestudy and Concomitant TherapyAdded the following text: “For subjects who fail screening, concomitant therapies do not need to be recorde d unless there is an adverse event.” Added :“tricyclic antidepressants” and “bupropion” to the list of prohibited medications. Added: “ When discontinuing a prohibited medication, the investigators should consider the time needed to sufficiently eliminate a drug from body system, eg, 5half-lives of the drug.” Rationale: Minor changes/clarifications were made to the timing and conduct of study procedures to allow flexibility to investigators and clarify timing of protocol procedures . Time and Events Schedu le Revised the final table column to make it clear that the End -of-Study/Follow -up visit will be conducted 7 to 14 days after the last dose. Changed the Visit window for the End -of-Study/Follow -up visit from “±7 days” to “7 to 14 days after the last dose” Changed the Study Week for the End -of-Study/Follow -up visit from “26” to “25-26” Time and Events Schedule Changed w indow for Visit 6 from “±5 days” to “±4days”."

Overvie w The w ording pertaining to the order of study assessments was revised to indicate that the proposed order (ECGs, vital signs, blood draws, PRO assessments and then other procedures) is a recommendation , not a requirement. Section 9.7. Safety Evaluations (Vital signs)Deleted th e text stating that vital signs should be measured in non -fasting conditions whenever possible. Rationale: To clarify th at the 6 -month treatment period is equivalent to a 24-week treatment period (ie, 1 month = 4weeks). Synopsis; Section 1. Introducti on; Section 2.1. Objectives and Endpoints; Section 3.1. Overview of Study DesignWhere the study is described as a “6 -month” study ,the qualifier “(24 -week)” was added. Rationale: To clarify that only those subjects with acute suicidal ideation and with a clear plan should be discontinued from study treatment. Section 10.2. Withdraw al from the StudyThe follow ing sentence was updated as shown below (new text indicated in “italics” ): The subject shows signals of acute suicidal ideation “with a clear plan ”at any time during the study; the subject should be referred to appropriate medical/psychiatric care . Rationale: Wording regarding the reporting process for adverse events of special interest was updated. Section 9.7. Safety Evaluations (Adverse events of Special Interest)The follow ing sentence was updated as shown below: When reported, the investigator will be required to complete a detailed summary of the event and its clinical course utilizing the CRF page “AE of special interest narrative form” as soon as information on the outcome (recovered, resolving, or ongoing) is available. “In addition, the AE should be marked as an AE of special interest in the CRF .” Rationale: Wording regarding the transmission of serious adverse events to the sponsor wa s updated to remove reference to the Safety Report Form, as it is not relevant for this study. Section 12.3.2. Serious Adverse EventsThe follow ing sentence was updated as shown below: Information regarding serious adverse events will be transmitted to th e sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event Form and Safety Report Form , which must be completed and reviewed “signed” by a physician from the study site, and transmitted to the sponsor within 24 hours.

While preclinical evidence supports a role for the orexin system in modulating the HPA axis and stress - responsiveness, clinical data in support of a role for orexin in depression are fairly limited. In depressed subjects, average cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin levels have not been demonstrated to be different from controls, nor to correlate with the severity of depressive illness; however, the diurnal variation of CSF orexin levels has been shown to be blunted in subjects with depression, with a trend toward elevated orexin levels in CSF across the entire diurnal period. The most striking elevation has been noted at the physiologic nighttime nadir. s. The exploratory efficacy results from a multiple -dose study (42847922MDD1001) of 20 mg of JNJ -42847922 in 48 subjects with MDD showed an early onset (as early as Day 11 of exposure) and a clinically relevant antidepressant effect that was sustain ed at least 14 days after treatment discontinuation. The effect of JNJ-42847922 was largely related to a change in the core symptoms of depression and overall unrelated to its impact on sleep -related items.

Hypothesis The primary hypothesis of this study is that, in adult subjects with MDD who have had an inadequate response to treatment with an SSRI/SNRI, adjunctive treatment with JNJ -42847922 will delay the time to all-cause disc ontinuation of study drug when compared to adjunctive treatment with quetiapine XR. OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, parallel -group, flexible -dose, 6-month (24-week) study in adult subjects with MDD who have an inadequate response to current antidepressant therapy with an SSRI/SNRI. The study will consist of 3 phases: an up to 4-week screening phase, a 6-month double -blind treatment phase, and a 2-week follow -up phase culminating in a follow -up/en d-of-study visit. Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either flexibly dosed JNJ -42847922 (20 or 40 mg) or flexibly dosed quetiapine XR (150 or 300 mg) as adjunctive therapy to their current SSRI or SNRI. Subjects will co ntinue to take their baseline SSRI/SNRI antidepressant (at the same dose, without change, every day and at approximately the same time as prior to entering the study) throughout the screening, double -blind, and follow -up phases. SUBJECT POPULATION The stud y population will include adult men and women of non -childbearing potential (WONCBP) (aged 18 to 70years, inclusive )who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5th Edition (DSM -5) diagnostic criteria for MDD (confirmed by the Structure d Clinical Interview for DSM -5 Axis I Disorders –Clinical Trials Version [SCID -CT]), and who have had an inadequate response to at least 1but no more than 3antidepressants (administered at an adequate dose and duration in the current episode, as assesse d by the Massachusetts General Hospital -Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire [MGH -ATRQ]). Each potential subject must have MADRS total score ≥25 at screening and must not demonstrate a clinically significant improvement (ie, an improvement of >20% on their MADRS total score) from the screening to baseline visit. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION All subjects randomized to JNJ-42847922 will receiv e 20 mg as a starting dose. Subjects randomized to quetiapine XR will receive 50 mg once daily for 2 days, followed by an increase to 150 mg once daily on Day 3, as per prescribing guidelines in the product label. After the initial dosing period, dose adju stments may be made starting with the first scheduled clinic visit (Day 14). The first dose adjustment must be upwards. Subsequent adjustments may be made upwards or downwards within the study dose ranges (20or 40 mg for subjects randomized to JNJ-4284792 2 or 150 or 300 mg for subjects randomized to CCI"

Description of Interventions Treatment name JNJ-42847922 Quetiapine XR Dose per d elivery (ie, total daily dose)20mg or 40 mg 50 mg for the first 2 days and then 150mg or 300 mg Study drugs will be over -encapsulated tablets to be taken orally, once daily at bedtime, approximately 3hours after the last meal, with approximately 100 mL of plain water and swallowed whole. Tablets must not be chewed, divided, dissolved or crushed. EFFICACY EVALUATIONS The primary endpoint of this study is time to all -cause discontinuation of study drug. The investigator will be required to complet e a detailed summary of the discontinuation, such as reasons and times, utilizing the CRF page. If it is caused by an AE, the clinical course of the AE and the outcome (recovered, resolving, or ongoing) of the AE should be documented. The efficacy of the study drugs (JNJ-42847922 and quetiapine XR) will be evaluated using the MADRS (SIGMA version), SIGH -A (HAM -A), CGI-S, SDMT, TMT -Part B, HVLT -R, PGI-S, PROMIS -SD (Short Form 8a), PROMIS -SRI (Short Form 8a), SMDDS, QLDS, and CSD -M. PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATION S Blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of JNJ-42847922 and the metabolites M12 and M16 in the morning of Days42, 84and 168, within 12 hours after the previous dose. BIOMARKER EVALUATIONS Venous blood samples will be collected for the assessment of biomarkers as indicated in the Time and Events Schedule. To avoid interference caused by lipid content in blood specimens collected for biomarker evaluation, biomarker samples will be collected under fasting conditions (for aminimum of 8 hours, water permitted). Saliva samples for the measurement of cortisol concentrations will be collected by using an oral swab method just before bedtime (before dosing) and upon awakening as indicated in the Time and Events Schedule. PHARMAC OGENOMIC AND EPIGENETIC (DNA) EVALUATIONS Blood samples for genetic research will be collected from subjects who consent separately to this component of the study (where local regulations permit) to allow for the identification of genetic and/or epigenetic factors that may influence the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, safety, or tolerability of JNJ-42847922 and to identify genetic and/or epigenetic factors associated with MDD. Subject participation in genetic research is optional. MEDICAL RESOURCE UTILIZAT ION AND HEALTH ECONOMICS Medical resource utilization will be assessed using the HRUQ. SAFETY EVALUATIONS Safety evaluations will include collection of AEs and concomitant medications, as well as assessment with physical examination, body weight, waist circumference, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, urine drug test"

In additi on, emergence of suicidal ideation will be assessed using the C -SSRS; potential withdrawal effects will be assessed by the clinician using the PWC; and the effect on sexual functioning will be measured by the ASEX. STATISTICAL METHODS Sample Size Determina tion The primary purpose of the study is to investigate potential differentiating features between JNJ-42847922 and quetiapine XR. Although the sample size was not chosen based on a specific set of endpoints, for evaluating the time to discontinuation of study drug in the JNJ-42847922 group versus the quetiapine XR group, a one -sided log -rank test with an overall sample size of 100 subjects (50 in the JNJ - 42847922 group and 50 in the quetiapine XR group) provides approximately 92% power at a 1-sided 0.10 significance level to detect a hazard ratio of 0.415, assuming the proportion of subjects who discontinue from study drug in the quetiapine XR group is 50%.The planned sample size of the study is consistent with the nature of Phase 2 exploratory study. Efficacy Analysis The efficacy analyses will be based on the full analysis set (FAS) which consists of all subjects who were randomly assigned to study drug and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The primary efficacy endpoint, time to all-cause discontinu ation of study drug, will be estimated by the Kaplan -Meier method and summarized (number of discontinuations, number of censored subjects, median, 25th and 75th percentile, if estimable) by treatment group. Time to all-cause discontinuation of study drug is defined as the number of days from the first dose of study drug to the last dose of study drug. Subjects who complete treatment are not considered to have discontinued. A stratified log-rank test (stratified for baseline insomnia status) will be used to test the hypothesis that there is no difference between the JNJ-42847922 group and quetiapine XR in the probability of discontinuing study drug, using a 1-sided 0.10significance level. Biomarker Analysis Cortisol levels will be tabulated for each time point and summary statistics will be calculated. Post- treatment changes in cortisol levels will be assessed by treatment group. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-test will be used to assess differences across groups and time points. Correlations between cortisol levels and clinical endpoints will be evaluated. The additional exploratory biomarkers will be tabulated by treatment and summary statistics will be calculated. Post-treatment changes in exploratory biomarkers will be summarized by treatment group. Associations between baseline biomarker levels and clinical endpoints may be explored. Additional exploratory analyses may also be performed. Results of all exploratory analysis will be presented in a separate report. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Concentration -time data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by dose, visit date and time (relative to dose) for JNJ -42847922, and metabolites M12 and M16 (as applicable)."

All reported AEs with onset during the double -blind treatment phase and AEs that have worsened since baseline (ie, treatment -emergent adverse events [TEAEs]), will be included in the analysis. Serious adverse events will be summarized separately. Laboratory data will be summarized by type of laboratory test and treatment. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for each laboratory analyte at baseline and for observed values and changes from baseline at each scheduled time point. Descriptive statistics of pulse, supine and standing blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), and temperature for observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized at each scheduled time point by treatment.

INTRODUCTION JNJ-42847922 (seltorexant) is a potent and selective antagonist of the human orexin -2 receptor (OX2R , negative log of inhibition constant [pKi]=8) that is being developed for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia. The orexinergic circuits innervate most of the structures implicated in the pathophy siology of mood disorders, as well as in emotional behavior, stress responses, and reward processing .4,25,29,34,38,44,63In its role in mediating arousal, orexinergic transmission is driven partly by the amygdala, a limbic structur e that organizes other behavioral, endocrine, autonomic and emotional responses to stressors, threats, rewards, and novelty .44In patients with mood disorders, the amygdala manifests abnormally elevated activity under stress in response to emotionally negative or aversive stimuli, and during sleep.34 While preclinical evidence supports a role for the orexin sy stem in modulating the HPA axis and stress -responsiveness, clinical data in support of a role for orexin in depression are fairly limited. In depressed subjects, average cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin levels have not been demonstrated to be different from controls, nor to correlate with the severit y of depressive illness; however, the diurnal variation of CSF orexin levels has been shown to be blunted in subjects with depression, with a trend toward elevated orexin levels in CSF across the entire diurnal period. The most striking elevation has been noted at the physiologic nighttime nadir. A pathologically elevated limbic drive from the amygdala in depressed patients may explain this finding, and it is possible that normalizing cortisol during that particularly exaggerated cortisol elevation (ie ,during sleep) may significantly reduce depressive s ymptoms. The orexins stimulate two distinct G -protein coupled receptors, orexin -1 (OX1R) and OX2R that are co-located or selectively located in specifi c brain areas suggesting differentiated roles. The best-characterized orexinergic system involves the OX2R located on histaminergic neurons in CCI"

Warnings and precautions for suvorexant include the risk of next day impairment, including impaired driving skills and the potential to fall asleep while driving, and symptoms similar to mild cataplex y have been reported with the use of suvorexant. A contributing factor to these risks for suvorexant is its long half -life (about 12hours). In contrast, such risks appe ar to be mitigated by the short half -life (2 -3 hours) of JNJ -42847922. The exploratory efficacy results from a multiple -dose study (42847922MDD1001) of 20 mgof JNJ-42847922 in48subjects with MDD showed an early onset (as early as Day 11 of exposure) and a clinically relevant antidepressant effect that was sustained at least 14 days after treatment discontinuation . The effect of JNJ-42847922 was largely related to achange inthe core s ymptoms of depression and overall unrelated to its impact on sleep- related items. A Phase 2b study (42847922MDD2001) is currently ongoing to investigate the antidepr essant effects of JNJ-42847922 (up to 3 doses [10, 20, and 40 mg] versus placebo), as adjunctive treatment to standard of care and to further assess the safet y and tolerability of JNJ-42847922 over a treatment duration of 6weeks . The study utilizes the change in the Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline to the end of Week 6 as the primary endpoint. The present study is being conducted to compare the efficacy of JNJ-42847922 (20 or 40mg) versus quetiapine XR (150 or 300 mg) as adjunctive treatment to standard of care over a treatment duration of 6 months (24 weeks) .The primary endpoint will be time to all-cause treatment discontinuation. Efficacy , safet y, and tolerability will also be assessed to evaluate the mainten ance of antidepressant effect over time (including response and remission rates), to provide long-term (6-month) safet y information for JNJ-42847922, and to compare the efficacy and tolerability of JNJ-42847922 versus quetiapine XR over 6 months of treatme nt. The doses of JNJ-42847922 being evaluated in the present study (20 and 40 mg) were selected on the basis of efficacy , safet y and tolerability data from Phase 1 clinical studies. Quetiapine XR was chosen as the active comparator as it is one of only 3 d rugs approved for the adjunctive treatment of patients with MDD in the US and is a commonly -used medication in this treatment setting. The doses of quetiapine XR selected for this study (150 and 300 mg) are consistent with the recommended dose range indica ted in the US prescribing information. CCI CCI"

Background 1.1.1. Nonclinical Studies Nonclinical Pharmacology Safety Pharmacology JNJ-42847922 was evaluated in a variet y of in vitro and in vivo models for effects on the cardiovascular system. These included the in vitro ion channel assay in human Ether-à-go-go Related Gene (hERG) -transfected HEK293 cells, the isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers assay , an in vivo study in anesthetized guinea pigs and dogs, and a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) study in conscious dogs. JNJ-42847922 did not show any potentia l for adverse cardiovascular effects. In a rat study to investigate neurobehavioral effects, treatment related changes at ≥250 mg/kg were likely related to exaggerated pharmacology . Findings at 250 mg/kg included slight narrowing of the palpebral fissure in all animals with one also display ing a tendency to decreased body temperature, and a minor retardation of visual placing.

Compa rator Drug Quetiapine Fumarate Extended -release Tablets Quetiapine extended -release (XR) will be included in this study as an active comparator to investigate potential differentiating features between JNJ-42847922 and quetiapine XRin the augmentation ofselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI )/serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI )treatment of MDD. Quetiapine is a combined dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin type 2A (5HT2A) antagonist that belongs to the atypical antipsy chotic class. Well-known class effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), somnolence/sedation, metabolic changes (eg, hypergly cemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain), extrapy ramidal symptoms (EPS)including tardive dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, and hematolo gic effects (eg, neutropenia and agranulocy tosis), QT prolongation, seizures, and hyperprolactinemia.55Additionally , cataract development has been observed in dogs after quetiapine exposure during chronic toxic ity studies.51 Although the immediate -release formulation was initially approved for use in schizophrenia, quetiapine XR has been shown to be effective for bipolar disorder and as adjunctive treatment with antidepressants for MDD.3It is approved in the US and EU for the adjunctive treatment of MDD based on well- controlled studies. For further information regarding quetiapine XR (including list of adverse reactions, dosage and administration, warnings and precautions ,etc) refer to the local prescribing information .51 1.3. Overall Rationale for the Study Major depressive disorder is a common, serious, recurrent disorder, with worldwide lifetime prevalence estimates ranging from 8% to 12% in most countries. Its negative impact on role functioning in various settings (eg, school performance, marriage, parenting, and the workplace), quality of life, physical health, and life expectan cy has been well- documented. Loss of work production and absenteeism due to major depressive episodes or MDD has been estimated to account for approximately 30 to 50 billion dollars in annual human capital.27Asof October 2015, with an estimated 350 million sufferers, depression has been ranked by the World Health Organization as the leading cause of disability worldwide, and the prevalence is rising.61 CCI"

In the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) -sponsored Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, only 28% of subjects achieved remission (defined as a score of ≤7 on the HAM -D17) during first- line treatment with a SSRI .46For inadequate response to an optimized trial of first-line antidepressant therapy (ADT), current guidelines recommend switching the ADT, adding a second ADT or adding adjunctive therap y with a non-ADT.10,40,52All curren tly approved drugs indicated for adjunctive therap y in patients with MDD (including quetiapine, aripiprazole, and brexipiprazole) belong to the at ypical antipsy chotic family , and have tolerability issues that, in some cases, may lead to non -adherence. Aside from serious risks such as NMS and tardive dyskinesia, these agents are well-known to be more commonly associated with risks such as hypergly cemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and next day drowsiness. It is well- established that sy mptoms of insomnia commonly occur with major depression episodes.1 In fact, chronic insomnia may be presen t for years prior to the onset of the first depressive episode and increases the risk of non-depressed persons to develop depression by twofold compared to persons without insomnia. Therefore, insomnia is not only a s ymptom of depression, but also a predic tor of depression.24Ongoing sleep problems may contribute to the persistence of a depressive episode or may be a residual symptom of a current depressive episode, despite other symptoms of depression having responded to treatment. Significant sleep symptoms are known to increase relapse risk in patients with MDD.39 At present, about two- thirds of depressed patients take sleep medications in addition to their antidepressant regimen. The drugs prescribed for this purpose include benzodiazepines, atypical antipsy chotics (eg, quetiapine), trazodone, antihistamines, non-benzodiazepines sleep agents such as zolpidem, as well as non-prescription sleep aids. Some of the most common side effects of these medications CCI CCI CCI"

Overall Risk and Benefit A ssessment As further described in Secti on 1and the rationale for this study (Section 1.3), MDD is a common, serious, recurrent mental disorder. MDD is the leading cause of disability , and its prevalence i s rising.61 Current therapies commonly used as first-line ADT in patients with MDD (eg, SSRI s and SNRI s) are sub-optimally effective in some patients who require adjunctive treatment, or who are otherwise poorl ycompliant because of their associated AEs, such as weight gain and sexual side effects. Currently approved adjunctive treatments are limited to the atypical antips ychotic drug class, which present considerable tolerability concerns (eg, metabolic syndrome , akathisia, and EPS). The orexin -receptor antagonist class offers a novel mechanism of action that may prove to be a valuable alternative in the adjunctive treatment of MDD, but without the side effects observed with other medications commonly used in thi s setting ,such as weight gain, sexual side effects, akathisia, or EPS The currentl y available data (see Section 1.1.2 , Clinical Studies, and the JNJ-42847922 Investigator’s Brochure21) support this clinical study that investigates the efficacy and safet y of JNJ-42847922 in adult subjects with MDD who have responded inadequately to commonly used first-line ADTs. The antidepressant effect of JNJ -42847922 was clinically relevant a s earl y as Day 11 of exposure and was sustained at least 14 days after treatment discontinuation. The effect of JNJ-42847922 was largel y related to an effect on the core symptoms of depression, and overall unrelated to its effect on sleep -related events. Additionally , the safet y and tolerability data so far accumulated for JNJ-42847922 in both healthy subjects and subjects with MDD and/orinsomnia were generally acceptable based on a thorough review of the safet y information from completed clinical studies . No death or SAEs were reported after subjects received JNJ-42847922. The most commonly reported TEAEs were somnolence, headache, and dizziness with most TEAEs being mild or moderate in intensity . Adverse drug reactions attributed to JNJ-42847922 were sleep paral ysis, somnolence, and abnormal dreams. Few subjects reported these events at doses planned for this study and all were self-limited and mild or moderate in intensity . Based on the short half-life of JNJ-42847922, no accumulation of study drug is expected. (Refer to Section 1.1.2 , Clinical Studies, and the JNJ-42847922 I nvestigator’s Brochure21for additional details).

The information obtained to date regarding JNJ-42847922 suggests that the potential benefits to patients with MDD in fulfilling an unmet medical need outweigh the identified (ie, ADRs) and potentia l risks (see Adverse Events of Special Interest in Section 9.7, Safety Evaluations) at the doses selected for further investigation. 2.

Hypothesis The primary hypothesis of this study is that,in adult subjects with MDD who have had an inadequate response to treatment with an SSRI /SNRI , adjunctive treatment with JNJ-42847922 will delay the time to all-cause discontinuation of study drug when compared to adjunctive treatment with quetiapine XR . 3. STUDY DESIGN A ND RA TIONA LE 3.1. Overview of Study Design This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, parallel -group, flexible -dose, 6-month (24-week) study in adult subjects with MDD who have an inadequate response to current antidepressant therap y with an SSRI /SNRI. The study will consist of 3 phases: an up to 4-week screening phase, a 6-month double -blind treatment phase, and a 2-week follow -up phase culminating in a follow -up/end-of-study visit. Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either flexibl ydosed JNJ-42847922 (20 or 40 mg) or flexibl ydosed quetiapine XR (150 or 300 mg) as adjunctive therap y to their current SSRI or SNRI .

Screening Phase After providing written informed consent and within 4 weeks prior to randomization, outpatient subjects experiencing a major depressive episode will be screened to evaluate their eligibility for study participation. To be eligible for the stud y, subjects must meet the following criteria: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5th Edition (DSM -5) diagnostic criteria for MDD, without psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 Axis I Disorders –Clinical Trials Version (SCI D-CT). MADRS total score ≥25 at screening and must not demonstrate a clinically significant improvement (ie, an improvement of >20% on their MADRS total score) from the screening to baseline visit. It is expected that there will be a minimum of 5 days between screening and baseline MADRS. Inadequate response to at least 1 but no more than 3antidepressants, administered at an adequate dose and duration (at least 4 weeks) in the current episode of depression, as assessed by the Massachusetts General Hospital -Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (MGH -ATRQ). See Section 9.1.2 , Screening Phase, for additional details on screening procedures . Double -Blind Treatment Phase At the start of the study , subjects will be randomized to receive either JNJ-42847922 or quetiapine XR once daily taken orally while continuing their current antidepressant on which they have had an inadequate response at the time of screening. The assigned study drug will be self-administered at bedtime by the subject at home. Study procedures during the double -blind treatment phase to assess efficacy , safety , tolerability , compliance, and other evaluations (eg, PK and biomarker) will occur as per the Time and Events Schedule. Subjects will be seen at the study site at baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 of the double -blind phase. A telephone interview will be conducted atthe end ofWeek 1to collect AEs and assess any other issues with tolerability to the study medication . See Section 9.1.3 , Double -blind Treatment Phase for additional details. End-of-Study /Follow -UpVisit All subjects will return to the study site for a follow -up visit within 7 to 14 day s after completion of the double -blind phase. At the follow -up visit, safety assessments/procedures will be completed per the Time and Events Schedule. If a subject prematurely withdraws from the study , the End-of-Study Visit assessments should be performed as soon as possible."

See Section 9.1.4 End-of- Study Visit /Follow- Upfor additional details. Study Evaluations The primary endpoint of this study is time to all-cause discontinuation of study drug. The investigator will be required to complete a detailed summary of the discontinuation, such as reasons and times, utilizing the CRF page. If it is caused by anAE, the clinical course of the AE and the outcome ( recovered, resolving, or ongoing) of the AE should be documented. The efficacy of the study drugs (JNJ-42847922 and quetiapine XR) will be evaluated using the MADRS (SIGMA version ),SIGH-A (HAM -A), CGI-S, SDMT, TMT- Part B, HVLT -R, PGI-S, PROMI S-SD (Short F orm 8a), PROMI S-SRI (Short Form 8a), SMDDS, QLDS, and CSD -M. These evaluations will be performed at the timepoints specified in the Time and Events Schedule. The safet y and tolerability of the study drug will be evaluated throughout the study . In addition to standard/routine assessments, the safety assessment in this study will include the ASEX, ESRS -A, C-SSRS, and PWC. Medical resource utilization will be assessed using the HRUQ. Blood samples for PK and biomarker evaluation will be collected on the study visits specified in the Time and Events Schedule. Evening and morning salivary cortisol samples will be collected by subjects at home, on the day s specified in the Time and Events Schedule. Blood samples for genetic research will be collected from subject s who consent separately to this component of the study to allow for the identification of genetic and/or epigenetic factors that may influence the PK, efficacy , safet y, or tolerability of JNJ-42847922 and to identify genetic and/or epigenetic factors associated with MDD. Subject participation in genetic research is optional. 3.2. Study Design Rationale Study Population In the context of mood disorders, sleep disturbances (both insomnia and hypersomnia) have been associated with a suboptimal response to antidepr essant drug therapy , an increased risk for relapse (in antidepressant -responsive patients), and prodromal depression.6,7,23,24,58While the orexin system promotes wakefulness, increasingly it is also associated with hyperarousal5and motivati onal behaviors.48Hyperarousal characterizes a major subgroup of patients with MDD.15 OX2R antagonists may have utility to normalize hy perarousal in patients with MDD and thereb y have an antidepressant effect independent from their utility as hypnotics. Therefore, OX2R antagonists, such as JNJ-42847922 may have clinical efficacy in the treatment of MDD, CCI"

The study population will include adult men andWONCBP (aged 18 to 70 years, inclusive) who meet DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for MDD (confirmed by the SCID-CT),14and who have had an inadequate response to current antidepressant therapy with an SSRI /SNRI (administered at an adequate dose and duration in the current episode). Unlike many other mental disorders, the age of onset of depression has a wide range, with a median onset of early to mid-20s, although significant proportions of patients may experience onset between late adolescence to late adulthood. Women have a two-fold increased risk of depression over men, and separation and divorce are additional risk factors across the s exes.27 Definitive GLP studies in pregnant rats and rabbits to evaluate the effects of JNJ-42847922 on embry o-fetal development have been completed. JNJ-42847922 did not induce any developmental alterations (external, visceral, and skeletal) in the fetuses. However, a female rat fertility study suggested a reduction in female fertility . Since it is not know n what the relevance of these findings are to a woman’s abilit y to become pregnant after taking JNJ-4284792 2, WOCBP will not be included in this study until more is learned about the effect of JNJ-42847922 on female reproduction. Blinding, Control, Treatment Groups Quetiapine XR will be included as an active comparator to investigate potential differentiating features between JNJ-42847922 and quetiapine XR. While 3 drugs (quetiapine, aripiprazole, and brexpiprazole) have been approved in the US for the adjunctive treatment of MDD, quetiapine XR is the only drug approved for the same indication in the EU. The data collected from this study will be used to guide phase 3 studies and these studies will be international studies. Quetiapine XR isalso most likely to maintain the blind with JNJ-42847922 in that both drugs cause sleep and sedation, while aripiprazole and brexpiprazole do not. Unlike JNJ-42847922, the other 2 drugs cause significant akathisia which would also potentially unblind them from JNJ -42847922. Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment groups, to increa se the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg,demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Blinded treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints. To test the hypothesis that JNJ-42847922 improves depressive symptoms in subjects with and without significant insomnia, randomization will be stratified and rough ly balanced between subjects with a baseline ISI score <15 (subclinical or no clinically significant insomnia) and ≥15 (moderate to severe insomnia). This distribution will approximately mimic the prevalence of significant insomnia in representative samples of subjects with MDD reported in the literature,"

Dose and Dose Administration Interval The JNJ-42847922 do ses selected for the study are: 20 and 40 mg. The doses chosen are within the range shown to be well tolerated in the Phase 1 studies. Subjects randomized toJNJ-42847922 will begin dosing at the 20 mg dose. After the initial dosing period, dose adjustments may be made starting with the first scheduled clinic visit (Day 14). The first dose adjustment must be upwards. Subsequent adjustments may be made upwards or downwards within the study dose range (20 or 40 mg) if necessary , depending upon the investigator’s assessment of the subject’s clinical response and tolerability . While there were no reports of severe somnolence reported in subjects exposed to JNJ-42847922, 40 mg was selected as the upper dose limit in this study to evaluate the efficacy of JNJ-42847922 in the adjunctive treatment of MDD.

DNA and Biomarker Collection It is recognized that genetic variation can be an important contributory factor to interindividual differences in drug distribution and response and can also serve as a marker for disease susceptibility and prognosis. Pharmacogenomic research may help to explain interindividual variability in clinical outcomes and may help to identify population subgroups that respond differentl y to a drug. The goal of the pharmacogenomic component is to collect DNA to allow the identification of genetic and/or epigenetic factors that may influence the PK, efficacy , safety , or tolerability of JNJ-42847922 and to identify genetic and/or epigenetic factors associated with MDD. Specifically , genetic and epigenetic changes in genes known to be in pathway s relevant to depression (HPA axis, inflammation, growth factors, monoamine transporters, ion channels, circadian rh ythm) will be evalua ted. Increasingl y, it is recognized that psychiatric disorders may be associated with altered immune/metabolic activation patterns. Blood and saliva samples will be collected to explore biomarkers related to immune system activity , HPA axis activation, and neurotropic factors (including but not limited to growth factors, inflammation, or endocrine markers). Many of these factors may be influenced by stage of menstrual cycle in women; therefore, menstrual cycle will be tracked in premenopausal women during the study , by the subject’s verbal report. Biomarker samples may help to explain interindividual variability in clinical outcomes or identify population subgroups that respond differently to JNJ-42847922. DNA and biomarker samples may be used to help addres s emerging issues and to enable the development of safer, more effective, and ultimatel y individualized therapies. Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics In subjects who have shown an inadequate response to their current antidepressant therapy , adjunctive treatment with JNJ-42847922 versus quetiapine XR may result in lower utilization of services (ie, outpatient visits, emergency room visits or hospitalization) as assessed using the HRUQ. The HRUQ includes information regarding utilization of healthcare services, including the timing of services, enabling changes in level and quantity of services to be considered as a variable in economic models.

All currentl y approved drugs indicated for adjunctive therap y in patients with MDD (including quetiapine, aripiprazole, and brexipi prazole) belong to the atypical antipsy chotic family that are associated with SAEs such as NMS andtardive dyskinesia, and more commonly associated with risks such as EPS, akathisia, weight gain, hypergl ycemia/diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. These serious tolerability issues may lead to medication non-adherence or treatment discontinuati on. JNJ-42847922 was well tolerated and not associated with any of these AEs based on clinical studies completed to date. JNJ-42847922 as an adjunctive therapy for MDD may have comparable efficacy anda lower over-all discontinuation rate when compared to quetiapine XR. Though antidepressant response may occur over 4to 6 weeks (the length of a typical short -term trial for MDD), patients usuall y are treated for at least 6-12 months to prevent a recurrence of the MDD episode after successful treatment. Hence, long-term persistence on treatment (a combination of efficacy and tolerability ) is important for the long-term treatment of patients with MDD. Secondary Efficacy Meas ures MADRS : The 10-item clinician -administered MADRS was designed to be used in subjects with MDD to measure the overall severit y of depressive symptoms.33The MADRS scale has been selected as a secondary endpoi nt for this study because it is validated, reliable, and acceptable to regulatory health authorities as a primary scale to determine efficacy in major depression. The structure interview guide version (SIGMA) will be used in this study . The SIGMA has been shown to achieve high reliability of MADRS scores in evaluating patients with depression.60 CGI -Sand PGI -S:The CGI-S and PGI -S will be used to allow assessment of minimal clinically important difference using an anchor based approach calculated from the global impressions of the clinician and the subject.9,16,17,45 SIGH -A(HAM -A): The original 14-item clinician -administered HAM -A scale assesses the severit y of different anxiety -related symptoms. It is a commonly used, validated scale in clinical trials assessing anxiety .18,19However, the original HAM -A lacks instructions for administration and clear anchor points for the assignment of severity ratings. For this reason, the structured interview guide version (SIGH-A) will be used in this study . The SIGH-A has been shown to have high inter -rater and test -retest reliability and produced similar but consistently higher (+4.2) scores compared to the original HAM -A. Correlation with a self-report measur e of overall anxiety has also been shown to be high.59 PROMIS -SD (short form 8a) and PROMIS -SRI (short form 8a):The PROMI S-SD (Sleep Disturbance) instruments assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality , sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep. This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting"

The Sleep Disturbance short form is univers al rather than disease -specific. It assesses sleep disturbance over the past seven day s. The PROMI S-SRI (Sleep -Related Impairment) scale consists of 8 items. The adult Sleep -Related Impairment item bank focuses on self -reported perceptions of alertness, sl eepiness, and tiredness during usual waking hours, and the perceived functional impairments during wakefulness associated with sleep problems or impaired alertness. The Sleep -Related Impairment short form is universal rather than disease -specific. It asses ses sleep -related impairment over the past seven days. QLDS : The QLDS is a disease specific patient reported outcome (PRO )designed to assess health related quality of life in patients with MDD . SMDDS : The SMDDS is a 16-item instrument which assesses patient-reported symptoms associated with MDD .41,42,43,47,56It is a newl y developed PRO developed according to the latest standards for PRO development. Initial measurement properties of the SMDDS have been assessed in a quantitative pilot study .11Data from this non-interventional study indicate that the SMDDS has good measurement properties including internal (Crohbach’s Alpha 0.929) and test retest reliability (ICC 0.848 and Pearson’s r 0.850), and convergent construct and known groups validi ty. Sensitivity to change and interpretation of an important clinical change have yet to be evaluated for this new assessment. Its content addresses concepts of negative emotions, anxiety , low energy , cognition, sleep disturbance, eating behavior, low motivation, self-blame and self- harm or suicide ,which represent issues identified during item generation process with subjects with MDD. Subjective sleep parameters : Subjects will be asked to provide answers to questions to determine their subjective experien ce of sleep by recording their answers in a daily sleep diary (CSD -M). SDMT :The SDMT is a widel y used, paper -and-pencil assessment of complex scanning and visual tracking, requiring elements of attention, visuoperceptual processing, working memory , and cognitive/psy chomotor speed.53The test is viewed as a robust screening test for adult neurops ychological impairment52and is sensitive to impairments in cognitive fun ction associated with MDD .4 TMT -Part B: The TMT -Part B measures divided attention and executive function (tracking and sequencing) and is sensitive to cognitive decline associated with MDD.54 HVLT -R:The HVLT -R, a measure of verbal learning and memory , is a 12-item word list recall test. Administration includes 3 learning trials, a delay ed recall (20-minute) trial, and a 24-word recognition list (including 12 target and 12 foil words).4The test administrator reads instructions and word lists aloud, and records words recalled/recognized by the subject. Scores include learning, delay ed recall, and recognition. The HVLT -R is awell-validated and widely used measure of verbal episodic memory ."

Pharmacokinetic Assessments Blood samples of approximately 3mL will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of JNJ-42847922 and the metabolites M12 and M16 (as applicable) in the morning of Day s 42, 84 and Day 168, within 12 hours after the previous dose. Safety Evaluations Standard safet y evaluations including collectio n of AEs and concomitant medications, physical examination, body weight, waist circumference, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, urine drug test, alcohol breath test, pregnancy testing, and clinical laboratory tests will be performed to monitor subject safet y throu ghout the study . The homeostatic model assessment will be conducted to estimate changes in beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity . The model requires both glucose and insulin measurements. It is known that atypical antipsy chotic medications, including quetiapine XR,may cause insulin resistance; at present, there is no evidence that JNJ-42847922 has an y impact on glucose metabolism. Emergence of suicidal ideation will be assessed using the C-SSRS. The C-SSRS has been used frequentl y in clinical studies and it is a standard measure for suicidal ideation assessment; its use is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance.57 The effect on sexual functioning will be measured by the ASEX. The ASEX has shown satisfactory reliability and validity .32 Drug -induced EPS will be monitored using the ESRS -A. The ESRS -A is an abbreviated manualized version of the ESRS, a semi -structured interview that rates parkin sonian symptoms, dystonia, dyskinesias, and akathisia over the previous 7 days.10The ESRS -A is being included since the comparator medication, quetiapine XR, is an antipsy chotic with the potential to cause EPS and akathisia. In addition, potential withdrawal effects will be assessed by the clinician using the PWC. The PWC is a reliable and sensitive instrument for the assessment of discontinuation symptoms.46 Adverse Events of Special Interest Prior studies with DORAs (eg, suvorexant) suggest that such agents may precipitate cataplex y (sudden, transient episode of muscle weakness accompanied by conscious awareness) and sleep paral ysis (the experience of not being able to move, react, or speak when falling asleep/awakening). Animal studies suggest that cataplex y may be a liability for DORAs, but not for OX2R -selective antagonists.13To date, 3 cases of sleep paral ysis have bee n observed with JNJ-42847922: Complex, sleep -related behaviors/parasomnias such as confusional arousals, somnambulism (sleep walking), sleep terrors, bruxism (teeth grinding), sleep sex, sleep related eating disorder, sleep behavior disorder, and catathrenia (REM associated CCI"

For these reasons, cataplex y, sleep paral ysis, and complex, sleep -related behaviors (parasomnias) are considered AEs of special interest in this study . 4. SUBJECT POPULA TION Screening for eligible subjects will be performed within 4 weeks before administration of the study drug. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolling subjects in this study are described in the following 2 subsections. If there is a question about the inclusion or exclusion criteria below, the investigator must consult with the appropriate sponsor representative and resolve any issues before enrolling a subject in the study . Waivers are not allowed. Exceptional and limited retesting of abnormal screening value s (particularly, if the initial laboratory testing wasnot done under fasting conditions) that would otherwise lead to exclusion may be allowed after discussion and approval by the sponsor during the screening phase (to reassess eligibility ). This should only be considered if there is no anticipated impact on subject safet y.

Such subjects may be discontinued or advised not to drive or operate machinery . 5. TREA TMENT ALLOCA TION AND BLINDING Treatment Allocation Procedures for Randomization and Stratification Central randomization will be implemented in this study . Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2treatment groups based on a computer -generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by or under the supervision of the sponsor. The randomization will be balanced by using randoml y permuted blocks and will be stratified by insomnia status (significant insomnia symptoms [ISI score ≥15]2at baseline versus no significant insomnia symptoms [ISI score <15] at baseline) . The interac tive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique treatment code, which will dictate the treatment assignment and matching study drug kit for the subject. The requestor must use his or her own user identification and personal identification number when contacting the IWRS, and will then give the relevant subject details to uniquely identify the subject. Blinding To maintain the study blind, the study drug container will have a label containing the study name, study drug number, and reference number .The label will not identify the study drug in the container. However, if it is necessary for a subject's safet y, the study blind may be broken and the identity of the study drug ascertained. The study drugnumber will be entered in the case report form (CRF) when the study drug is dispensed. The study drugs will be identical in appearance and will be packaged in identical containers. The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained within the IWRS, which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the blind for an individual subject. Data that may potentially unblind the treatment assignment (ie, study drug concentrations, study drug preparation/accountability data, treatment allocation, and biomarker or other specific laboratory data) will be handled with special care to ensure that the integrit y of the blind is maintained and the potential for bias is minimized. This can include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by the investigators, clinical team, or others as appropriate until the time of database lock and unblinding. In particular, data regarding"

Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken until all subjects have completed the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the blind should be broken only if specific emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by knowing the treatment status of the subject. In such cases, the investiga tor may in an emergency determine the identity of the treatment by contacting the I WRS. It is recommended that the investigator contact the sponsor or its designee if possible to discuss the particular situation, before breaking the blind. Telephone contac t with the sponsor or its designee will be available 24hours per day, 7days per week. In the event the blind is broken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, time, and reason for the unblinding must be documented in the appropriate section of the CRF, andin the source document. The documentation received from the IWRSindicating the code break must be retained with the subject's source documents in a secure manner . Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unblinded are requi red to return for an end-of- study visit. 6.

This should only be considered if there is no anticipated impact on subject safet y. Subjects must discontinue all prohibited psychotropic medications as described in Section 8, Prestudy and Concomitant therapy , before Day 1 of the study . 9.1.3. Double -Blind Treatment Phase Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and who have completed all screening procedures will be randomized to recei ve either JNJ-42847922 or quetiapine XR once daily taken orally while continuing their current antidepressant on which they have had an inadequate response at the time of screening. The assigned study drug will be self-administered at bedtime by the subjec t at home. All subjects randomized to JNJ-42847922 will receive 20 mg as a starting dose. Subjects randomized to quetiapine XR will receive 50 mg once daily for 2 days, followed by an increase to 150 mg once dail y on Day 3, as per prescribing guidelines in the product label. After the initial dosing period, dose adjustments may be made starting with the first scheduled clinic visit (Day 14). The first dose adjustment must be upwards. Subsequent adjustments may be made upwards or downwards within the study dose ranges (20 or 40 mg for subjects randomized to JNJ- 42847922 or 150 or 300 mg for subjects randomized to quetiapine XR) if necessary , depending upon the investigator’s assessment of the subject’s clinical response and tolerability . Adjustments of dose should only be made after a clinic visit (if needed may be an unscheduled visit) and assessment of efficacy and tolerability of the medication. If the dose is changed, then at a minimum the CGI -S, PGI -S, and SMDDS should be collected along with the ESRS -A. Study procedures during the double -blind treatment phase to assess efficacy , safety , tolerability , compliance, and other evaluations (eg, PK and biomarker) will occur as per the Time and Events Schedule.

A telephone interview will be conducted at the end of Week 1to collect AEs and assess any other issues with tolerability to the study medication. 9.1.4. End-of-Study Visit /Follow -Up Visit All subj ects will return to the study site for a follow -up visit within 7 to 14 day s after completion of the double -blind phase. At the follow -up visit, safety assessments/procedures will be completed per the Time and Events Schedule. If a subject prematurel y withdraws from the study , the End-of-Study Visit assessments should be performed as soon as possible. At the start of the follow -up phase, further clinical/standard of care for the treatment of depression will be arranged by the study investigator and/or the subject’s treating phy sician. The study will be considered completed after the final study visit (Week 26) for the last subject participating in the stud y. The duration of participation in the study for an individual subject (including screening and follo w-up visit) will be up to 30 weeks. 9.2. Efficacy Evaluations The following efficacy assessments will be performed at the timepoints indicated in the Time and Events Schedule. The MADRS (SIGMA) and CGI-S will be administered by independent, centralized remote raters; the SIGH-A(HAM -A), SDMT, TMT-Part B, and HVLT -R will be administered by the investigators or designee; and thePGI-S,PROMI S-SD (Short Form 8a), PROMI S-SRI (Short Form 8a), SMDDS, QLDS , and CSD -Mwill be completed by the subjects. 9.2.1. Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MA DRS) The MADRS will be performed by independent, centralized remote raters during the study . The MADRS is a clinician -administered scale designed to measure depression severit y and detects changes due to antidepressant treatmen t.33The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. The test exhibits high int er-rater reliability . The t ypical recall period for the MADRS is 7 day s. 9.2.2. Clinical Global Impression -Severity (CGI -S) The CGI-S will be completed by independent, centralized remote raters during the study . The CGI-S provides an overall clinician -determined summary measure of the severity of the subject’s illness that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the subject’s history , psychosocial circumstances, s ymptoms, behavior, and the impact of the sy mptoms on the subject’s abilit y to function.17The CGI-S evaluates the severity of psy chopathology on a scale of 1 to 7. Considering total clinical experience with the depression population, a subject is assessed on severit y of illness at th e time of rating according to: 1=normal (not at all ill); 2=borderline ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedl y ill; 6=severel y ill; 7=among the most extremely ill"

The CGI-S permits a global evaluation of the subject's condition at a given time. For an experienced rater, the time required to complete the CGI -S is less than 1 minute. 9.2.3. Patient Global Impression -Severity (PGI -S) The PGI-S is a self-report scale to measure severity of illness (1=none, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe).45Considering all aspects of depression, subjects will rate their severit y on the PGI-S. Its completion time is less than 1 minute. 9.2.4. Structured Interview Guide Version (SIGH -A) Hamilton A nxiety Rating Scale (HA M-A) The origin al 14-item clinician -administered HAM -A scale assesses the severity of different anxiety -related symptoms. It is a commonl y used, validated scale in clinical trials assessing anxiety .18,19However, the original HAM -A lacks instructions for administration and clear anchor points for the assignment of severity ratings. For this reason, the structured interview guide version (SIGH -A)will be used in this study . The SIGH-Ahas been shown to have high inter- rater and test-retest reliability and produced similar but consistently higher (+4.2) scores compared to the original HAM -A. Correlation with a self-report measure of overall anxiety has also been shown to be high .59 9.2.5. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Sy stem -Sleep Disturbance (PROMIS -SD) and Sleep -Related Impairment (PROMIS - SRI) Short Form s Developed under a National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative, the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System captures self-reported, qualitative health aspects in the domains of phy sical, mental, and social health.64 The PROMI S-SD Short Form subscale consists of a static 8 item questionnaire. The PROMI S-SDinstruments assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality , sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep. This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting to sleep or staying asleep, as well as perceptions of the adequacy of and satisfaction with sleep. Sleep Disturbance does not focus on symptoms of specific sleep disorders, nor does it provide subjective estimates of sleep quantities (total amount of sleep, time to fall asleep, amount of wake fulness during sleep). The Sleep Disturbance short form is universal rather than disease - specific. It assesses sleep disturbance over the past seven days. Its completion time is estimated to be less than 5 minutes. The PROMI S-SRI Short Form subscale consis ts of a static 8 item questionnaire. The PROMI S adult Sleep -Related Impairment item bank focuses on self-reported perceptions of alertness, sleepiness, and tiredness during usual waking hours, and the perceived functional impairments during wakefulness associated with sleep problems or impaired alertness. Though Sleep -Related Impairment does not directly assess cognitive, affective, or performance impairment, it does measure waking alertness, sleepiness, and function within the context of overall sleep -wake function. The Sleep -Related Impairment short form is universal rather than disease -specific. It"

Quality of Life in Depression Scale (QL DS) The QLDS is a disease specific PRO designed to assess health related quality of life in patients with MDD .20The instrument has a recall period of ""at the moment"", contains 34-items with ""yes""/""no"" response options and takes approximately 5to 10 minutes to complete. The score range is from 0 (good quality of life) to 34 (very poor quality of life). 9.2.7. Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder Scale (SMDDS) The SMDDS assesses patient -reported symptoms associated with MDD .41,42,43,47,56The targe t population includes adults (aged 18 and older) with a clinical diagnosis of MDD who are being treated in an ambulatory setting. The SMDDS has been developed in a patient sample including both males and females, varying levels of age, race, education, marital status, and severity . This 16-item instrument has a 7 -day recall period, and subjects respond to each question using a rating scale between 0 (“Not at all” or “Never”) to 4 (“Extremely ” or “Alway s”). The total score ranges from 0 to 60 with a higher s core indicating more severe depressive s ymptomatology . 9.2.8. Subjective Sleep Parameters (Consensus Sleep Diary -Morning Administration [CSD -M]) Subjects will be asked to provide answers to questions to determine their subjective experience of sleep by recording their answers in a daily sleep diary (CSD -M).The CSD -M is the only sleep diary developed with rigorous methodology for patient reported outcome development, including employ ing user/focus group feedback and expert feedback to establish construct validity .It has undergone psychometric testing and its content validity has been confirmed by patient focus groups.8The parameters recorded include: self-reported sleep onset latency (sSOL) subjective TST (sTST) subjective WASO (sWASO) subjective number of nighttime awakenings (s nNAW) subjective quality of sleep (sQUAL) subjective refreshed feeling on waking (sFRESH) 9.2.9. Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) The SDMT is a widely used, paper -and-pencil assessment of complex scanning and visual tracking, requiring elements of attention, visuoperceptual processing, working memory , and cognitive/ps ychomotor speed.53The test is viewed as a robust screening test for adult neurops ychological impairment52and is sensitive to impairments in cognitive function associated with MDD .4The SDMT measures the time to pair abstract symbols with specific numbers. The test includes a coding key consisting of 9 abstract symbols, each paired with a number ranging"

Following the key, the subject is presented with randoml y ordered symbols and is required to write the number corresponding to each symbol as fast as possible. The number of correct substitutions within 90 seconds is recorded. 9.2.10. Trail Making Test Part B (TMT -Part B) The TMT -Part B measures divided attention and executive function (tracking and sequencing). The subject is instructed to draw a line to connect a set of 25 consecutively numbered and lettered circles, alternating sequentiall y between numbers and letters (ie, 1-A-2-B). The subject is instructed to work as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy . The TMT -Part B has acceptable reliability ; reliability coefficients have typicall y been reported as exceeding 0.65.29The TMT -Part B is sensitive to cognitive decline associated with MDD.54 9.2.11. Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised (HVLT -R) The HVLT -R, a measure of verbal learning and memory , is a 12-item word list recall test. Administration includes 3 learning trials, a delay ed recall (20-minute) trial, and a 24-word recognition list (including 12 target and 12 foil words).4The test administrator reads instructions and word lists aloud, and records words recalled/recognized by the subject. Scores include learning, delay ed recall, and recognition. The HVLT -R is a well-validated and widely used measure of verbal episodic memory . 9.3. Pharmacokinetics Blood samples of approximately 3mL will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of JNJ-42847922 and the metabolites M12 and M16 as described bel ow: Day 42, Day 84and Day 168 PK sampling A single sample will be collected in the morning of Visits 6, 7and 9 within 12 hours after the previous dose . As this is a blinded study , blood samples for PK will be collected from quetiapine -dosed subjects, but not analy zed for PK. These samples will be stored and may be analyzed if needed (eg, suspicion of an incorrect dose). Genetic analy ses will not be performed on these plasma samples. Note that there are no dietary restrictions or fasting requirements prior to blood collection for PK assessments. Subject confidentiality will be maintained. Additional information about the collection, handling, and shipment of biological samples can be found in the Laboratory Manual. The exact time of PK blood sample collec tion must be recorded, along with all concomitant medications (dose, drug, start and stop date). The exact date and time of the last administration of study drug before the PK sample will be recorded. The exact time of the last meal intake prior to dosing before PK sampling on Days42, 84and168 will also be recorded."

Analytical Procedures Pharmacokinetics Plasma samples will be analy zed to measure concentrations of JNJ-42847922 and the metabolite M12 using a validated, specific, and sensitive liquid chrom atograph y/mass spectrometry /mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method by or under the supervision of the sponsor. The metabolite M16 will be analy zed using a scientificall y validated method. 9.3.2. Pharmacokinetic Parameters Concentration -time data will be graphicall ydisplay ed by dose, visit date and time (relative to dose) for JNJ -42847922, M12, and M16 and summarized using descriptive statistics. 9.4. Biomarkers Venous blood samples will be collected for the assessment of biomarkers as indicated in the Time and Events Schedule. To avoid interference caused by lipid content in blood specimens collected for biomarker evaluation, biomarker samples will be collected under fasting conditions (for a minimum of 8 hours, water permitted). Saliva samples for the measurement of cortisol concentrations will be collected by using an oral swab method just before bedtime (before dosing) and upon awakening as indicated in the Time and Events Schedule. Cortisol concentration has a strong diurnal pattern, with peak concentrations present upon awakening and low concentrations in the evening hours. Collection of saliva cortisol samples (which correlate well with serum concentrations) allows for collection at home with a low subject burden. Subjects should not consume alcoholic beverages forat least 12 hours prior to saliva sampling. Food, drinks (except water), and oral care (brushing, flossing, mouthwash) are not permitted 1 hour prior to the saliva collection. Biomarker analy ses will include (but are not limited to) markers related to theimmune system activity , growth factors, metabolic, and HPA axis activation, to allow for exploratory assessment of drug-clinical response relationship, to explain interindividual variability in clinical outcomes, and to identify population subgroups that respond differentl y to treatment. Biomarkers may be added or deleted based on scientific information or technical innovations under the condition that the total volume of blood collected will not be increased. All biomarker data obtained during this study may be included in ongoing cross -study analyses to investigate the relationship between depression severit y and phenot ypes and biomarkers. Fasting status at the time of biomarker blood collection will be noted on the laboratory requisition form and/or theCRF, along with any incidence of illness or allergy during the previous 2 weeks. Information about alcohol consumption within 12 hours prior to saliva sampling (including amount/ty pe of alcohol consumed) will be recorded on the CRF. I n addition, for preme nopausal women, the average length of menstrual cycle (days) and first day of last period will be recorded on the CRF."

Pharmacogenomic (DNA ) Evaluations A pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected from subjects who consent separatel y to this component of the study (where local regulations permit) to allow for additional research. DNA samples will be analy zed for the identification of genetic and/or epigenetic factors that may influence the PK, efficacy , safet y, or tolerability of JNJ-42847922 and to identify genetic and/or epigenetic factors associated with MDD. Epigenetic changes in genes known to be relevant to depression (HPA axis, inflammation, growth factors, monoamine transporters, ion channels, circadian rhythm) may be evaluated. Additional analy ses may be conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help resolve issues with the clinical data. Subject participation in the pharmacogenomic research is optional and will not affect the abilit y of a subject to participate in this study . DNA samples will be used for research related to JNJ- 42847922 and MDD. They may also be used to develop tests/assay s related to JNJ-42847922 and MDD. Pharmacogenomic research may consist of the analysis of 1 or more candidate genes or of the analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome or analy sis of the entire genome (as appropriate) in relation to JNJ-42847922 and MDD clinical endpoints. Analy ses may be performed across multiple studies. 9.6. Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics Medical resource utiliz ation data, associated with medical encounters, will be collected using the HRUQ during the double -blind and follow -up phases of the study . This questionnaire28was designed to assess utilization of the followin g resources: hospitalizat ion (refers to ≥1-night stay ), emergency room visits without hospitalization, day or night clinic stays, outpatient treatment . The questionnaire will be used in the study as an exploratory tool. Study personnel will administer the questionnaire. If possibl e, for a given subject, the same person should administer this scale at all visits. Note that any resource utilization that is required by the protocol should not be captured on the questionnaire. 9.7. Safety Evaluations The collection of AEs and concomitant medications will start after the informed consent has been signed and will continue until the follow -up visit. All safety assessments listed below will be performed as specified in the Time and Events Schedule. Any clinically relevant changes occurring durin g the study must be recorded on the Adverse Event section of the CRF. Any clinically significant abnormalities persisting at the end of the study/earl y withdrawal will be followed b y the investigator until resolution or until a clinically stable endpoint i s reached.

Adverse events will be followed by the investigator as specified in Section 12, Adverse Event Reporting. As with any CNS -active medication, investigators should monitor carefully and document any CNS -related adverse event including tremor, ataxia, abnormal sensation, confusion, or possibility of seizure. Adverse Events of Special Interest The following AEs are consid ered to be of special interest in this study : Cataplex y (sudden, transient episode of muscle weakness accompanied by conscious awareness) Sleep paraly sis (the experience of not being able to move, react, or speak when falling asleep/awakening) Complex, sleep-related behaviors/parasomnias such as confusional arousals, somnambulism (sleep walking), sleep terrors, bruxism (teeth grinding), sleep sex, sleep -related eating disorder, sleep behavior disorder, and catathrenia (REM -associated end-inspiratory apnea/b reath holding) Investigators are instructed to inquire about the occurrence of such events during the collection of AEs at each visit. When reported, the investigator will be required to complete a detailed summary of the event and its clinical course util izing the AE of special interest narrative form as soon as information on the outcome (recovered, resolving, or ongoing) is available. In addition, the AE should be marke d as an AE of special interest in the CRF . Note: If the event meets the seriousness criteria (see Section 12.1.1 ), the Serious Adverse Events Form must also be completed according to the serious adverse events reporting timeline described in Section 12.3.2, ie, within 24 hours of having become aware of the event, even if all details are not available. Clinical Laboratory Tests Blood samples for serum chemistry and hematology and a random urine sample for urinaly sis will be collected. The investigator must review the laboratory results, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the Adverse Event section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents.

Urine drug screens will be done b y the site using a dipstick Alcohol breath test Electrocardiogram (ECG) Twelve -lead ECGs, intended for safet y monitoring, will be recorded in a supine position so that the different ECG intervals (RR, PR, QRS, QT) can be measured. The ECG will be recorded until 4 regular consecutive complexes are available in good readable quality . During the collection of ECGs, subjects should be in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). Subjects should rest in a supine position for at least 5minutes before ECG collection and should refrain from talking or moving arms or legs. If blood sampling or vital sign measurement is scheduled for the same time point as ECG recording, the procedures should be performed in the following order: ECG, vital signs, blood draw. Vital Signs (Pulse/Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Temperature) Blood pressure and pulse/heart rate measurements will be assessed in supine and standing positions with a completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. Supine blood pressure and pulse/heart rate measure ments should be preceded by at least 5minutes of rest in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones), and standing measurements should follow . Standing measurements are to be taken after at least a full minute of standing. In additi on, oral or t ympanic temperature will be measured. Physical Examination The study investigator, or other authorized and appropriatel y qualified designee, will perform the physical examinations. Height will be measured at screening only. Body weight and waist circumference will be measured at screening, and at study visits as outlined in the Time and Events Schedule . Body weight will be measured using a calibrated scale at each visit. Subjects will be weighed at approximately the same time of day on the same scale, wearing underwear and a gown and without shoes; they will be instructed to empty their bladders before being weighed. (Note: if disrobing for weighing is logistically impossible, the subject should be dressed as lightl y as possible, with consisten cy from visit to visit). The scale should be calibrated before the first subject is enrolled at the site. Calibration must be documented in the calibration log."

The measuring tape should be snug, but does not compress the skin, is parallel to the floor, and is not twisted. The measurement should be taken at the end of a normal respiratory expiration. The measurement should be recorded in centimeters to the first decimal point. Additional blood and urine samples may be taken or vital signs and ECGs recorded at the discretion of the investigators as nee ded. Physicians Withdrawal Checklist (PWC) Potential withdrawal effects will be assessed by the 20-item physician withdrawal checklist (PWC).46The PWC is a simple, accurate, reliable, and sensitive instrument f or the assessment of potential withdrawal s ymptoms following cessation of treatment. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) Emergence of suicidal ideation will be assessed using the C-SSRS .The C-SSRS has been used frequentl y in clinical studies, is a standard measure for suicidal ideation assessment, and its use is in accordance with FDA guidance.57 Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) The ASEX is a patient reported five-item rating scale that quant ifies sex drive, arousal, vaginal lubrication/penile erection, ability to reach orgasm, and satisfaction from orgasm. Possible total scores range from 5 to 30, with the higher scores indicating more sexual dysfunction. The scale has shown satisfactory reliability and validity .32 The Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale —Abbreviated (ESRS -A) The ESRS -A is an abbreviated manualized version of the ESRS, a semi -structured interview that rates parkinsonian symptoms, dystonia, dyskinesias, and akathisia over the previous 7 days.10 The ratings include a motor examination for rigidity , tremor, reduced facial expression or speech, impaired gait/posture, postural instability , andbrady kinesia/h ypokinesia. Twenty -four individual items are rated on a 6-point scale: 0=Absent, 1=Minimal, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Severe, or 5=Extreme. Frequency is included as an index of severity . Symptoms are divided into the 4corresponding subscales and each subscale is summarized in a Clinical Global Impression of Movement Severit y (CGI -MS) score. 9.8.

SUBJECT COMPLETION/ DISCONTINUA TION OF S TUDY TREATMENT/ WITHDRA WALFROM THE STUDY 10.1. Completion A subject will be considered to have completed the double -blind phase if he or she has completed assessments at Week 24(ie, Day 168) of the double -blind phase. A subject will be considered to have completed the follow -up phase if he or she has completed assessments at the follow -up vi sit (ie, the visit Days 175 -182). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment for any reason before completion of the double -blind phase will not be considered to have completed the study . 10.2. Withdrawal From the Study Because the primary endpoint ofthis study is time to all-cause discontinuation, investigators should ensure that appropriate withdrawal criteria have been met when withdrawing a subject from the study , especially when subjects are withdrawn due to lack of efficacy . The investigator should complete a detailed summary of the discontinuation, including the reasons for withdrawal and time of the withdrawal, in the CRF and in the source document. If the withdrawal results from an AE, the clinical course of the AE and the outcome (recovered, resolving, or ongoing) of the AE should be documented. A subject will be automatically withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: Lost to follow -up Withdrawal of consent Death Noncompliance with study drug administration (ie, missing either 4 or more consecutive doses of study medication or a total of 20 or more doses during the 6-month period) Investigator's impression of noncompliance with background antidepressant therap y Discontinuation of study treatment for any reason. A subject's study treatment will be automatically discontinued if: The investigator or sponsor believes that for safet y reasons or tolerability reasons (eg,AE) it is in the best interest of the subject to discontinue study treatment The subject becomes pregnant The subject shows signals of acute suicidal ideation with a clear plan at any time during the study ; the subject should be referred to appropriate medical/ps ychiatric care"

If a subject withdraws from the study before the end of the double -blind phase (ie, Day 168), end-of-study /follow -up assessment should be obtained. If a subject is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort must be made by the study -site personnel to contact the subject and determine the reason for discontinuation/withdrawal. The measures taken to follow -up must be documented. If a subject leaves the study due to withdrawal of consent, the investigator will make sure that there is not a reason for the withdrawal of consent such as lack of efficacy or poor tolerance (ie, due to an AE). Study drug assigned to the withdrawn subject may not be assigned to another subject . Subjects who withdraw will not be replaced. 10.3. Withdrawal From the Use of Research Samples A subject who withdraws from the study will have the following options regarding the optional research samples: The collected samples will be retained and used in accordance with the subject's original separate informed consent for optional research samples. The subject may withdraw consent for optional research samples, in which case the samples will be destroy ed and no further testing will take place. To initiate thesample destruction process, the investigator must notify the sponsor study site contact of withdrawal of consent for the optional research samples and to request sample destruction. The sponsor study site contact will, in turn, contact the biomarker repre sentative to execute sample destruction. If requested, the investigator will receive written confirmation from the sponsor that the samples have been destroyed. Withdrawal From the Optional Research Samples While Remaining in the Main Study The subject may withdraw consent for optional research samples while remaining in the study . In such a case, the optional research samples will be destroy ed. The sample destruction process will proceed as described above. Withdrawal From the Use of Samples in Future Rese arch The subject may withdraw consent for use of samples for future research (refer to Section 16.2.5 , Long -Term Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research). In such a case, samples will be destroy ed after they are no longer needed for the clinical study . However, if the subject withdraws consent after the study is over, it is possible that the investigator may have alread y discarded the subject’s medical records that link the subject’s name to his or her study number. In this case, the subject’s samples would no longer be linked to the subject, and it would not be possible to find the subject’s samples for destruction. Details of the sample retention for research are presented in the main I CF and in the separate ICF for optional research samples."

STATISTICA L METHODS Statistical analy sis will be done by the sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. A general description of the statistical methods to be used to anal yze the efficacy and safet y data is o utlined below. Specific details will be provided in the Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) . 11.1. Subject Information The efficacy analyses will be based on the full analy sis set (FAS) which consists of all subjects who were randoml y assigned to stud y drug and rec eived at least 1 dose of study drug. Safety analyses will be based on the safet y analysis set, which consists of all subjects who were randomly assigned to study drug and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The safet y analysis set is the same as the FA S. For all subjects who are randoml y assigned to study drug, descriptive statistics (eg, study completion/withdrawal information, demographic and baseline data) will be provided. 11.2. Sample Size Determination The primary purpose of the study is to investigate potential differentiating features between JNJ-42847922 and quetiapine XR. Although the sample size was not chosen based on a specific set of endpoints, for evaluating the time to discontinuation of study drug in the JNJ-42847922 group versus the quetiapin e XR group, a one-sided log-rank test with an overall sample size of 100subjects (50in the JNJ-42847922 group and 50in the quetiapine XR group) provides approximately 92% power at a1-sided 0.10significance level to detect a hazard ratio of 0.415, assuming the proportion of subjects who discontinue from study drug in the quetiapine XR group is 50%. The planned sample size of the study is consistent with the nature of a Phase 2 exploratory study .67 11.3. Efficacy Analyses The primary efficacy endpoint, time to all-cause discontinuation of study drug, will be estimated by the Kaplan -Meier method and summarized (number of discontinuations, number of censored subjects, median, 25th and 75th percentile, if estimable) by treatment group. Time to all-cause discontinuation of study drug is defined as the number of days from the first dose of study drug to the last dose of study drug. Subjects who complete treatment are not considered to have discontinued. A stratified log-rank test (stratified for baseline insomnia status) will be used to test the hypothesis that there is no difference between the JNJ-42847922 group and quetiapine XR in the probability of discontinuing study drug, using a 1 -sided 0. 10significance level. The analyses for the secondary efficacy endpoints will be described in the SAP. For all other efficacy endpoints, no multiplicity adjustment will be done and nominal p-values will be presented."

ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING Timely , accurate, and complete reporting and analy sis of safety information from clinical studies are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y information; all clinical studies conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates will be conducted in accord ance with those procedures. 12.1. Definitions 12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications Adverse Event An AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AEcan therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investig ational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per International Conference on Harmonisation [I CH]) . This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing of the ICF (refer to Section 12.3.1 , All Adverse Events, for time of last adverse event recording) Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that a t any dose: Results in death Is life -threatening (The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongati on of existing hospitalization Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product Is Medicall y Important*"

These should usually be considered serious. If a serious and unexpected adverse event occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study drug and the event (eg, death from anaph ylaxis), the event must be reported as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of the study endpoint (eg, all -cause mortalit y). Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Refer ence Safety Information An AE is considered unlisted if the nature or severit y is not consistent with the applicable product reference safety information. For JNJ-42847922, the expectedness of an AEwill be determined b y whether or not it is listed in the Investigator's Brochure. For baseline antidepressant therapies (eg, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, milnacipran, levomilnacipran, sertraline, paroxetine, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, vilazodone, or vortioxetine) and quetiapi ne XR with marketing authorization the expectedness of an AEwill be determined by whether or not it is listed in the locally approved SmPC/ PI. Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Drug An AE is considered associated with the use of the drug if th e attribution is possible, probable, or very likely by the definitions listed in Section 12.1.2 , Attribution Definitions . 12.1.2. Attribution Definitions Not Related An AEthat is not related to the use of the drug . Doubtful An AEfor which an alternative explanation is more likely , eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely . Possible An AEthat might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanation, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. Probable An AEthat might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive (eg,confirmed by dechallenge). An alternative explanation is less likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s)."

The relationship in time is very suggestive (eg, it is confirmed by dechallenge and rechallenge). 12.1.3. Severity Criteria An assessment of severity grade will be made using the following general categorical descriptors : Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity . Severe : Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. Prevents normal every day activities. The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit y of events not directly experienced b y the subject (eg, laboratory abnor malities). 12.2. Special Reporting Situations Safety events of interest on a sponsor study drugthat may require expedited reporting or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to: Overdose of a sponsor study drug Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study drug Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study drug Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to the sponsor study drug , eg, name confusion) Exposure to a sponsor study drug from breastfeeding Speci al reporting situations should be recorded in the CRF. Any special reporting situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page of the CRF . 12.3. Procedures 12.3.1. All Adverse Events All AEs and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICFis obtained until completion of the subject's last study -related procedure ,which may include contact for follow -up of safet y. Serious adverse events, including those spontaneousl y reported to the investigator within 30daysafter the last dose of study drug, must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. The sponsor will evaluate any safety"

All events that meet the definition of a serious adverse event will be reported as serious adverse events, regardless of whether they are protocol -specific assessments. Anticipated events will be recorded and reported as described in Attachment 2. AllAEs, regardless of seriousness, severit y, or presumed relationship to study drug, must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the CRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (eg,cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as ""upper respiratory infection""). Investigators must record in the CRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the AEto study therap y. All measures required for AEmanagement must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor instructions. The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reportin g of AEs to the regulatory authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) . For anticipated events reported as individu al serious adverse events the sponsor will make a determination of relatedness in addition to and independent of the investigator’s assessment. The sponsor will periodicall y evaluate the accumulating data and, when there is sufficient evidence and the spon sor has determined there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused a serious anticipated event, they will submit a safet y report in narrative format to the investigators (and the head of the investigational institute where required ). The investigato r (or sponsor where required) must report SUSAR s to the appropriate Independent Ethics Committee/I nstitutional Review Board (IEC/I RB) that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by the IEC/IRB .A SUSAR will be reported to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating investigators and IEC/I RB will receive a blinded SUSAR summary , unless otherwise specified . All subjects will be provided with a ""wallet (study ) card"" and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration of th e study indicating the following: Study number Statement, in the local language(s), that the subject is participating in a clinical study Investigator's name and 24 -hour contact telephone number Local sponsor's name and 24 -hour contact telephone number (for medical staf f onl y) Site number Subject number Any other information that is required to do an emergency breaking of the blind"

Serious A dverse Events All serious adverse events occurring during thestudymust be reported to the appropriate sponsor conta ct person b ystudy -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event. Information regarding serious adverse events will be transmitted to the sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event Form, which must be completed and signed by a physician from the study site, and transmitted to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow -up reports of a serious adverse event should be made by facsimile (fax). All serious adverse events that have not resolved by the end of the study , or that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study , must be followed until any of the following occurs: The event resolves The event stabilizes The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to study conduct It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after demonstration of due diligence with follow -up efforts) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product will be reported as a serious adverse event. Any event requiring hospitalization (or prolongation of hospitalization) that occurs during the course of a subject's participation in a study must be reported as a serious adverse event, except hospitalizations for the following: Hospitalizations not intended to treat an acute illness orAE (eg, social reasons such as pending placement in lo ng-term care facility ) Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the CRF ). Note: Hospitalizations that were planned before the signing of the ICF, and where the underly ing condition for which the hospitalization was planned has not worsened ,will not be considered serious adverse events. Any AEthat results in a prolongation of the originally planned hospitalization is to be reported as a new serious adverse event. The cause of death of a subject in a study within 30 days of the last dose of study drug, whether or not the event is expected or associated with the study drug, is considered a serious adverse event. 12.3.3. Pregnancy All initial reports of pregnancy in female subjects or partners of male subjects must be reported to the sponsor by the study -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomal ies, ectopic pregn ancy ) are considered serious"

A PQC may have an impact on the safet y and ef ficacy of the product. T imely , accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protec tion of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor , and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The sponsor has established procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of PQC information; all studies conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates will be conducted in accordance with those procedures. 13.1. Procedures All initial PQCs must be reported to the sponsor by the study -site personnel within 24 hours after being made aware of the event . If the defect iscombined with a serious adverse event, the study -site personnel must report the PQC to the sponsor according to the serious adverse event reporting timelines (refer to Section 12.3.2 , Serious Adverse Events). Asample of the suspected product should be maintained for further investigation if requested by the sponsor . 13.2.

ETHICA L ASPECTS 16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study and, during the study , subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue partic ipation. They will be told that their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and potential AEs of the study, and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled. The primary ethical concern is that some subjects who could potentially benefit from adjunctive treatment with JNJ-42847922 or queti apine will be randomized to a treatment thatis either not efficacious or where the risks exceed the benefits for that subject. This will be partiall y mitigated by continued background antidepressant therapy throughout the study . CCI"

This 6-month study is intended to better understand the long-term safety and efficacy of JNJ-42847922. Based on currentl y available data, JNJ-42847922 may have similar efficacy , compared to quetiapine XR as an adjunctive treatment of MDD.

Unlike many other mental disorders, the age of onset of depression has a wide range, with a median onset of early to mid-20s, although significant proportions of patients may experience onset between late adolescence to late adulthood. In addition, women have a two-fold increased risk of depression over men, and separation and divorce are additional risk factors across the sexes. Subjects with MDD who have had an inadequate response to current antidepressant therap y with an SSRI /SNRI will be selected, as it is expected that this population will be representative for the targeted subject population for future clinical trials. Also, subjects might benefit from the clinical evaluations and the information collected as part of this study . The results of the investigation of JNJ-42847922 may help future patients with MDD. The spon sor will monitor the study site and records to ensure compliance with the protocol, and that current ICH guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) are followed, and applicable regulatory requirements are adhered to. Subjects will be monitored for safet y and tolerability throughout the study , in accordance with the Time and Events Schedule. In addition, to ensure subject safet y, subjects should be cautioned not to drive or operate machinery or engage in any potentially hazardous activities if they have had less than a full night’s sleep (6-8 hours) following administration of the study drug or at any time during the study if the subject feels that his or her baseline capacity is impaired. At any point during the study , if subjects manifest significant next day sleepiness, they are advised to inform the investigator. Such subjects may be discontinued or advised not to drive or operate machinery . The maximum amount of blood drawn (including retesting) from each subject in this study will not exceed 250 mL, which is considered to be safe and acceptable in comparison to a Red Cross blood donation. 16.2. Regulatory Ethics Compliance 16.2.1. Investigator Responsibilities The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study is performed in accordance with the protocol, current ICH guidelines on GCP, and applicable regulatory and country -specific requirements. Good Clinical Practice is an international ethical and scientific qualit y standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the particip ation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety , and well -being of study subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki ,and that the study data are credible."

After upload of the data into the study database they will be ver ified for accuracy and consistency with the data sources. 17.7. Record Retention In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all CRF and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well asall study documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial, and all study documents as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new custodian. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor ."

Monitoring The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will record dates of the visits in a study site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first post- initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the monitor will compar e the data entered into the CRF with the source documents (eg,hospital/clinic/phy sician’s office medical records) ; a sample may be reviewed .The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the CRF are known to the sponsor and study -site personnel and are accessible for verification by the sponsor study -site contact. If electronic records are maintained at the study site, the method of verification must be discussed with the study -site personnel . Direct access to source document s(medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verify ing that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this review will be discussed with the study -site personnel . The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be available, the source document swill beaccessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct. In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the study at the site. 17.9. Study Completion/Termination 17.9.1. Study Completion /End-of-Study The study is considered completed with the final study visitfor the last subject participating in the study . The final data from the study site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after completion of the final subject visit at that study site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement. 17.9.2. Study Termination The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Study sites will be closed upon study completion.

For the purposes of this study the following events will be considered anticipated events: Suicidal thinking, ideation/ behavior, Sleep changes/difficulty sleeping, reduced sleep, abnormal sleep, tiredness, fatigue, reduced energy, Difficulty in sexual desire, performance or satisfaction, Reduced appetite, weight changes (loss or increase), Irritability, anger, impulsive behavior, Agitation, feeling anxious/anxiety, tension, panic attacks, phobia. Reporting of Anticipated Events All adverse events will be recorded in the CRF regardless of whether considered to be anticipated events and will be reported to thesponsor asdescribed in Section 12.3.1 , All Adverse Events . Any anticipated event that meet s serious adverse event criteria will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section 12.3.2 , Serious Adverse Events. These anticipated events are exempt from expedited reporting as individual single cases toHealth Authorities. However ,if based on an aggregate review, it is determined that an anticipated event is possibly related to study drug, the sponsor will report these events in an expedited manner. Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC) An Anticipate d Event Review Committee (ARC) will be established to perform reviews of pre-specified anticipated events at an aggregate level. The ARC is a safety committee within the sponsor’s organization that is independent of the sponsor’s study team. The ARC will meet to aid in the recommendation to the sponsor’s study team as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that an anticipated event is related to the study drug. Statistical Analysis Details of statistical analysis of anticipated events, including the frequency of review and threshold to trigger an aggregate analysis of anticipated events will be provided in a separate Anticipated Events Safety Monitoring Plan (ASMP)."
