Name of Investigational Product: ALXN1210 Name of Active Ingredient: ALXN1210 Title of Study: A Phase 3, Open -Label Study of ALXN1210 in Children and Adolescents with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) Protocol No: ALXN1210 -PNH -304 EudraCT Number: 2017‐002820‐26 Study Center(s): Approximately 10 investigative sites globally. Length of Study: Estimated date first patient treated: February 2018 Estimated date last patient completed: March 2024 Phase of Development: 3 Objective: The objective s of this study are to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and efficacy of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Study Design and Methodology: This is a Phase 3, open -label, single -arm multicenter study to evaluate the PK/PD, safety, and efficacy of ALXN1210 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion to pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) with PNH. The study consists of a 4 -week Screening Period, a 26 -week Primary Evaluation Period, and an Extension Per iod. Consenting patients will be screened for study eligibility up to 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Patients who satisfy all of the inclusion criteria and all of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the Primary Evaluation Period and receive a weight -based loading dose of ALXN1210 on Day 1, followed by weight -based maintenance treatment with ALXN1210 on Day 15 and once every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or once every 4 weeks (q4w) for patients weighing < 20 kg, for a total of 26 weeks of treatment. For patients entering the study on eculizumab therapy, Day 1 of study treatment will occur 2 weeks from the patient’s last dose of eculizumab. An interim analysis of data, including ALXN1210 PK and free complement component 5 (C5) leve ls, will be conducted after 4 patients weighing ≥ 5 kg to < 40 kg have completed dosing through Day 71. Enrollment of patients will proceed without interruption while the analysis is ongoing. The accrued safety and PK/PD data will be assessed to ensure that ALXN1210 treatment is well tolerated and is providing adequate complement inhibition. Based on this review, the dose regimen may be adjusted. In addition, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data from the study on a regular basis. To support regulatory filings, i nterim analyses may be conducted based on efficacy, safety, PK, PD, and immunogenicity data collected through the end of the 26 -week Primary Evaluation Period (Day 183) after 12 patients are enrolled, and after enrollment is completed. After completion of all pre -dose assessments on Day 183, all patients will enter an Extension Period and continue to receive ALXN1210 according to the appropriate weight -based regimen. The Extension Period will continue until the produc t is registered or approved (in accordance with country- specific regulations) or for up to 4 years, whichever occurs first, except in Norway where the Extension Period will be 4 years. The end of study is defined as the last patient’s last visit or follow -up (whether on site or via phone call) in the Extension Period. Number of Patients (planned): Approximately 13 patients, from birth to < 18 years, will be enrolled to ensure at least 10 evaluable patients complete the 26 -week period. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Patients must meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria. Patients who fail any of the eligibility criteria may be rescreened once for participation. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Male and female patients < 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 5 kg at the time of consent. 2. Documented diagnosis of PNH, confirmed by high- sensitivity flow cytometry evaluation of red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs), with granulocyte or monocyte clone size of ≥ 5%. 3. For patients not currently treated with complement inhibitor, presence of 1 or more of the following PNH -related signs or symptoms within 3 months of Screening: fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath (dyspnea), anemia, history of a major adverse vascular event (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction; or history of packed RBC transfusion due to PNH."

The proportion of patients who develop antidrug antibodies (ADAs) will also be assessed. Statistical methods: Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics : Sparse PK and PD (free C5) samples will be collected over the course of the study. Individual serum concentration data for all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210 and who have evaluable PK data will be used to derive PK parameters for ALXN1210. Graphs of mean serum concentration -time profiles will be constructed. Graphs of serum concentration -time profiles for individual patients may also be generated. Actual dose administration and sampling times will be used for all calculations. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for serum concentration data at each sampling time, as appropriate. Assessment of population -PK may be considered using data from this study or in combination with data from other studies. Pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed for all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210 and who have evaluable PD data. Descriptive statistics will be presented for all ALXN1210 PD endpoints at each sampling time. The PD effects of ALXN1210 administered IV will be evaluated by assessing the absolute values and changes and percentage changes from baseline in total and free C5 serum concentrations and change from baseline in cRBC hemolysis over time, as appropriate. Assessments of ALXN1210 PK/PD relationships may be explored using data from this study or in combination with data from other studies. Analyses will be conducted separately for naïve and previously eculizumab- treated patients. This study is descriptive in nature and not statistically powered for hypothesis testing due to the rarity of disease in pediatric patients. A sample size of 10 should be sufficient to adequately describe PK/PD in pediatric patients with PNH. Efficacy : The efficacy analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210 and have at least 1 postbaseline assessment. All data collected will be presented using summary tables, figures, and data listings. All analyses will be performed using SAS ® release, version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) or other validated statistical software. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including number of observations and mean, S D, median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency counts and percentage of patients. Analyses will be conducted separately for naïve and previously eculizumab- treated patients. Safety : All safety analyses will b e performed on the Safety Set, defined as all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210. The incidence of treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term overall, by severity, and by relationship to treatment. Obse rved values and changes from baseline (last assessment prior to ALXN1210) in ECGs, vital signs, and laboratory assessments, as well as presence of ADA, will be summarized. Shifts from baseline in laboratory assessments will be summarized for all study visi ts."

INTRODUCTION Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a progressive, debilitating, and life-threatening disease characterized by complement -mediated hemolysis, thrombosis, and bone marrow failure. PNH has an estimated worldwide incidence of 1.3 per million populati on (Hill, 2006 ). The onset of PNH is typically in adulthood, with pediatric cases accounting for < 5% of reported cases (Ware, 1991 ). Given the extremely small target population, studies of children with PNH have been limited to case reports, case series, and a small clinical trial (Reiss, 2 014). In adults, the clinical manifestations of PNH include hemoglobinuria, chronic renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, thrombosis, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and dysphagia (Parker, 2005). In contrast, children with PNH usually present with nonspecific symptoms related to the underlying bone marrow disorder, such as pallor, fatigue, or jaundice, with hemoglobinuria appearing less commonly ( Ware, 1991). Clinical eval uation in pediatric patients also reveals bone marrow failure syndromes, such as aplastic anemia and refractory cytopenia (van den Heuvel-Eibrink, 2007). Once the bone marrow disorder is resolved in the child or the PNH clone expands (the cause of which is still unknown), the disease eventually evolves into one more typically seen in adults at presentation. Thus, pediatric patients can be expected to suffer substantial morbidity related to hemolysis, as seen in adult PNH patients ( Parker, 2005). The ALXN1210 clinical program in patients with PNH includes a Phase 3 study in adults with PNH who are naïve to eculizumab therapy, a Phase 3 study in adults with PNH who are stable on eculizumab therapy, a Phase 1b dose- ranging study, and a Phase 2 dose regimen optimization study. Each of these studies also includes a 2 -year extension phase. In addition, a Phase 1 study to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK ) profile of ALXN1210 in healthy Japanese subjects has been completed. In this Phase 3, open-label study, the PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety of ALXN1210 will be assessed in pediatric patients with PNH. The study design rationale is further discussed in Section 7.2. More information about the PK, mechanism of action, known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated adverse events (AEs) of ALXN1210 may be found in the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 5.1. Benefits and Risks Assessment 5.1.1. Potential Benefits As described above, PNH is an ultra-rare, progressive, debilitating, and life-threatening disease, driven by chronic uncontrolled complement activation. The resulting inflammation and cellular damage lead to systemic complications, principally through intravascular hemolysis and thrombophilia ( Brodsky, 2014; Socie, 1996). Chronic intravascular hemolysis due to continuous activation of the complement pathway leads to the release of free hemoglobin, nitric oxide consumption and persistent smooth muscle cell contraction, chronic anemia, and an increased risk of severe thromboembolism. Patients with PNH are at risk of substantial morbidity and mortality and altered quality of life (QoL) . The current standard of care for the treatment of PNH is eculizumab (Soliris®), a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to human complement component 5 (C5) and inhibits the activation of terminal complement."
17,page_17,"Protocol ALXN1210 -PNH -304 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 3 (Global) 22 Apr 2020 Page 17 of 64 CONFIDENTIAL The efficacy and safety of eculizumab for the treatment of PNH are well established. The approved dosage regimen for eculizumab for PNH involves 4 weekly induction doses, followed by maintenance doses administered every 2 weeks starting at Week 5. Given that PNH is a chronic disease, the current eculizumab regimen may significantly affect patients, many of whom have to miss days of work or school to accommodate treatment. In some cases, patients may refuse treatment or may be unable to comply with the treatment frequency of eculizumab. Practice survey research sup ports the assumption that the less frequent infusions associated with ALXN1210 will have a positive impact on daily life for patients and their caregivers. ALXN1210 is a recombinant, humanized mAb derived through minimal targeted engineering of eculizumab by introducing 4 unique amino acid substitutions. ALXN1210 has been designed to have the same rapid onset of action and effective blockade of complement, with an increased serum half -life to yield an increased duration of pharmacologic activity relative to eculizumab. By providing patients and physicians with an option for less frequent dosing, ALXN1210 will allow greater access to care for those patients who may not initiate treatment or may discontinue eculizumab due to frequency of dosing, or patients who are currently on therapy receiving eculizumab every 2 weeks. Additionally, the substantially longer half-life of ALXN1210 is expected to produce sustained terminal complement inhibition during a longer dosing interval. In PNH this may reduce the potential risk of breakthrough, complement- mediated hemolysis, as suggested by preliminary clinical data from the ongoing PNH studies, which demonstrate rapid and sustained reduction in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, a direct measure of hemolytic activity tha t is of comparable magnitude to that seen in studies of eculizumab. 5.1.2. Identified and Potential Risks 5.1.2.1. Meningococcal Infection Increased susceptibility to infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis is a known risk associated with complement inhibition. Similar to eculizumab, the main risk associated with ALXN1210 is the risk of meningococcal infections. Specific risk mitigation measures are in place to address this risk, as described in Section 9.8. 5.1.2.2. Immunogenicity As a humanized mAb, administration of ALXN1210 may be associated with immunogenicity reactions similarly to any therapeutic protein. Monitoring of immunogenicity is in place for this study, as described in Section 7.3 and Section 11.6. 5.1.2.3. Pregnancy Exposure No studies of ALXN1210 have been conducted in pregnant women. Pregnant or nursing female patients are excluded from the clinical trial. Patients enrolled in the study, and a spouse or partner, will use a highly effective or acceptable method of contraception as required in Section 9.11 ."

Study Objectives The objectives of this study are to assess the PK, PD, safety, and efficacy of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with PNH. 6.2. Endpoints 6.2.1. Primary Endpoints • PK/PD parameters (trough and peak) at Baseline and Weeks 2, 10, 18, and 26 − PK: maximum serum concentration (C max), trough serum concentration (measured at end of dosing interval at steady state; C trough), accumulation ratio − PD: change in free C5 concentrations and in chicken red blood cell (cRBC) hemolytic activity over time 6.2.2. Secondary Endpoints • Percentage change in LDH from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26) • Transfusion avoidance (TA), defined as the proportion of patients who remain transfusion -free and do not require a transfusion through Day 183 (Week 26) • Change in quality of life (QoL ), as measured by Pediatric Functional Assessment of Chronic Therapy (FACIT) Fatigue questionnaire (patients ≥ 5 years of age), from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26) • Proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin, defined as avoidance of a ≥ 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin level from baseline in the absence of transfu sion through Day 183 (Week 26) • Percentage change in free hemoglobin from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26) • Proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, defined as at least one new or worsening symptom or sign of intravascular hemolysis (fatigue, hemoglo binuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath [dyspnea], anemia, major adverse vascular event [MAVE, including thrombosis], dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction) in the presence of elevated LDH as follows: − For patients who enter the study naïve to complement inhibitor treatment, elevated LDH ≥ 2 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) after prior LDH reduction to < 1.5 × ULN on therapy − For patients who enter the study stabilized on eculizumab treatment, elevated LDH ≥ 2 × ULN 6.2.3. Safety Endpoints The safety and tolerability of ALXN1210 will be evaluated from baseline to Week 26 and throughout the extension period by physical examinations, vital signs, physical growth (height,"

Summary of Study Design This is a Phase 3, open -label, single- arm multicenter study to evaluate the PK/PD, safety, and efficacy of ALXN1210 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion to pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) with PNH. The study consists of a 4- week Screening Perio d, a 26- week Primary Evaluation Period, and an Extension Period. Consenting patients will be screened for study eligibility up to 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Patients who satisfy all of the inclusion criteria and all of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the Primary Evaluation Period and receive a weight-based loading dose of ALXN1210 on Day 1, followed by weight -based maintenance treatment with ALXN1210 on Day 15 and once every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or once every 4 w eeks (q4w) for patients weighing < 20 kg, for a total of 26 weeks of treatment. For patients entering the study on eculizumab therapy, Day 1 of study treatment will occur 2 weeks from the patient’s last dose of eculizumab. An interim analysis of data, including ALXN1210 PK and free C5 levels, will be conducted after 4 patients weighing ≥ 5 kg to < 40 kg have completed dosing through Day 71. Enrollment of patients will proceed without interruption while the analysis is ongoing. The accrued safety and PK/PD data will be assessed to ensure that ALXN1210 treatment is well tolerated and is providing adequate complement inhibition. Based on this review, the dose regimen may be adjusted. In addition, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review sa fety data from the study on a regular basis. After completion of all pre -dose assessments on Day 183, all patients will enter an Extension Period and continue to receive ALXN1210 according to the appropriate weight-based regimen. The Extension Period will continue until the product is registered or approved (in accordance with country-specific regulations) or for up to 4 years, whichever occurs first, except in Norway where the Extension Period will be 4 years. The end of study is defined as the last patient’s last visit or follow -up (whether on site or via phone call) in the Extension Period. 7.2. Discussion of Design and Control This is an uncontrolled, open- label study of ALXN1210 treatment in pediatric patients. Given the ongoing ALXN1210 clinical program in adults with PNH and the data already generated in an eculizumab clinical study in pediatric patients with PNH (M07-005), a single- arm design was deemed appropriate to investigate the PK/PD, efficacy, and safety of ALXN1210 in the pediatric population. The rarity of PNH in the pediatric population precludes feasibility of a trial with a larger sample size. Ten patients should be sufficient to adequately describe PK/PD in this population while enabling study conduct within a reasonable time frame for making this important treatment available to patients, given the challenges of finding these rare pediatric patients and enrolling them into a prospective, interventional study. The proposed sample size is consistent with the principles of extrapolating the PK/PD and safety/efficacy from adults to pediatric patients given that the disease pathogenesis and mechanism of action of the drug are similar between these two population subsets. This study is descriptive in nature and not"

This approach was discussed in the context of the agreed pediatric investigation plan of ALXN1210 in PNH (EMEA-002077- PIP01 -16). The disease pathophysiology and clinical response to ALXN1210 treatment is expected to be similar between adult and pediatric PNH populations, as demonstrated in the eculizumab clinical development program. Thus, the efficacy parameters in this study of ALXN1210 are modelled on those selected for study in adult patients with PNH. The safety parameters being evaluated ar e commonly used in clinical trials per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and good clinical practice (GCP) guidance documents. 7.3. Schedule of Assessments The Schedule of Assessments is provided in Table 1 for the Screening and Primary Evaluation Period and in Table 2 and Table 3 for the Extension Period. Refer to Appendix A and the Laboratory Manual for details on the number of samples and volumes for all sampling and tests during the study. Additional (unscheduled) visits outside the specified visits are permitted at the discretion of the Investigator. Procedures, tests, and assessments will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator. All tests, procedures, or assessments performed at the Unscheduled Visits must be recorded on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Additionally, if a suspected event of breakthrough hemolysis occurs, LDH, PK, and PD parameters must be analyzed at the central laboratory. If the suspected event of breakthrough hemolysis does not occur at a scheduled visit, an unscheduled visit should occur for evaluation of the patient and collection of the required LDH, PK, and PD parameters. For purposes of defining breakthrough hemolysis, assessment of LDH must be based on a central laboratory value. If a supplemental dose of study drug is administered, PK/PD samples will be collected predose and at end of infusion (EOI) and a physical examination including vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature) will be performed. If the loading dose for patients ≥ 5 to < 10 kg is administered as 2 separate infusions < 24 hours apart (as described in Section 9.2), blood samples for PK/PD analysis will be collected before the first infusion (ie, the predose sample) and after the second infusion (ie, the EOI sample)."

35,page_35,"Protocol ALXN12 10-PNH -304 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 3 (Global) 22 Apr 2020 Page 35 of 64 CONFIDENTIAL 9.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment All enrolled patients will receive ALXN1210. 9.4. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study The weight-based dosages of ALXN1210 in this study ( Table 6 ) are premised on PK/PD data from early development studies in healthy adult volunteers as well as the available data from patients with PNH in an ongoing Phase 1b dose-finding study (ALXN1210- PNH-103) and an ongoing Phase 2 proof- of-concept study (ALXN1210- PNH-201). The selection of the ALXN1210 dose regimen is based on targeting immediate, complete, and sustained inhibition of terminal complement in pediatric patients with PNH throughout the dosing interval. Body weight-based dosing in pediatric patients is proposed to limit body weight-based variability in ALXN1210 drug exposure. ALXN1210 pediatric dosing is predicted to not exceed maximum ALXN1210 exposures achieved in PNH patients in Phase 2. 9.5. Special Treatment Considerations Infusion of other monoclonal antibodies has been associated with infusion reactions, with onset typically during or shortly after completion of the infusion. Please refer to Appendix B for guidance on identifying and managing potential drug infusion reactions. 9.6. Blinding This is an open -label study, so blinding is not applicable. 9.7. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Nonpharmacologic Procedures Prior medications (including vitamins and herbal preparations)—including those discussed in the exclusion criteria (Section 8.2) and procedures (any therapeutic intervention, such as surgery/biopsy or physical therapy) the patient takes or undergoes within 28 days prior to the start of Screening until the first dose of study drug—will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF. In addition, history of meningococcal vaccination must be collected for the 3 years prior to first dose of study drug and vaccination history for Hib and S pneumoniae must be collected from birth. If patients had been treated with eculizumab, a documented regim en history will be collected. Transfusions of pRBCs received within 1 year prior to first study drug administration will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF. All medication used and procedures undertaken during the study will be recorded in the patient’s source document/medical chart and eCRF. This record will include all prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, over- the-counter medications, and current medications for PNH. Concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded from the first infusion of study drug through 56 days after the patient’s last dose of study drug. Any changes in concomitant medications also will be recorded in the patient’s source docum ent/medical chart and eCRF. Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the patient’s standard of care during the study, or for the treatment of any AE, along with the allowed medications described below may be given"
36,page_36,"Protocol ALXN12 10-PNH -304 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 3 (Global) 22 Apr 2020 Page 36 of 64 CONFIDENTIAL at the discretion of the Investigator. However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding all medications are recorded in full in the patient’s source document/medical chart and eCRF. Concomitant use of anticoagulants is prohibited if not on a stable dose regimen for at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1. Concomitant use of complement inhibitors other than the study treatment is prohibited. 9.8. Vaccination Due to its mechanism of action, the use of ALXN1210 increases the patient’s susceptibility to meningococcal infection (N meningitidis ). To reduce the risk of meningococcal infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections within 3 years prior to, or at the time of, initiating study drug. Patients who initiate study drug treatmen t less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Vaccines against serotypes A, C, Y, W135, and B, where available, are recommended to prevent commo n pathogenic meningococcal serotypes. Patients must be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national vaccination guidelines or local practice for vaccination use with eculizumab. Vaccination may not be sufficient to prevent meningococcal infecti on. Consideration should be given per official guidance and local practice on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents and vaccination. All patients should be monitored for early signs of meningococcal infection, evaluated immediately if infection is suspected, and treated with appropriate antibiotics, if necessary. To increase risk awareness and promote quick disclosure of any potential signs or symptoms of infection experienced by the patients during the course of the study, patients will be provided a safety card to carry with them at all times. Additional discussion and explanation of the potential risks, signs, and symptoms will occur at each visit as part of the review of the patient safety card as described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). Patients must also be vaccinated against Hib and S pneumoniae according to national and local vaccination schedule guidelines. Vaccinations for N meningitidis , Hib, and S pneumoniae will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF. 9.9. Treatment Compliance Patients will be administered study drug in a controlled setting under the supervision of the Investigator or designee, thereby ensuring compliance with study drug administration. The Investigator or designee will ensure that all patients are adequately informed on the specific dosing regimen required for compliance with the study protocol, ensure that the patient receives the appropriate dose at the designated time points during the study and that adequate safety monitoring occurs during the infusion ( Section 9.5). 9.10. Home Visits To ensure patient safety and treatment continuity during the COVID -19 pandemic, the following will apply where patients are not able to reach the study sites, and until patients are able to resume study visits at the site."

In case of any signs or symptoms indicating an SAE or breakthrough hemolysis , the patient will need to be evaluated at the study site. Monitoring, treatment, and management of infusion reactions for patients receiving drug infusions at h ome are described in detail in the home health care manual and Appendix B . 9.11. Contraception Guidance Female patients of childbearing potential (ie, who have achieved menarche) must use a highly effective or acceptable method of contraception (as defined below), starting at Screening and continuing for at least 8 months after the last dose of study drug. Highly effective contraceptive methods include: 1. Hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 2. Intrauterine device 3. Intrauterine hormone -releasing system 4. Bilateral tubal occlusion 5. Vasectomized partner, provided that the partner is the patient’s sole sexual partner 6. Sexual abstinence, defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug treatment; reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient Acceptable contraceptive methods include: 1. A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) The above-listed method(s) of contraception chosen for an individual patient can be determined by the Investigator with consideration for the patie nt’s medical history and concomitant medications. Male patients with a female spouse/partner of childbearing potential or a pregnant or breastfeeding spouse or partner must agree to use double barrier contraception (male condom plus appropriate barrier method for the female partner) while on treatment and for at least"

SAFETY ASSESSMENTS The Investigator or his/her designee will meet with patients to discuss the potential safety risks of ALXN1210 and to give the Investigator the opportunity to address any of the patient’s safety concerns regarding the study. Investigators are instructed to follow any AEs through to their conclusion (resolution or stabilization), as described in Section 11.7.6. The timing of the clinical and laboratory assessments to be performed is specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). Any clinically significant abnormal results should be followed until resolution or stabilization. 11.1. Demographic/Medical History 11.1.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics A review of demographic parameters, including age, gender, race , and ethnicity will be performed. A complete medical history will be taken and documented. Weight and height will be recorded. Head circumference will be recorded for patients who are ≤ 3 years of age. 11.1.2. Disease Characteristics The patient’s PNH medical history, including PNH symptoms, date of diagnosis, PNH clone size, pRBC transfusions, and history of any MAVEs, will be documented at the Screening V isit. 11.1.3. Medical History The patient’s medical history, including prior and concomitant conditions/disorders and transfusion history, will be recorded at the Screening Visit. Medication (prescription or over- the-counter, including vitamins and/or herbal supplements) use within 28 days prior to the start of Screening will also be r ecorded. Details of prior treatment with eculizumab, including dose level and frequency, will be collected. Meningococcal vaccination within 3 years prior to the first dose of study drug, and vaccination history for Hib and S pneumoniae from birth, will also be recorded, as described in Section 9.7. 11.2. Physical Examinations A physical examination will include the following assessments: general appearance; skin; head, ear, eye, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes; chest; heart; abdominal cavity; limb; central nervous system; and musculoskeletal system. An abbreviated physical examination consists of a body system relevant examination based upon Investigator (or qualified designee) judgment and patient symptoms. Physical growth (height, weight, and head circumference [the latter only in patients ≤ 3 years of age]) will be assessed. 11.3. Vital Signs Vital sign measurements will be taken after the patient has been resting for at least 5 minutes, and will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP; millimeters of mercury [mmHg]),"

Laboratory Assessments Samples for serum pregnancy, hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis will be performed at the times specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). Specific laboratory assessments are provided in Appendix D . Samples for laboratory assessments will be collected before each study drug administration. An alternative blood sampling schedule for infants, for whom less blood volume should be collected, must be used as detailed in the laboratory manual. If a suspected event of breakthrough hemolysis occurs, an unscheduled visit must take place at which a sample is collected for analysis of LDH and PK/PD by the central laboratory. Laboratory assessments will be tested at a central laboratory facility. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for time windows for collection and detailed instructions for collecting, processing, storing, and shipping blood samples for safety assessments. Laboratory reports will be made available to the Investigators in a timely manner for clinical management of patients. It is anticipated that some laboratory values may be outside the normal value range due to the underlying disease. The Investigators should use their medical judgment when assessing the clinical significance of these values. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in laboratory measurements that has medical relevance and which results in a change in medical care. If clinically significant laboratory cha nges from baseline value are noted, the changes will be documented as AEs on the AE eCRF. The Investigator will also assess the relationship to study treatment for all clinically significant out- of-range values ( Section 14.9.3). The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient through additional laboratory assessments until (1) values have returned to the normal range or baseline level, or (2) in the judgment of the Investigator, values that are outside the normal range are not related to the administration of study drug or other protocol- specific procedures. 11.4.1. Pregnancy Testing For females of childbearing potential (ie, have achieved menarche), a s erum or urine pregnancy test (beta- human chorionic gonadotropin [β -hCG]) will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). 11.4.2. Hematology Blood samples will be analyzed for the hematology parameters listed in Appendix D . 11.4.3. Serum Chemistry Blood samples will be analyzed for the serum chemistry parameters listed in Appendix D . Indirect bilirubin is calculated from total and direct bilirubin values; therefore, indirect bilirubin results will not be available if direct bilirubin is below the limit of quantification. Chemistry assessments will be performed at the time points specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). The estimated glomerular filtration rate will be calculated using the Schwartz formula for all visits at which serum chemistries are collected."

Coagulation Blood samples will be analyzed for the coagulation parameters listed in Appendix D . 11.4.5. Urinalysis and Urine Chemistry Urine samples will be analyzed for th e parameters listed in Appendix D . A microscopic examination of urine samples will be performed if the results of the macroscopic analysis are abnorm al. 11.5. Electrocardiograms For each patient , single 12- lead digital ECGs will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collection and remain supine but awake during ECG collection. The Investigator or designee will be responsible for reviewing the ECG to assess whether the ECG is within normal limits and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be indicated on the CRF. For any clinically significant abnormal ECG results, the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the patient’s continued eligibility to participate in this protocol. 11.6. Immunogenicity Blood samples will be collected to test for presence and titer of ADAs to ALXN1210 in serum prior to study drug administration as indicated in t he Schedule of Assessments ( Section 7.3). Further characterization of antibody responses may be conducted as appropriate, including binding and neutr alizing antibodies, PK/PD, safety, and activity of ALXN1210. 11.7. Adverse Event Management An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (eg, hospitalization for elective surgery if planned before the start of the study, admissions for social reasons or for convenience), and anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen are not AEs. Transfusions are treated as efficacy endpoints (see Section 6.2). Transfusions administered in the inpatient or outpatient setting should not be captured as AEs or SAEs unless identified as such by the Investigator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish drug effect. A medication error (including intentional misuse, abuse, and overdose of the product) or use other than what is defined in the protocol is not considered an AE unless there is an untoward medical occurrence as a result of a medication error."

The following event is an important identified risk in this study: • Meningococcal infections 11.7.2. Severity Assessment The severi ty of AEs will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 or higher. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. Each CTCAE term is a Lowest Level Term (LLT) per the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ®). Each LLT will be coded to a MedDRA preferred term (PT). Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE assigns a grade of 1 through 5, with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE (Ta ble 7).

Grade 5 Death related to AE. Abbreviations: ADL = activities of daily living; AE = adverse event a Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. b Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. Any change in the severity of an AE should be documented based on specific guidelines in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. Severity and seriousness must be differentiated: severity describes the intensity of an AE, while the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met specific criteria for an SAE as described in Section 11.7.4 ."

Causality Assessment An Investigator must pro vide a causality assessment (Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Definite) for all AEs (both serious and nonserious) based upon the Investigator’s medical judgment and the observed symptoms associated with the event ( Table 8). This assessment must be recorded on the eCRF and any additional forms as appropriate. Table 8: Causality Assessment Descriptions Assessment Description Not Related/Unrelated Suggests that there is no causal association between the investigational product and the reported event. Unlikely Related Suggests that the clinical picture is highly consistent with a cause other than the investigational product, but attribution cannot be made with absolute certainty and a relationship between the investigational product and AE cannot be excluded with complete confidence. Possibly Related Suggests that treatment with the investig ational product may have caused or contributed to the AE (ie, the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the investigational product, but could also have been produced by other factors). Probably Related Suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with the investigational product administration exists and the likely causal association of the event with the investigational product. This will be based upon the known pharmacological action of the investigational product, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the investigational product or class of drugs, or judgment based on the Investigator’s clinical experience. Definitely Related Temporal relatio nship to the investigational product, other conditions (concurrent illness, concurrent medication reaction, or progression/expression of disease state) do not appear to explain event, corresponds with the known pharmaceutical profile, improvement on discon tinuation, reappearance on rechallenge. Abbreviation: AE = adverse event 11.7.4. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: • Results in death • Is life -threatening (ie, patient was at risk of death at the time of the event) • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threat ening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Alexion procedures for the reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are in accordance with United States Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidance documents or national regulatory requirements in participating countries, as well as IRBs/IECs where applicable. 11.7.6. Collection and Reporting of Adverse Events 11.7.6.1. All Adverse Events All AEs (serious and nonserious) will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until 56 days after the last dose of study drug for patients with ET or until 56 days after the last dose of study drug for patients who complete the study. All AEs must be recorded on the eCRF upon the Investigator or his/her staff becoming aware of their occurrence. Investigators will be instructed to report the SAE including their assessment (eg, severity, seriousness, and potential relatedness t o study drug) to Alexion Global Drug Safety (GDS) within 24 hours of first awareness of the event via the Safety Gateway. If a patient’s treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly capture the circumstances and data le ading to any such dose interruption or discontinuation of treatment in the AE and Exposure pages of the eCRF. 11.7.6.2. Serious Adverse Events All SAEs will be recorded regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of causality. No time limit exists on reporting SAEs that are thought to be causally related to the study drug. Investigators are at liberty to report SAEs irrespective of causality. For all SAEs, the Investigator must provide the following: • Appropriate and requested follow- up information in the time frame d etailed below • Causality of the SAE(s) • Treatment of/intervention for the SAE(s) • Outcome of the SAE(s) • Supporting medical records and laboratory/diagnostic information All SAEs must be reported to Alexion GDS within 24 hours of the Investigator or site staff awareness. These timelines for reporting SAE information to the Sponsor need to be followed for the initial SAE report and for all follow -up SAE information. The Investigator or designee must record the SAE data in the eCRF and verify the accuracy of the information with corresponding source documents. The SAE report should be submitted electronically via the Safety Gateway. In the event that either the electronic data capture (EDC) or the Safety Gateway is unavailable at the site(s), the SAE must be reported on the paper SAE contingency form. Facsimile transmission or email may be used in the event of electronic submission failure."

All paper forms and follow -up information submitted to the Sponsor outside of the Safety Gateway (eg, discharge summary) should be kept in the appropriate section of the study file. 11.7.7. Sponsor Reporting Requirements Alexion GDS or its legal representative is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of SAEs meeting the reporting criteria. This protocol will use the current IB as the Reference Safety Document. T he expectedness and reporting criteria of an SAE will be determined by the Sponsor from the Reference Safety Document. 11.7.8. Investigator Reporting Requirements The Investigator must fulfill all local regulatory obligations required for the study Investigators. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB/IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site, as required per IRB/IEC standard operating procedures ( SOPs ). Investigators will also be notified of all SUSAR events that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB/IEC of these additional SAEs as per IRB/IEC SOPs. 11.8. Exposure During Pregnancy and Lactation No studies of ALXN1210 have been conducted in pregnant women. Pregnant or nursing female patients are excluded from the clinical trial. Patients enrolled in the study, and a spouse or partner, will use a highly effective or acceptable method of contraception. In the event of a pregnancy event, pregnancy data will be collected during this study for all patients and a female spouse/partner of male patients. Exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in utero) can be the result of either maternal exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following paternal exposure. For all Alexion products, both in development or post approval, exposure during pregnancy must be recorded and the pregnancy followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (ie, sponta neous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality), even if the patient discontinues study drug or withdraws from the study. If a female patient or a patient’s female partner becomes pregnant during the conduct of this study, the Investigator must submit the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome/Breastfeeding” form to Alexion GDS via fax or email (Section 11.7.6.2). When the outcome of the pregnancy becomes known, the form should be updated and submitted to Alexion GDS.

General Considerations All data collected will be presented in summary tabulations. All data, as well as any outcomes derived from the data, will be presented in detailed data listings. Grap hical displays may also be provided, when appropriate. Analyses of efficacy and safety will be performed using SAS® release, version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA) or other validated statistical software. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including number of observations and mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency counts and percentage of patients. Analyses will be conducted separately for naïve and previously eculizumab- treated patients. Analyses of PK will be performed using Phoenix ® WinNonlin®, version 7.0 or higher (Certara USA, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey, USA). Details of the statistical analyses described below will be specified in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) before first database lock and analysis. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment only if it changes the primary or key secon dary objectives or the study conduct. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol or SAP, and the justification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report (CSR). Additional exploratory analyses of the data may be conducted as deemed appropriate. To support regulatory filings, i nterim CSRs may be prepared based on efficacy, safety, PK, PD, and immunogenicity data collected through the end of the 26- week Primary Evaluation P eriod (Day 183) after 12 pati ents are enrolled , and after enrollment is completed . A final CSR to summarize long -term efficacy, safety, PK, PD, and immunogenicity parameters will be produced at study completion. 14.2. Determination of Sample Size This study is descriptive in nature and not statistically powered for hypothesis testing due to the rarity of disease in pediatric patients. Approximately 13 patients will be enrolled to ensure at least 10 evaluable patients complete the 26 -week period, wh ich is expected to be sufficient to adequately describe PK/PD in pediatric patients with PNH. 14.3. Analysis Sets Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will include all patients who received at least 1 dose of ALXN1210 and have at least 1 postbaseline assessment. Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Set, defined as all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210. Pharmacokinetic and PD analyses will be performed on all patients who receive at least 1 dose of ALXN1210 and who have evaluable PK and PD data."

60,page_60,"Protocol ALXN12 10-PNH -304 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 3 (Global) 22 Apr 2020 Page 60 of 64 CONFIDENTIAL APPENDIX A. BLOOD SAMPLING VOLUMES The following procedures for blood collection should be adhered to: 1. Number of attempts: The number of attempts for sampling blood is limited to 3 times per day. This means that, after 3 punctures for collection of blood have been performed and no or insufficient blood could be collected, no other puncture will be done on the same day. 2. Volume of blood samples: Per study patient, the study- related blood loss (including any losses in the collection procedure) should not exceed 3% of the total blood volume during a period of 4 weeks, and should not exceed 1% at any single time. The total volume of blood is estimated at 80 to 90 mL/kg body weight. Three percent (3%) is 2.4 mL blood per kg of body weight. If an investigator decide s to deviate from these limits, the deviation must be fully documented, and the investigator should provide justification for the deviation. If the required blood volume cannot be obtained, due to the above mentioned safety limits, priority will be given to safety -relevant investigations. 3. EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream/plaster: To minimize the possible pain and discomfort due to collection of blood, the Investigator should apply an EMLA cream/plaster at the puncture site.

MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL DRUG INFUSION REACTIONS Infusion of other monoclonal antibodies has been associated with infusion reactions, with onset typically during or shortly after completion of the infusion. For this reason, patients will be carefully observed during each infusion. Patients who develop AEs of rash, hives, itching, or dysphagia of mild to moderate intensity during their infusio n of ALXN1210 may continue to receive the infusion if deemed to be medically appropriate by the Investigator. Medical intervention may include, but is not limited to, slowing of the infusion rate (with or without treatment) or interrupting or stopping the infusion. Any acute reaction should be treated according to standard medical practice depending upon clinical signs and symptoms. If a patient requires medical intervention, the patient should remain at the investigational site until his or her condition s tabilizes. The AE and any associated concomitant medications must be captured on the patient’s source document and electronic case report form (eCRF). Some patients treated with IV infusions of monoclonal antibodies have experienced concurrent reactions with signs or symptoms that can be classified as acute allergic reactions/hypersensitivity reactions or cytokine release syndrome. Signs and symptoms include headache, fever, facial flushing, pruritus, myalgia, nausea, chest tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, erythema, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, shivers, hypertension, lightheadedness, hypotension, palpitations, and somnolence. Anaphylaxis might occur at any time during an infusion; therefore, patients will be monitored closely during the infusion. In addition, the re-administration of some monoclonal antibodies has been associated with serum sickness- like reactions manifesting 1 to 14 days after drug administration. All AEs that may indicate an infusion- related response will be graded according to the CTCAE v4.03 or higher. Before any infusion is started, the treating physician and other appropriate personnel must make certain that medication (ie, adrenaline, inhaled beta agonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids) and other equipment to treat anaphylaxis are readily available. The infusion must be stopped immediately if Grade ≥ 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (including drug fever) or Grade ≥ 3 cytokine release syndrome/acute infusion reaction occurs. The Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of any infusion reaction requiring interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Patients who experience a reaction during the administration of study drug should be treated according to institutional guidelines. For a Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion reaction, the infusion should be temporarily stopped and treatment with an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg orally or equivalent) and acetaminophen (650 mg orally or equivalent) may be considered. If the patient’s signs and symptoms have resolved (with or w ithout administration of the above medication), the infusion may be restarted. However, the patients should be infused at a slower rate and be monitored closely for any signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during the remainder of the infusion. Patients experiencing an infusion reaction should be observed in the clinic until resolution of the reaction, or until the Investigator determines the patient is no longer at risk. Patients who experience a severe reaction during administration of study drug resul ting in discontinuation of study drug should undergo all scheduled safety, PK, and PD evaluations required by the protocol."
62,page_62,"Protocol ALXN12 10-PNH -304 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amendment 3 (Global) 22 Apr 2020 Page 62 of 64 CONFIDENTIAL If anaphylaxis occurs according to the criteria listed below, then administration of subcutaneous epinephrine (1/1000, 0.3 mL to 0.5 mL, or equivalent) should be considered. In the case of bronchospasm, treatment with an inhaled beta agonist also should be considered. Patients administered an antihistamine for the treatment or prevention of an infusion reaction should be given appropriate warnings about drowsiness and impairment of driving ability before being discharged from the center. Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any 1 of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled : 1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula), and at least 1 of the following: a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that pati ent (minutes to several hours): a. Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula) b. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze/bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) c. Reduced BP or associated sympto ms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a.
