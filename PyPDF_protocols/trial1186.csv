Background Patients with triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have failed approved or accepted treatments in the 1st and 2nd line setting remain in dire need of additional therapeutic approaches. The Trop -2 antigen is highly expressed on most solid epithelial cancers, including TNBC. Sacituzumab govitecan was developed by Immunomedics to treat these cancers by binding to Trop -2 for targeted delivery of SN -38 directly to the tumor cell while minimi zing systemic exposure of SN -38 to decrease host toxicity. A phase I/II trial in heavily treated patients with a variety of solid cancers, including TNBC, demonstrated that sacituzumab govitecan was therapeutically active when given on days 1 and 8 of rep eated 21 -day cycles, with neutropenia being the main toxicity followed by a low incidence of severe diarrhea. Since 10 mg/kg was the maximum dose that allowed multiple cycles to be given repeatedly with acceptable toxicity, this dose of sacituzumab govitec an was selected for further clinical development with this treatment schedule, including this Phase III study. Objectives The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan to the treatment of physician’s choice (TPC) as measured by independently reviewed progression -free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic TNBC previously treated with at least two systemic chemotherapy regimens , and without brain metastasis at baseline . The secondary objectives of the study are to compare between the two treatment groups for:  Progression Free Survival ( PFS) in the ITT population  Overall Survival (OS) in the ITT population and in the subpopulation of patients with brain metastasis  Independently -determined Objective Response Rate ( ORR), duration of response (DoR) and time to onset of response per RECIST 1.1 criteria VV-RIM-0002727 1.0 - Approved"

For each patient, t he same imaging technique should be used throughout the trial. All images will be evaluated locally at the study site f or tumor status as per RECIST1.1. Additional CT or MRI scans may be performed at the discretion of the physician to assess disease status as medically indicated. In case of progression on clinical grounds, the investigator will make every effort to document progression objectively/radiographically, so that documentation can be reviewed by the IRC. Patients on either treatment arm who have progression of disease assessed for the first time during the study but, who, in the opinion of the treating physician are deriving continued clinical benefit from IMMU-132 or TPC treatment, relative to other available treatment options, may continue to be treated b ased on physician discretion as long as they continue to meet eligibility criteria. Other study procedures duri ng treatment include quality of life questionnaires, physical examination and vital signs, CBC (with differential and platelet count s), routine serum chemistries, serum samples for levels of sacituzumab govitecan, , concomitant medications, and adverse events. ( See Study Procedures ) A final study visit will be conducted within 4 weeks after the last dose of sacituzumab govitecan or TPC for patients discontinuing study participation unless an earlier termination is required. Patients who discontinue for reasons other than progression should have a CT/MRI scan performed. Patients who discontinue treatment due to toxicity will continue with radiologic response assessments at the protocol -required schedule, until progression of disease or initiation of new therapy. The reason for study discontinuation will be documented and any adverse events or abnormal laboratories at that time will be followed until resolution or stabilization. No crossover to sacituzumab govitecan treatment will be allowed after discont inuing treatment in the TPC arm, but otherwise there is no restriction on subsequent therapies that a patient may receive after discontinuing the study.

Adverse event reporting will continue for 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. Sample Size A hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 667, likely corresponding to a 50 % improvement in PFS , would be considered to be clinically meaningful in this relapsed/refractory locally advanced or metastatic TNBC patient population. Approximately f our hundred and eighty -eight patients (488) patients are anticipated to be enrolled. The population of patients with brain metastases will be capped at 15 % ( N=74) of the trial population. The primary PFS analysis will be performed when 425 investigator defined PFS events have occurred in all patients randomized as long as 315 or more PFS events have also occurred, according IRC review, as defined for the prim ary analysis in the primary analysis population of patients without brain metastases (BM -ve population). Assuming at most 15% of patients have brain metastases and there are 13% or fewer IRC events compared to investigator review, it would be expected tha t there would be at least 315 IRC events in the BM -ve population at the time 425 investigator PFS events have been observed amongst all patients randomized. If the true HR is 0.667 in the IRC review of the BM -ve population, the study will have at least 95 % power to detect a statistically significant improvement in PFS, with a two-sided type 1 error rate of 5% , if data are analysed after 315 IRC PFS. PFS estimates in this patient population vary from 1.7 to 4.2 months (3 months average). For an estimate o f median PFS of 3 months in the control TPC group, and assuming a 24 -month enrollment period, it is expected the primary PFS analysis will be performed after a minimum follow -up of approximately 4 months. OS will be analysed at the time of the PFS analys is and also after 330 deaths have occurred in the primary analysis population of randomized patients without brain metastases. The study will have approximately 89.5% power to detect an improvement in overall survival in the BM -ve population, with a two -sided 5% type 1 error rate, assuming that 72% of the planned number of deaths in BM -ve population have occurred at the time of the interim analysis (i.e., 238 deaths), and the true HR for OS is 0.7. Assuming a 10 -month median in the control arm, a HR of 0 .7 would likely correspond to a 4.3 month improvement. The final analysis of OS is predicted to occur after a minimum follow -up of 17 months, 13 months after the primary analysis of VV-RIM-0002727 1.0 - Approved"

Centralized Procedures Stratified randomization will be by means o f an interactive web -based response system (IWRS). An independent centralized blinded assessment of progression -free survival will be conducted for determination of the study primary endpoint. An independent Drug Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be convened at regular intervals to assess the progress of this study, and review safety and progression data, per an approved DSMC charter. The DSMC will consider all available safety and efficacy data prior to formulating its recommendations regardin g continuation or termination of the trial. Data Analysis The primary analysis population consists of all patients without brain metastases, labelled throughout as the BM -ve population. Analyses will also be performed amongst all randomized patients, reg ardless of whether they have brain metastases, labelled throughout as the ITT population. To strongly control Type I Error across populations and the two key endpoints of IRC PFS and overall survival (OS), a hierarchical testing strategy will be performed as displayed below, where a given hypothesis can only be declared statistically significant if all previous hypotheses in the hierarchy are also statistically significant. If fewer than 30 patients with brain metastases are recruited, analyses in the ITT population will not be performed. Imaging evidence of efficacy will be obtained from CT or MRI scans using RECIST 1.1 criteria to classify tumor response, time to onset of objective response, duration of objective response, a nd time to progression. Using descriptive statistics, these metrics will be tabulated and compared between the two treatment arms. A stratified log -rank test stratified by randomization strata will b e used to compare the treatment groups for the time-to-event endpoint s of Progression -Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) .

Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize quality of life (QOL) questionnaire responses [EORTC QLQ C -30]. All patients administered at least one dose of IMMU -132 or TPC will be included in the evaluation of safety. Safety and tolerability wil l be evaluated from adverse events, standard safety laboratories (CBC with differential and platelet count, serum chemistries, and urinalysis), physical examination, E CG and vital signs. Adverse events will be classified according to the MedDRA systems of preferred terms and system organ class, and all adverse events and abnormal laboratories will be classified for severity using NCI CTCAE v4.03 toxicity grades. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize adverse events, and abnormal laboratories. The frequency of AEs will be tabulated by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term for each treatment group . AEs leading to death or to discontinuation from treatment, as well as all SAEs will be summarized separately. The reasons for disconti nuation will also be summarized for each treatment group using frequency distributions. Both actual and change -from -baseline data on vital signs will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group for each study time -point. Routine safety la boratories, based on hematology and serum chemistry data, will be listed by patient and summarized by descriptive statistics for each treatment group, if appropriate. Laboratory test results will be graded according to CTCAE severity grade when applicable . The frequency distribution of the worst CTCAE grade observed will be tabulated for each parameter by treatment group. For parameters for which a CTCAE scale does not exist, the proportion of patients with abnormal values will be summarized by treatment group.

Description of the Investigational Product SN-38, a topoisomerase I in hibitor, is the active metabolite of irinotecan, which is approved as a single agent for colorectal cancer and included in treatment regimens such as FOLFIRI (Zaanan 2011 ). Only 5% of irinotecan is converted to the active SN-38 form by esterase activity residing primarily in the liver, albeit there are esterases in the tumor that can cleave irinotecan to SN-38 (Mathijsen 2001 ). Its catabolism in the liver results in its transport through t he bile duct into the intestines, resulting in GI toxicity. In an attempt to improve the bioavailability of SN -38, Immunomedics , Inc. developed a procedure for coupling SN -38 to an antibody that retains the antibody molecular integrity and specific binding (Govi ndan 2009 ; Moon 2010 ). In murine models bearing human tumor xenografts, one particular linker with an SN -38 release half -life of 1.0 to 1.5 days was found to have the best therapeutic response. Importantly, significant anti -tumor effects were possible at doses that were completely non -toxic to the mice . Sacituzumab govitecan (Company Code: IMMU -132) is an antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the following three compounds: 1. The h umanized monoclonal antibody, hRS7 IgG1 , binds to Trop -2 (trophoblastic cell - surface antigen , also known as EGP -1, epithelial glycoprotein -1). It is a cell surface, transmembrane calcium signal transducer glycoprotein belonging to the TACSTD gene family that is highly expressed in many epithelial cancers, particularly metastatic sites (Alberti 2007 ), with much lower expression in normal tissues ( Trerotola 2010 ). Trop -2 has been implica ted in oncogenesis, often being found in more aggressive tumors (Fang 2009). The antibody was initially developed as a murine monoclonal antibody by the immunization of mice with a fresh specimen of a human lung cancer. The properties of the parent murine antibody have been extensively described (Basu 1995 ; Stein 1994 ; Shih 1995 ; Stein 1993 ; Stein 1995 ; Stein 1997 ). 2. The camptothecin -derived agent, SN -38, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor . 3. A linker, with the company designation , CL2A, which binds SN-38 to the antibody . IMMU -132 is prepared at a ratio of 7 to 8 molecules of SN -38 per molecule of the anti -Trop -2 antibody, hRS7 (Goldenberg 2015 ). For clinical use, 10 mg/mL are formulated in 25 mM MES buffer, pH 6.5, together with the other excipients (25 mM treh alose, 0.01% Polysorbate 80). It is then lyophilized at 200 mg/vial. IMMU -132 is supplied in 50 -mL clear glass vials to be stored under refrigerated conditions (2 -8oC) until used. Since the formulated drug product contains no preservative, vials should be used only once and within eight hours of reconstitution. Each 200 mg vial of IMMU -132 is reconstituted with 20 ml of saline and then further diluted with saline for intravenous administration so that the final concentration of IMMU -132 is in the 1.1-3.4 mg/ml range. IMMU -132 should be administered at a starting dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle. Dose reductions and dose delays are linked to certain toxicity. VV-RIM-0002727 1.0 - Approved"

Non-Clinical Studies The anti -tumor activity of the hRS7 -SN-38 conjugate was examined in mice bearing a variety of human epithelial cancer xenografts, where it was shown to have significant anti-tumor effects compared to free SN -38, irinotecan, or an irrelevant IgG -SN-38 conjugate (Cardillo 2011 ; Goldenberg 2015 ; Cardillo 2015 ). There were significant changes in liver transaminases that were returning to normal levels 2 weeks after treatment in mice (Cardillo 2011) . While Trop -2 is highly conserved among various species, the hRS7 antibody does not bind to murine Trop -2, but an immunohistology study of cynomolgus monkey tissues showed hRS7 bound to Trop -2 and had a similar distribution as found in humans ( Cardillo 2011 ). Thus, a toxicology study was performed with IMMU -132 in monkeys with the purpose to assess the dose-limiting toxicity and to determine if Trop -2 expressing normal tissues would limit the use of this conjugate. Two doses were administered within one week (3 days apart) at a cumulative amount of 120 and 240 mg/kg (1.92 and 3.84 mg/kg of SN -38; human equivalent dose of the conjugate was 38.7 and 77.4 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic analysis of the clearance of the hRS7 IgG and SN -38 (as free SN -38, total SN -38, and a derived IgG -bound SN -38) showed the IgG cleared at what appeared to be an expected rate (e.g., 30% cleared over 1 day, terminal half -life ~5 day s). The clearance parameters for the total and IgG -bound SN -38 were very similar, with a half -life of ~13 h, which reflect s the clearance of the IgG and the fact that the SN -38 is released from the conjugate at a rate of ~50% every 20 h. As expected, the AUC for the total and IgG -bound SN - 38 was nearly 15 -times higher than the free SN -38, which had a half -life of ~25 h, similar to the rate reported for SN -38 released from irinotecan. Thus, the conjugate is capable of liberating low concentrations of SN -38 in the serum a t a slow and sustained rate. In cynomolgus monkeys administered the cumulative dose of 120 mg/kg, there was evidence of myelosuppression within 3 days, but the decrease in counts did not achieve gradable levels and were completely restore d within 10 -14 days. No significant change in serum chemistries or tissue pathology was noted. At the 240 mg/kg, severe gastrointestinal ( GI) and hematological toxicities occurred ; therefore, the maximum tolerated dose had been exceeded. The conjugate displayed a similar toxicity profile as irinotecan , with major GI and hematologic al toxicity. Importantly, there were no serious histopathological changes to tissues with known hRS7 binding in the monkey, with the exception of mild to moderate hemorrhage o f the endometrium and atrophy of the endometrial glands that were showing recover y at the time the study was terminated. (See Investigator Brochure for additional information on IMMU -132) In vitro studies in 2 triple -negative breast cancer cell line s, one expressing Trop -2 and another being Trop -2-negative, showed that double -stranded DNA breaks only occurred in the Trop -2- expressing cell line after a brief exposure (1 h) with IMMU -132 (Goldenberg 2015 ). This study confirmed that SN-38 delivery by the specific IMMU -132 conjugate was necessary for the therapeutic effect, with a non -targeting conjugate having nearly 3 -fold less double -stranded DNA breaks than IMMU -132-treated Trop -2-expressing cells. In mice bearing Tro p-2-expressing human tumor xenografts that were given irinotecan or IMMU -132, SN -38 levels in the tumors exposed to IMMU -132 were as much as 130 -fold more than in the irinotecan -treated animals, illustrating the superior targeting of the conjugate to deliv er SN -38 to tumors ( Sharkey 2015 ).

40,page_40,"Immunomedics, Inc. IMMU -132-05 Sacituzumab Govitecan 26 August 2019 CONFIDENTIAL Page 41 addition, these studies showed that the SN -38 was protected from glucuronidation while coupled to the IgG, and since the linker was coupled to SN -38’s lactone ring, this also preserve s SN -38 in its most active form until it is released from the conjugate. This reduced glucuronidation is believed to explain the low incidence of severe diarrhea found in the clinical trials. Thus, IMMU -132 appears to be a more effective vehicle for delive ring SN -38 than irinotecan , and potentially less toxic in terms of severe diarrhea . 1.2.2. Clinical Study Study IMMU -132-01 entitled “ A Phase I/II Study of IMMU -132 (hRS7 -SN38 Antibody -Drug Conjugate) in Patients with Epithelial Cancer ,” conducted under IND 1156 21 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier , NCT01631552 ), is the only ongoing clinical investigation of the safety and efficacy of IMMU -132 in patients with cancer. This is a Phase I/II, open -label multi -center, US -only, study of IMMU -132 in previously -treated pati ents with advanced, metastatic, epithelial tumors . The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IMMU -132 as a single agent administered in 3 -week treatment cycles, in previously -treated patients with advanced epithelial cancer. The secondary objectives are to obtain initial data concerning pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and efficacy with this dosing regimen. Briefly, the study population is constituted of males or non -pregnant, non -lactating, females ≥ 18 years of age, able to give written informed consent, if they have documented epithelial cancer that involves any of the following tumor types: ovarian, cervical, endometrial, breast (triple - negative and non -triple -negative ), prostate (hormone refractory), lung [non -small cell (NSCLC) and small cell (SCLC)], head and neck (squamous cell), esophageal, colorectal, gastric, pancreas, renal (clear cell), urothelial, hepatocellular , glioblastoma multiforme and thyroid (follicular) cancers . There is no Trop -2 selection fo r enrollment. Patients must have metastatic disease and have either relapsed after receiving or were refractory to at least one standard chemotherapy regimen for their disease, with measurable disease by CT or MRI at the time of treatment, but no single l esion ≥ 7 cm in diameter. 1.2.2.1. Phase I In the completed Phase I portion of Study IMMU -132-01, doses as high as 18 mg/kg were given on day 1 and 8 of a 21 -day treatment cycle ( Starodub 2015 ). Neutropenia was the dose -limitin g toxicity at this level, with the MTD declared to be 12 mg/kg. Most of the other adverse events at all dose levels were Grade 2 or lower. Fatigue, alopecia and occasional mild to moderate diarrhea were some of the more common non -hematological toxicities , with two patients reporting a rash. While 12 mg/kg was considered the MTD, there was tendency for patients treated at this level to have delays in their dose schedule, as well as dose reductions. Therefore, in order to continue treatment with minimal d elays or reductions, IMMU -132 treatment sta rting at either 8 or 10 mg/kg (d ays 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle) was selected for evaluation in the Phase II portion of this study, with particular emphasis to enroll patients with triple -negative breast, small and non-small cell lung cancers, and secondarily patients with esophageal and urothelial cancers. Table 1 below indicates the incidence of drug -related grade 3+ adverse events observed at 10 mg/kg in all patients/all t umors enrolled at the 10 mg/kg dose level.

Summary of Potential Risks In patients with TNBC, the following adverse events (AEs) , all grades and regardless of relationship to IMMU -132, have been observed at the following rates (by order of frequency in each category):  Very likely: ( > 40%): nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue  Likely ( 20%-39%): alopecia, constipation, decreased appetite, leukopenia hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia  Less Likely ( 10%-<20%): hypophosphatemia, febrile neutropenia 1.4. Description of Study Population TNBC is a serious disease, with an annual incidence estimated to be about 40,000 people (20,000 for metastatic TNBC) in the United States, and with a median survival o f 10-13 months for metastatic TNBC ( Andre 2012 ).

Therefore, metastatic TNBC is insensitive to most of the available targeted therapies for breast cancer treatment, including HER2 -directed therapy (such as trastuzumab), and endocrine th erapies (such as tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitors). There is currently no single standard chemotherapy to treat patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic TNBC. Duration of response is usually short, with rapid relapse , and visceral and brain metas tases being very common . In TNBC patients treated with capecitabine, median PFS was 1.7 months ( Perez 2010 ), and it was 2.9 months for gemcitabine combined with carboplatin in patients treated with up to 2 prior chemotherapi es (O’Shaughnessy 2014 ). In a small cohort of 22 second -line TNBC patients (33% chemotherapy -naïve and one median prior chemotherapy regimen) treated with nab -paclitaxel, median PFS was 3.7 months ( Forero - Torres 2015 ). Median PFS was 2.9 months in 86 metastatic TNBC patients treated with cisplatin or carboplatin, and who received no more than one prior chemotherapy ( Isakoff 2015 ). 1.5. Rationale for Dose R egimen Most patients in IMMU -132-01 study have been treated with 8 or 10 mg/kg dos es. There was no major difference in safety between these two doses, but there was a trend for better efficacy with 10 mg/kg dosing, which was therefore selected for this st udy. 2. STUDY OBJECTIV ES 2.1. Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan to the TPC as measured by independently -reviewed IRC PFS in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC previously treated with at least two systemic chemotherapy regimens for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease , and without brain metastasis at baseline . 2.2. Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of the study are to compare between the two treatment grou ps for:  PFS for the ITT population  OS in both the ITT population and in the subgroup with brain metastasis.  Independently -determined Objective Response Rate (ORR), duration of response and time to onset of response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria  Quality of life  Safety, including adverse events, safety laboratories and evaluations, incidence of dose delays and dose reductions, and treatment discontinuations due to adverse events VV-RIM-0002727 1.0 - Approved"

Study Overview This is a Phase III, randomized, open -label, multicenter (up to 100 centers) study of IMMU -132 in locally -advanced or metastatic TNBC patients who are refractory or relapsing after at least 2 prior standard chemotherapy regimens for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and these regimens will qualify regardless of triple -negative status at the time they were given . A table of approved or standard therapeutic regimens for TNBC is included in Appendix 1. There is no upper limit in the number of prior therapies . Earlier adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment for more limited disease will qualify as one of the required prior regimens if the development of unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease occurred within a 12 - month period of time after completion of chemotherapy . All patients must have been previously treated with taxane regardless of disease stage (adjuvant, neoadjuvant or advanced) when it was given. Patients who have contra -indications or are intolerant to taxanes are eligible provided that they received at least one cycle of a taxane and showed contra -indications or intolerance during or at the end of that cycle. For patients with a documented germ -line BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation who received an approved PARP inhibitor, the PARP inhibitor can be used to meet the criteria for one of two prior standard of care chemotherapies. Approximately f our-hundred eighty -eight (488) patie nts from up to approximately 150 centers, including sites in North America , and Europe will be randomized 1:1 to the following treatment arms:  Sacituzumab govitecan (10 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 of 21 -day cycle s)  TPCdetermined before randomization from only on e of the following 4 treatment regimens , and administered for metastatic breast cancer as per label or NCCN guidelines below or with dose modifications if too toxic (see Section 6.5). No combination of the four ch oices is permitted .  Eribulin (1.4 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle for North America sites, 1.23mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle for European sites )  Capecitabine ( 1000 -1250 mg/m2 orally twice da ily on Days 1 -14 of a 21-day cycle)  Gemcitabine ( 800-1200 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 , 8 and 15 of a 2 8-day cycle)  Vinorelbine ( 25 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 weekly (Note: eligible patients with Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy should not be prescribed vinorelbine as T PC) VV-RIM-0002727 1.0 - Approved CCI"

Tumor progression leading to treatment withdrawal will be assessed by the investigator. Patient who discontinue treatment for other reasons than PD should a MRI/ CT scan performed within 4 weeks of study treatment discontinuation. No crossover to IMMU -132 treatment will be allowed at time of progression in the TPC arm. Clinical sites will use standard ASCO/CAP criteria for the pathological diagnosis of TNBC, defin ed as negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Receptor results will be based on local assessment of the most recent analyzed biopsy (or other pathology specimen). HER2 negative i s defined as one of the following: 0 or 1+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC), or if IHC 2+, then fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ratio of HER2 gene: chromosome 17 being less than 2, as per standard guidelines (Wolff 2013 ). ER- and PR -negative is defined as < 1% of cells expressing hormonal receptors by IHC, as per standard guidelines ( Hammond 2010 ). This study will utilize an intent -to-treat a nalysis . Screening evaluations within 28 days of the scheduled start of treatment include signature of informed consent, patient eligibility determination, BRCA 1&2 mutational status, if known , medical/surgical history, physical examination with vital sig ns and performance evaluation, prior and concomitant medications, local histology review to confirm TNBC diagnosis, CT or MRI scans (chest, abdomen, pelvis , with contrast as appropriate ) with additional imaging of other involved /suspected areas . Patients w ith known or suspected brain metastasis must have a brain MRI and must be documented to have had stable CNS disease for at least 4 weeks Target and non-target lesions must be determined by the clinical site at time of randomization . CBC (including platele t count , with WBC differential in absolute cell counts ), routine serum chemistries, urinalysis, E CG and serum samples for anti -drug antibodies will be also performed . In women of childbearing potential, a urine or serum HCG is also required within one we ek of treatment.

Growth factors and other supportive care are allowed and are strongly encouraged to be used aggressively including for prophylax is when medically necessary any time during treatment with IMMU -132 or the TPC . Refer to guidelines in Section 6.4.6 and Table 6. Toxicity guidelines for patients receiving TPC should follow local standard of care. If a patient randomized to receive IMMU -132 experiences ≥ Grade 2 neutropenia or ≥ Grade 2 GI toxicity prior to starting on the first treatment day (Cycle 1 Day 1), the treatment initiation should be withheld unti l resolved to ≤ Grade 1. If recovery to ≤ Grade 1 requires more than a 3-week delay, the patient should come off the study. In subsequent treatment cycles, if a patient experiences ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia or ≥ Grade 3 GI toxicity , IMMU -132 should be withh eld until resolved to ≤ Grade 1 and patients will be assessed at least weekly (biweekly for Grade 4 toxicities). If recovery to ≤ Grade 1 requires more than a three -week delay, the patient should come off the study. IMMU -132 will be permanently discontinu ed for a patient in the event of any ≥ Grade 3 infusion reactions which occurs after pre -medication with antihistamines, H2 blockers and steroids. In the event of other ≥ Grade 3 treatment -related toxicity at the time of a scheduled treatment day, IMMU -132 will be held and patients will be assessed at least weekly (biweekly for Grade 4 toxicities). If recovery to ≤ Grade 1 delays the next dose by only one week, treatment may resume without dose reduction ; however, patients should be administered growth fac tor support such as gCSF . If recovery of non -hematologic toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 delays the next dose by 2 or 3 weeks, treatment must be resumed at a reduced dose (see Table 6). If recovery to ≤ Grade 1 requires more than three weeks delay, treatment must be permanently discontinued. If recovery of hematologic toxicity (neutropenia) to ≤ Grade 1 delays the next dose by 1 week, growth factors should be added as per Section 6.4.6 , or as medically necessary to prevent dose delays and dose reduction . Patients who exhibit an excessive cholinergic response to IMMU -132 or TPC treatment (e.g., abdominal cramping, diarrhea, salivation, etc.) can receive appropriate premedication (e.g ., atropine) for subsequent treatments. Study procedures during treatment include physical examination and vital signs, CBC (with differential and platelet count), routine serum chemistries, urinalysis, serum samples for ECG, anti -drug antibody respon se, concomitant medications, and adverse events .

Abstinence refers to ‘True abstinence’ which means it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulatio n, symptotherma, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to study treatment, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contrace ption. ** In patients with a history of HBV, hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) testing is required and if positive, then HB DNA testing will be performed and if positive the patient will be excluded . 4.3. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  No anti-cancer therapies , aside the study drug (IMMU -132)/TPC are permitted during this study. However, palliative and/o r supportive medications , such as bone - modifying medications (bisphosphonates or denosumab), and/or procedures such as radiation and surgery will be allowed at the investigator’s discretion. If a patient requires palliative radiotherapy for brain metastase s, IMMU -132 or T PC should be interrupted one week before the procedure and reinstated two weeks after the procedure, provided that palliative radiotherapy is not indicated for tumor progression, in which case the patient will have to be discontinued for th e trial.  Premedication for prevention of infusion reaction with antipyre tics, H1 and H 2 blockers are strongly recommended before sacituzumab govitecan infusions. Corticosteroids (50 mg hydrocortisone or equivalent P.O. or I.V.) may be added if necessary and were used in approximately two -thirds of patients from the phase 2 trial. Premedication according to established guidelines with a two or three drug combination regimen (e.g. dexamethasone with either a 5 -HT3 receptor antagonist or a NK 1 receptor antagon ist, as well as other drugs as indicated) for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is strongly recommended (see below for information on medication affecting QT interval) .  Additional antiemetics, sedatives, and othe r supportive measures may also be employed as clinically indicated. In addition, all patients should be given medications for use at home for prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patients should be instructed as to how to aggressiv ely treat nausea and vomiting with these out -patient medications.  At the onset of diarrhea, promptly initiate loperamide, 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg with every episode of diarrhea for a maximum of 16 mg daily. Discontinue loperamide 12 hours after di arrhea resolves. Additional supportive measures (e.g. fluid and electrolyte substitution) may also be employed as clinically indicated. All patients should be given take -home medications with clear instructions for treatment of diarrhea.  Patients who exh ibit an excessive cholinergic response to sacituzumab govitecan treatment (e.g., abdominal cramping, diarrhea, salivation, etc.) can receive appropriate premedication (e.g. , atropine) for subsequent treatments.

The antibody is prepared using cell culture methods in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for the manufacture and testing of monoclonal antibody product s for human use. SN - 38 (7 -ethyl -10-hydroxy -camptothecin) is a small molecule and the active metabolite of the chemotherapeutic agent , irinotecan. IMMU -132 is an antibody drug -conjugate prepared by Immunomedics, Inc. (Morris Plains, NJ). The conjugation uses a spacer containing a cleavable -carbonate bond to attach SN -38 to reactive cysteine thiols present on the hRS7 antibody. For clinical use, 10 mg/mL IMMU -132 is formulated in 25 mM MES, pH 6.5 , together with the other excipients (25 mM trehalose, 0.01 % Polysorbate 80), which is then lyophilized. Glass vials c ontaining 200 mg of IMMU -132 as a sterile, non -pyrogenic, lyophilized powder are to be stored under refrigerated conditions (2 -8ºC) until used. Each vial is labeled “For Investigational Use Only” and identified by study drug name, lot number, and dose. Since the formulated drug product contains no preservative, vials should be used only once. VV-RIM-0002727 1.0 - Approved"

Preventative Medications Premedication for prevention of infusion reaction with antipyrectis, H 1 and H 2 blockers should be administered before sacituzumab govitecan infusions. Corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 50 mg or equivalent P.O. or I.V.) may be added if necessary and were used in approximately two -thirds of the patients in the Phase 2 trial . Premedication according to established guidelines with a two or three drug combination regimen (e.g. dexamethasone with eithe r a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist or a NK 1 receptor antagonist, as well as other drugs as indicated) for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is strongly recommended. Additional antiemetics, sedatives, and other supporti ve measures may al so be employed as indicated per investigator discretion. All patients should be given medications to take home for prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting. At the onset of diarrhea, promptly initiate loperamide, 4 mg initially f ollowed by 2 mg with every episode of diarrhea for a maximum of 16 mg daily. Discontinue loperamide 12 hours after diarrhea resolves. Additional supportive measures (e.g. fluid and electrolyte substitution) may also be employed as clinically indicated. All patients should be given take -home medications with clear instructions for treatment of diarrhea. Patients who exhibit an excessive cholinergic response to treatment with sacituzumab govitecan (e.g., abdominal cramping, diarrhea, salivation, etc.) can r eceive appropriate premedication (e.g., atropine) for subsequent treatments. 6.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature) for IMMU -132 will be assessed prior to the first infusion of cy cle 1 and every 15 ± 5 minutes for the first hour and then every 30 minutes until completing IV administration, at completion, and then 30 minutes post infusion . In absence of significant changes, may be reduced with subsequent doses to prior to infusion, at 30 minutes, and then at completion. Timepoints can be ± 1-2 min. 6.4.3. Intravenous Administration of IMMU -132 Do not administer as an IV push or bolus. IMMU -132 is administered intravenously as a slow infusion as described below. Intravenous access must be well established prior to initiating infusion. At the time of dosing, the IV line will be connected to an infusion container containing the prepared volume of IMMU - 132. Either gravity or an infusion pump may be used. Only normal saline should be used a s the infusion base solution , since the Sponsor has not examined the compatibility of IMMU -132 with other infusion diluents. The initial infusion should proceed slowly. If vital signs remain stable and in the absence of infusion reactions, the infusion ra te can be incrementally advanced following suggested guidelines given in Table 4, and following completion, the intravenous line should be flushed slowly with 20 mL normal saline and the end of infusion time recorded . In the event of infusion reactions or vital sign changes, the infusion rate may be slowed, interrupted or terminated, as considered appropriate by the managing physician (See Section 6.4.4 ).

Managing IMMU -132 Infusion Toxicity The Sponsor’s designee should be notified within 24 hours in the event of any serious infusion react ion occurring with IMMU -132 or one of the TPC drugs . NCI CTCAE version 4.0 3 is used to grade all adverse events and to provide management guidelines for infusion toxicity. For a serious infusion reaction considered severe or life threatening (NCI toxicit y Grade 3 or higher) the infusion must be permanently terminated.  Examples of such events include: serious or clinically significant cardiopulmonary events, severe allergic (symptomatic bronchospasm) or anaphylactic reactions, or other severe reactions.  The occurrence of Grade 3 in fusion -related reactions ( e.g., prolonged infusion related reactions not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion) also require the infusion to be permanently terminated. Otherwise, for moderate infusion toxicity (Grade 2 events), the infusion should be temporarily stopped for at least 15 minutes or until symptoms resolve, and then resumed at the slowed infusion rate, if the patient is stable. Recommended actions for mild toxicity (Grade 1 events) include slowing the remaining infusion rate. Any infusion toxicity must have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 prior to a patient receiving the next scheduled infusion . Additional Medications Patients may be medicated during treatment as indicated in the judgment of the treating physician to control potential in fusion or hypersensitivity responses. For anaphylactic reactions, appropriate medical measures (e.g., epinephrine, antihistamines, hydrocortisone, and IV fluids) should be taken. Such a subject should not receive additional study drug and should be disco ntinued from the study. Nausea, Vomiting and Diarrhea Gastrointestinal toxicity may be dose -limiting with IMMU -132. Premedication according to established guidelines with a two or three drug combination regimen (e.g. dexamethasone with either a 5 -HT3 rece ptor antagonist or a NK 1 receptor antagonist, as well as other drugs as indicated) for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is recommended.

All patients will be closely monitored over the course of their treatment and aggressively medically managed in order to prevent dose reductions and delays where p ossible , with NCI -CTCAE v4.0 3 used to grade all adverse events and to provide dose reduction, delay or cessation guidelines in the event of toxicity. If a patient experiences ≥ Grade 2 neutropenia or ≥ Grade 2 GI toxicity on the first treatment day (Cycle 1, Day 1), growth factors should be administered and treatment initiation should be withheld until resolved to ≤ Grade 1. If recovery to ≤ Grade 1 requires more than three -week delay, the patient should be withdrawn from the study. In subsequent treatmen t cycles, if a patient experiences ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia or ≥ Grade 3 GI toxicity , the treatment should be withheld until resolved to ≤ Grade 1 and patients will be assessed at least weekly (biweekly for Grade 4 toxicities). If recovery to ≤ Grade 1 requi res more than a 3-week delay, the patient should come off the study. Treatment will be permanently discontinued for a patient in the event of any ≥ Grade 3 infusion reactions which occur after pre -medication with antihistamines, H2 blockers and steroids. In the event of ≥ Grade 3 treatment -related neutropenia at the time of a scheduled treatment day, the dose will be held and patients will be assessed at least weekly. Growth factors should be initiated. If recovery to ≤ Grade 1 delays the next dose by only one week, treatment may resume then without dose reduction with growth factor support as per Section 6.4.6 and Table 6. If recovery to ≤ Grade 1 delays the next dose b y 2 or 3 weeks, treatment may be resumed at the same dose with the addition of growth factors . If a patient is already receiving growth factors support and the next treatment is delayed by 2 or 3 weeks, treatment must be resumed at a reduced dose (Table 6). If recovery to ≤ Grade 1 requires more than a three -week delay, treatment must be permanently discontinued. In the event of other ≥ Grade 3 treatment -related non-hematologic toxicity at the time of a scheduled treatment day, the dose will be held and patie nts will be assessed at least weekly. If recovery to ≤ Grade 1 delays the next dose by only one week, treatment may resume then without dose reduction.

EORTC QLQ -C30 (Appendix 5) will be completed at baseline, the beginning of every cycle, and the final study visit. 8. ADVERSE EVENT S All patients must be carefully monitored for Adverse Events ( AEs), including clinical laboratory tests. AEs should be assessed in terms of their seriousness, intensity, and relationship to the study drug. For consistency, events are to be graded using t he NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 3. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with that treatment or usage. AEs include the following: An exacerbation, or an unexpected increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing condition (other than condition under investigation), including intermittent or episodic conditions. 1. Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition /indication under investigation 2. A suspected drug interaction 3. An intercu rrent illness 4.

Signs and symptoms of the disease under study that do not represen t a signif icant worsening or exacerbation 3. Expected progression of the disease under investigation 8.1. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) An AE that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as serious: 1. Fatal 2. Life-threatening 3. Disabling/inca pacitating 4. Results in hospitalization or prolongs a hospital stay 5. A congenital abnormality VV-RIM-0002727 1.0 - Approved CCI"

Other serious medical events may also be considered SAEs if they require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (e.g., allerg ic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in hospitalization, development of drug dependency or drug abuse) An SAE does not include: 1. Progression of disease. 2. Hospitalization for a routine clinical procedure as stipulated by the protocol. Hospitalization for non -medical reasons (i.e., social admissions, hospitalizations for social, convenience or respite care ). 8.2. Reporting AEs/SAEs The Investigator is to report all AEs directly observed or spontaneously reported by patients using concise medical terminology . Each patient will be questioned about AEs at each clinic or evaluation visit, asking, for example, “Since your last clinic visit , have you had any health problems?” All AEs will be reported following the first dose of study treatment through 30 days following the last day of administration of study treatment. Only treatment -related AEs will be captured from End of Treatment through the Safety Follow -up visit. All treatment -related AEs/SAEs that are ongoing at the time of the Safety Follow -up visit will be followed until resolution, return to baseline, or until they are Grade ≤ 1 (and following consultation and agreement by the Medical Monitor). During Follow -up visits in patie nts who discontinued therapy for reasons other than progression, any SAE determined by the Investigator to be potentially related to study treatment must also be reported. Whenever possible, a diagnosis should be given when signs and symptoms are due to co mmon etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respiratory infection”). In this protocol, disease progression is an efficacy endpoint and should not be reported as an AE. It is important to d ifferentiate expected disease progression from an AE. Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of disease progression should not be considered AEs. Expected disease progression refers to an event that is unequivocally related to disease progression, and that the clinical course is consistent with what would be expected for the patient’s disease. A clinical event in the setting of disease progression would be considered an AE if it could not be unequivocally attributed to or consistent wi th expected disease progression . A clinical laboratory AE is any laboratory value that is considered clinically significant by the Investigator and has caused a medical intervention, dose hold, dose reduction or schedule change. Laboratory abnormalities th at have not required medical intervention should not be recorded as AEs ( they will be analyzed and reported in the laboratory section of the clinical study report). All SAEs and pregnancies must be reported to the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee immediat ely, and no later than 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. VV-RIM-0002727 1.0 - Approved"

The notification should be performed on the pregnancy form and be handled in the same manner as for SAEs. In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth. The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by gross visual inspection unless pre -abortion laboratory findings are suggestiv e of a congenital anomaly. 8.6. Follow -up of Unresolved AEs Only AE and SAE possibly or probably related to study treatment will be followed -up beyond the 30-day period following the study treatment discontinuation.

Expedited Reporting In this trial, the Sponsor ’s design ee is responsible for expedited reporting of any SAE considered to be SUSAR (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction). A SU SAR is any adverse event which meets the following 3 criteria  Serious Adverse Event. An event meeting the SAE criteria in Section 8.1.  Suspected Adverse Reaction. An event for which there is a reasonable possibi lity that there is a causal relationship between the study treatment and the event  Unexpected Adverse Reaction. An event for which the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable product information ( e.g. Investigator's Brochure for an unappr oved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). The Sponsor ’s designee will report all relevant information about suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions (SUSARs) to all applicable regulat ory authorities in all participating countries, and via the Eudravigilance database (EVCTM), as required. SUSARs determined to be fatal or life-threatening must be submitted not later than 7 calendar days after initial report of the information to the Spo nsor’s designee (follow -up within an additional 8 days); otherwise SUSARs must be submitted within 15 calendar days. The Sponsor ’s designee will also report all SUSARs to the governing Ethics Committees and will inform all investigators, as required. 8.8.

Reporting to Health Authorities The Sponsor’s designee will be responsible for reporting all AEs and SAEs to the appropriate regulatory authorities ( e.g., U.S. FDA), Investigators, and central IRB in accordance with all applicable regulations and guidance documents . 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS 9.1. Determination of Sample Size A hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 667, likely corresponding to a 50 % improvement in PFS , would be considered to be clinically meaningful in this relapsed/refractory locally advanced or metastatic TNBC patient population. Four hundred and eighty -eight patients (488) patients are anticipated to be enrolled. The population of patients with brain metastases will be capped at 15 % (N=74) of the trial population. The primary PFS analysis will be performed when 425 investigator defined PFS events have occurred in all patients randomized as long as 315 or more PFS events have also occurred, according to Independent Review Committee (IRC) review, as defined for the primary analysis in the primary analysis population of patients without brain metastases (BM -ve population). Assuming at most 15% of patients have brain metastases and there are 13% or fewer IRC events compared to investigator review, it would be expected that there would be at least 315 IRC events in the BM -ve population at the time 425 investigator PFS events have been observed amongst all patients randomized. If the true HR is 0.667 in th e IRC review of the BM - ve population, the study will have at least 95% power to detect a statistically significant improvement in PFS, with a two-sided type 1 error rate of 5% , if data are analysed after 315 IRC PFS. PFS estimates in this patient populati on vary from 1.7 to 4.2 months (3 months average). For an estimate of median PFS of 3 months in the control TPC group, and assuming a 24 -month enrollment period, it is expected the primary PFS analysis will be performed after a minimum VV-RIM-0002727 1.0 - Approved"

O S will be analy zed at the time of the PFS analysis and also after 330 deaths have occurred in the primary analysis population of randomized patients without brain metastases. The study will have approximately 89.5% power to detect an improvement in overall survival in the BM -ve population, with a two -sided 5% type -1 error rate, assuming that 72% of the planned number of deaths in BM -ve population have occurred at the time of the interim analysis (i.e., 238 deaths), and the true HR for OS is 0.7. Assuming a 10 - month median in the control arm, a HR of 0.7 would likely correspond to a 4.3 -month improvement. The final analysis of OS is predicted to occur after a minimum follow -up of 17 months, 13 months after the primary analysis of PFS. 9.2. Interim analysis There will be an interim analysis of overall survival at the time of the final PFS analysis. A Lan - DeMets spending function that approximates O’Brien/Fleming stopping boundaries will be applied to the interim OS analysis, where the 2-sided significance level applied is determined by (t) = 2 -2(-z/2/t). In the equation, t is the number of OS events occurring at the interim divided by the number expected at the final analysis (i.e., 330) of the BM -ve population. If the final number of events differs from expected, the final significance leve l will be adjusted so that the overall alpha is controlled given the significance level applied at the first analysis. The PFS ITT analysis will only be declared as statistically significant if both the PFS BM -ve and OS BM - ve analyses have also been decla red as statistically significant. However, given the PFS ITT analysis will not be updated at the final OS analysis, a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05 will be applied to this endpoint if and when both PFS and OS are statistically significant in the BM -ve population. In addition, OS in the ITT population will only be tested once PFS in the ITT population has been declared statistically significant. If this occurs at the time of the interim analysis, OS in the ITT population will be tested at the same adju sted alpha level computed for the analysis of OS in the BM -ve population. The significance level for the final analysis of OS in the ITT population will be determined by the Lan -DeMets spending function to ensure alpha is controlled at a 2 -sided alpha of 0 .05 at the final OS analysis, if OS analyses in the ITT population is also conducted at the time of PFS analysis. 9.3. Efficacy Analyses The primary analysis population consists of all ITT patients without brain metastases labelled throughout as the BM -ve pop ulation, defined as all randomized patients who were randomized to the strata of no baseline brain metastasis at the time of randomization. Analyses will also be performed amongst all randomized patients, regardless of whether they have brain metastases, labelled throughout as the ITT population. To strongly control type I error across populations and the two key endpoints of IRC PFS and overall survival (OS), a hierarchical testing strategy will be performed as displayed below, where a given hypothesis c an only be declared statistically significant if all hypotheses above it in the hierarchy are also statistically significant. If fewer than 30 patients with brain metastases are recruited, analyses in the ITT population will be removed from the hierarchy . VV-RIM-0002727 1.0 - Approved"

The PFS ITT analysis will only be declared as statistically significant if both the PFS BM -ve and OS BM -ve analyses have also been decla red as statistically significant. However, given the PFS ITT analysis will not be updated at the final OS analysis, a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05 will be applied to this endpoint if and when both PFS and OS are statistically significant in the BM -ve population. In addition, OS in the ITT population will only be tested once PFS in the ITT population has been declared statistically significant. If this occurs at the time of the interim analysis, OS in the ITT population will be tested at the same adju sted alpha level computed for the analysis of OS in the BM-ve population. The significance level for the final analysis of OS in the ITT population will be determined by the Lan -DeMets spending function to ensure alpha is controlled at a 2 -sided alpha of 0 .05 at the final OS analysis, if OS analyses in the ITT population is also conducted at the time of PFS analysis. The testing procedures and corresponding alpha levels for type I error rate control are depicted in the following diagram. VV-RIM-0002727 1.0 - Approved"

As a sensitivity analysis, efficacy will be also analyzed based on the Efficacy -Analyzable population, defined as all eligible , randomized and treated patients with at least one cycle of IMMU -132 or TPC and available follow -up radiological assessment data . Imaging evidence of efficacy will be obtained from CT or MRI scans using RECIST 1.1 criteria to classify tumor response, tim e to onset of objective response, duration of objective response, and time to progression. Starting with the initial dose of sacituzumab govitecan or TPC, CT or MRI scans will be obtained every 6 weeks for 36 weeks, then every 9 weeks thereafter, until the occurrence of progression of disease requiring discontinuatio n of further treatment. For each patient, the same imaging technique should be used throughout the trial. Using descriptive statistics, these metrics will be tabulated and compared between the two treatment arms.

PFS will be measured by an independent centralized and blinded group of radiology experts who will be assessing tumor response using RECIST 1.1 criteria. FDA definitions and guidance as described in Guidance for Industry: Clinical Trials Endpoints for the App roval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics (December 2018) and Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics (April 2015) will be used. Target lesions will be assessed by CT scans or MRIs according to the same sched ule in both treatment arms. PFS will be defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death, whichever comes first. The date of progression will be the earliest time when any tumor progression is observed based on RECIST 1. 1 (see Appendix 6). It will be the date of the last observation or radiological assessment of target lesions that shows a predefined increase (20%+) in the sum of the target lesion measurements , compared to the prev ious minimum, or the appearance of new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. The following censoring rules will be applied to the primary analysis of PFS : a. A patient who dies during follow -up period for survival without documented progr essive disease will be considered to have an event for PFS analysis. b. Patients who do not have progression and are alive will be censored at last date of radiographic assessment without documented progressive disease. c. Patients that progress or die following more than one missed scheduled visit will be censored at the last date of radiographic assessment without documented progressive disease. d. Patients in the follow -up period for progression who receive alternative anticancer treatment before documented progr essive disease will be censored at the last date of radiographic assessment without documented progressive disease prior to receiving alternative anticancer treatment. e. Patients without baseline tumor assessments or without additional follow -up data will be censored at the date of randomization. However, if such a patient dies no later than the time of the second scheduled assessment as defined in the protocol, this patient will be considered to have an event at the date of death. The primary analysis of PF S will be based on the assessment of the central reviewer; additional sensitivity analyses will be performed based on definitions of PFS as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan including the investigator’s assessment . OS will be measured from the date of randomization to death from any cause. Patients not known to have died at last follow -up are censored on the date they were last known to be alive. Patients are censored at the date of initiation of therapy (Day 1) if no additional data are obtained.

The total amount of study drug and number of cycles and doses received will be summarized by treatment group. Safety and tolerabilit y will be evaluated based on adverse events, standard safety laboratories (CBC with differential and platelet count, serum chemistries, and urinalysis), physical examination, E CG, and vital signs (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respirat ory rate, and body temperature) . The frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), classified by MedDRA, will be summarized by treatment group and overall using MedDRA Preferred Term and System Organ Class (SOC). An AE that occurs more than once withi n each patient will be counted only once in the summaries, using the worst NCI-CTCAE grade and relationship category. AEs will be consolidated using the worst NCI-CTCAE grade and relationship category observed for classification into each MedDRA SOC summa ry. AEs leading to death or to discontinuation from treatment, as well as all SAEs will be summarized separately. A listing of all death information will be generated. The reasons for study discontinuation will also be summarized for each treatment group . Both actual and change -from -baseline data on vital signs and E CG intervals (with particular emphasis on corrected QT interval) will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group for each study time -point. Percentages with abnormal E CGs wi ll be presented at each scheduled time point. Routine safety laboratories, based on hematology and routine serum chemistry data (glucose, creatinine, BUN, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, serum albumin, total protein, Na, K, calcium, Cl, CO 2, magnesium and phosphate ), will be summarized using values at each visit and change from baseline using descriptive statistics for each treatment group. Laboratory test results for platelets, neutrophils, white blood count, lymphocytes and hemoglo bin will be graded according to NCI-CTCAE severity grade. The worst NCI-CTCAE grade observed on -treatment will be tabulated for each lab parameter and presented in a frequency table by baseline grade.

Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) An eCRF is required and must be completed for each enrolled patient. The completed original eCRFs are the sole property of Immunomedics and should not be made available in any form to third pa rties, except for authorized representatives of appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Immunomedics. It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all eCRFs. eCRFs must be signed by the Investigator or by an authorized staff member. These signatures serve to attest that the information contained on the CRFs is true. At all times, the Investigator has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and la boratory data entered on the eCRFs. Patient source documents are the physician's patient records maintained at the study site. In most cases, the source documents will be the hospital's or the physician's chart. In cases where the source documents are t he hospital or the physician's chart, the information collected on the eCRFs must match those charts. In some cases, a portion of the source documents for a given study site may be the eCRFs. The Investigator must agree which items will be recorded in th e source documents and for which items the eCRF will stand as the source document. Corrections to the eCRF must be initialed and dated by the person making the correction (ICH E6 4.9.3). 12.2. Record Retention Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study, including eCRFs, source documents, consent forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records must be retained by the Investigator for at least 15 years. No study records shall be destroyed without prior authorization from Immunom edics. For studies conducted outside the United States under a US IND, the Investigator must also comply with US FDA IND regulations, ICH guidelines, and with the regulations of the relevant national and local health authorities. Current US federal law requires an Investigator to maintain such records for a period of two years following approval of a Biologic License Application, or, if the Biologic License Application is not approved, until two years following notification by Immunomedics that the clinical investigations have been discontinued. 13. ADMINISTRATIVE REQUI REMENTS 13.1. Good Clinical Practice The study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH for GCP and the appropriate local and national regulatory requirement(s).

The trial will be performed in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, t he Declaration of Helsinki, 18th World Medical Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, 1964 and later revisions (as mandated for European trials), and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. In the United States, ethical protection is provided by complian ce with GCPs as described in ICH and 21 CRF 50 (Protection of Human Subjects). The Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) will review all appropriate study documentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety and we ll-being of the patients. The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained. The Investigator is responsible for providing their IRB/IEC with any required study documents, progress reports and safety updates and is responsi ble for notifying the IRB/IEC promptly of all SAEs occurring at the site. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File. Copies of IRB/IEC approvals should be forwarded to Immunomedics or the designee. The only circumstanc e in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients. In that event, the Investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and Immunomedics or its designee in writin g within 5 working days after the implementation . 13.3. Patient Information and Consent It is the responsibility of the Investigator to give each patient (or the patient’s acceptable representative) full and adequate verbal and written information regarding the objective and procedures of the trial including the possible risks and benefits involved. Written patient information, approved by the IRB/IEC , must be given to each patient before any trial -related procedure is undertaken. During the consent process, th e patient must be informed about their right to withdraw from the trial at any time. The patient must also be given ample time to read the written informed consent form and have all study -related questions answered to the satisfaction of the patient (or t he patient’s legally acceptable representative). It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain a signature from each patient, the patient’s legally acceptable representative (if applicable ), and from the persons conducting the informed consent discussion prior to undertaking any trial -related procedure. The patient (or the patient’s legally acceptable representative) must be given a copy of the signed and dated informed consent form. The Investigator is also responsible for providing the patient (or the patient’s legally acceptable representative) with any clinical trial updates that may affect the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the study. The informed consent process must be documented in the patient’s medical or source char t.

RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS (RECIST) 1.1 New Respo nse evaluation criteria in Solid tumors: Revised REC IST cr iteria [EJC 4 (2): 228-247, 2009] are s umm arized below. Measurable /Non-Meas urable Lesions. Each tumor lesion or site of disease identified at baseline is catego rized as either a m easurable lesion or a non-measurable lesion acco rding to the following definiti ons. Lesion Type Meas urable Non-Meas urable Qualifyine Definition Tumo r lesions: Must be accurately m easured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the pl ane of m easurement is to be r ecorded) with a minimum size of: • 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no gr eater than 5 mm.) • 10mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesio ns w hich cannot be accurately m easured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable) • 20mm by chest X-ray. Malignant lymph nod es: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be 15mm in sho1 i axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no gr eater than 5 mm). At basel ine and in follow-up, only the sh o1i axis will be m easured and followed . All other l esions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10mm or pathological lymp h nodes with 10 to < 15mm sho1 i axis) as well as tiuly non-measurable lesions. Lesio ns considered tiuly non-m easurable inclu de: leptomeningeal disease , ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammato1 y breast disease, lymphangi tic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses /abdo minal or ganom egaly identified by physical exam th at is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. Specia l considerat ions r egarding lesion measurability: Bone l esions, cystic lesions, and lesions pr eviously ti·eated with l ocal therapy require paiiicular comment: Bone l esions: • Bone scan, PET scan or plain films ai·e not considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone l esions. However , these techniques can be used to confnm the pr esence or disappeai·ance of bone lesions. • Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-b lastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component m eets the definition of m easurability described above. Blastic bone lesions are non-m easurable. Cystic lesions: • Lesions that m eet the criter ia for radiogra phically defined s imple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (n either measurable nor no n-measurable) since they are, by definition, s imple cysts. • 'Cys tic lesions' thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. Howeve r, if non-cystic lesions ai·e present in the same patie nt, these ai· e prefe n ed for selectio n as target lesions. 26 Augus t 2019 CONFIDENTIAL Page 105 VV-RIM -0002727 1.0-Approved"
