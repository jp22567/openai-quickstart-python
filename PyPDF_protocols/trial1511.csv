Study Site(s): Approximately 200 Study Population: Premenopausal females (aged 18 – 49 years, inclusive) who have a documented surgical diagnosis of endometriosis (e.g., laparoscopy or laparotomy) established by visualization or histology within 10 years prior to entry into Washout or Screening and with moderate to severe pain. Number of Subjects to be Enrolled: Approximately 890 Methodology: This is a Phase 3, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of both elagolix 150 mg QD and elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD over 24 months in the management of endometriosis with associated moderate to severe pain in premenopausal women. After establishing eligibility, the study starts with open-label treatment on elagolix 150 mg QD for the first 3 months. Following the Treatment Month 3 visit and continuing through Treatment Month 24, the study is conducted in a double-blinded manner with treatment assignment determined based on the efficacy responder status assessed at Months 3 and 6."
2,page_2,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 3 Methodology (Continued): At the Treatment Month 3 study visit, the efficacy responder status of each subject will be determined based on the responses to the Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in the electronic diary (e-Diary). The results of the responder status determination are blinded and the details of the responder status calculation are outlined below. Subjects determined to be efficacy responders at the Treatment Month 3 visit will continue to dose with elagolix 150 mg QD in a blinded manner throughout the remainder of the 24-month Treatment Period. Subjects determined to be incomplete efficacy responders at the Treatment Month 3 visit will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive elagolix 150 mg QD or elagolix 200 mg BID + E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD. Subjects who were randomized to receive elagolix 200 mg BID + E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD will continue with this treatment in a blinded manner throughout the remainder of the 24-month Treatment Period. At the Treatment Month 6 study visit, the efficacy responder status of each subject will be determined in the same blinded manner as at the Treatment Month 3 study visit. Subjects who randomized at Treatment Month 3 to receive elagolix 150 mg QD and are subsequently determined to be efficacy responders at Treatment Month 6 will continue to receive elagolix 150 mg QD throughout the remainder of the 24-month Treatment Period. Subjects who randomized at Treatment Month 3 to receive elagolix 150 mg QD and are subsequently determined to be incomplete efficacy responders at Month 6 will receive elagolix 200 mg BID + E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD throughout the remainder of the 24-month Treatment Period. The Treatment Groups are described below:Day 1 Through Month 3 (Open-Label): !Open-Label elagolix 150 mg QD Month 4 Visit Through Month 6 (Double-Blind): !(A)Efficacy responders to elagolix 150 mg QD at Month 3 !(B)Incomplete efficacy responders to elagolix 150 mg QD at Month 3 and randomized to elagolix 150 mg QD treatment group !(C)Incomplete efficacy responders to elagolix 150 mg QD at Month 3 and randomized to elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA 1/0.5 mg QD treatment group Month 7 Through Month 24 (Double-Blind): !(A)Efficacy responders to elagolix 150 mg QD at Month 3 and continue treatment through Month 24 !(C)Incomplete efficacy responders to elagolix 150 mg QD at Month 3 and randomized to elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA 1/0.5 mg QD treatment group and continue treatment through Month 24. !(D)Incomplete efficacy responders to elagolix 150 mg QD at Month 3, randomized to elagolix 150 mg QD treatment group and remain incomplete efficacy responders at Month 6, dose increased to elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA 1/0.5 mg QD through Month 24 !(E)Incomplete efficacy responders to elagolix 150 mg QD at Month 3, randomized to elagolix 150 mg QD treatment group and are efficacy responde rs at Month 6 continue treatmen t through Month 24"
3,page_3,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 4 Study Duration: The total duration for this study is approximately 27 to 50 months, consisting of 4 study periods: !Washout Period – up to 10 months prior to Screening (only applicable if subject is taking exclusionary medication at the time of consenting; duration of washout depends on the type of excluded medication being taken) !Screening Period – approximately 1.5 to 4 months prior to the first dose of study drug. !Treatment Period – up to a total of 24-months treatment duration consisting of the following: oOpen-Label Run-In Period: 3 month treatment duration from Day 1 to Treatment Month 3 study visit oDouble-Blind Active Treatment Period: Treatment Month 3 study visit through Treatment Month 24 study visit !Follow-up Period – up to 12 months following the last dose of study drug Washout Period: Following informed consent, subjects who have been taking exclusionary medications prior to screening that require discontinuation (washout), must enter the Washout Period. The duration of the required washout period is based on the excluded medication being taken. Applicable study procedures may be performed, such as medical, social and gynecological history (including documentation of diagnosis of endometriosis via surgical visualization, histological diagnosis), a brief physical examination with vital signs and urine pregnancy testing; protocol-related adverse event review and documentation of current medications. Subjects must complete the Washout Period and have had at least 1 menstrual period (menses) prior to entering the Screening Period. Subjects will also begin the use of non-hormonal dual contraception during the Washout Period and receive counseling on the importance of consistent, appropriate and effective use of contraception, and contraceptives dispensed, as necessary. Screening Period: Following informed consent (if Washout was not required), subjects will enter into the Screening Period. Eligible subjects will have documentation of a surgical confirmation of endometriosis. In addition to medical and gynecological history, specific history will be obtained to help identify potential risk factors/predictors related to changes in BMD, including modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. The following safety assessments will be completed during the Screening Period: a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck to document baseline BMD; a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) to rule out any clinically significant gynecological disorders such as ovarian cysts, fibroids or endometrial polyps; a Papanicolau (Pap) test to rule out malignancy or pre-malignant changes; a mammogram in subjects 39 years of age or older if one has not been performed within 3 months prior to start of Screening; baseline ECG; as well as clinical laboratory testing."
4,page_4,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 5 Screening Period (Continued): An electronic diary (e-Diary) will be provided to subjects to begin recording dysmenorrhea (DYS) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP) via the 4 point Endometriosis Daily Pain Impact Diary; Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS; dyspareunia (if applicable) via a 4-point scale and the presence and intensity of uterine bleeding. Subjects will record use of protocol allowed analgesic rescue medications for endometriosis-associated pain in the e-Diary. A minimum of 45 days of daily e-Diary entries are required to be completed during the Screening Period. To be considered eligible for the study, during the last 35 calendar days of the Screening Period, subjects must have at least 2 days of moderate or severe DYS and one of the following: at least 2 days of moderate or severe NMPP with an average NMPP score of at least 1.0, OR at least 4 days of moderate or severe NMPP and an average NMPP score of at least 0.5. Additionally, subjects must have 2 menstrual cycles with cycle lengths of 21 – 38 days, and at least 1 full menstrual cycle (i.e., 2 menses or menstrual periods) must be documented in the e-Diary during the Screening Period. Subjects will be allowed to take protocol-specified analgesic rescue medication for endometriosis-associated pain and will record use daily in the e-Diary. Protocol specific analgesic rescue medication for endometriosis-associated pain will include four equivalent NSAID choices and two equivalent opioid choices); use of other rescue analgesic or the use of prophylactic analgesic medications for endometriosis-associated pain is not allowed. The subject and Investigator will decide on the appropriate rescue analgesic medications for that subject (based on the approved options). Subjects are also required to use appropriate non- hormonal methods of contraception (as applicable). Contraceptive counseling will be provided and contraceptives dispensed, as necessary. Treatment Period:The Treatment Period begins with Study Day 1. Study Day 1 will occur between Cycle Days 1 to 10 of a subject's menses (Cycle Day 1 is defined as first day with full menstrual flow) for all subjects who meet eligibility criteria during the Screening Period. On Study Day 1, all subjects will begin open-label dosing with elagolix 150 mg QD. The first dose of study drug will be administered at the study site on Day 1 and study drug kits will be dispensed to subjects to continue daily dosing. Monthly on-site study visits will be conducted during the first 6 months of the Treatment Period. Subjects will be expected to come in to the site every other month during Treatment Months 7 – 12 and every third month during Treatment Months 13 – 24. Telephone contacts will be conducted at months without an on-site visit. Subjects will be asked to complete various patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires at designated study visits. At the Day 1 visit (prior to dosing) and at all monthly visits (on-site and telephone contacts), site staff will administer to subjects the overall endometriosis-associated pain questionnaire, an 11-point NRS with a 7-day recall period. Starting at Treatment Month 1 and at all on-site visits thereafter, subjects will complete the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) questionnaire. Pregnancy (serum and/or urine) tests will be performed at each visit throughout the Treatment Period. Urine pregnancy test kits will be provided to subjects for use at home for the study visits when subjects are not required to come into the clinic/site. Subjects will self-administer the tests and report the results to the site at the telephone contact visits. A positive urine pregnancy test result must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test. If a serum pregnancy test result is positive at any time during the Treatment Period, study drug will be discontinued."
5,page_5,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 6 Treatment Period (Continued): Subjects will continue to use the daily e-Diary to record DYS, NMPP; dyspareunia; Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS; rescue analgesic use for endometriosis-associated pain and the presence and intensity of uterine bleeding through Treatment Month 6. Throughout the 24-month Treatment Period, all subjects will be allowed to take protocol specified analgesic medication for endometriosis-associated pain. Use of non-protocol specific analgesic or prophylactic analgesic medications for endometriosis-associated pain will not be allowed. After Treatment Month 6 use of protocol specific analgesic rescue medications will be assessed and documented at the study visits. At designated study visits during the 24-month Treatment Period, blood samples will be collected for clinical safety labs, including vitamin D levels. In addition, blood samples will be collected for assay of serum estradiol, plasma concentrations of elagolix and norethindrone. BMD will be assessed throughout the Treatment Period. Following baseline, DXA scans will be obtained at Treatment Months 6, 12, 18 and 24. A DXA scan will be required if a subject discontinues at the time of or after the Treatment Month 6 visit or if the reason for premature discontinuation is due to the occurrence of a fracture or any newly diagnosed bone condition. Vital signs assessments will be conducted at all on-site study visits. Additional safety assessments are completed as appropriate at designated study visits throughout the Treatment Period. Adverse event and concomitant medication review will be conducted at all study visits. Criteria for Assessment of Subject Status Following the Open-Label Run-In Period: At the Treatment Month 3 study visit, subjects will be assessed as either an 'efficacy responder' or an 'incomplete efficacy responder' based on responses entered in the e-Diary on the Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS. The status of a subject will be determined (in a blinded manner) within the e-Diary system as follows: !Efficacy responder: ≥ 30% decrease (improvement) from Baseline based on the average of the daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS over a 35 day window !Incomplete efficacy responder: < 30% decrease (improvement) from Baseline based on the average of the Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS over a 35 day window Following conclusion of the Open-Label Run-In Period, treatment arm assignment for all subjects will become and remain blinded for the remainder of the 24-month Treatment Period. Dose Escalation During the Treatment Period: Subjects assessed as ""efficacy responders"" (as defined above) at Treatment Month 3 visit will be assigned to continue dosing with elagolix 150 mg QD (Group A) in a blinded manner via Interactive Response Technology (IRT). All other subjects assessed as ""incomplete efficacy responders"" at Treatment Month 3 visit will be assigned randomly (in an equal ratio) via IRT to either elagolix 150 mg QD (Group B) or elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD (Group C) for 3 months. To preserve the blind, IRT will be utilized for study drug assignment for all subjects. The first dose from the newly assigned study drug kit at Treatment Month 3 will be administered at the site. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics samples must be obtained prior to study drug administration at the Treatment Month 3 visit."
6,page_6,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 7 Dose Escalation During the Treatment Period (Continued): At the Treatment Month 6 study visit, in a blinded manner via IRT, all subjects who were incomplete efficacy responders and randomly assigned at Treatment Month 3 to elagolix 150 mg QD will again be assessed for efficacy response in the same manner as was done at the Treatment Month 3 visit. All subjects in this group (Group B) who become efficacy responders will continue dosing with elagolix 150 mg QD in a blinded manner (Group E). All other subjects in this group who are assessed as incomplete efficacy responders at Treatment Month 6 will escalate dosing to elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD (Group D). To preserve the blind, IRT will be utilized for treatment assignment of all subjects; however, only subjects randomly assigned at Treatment Month 3 to the elagolix 150 mg QD (Group B) will have a chance for dose modification. The first dose from the newly assigned study drug kit at Treatment Month 6 will be administered at the site. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics samples must be obtained prior to study drug administration at the Treatment Month 6 visit. The treatment assignments following the Treatment Month 6 study visit will continue for all subjects for the duration of the 24-month Treatment Period in a blinded manner. There will not be further dose adjustments following the Treatment Month 6 visit for any subject. BMD Assessment and Subject Specific Safety Stopping Criteria for BMD During the Treatment Period: DXA scans of the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck will be obtained at Treatment Months 6, 12, 18 and 24. If the results of any post-baseline DXA prior to the Treatment Month 24 timepoint, as read by the central imaging vendor selected for the study, document a Z-score (for subjects < 40 years of age at the time of the Screening DXA) or a T-score (for subjects ≥ 40 years of age at the time of the Screening DXA) of < –2.5 in the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck, or > 8% decrease in BMD from baseline the subject must be discontinued from study drug dosing and will enter the Follow-Up Period. Follow-Up Period: Subjects will enter the Follow-Up Period for up to 12 months to assess bone recovery after up to 24 months of treatment with the study drug. Subjects who prematurely discontinue (PD) from the study at the time of or after the Treatment Month 6 visit or if the reason for PD is related to bone fracture will enter the Follow-Up Period. DXA scans of the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck will be obtained. Any ongoing adverse events or adverse events of bone fracture, clinically significant BMD decrease or a newly diagnosed medically-related bone condition will be collected during the Follow-Up Period. Concomitant medication use will be reviewed at on-site visits. The Follow-Up Period for the study should conclude for all subjects approximately 30 days after the last completed Treatment Month 24 visit. Central Laboratory and Central Imaging Vendors: DXA, TVU, safety clinical lab samples will be analyzed/evaluated using central laboratories or imaging vendors. Assays for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will be analyzed at AbbVie."

19,page_19,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 20 3.0 Introduction 3.1 Endometriosis Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus.1 Endometriosis primarily affects women of childbearing age, and is a frequently debilitating condition that is associ ated with a range of symptoms, the most common of which are dysmenorrhea (DYS) or painful menses, and non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP), as well as painful sexual intercourse or dyspareunia. Endometriosis is also a common reason cited for infertility. The treatment of pain in wome n with endometriosis is remarkable for the number of therapeutic classes that are used to manage these symptoms and their use has been detailed in key clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), 2American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM),3 European Society of Human Re production and Embryology (ESHRE),4the Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology Canada (SOGC) and the World Endometriosis Society (WES). 5 To date, no therapy has an optimal benefit/risk profile, which attests to the unmet need for effective therapy for women suffering from endometriosis-associated pain. 3.2 Elagolix Elagolix sodium (hereinafter ""elagolix"") is a novel, oral, short-acting, nonpeptide competitive gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist that is being developed by AbbVie for the management of endometriosis with associated pain and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. 3.2.1 Preclinical Experience 3.2.1.1 Toxicology A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicolo gy in addition to data on absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination can be found in the Investigator Brochure. 6"
20,page_20,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 21 3.2.2 Clinical Experience The current Investigator Brochure provides details of the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of elagolix in humans, in addition to a summary of elagolix clinical studies in Phases 1, 2 and 3.6 In two replicate Phase 3 studies in women with endometriosis-associated pain, both elagolix treatment groups (elagolix 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID) met the coprimary efficacy endpoints showing a statistically significant higher proportion of responders for dysmenorrhea (DYS) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP) than those who received placebo at Month 3. 7 Persistence of efficacy was observed through Month 6. The 150 mg QD dose demonstrated efficacy in 3 of 7 key ranked secondary outcome measures including significant reductions from baseline with the Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS (at Month 3), DYS (at Month 6) and NMPP (at Month 6). The 200 mg BID dose showed additional statist ically significant improvement in all 7 key ranked secondary outcome measures, including reductions in any rescue analgesic agent (NSAIDS or opioids), and dyspareunia scores. Consistent with estradiol (E2) suppression and previous elagolix studies, there was a dose dependent effect on BMD, such that a longer duration of treatment with the higher elagolix dose (200 mg BID) may require concomitant use of hormonal add back therapy to mitigate BMD loss. Elagolix is not contraceptive and can change the menstrual bleeding pattern. A folliculogenesis study with elagolix revealed a dose-dependent suppression of ovulation. Elagolix should not be used in women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. Information regarding contraception counseling and pregnancy testing is provided in Section 5.2.4 . 3.3 Differences Statement This Phase 3b study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of elagolix 150 mg QD and elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD in 18 to 49 year old"
21,page_21,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 22 premenopausal women with endometriosis with moderate to severe pain. This study is intended to provide additional dosing guidan ce for elagolix 150 mg daily over a 2 year treatment period, and dose escalation to 200 mg BID with E2/NETA in incomplete responders. In addition, this study will investigate known modifiable risk factors for BMD decrease to further educate practitioners as to which patients may be at higher risks for BMD decrease. Such information would equip prescribers to safely prescribe elagolix for longer periods of time. 3.4 Benefits and Risks Clinical studies with elagolix have demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in endometriosis-associated pain in premenopausal women with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain, including clinically meaningful improvements in DYS, NMPP, and in some cases, dyspareunia. Elagolix has been administered to over 3,700 subjects to date, and has been generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events associated with its use have included hot flush, headache and nausea. 6 A modest degree of BMD decrease has been associated with elagolix, also in a dose-dependent manner, as expected from its mechanism of action. Hormonal add-back therapy may help to mitigate this effect. Menstrual cycle changes are also observed in individuals administered elagolix, and include lengthening of the cycle, and in some subjects, oligo-or amenorrhea and/or irregular bleeding or s potting. Pregnancies have been observed in subjects exposed to elagolix, which is consistent with the dose-dependent effect on suppression of ovulation. To date, the benefit/risk profile of elagolix appears to remain favorable for the management of endometriosis-associated pain, and will be further defined by data from this Phase 3 trial. 4.0 Study Objective The objectives of this study are to:"

After establishing eligibility, the study starts with open-label treatment for the first 3 months. Following the Treatment Month 3 visit and continuing through Month 24, the study is conducted in a double-blinded manner with treatment assignment determined based on the efficacy responder status assessed at Treatment Months 3 and 6. At the Treatment Month 3 study visit, the efficacy responder status of each subject will be determined based on the responses to the Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS collected in the electronic diary (e-Diary). The results of the responder status determination are blinded and the details of the responder status calculation are outlined in Section 5.5.3 . Subjects determined to be efficacy responders at the Treatment Month 3 visit will continue to dose with elagolix 150 mg QD in a blinded manner throughout the remainder of the 24-month Treatment Period.

Eligible subjects will have documentation of a surgical confirmation of endometriosis. In addition to medical and gynecological history, specific history will be obtained to help identify potential risk factors/predictors related to changes in BMD, including modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. The following safety assessments will be completed during the Screening Period: ●dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine total hip and femoral neck to document baseline BMD ●transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) to rule out any clinically significant gynecological disorders such as ovarian cysts, fibroids or endometrial polyps; ●Papanicolau (Pap) test to rule out malignancy or pre-malignant changes; ●endometrial biopsy to rule out endometrial pathology; ●mammogram in subjects 39 years of age or older if one has not been performed within 3 months prior to start of Screening; ●baseline ECG; ●clinical laboratory testing. An electronic diary (e-Diary) will be provided to subjects to begin recording: ●DYS and NMPP via the 4-point Endometriosis Daily Pain Impact Diary; ●Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS; ●dyspareunia (if applicable) via a 4-point scale and ●the presence and intensity of uterine bleeding. A minimum of 45 days of daily e-Diary entrie s are required to be completed during the Screening Period.

Additionally, subjects must have 2 menstrual cycles with cycle length of 21 – 38 days, and at least 1 full menstrual cycle (i.e., 2 menses or menstrual periods) must be documented in the e-Diary during the Screening Period. Subjects will be allowed to take protocol-specified analgesic rescue medication for endometriosis-associated pain and will record use daily in the e-Diary. Protocol specific analgesic rescue medication for endometriosis-associated pain will include four equivalent NSAID choices and two e quivalent opioi d choices. Use of other rescue analgesic or the use of prophylactic analgesic medications for endometriosis-associated pain is not allowed. The subject and Investigator will decide on the appropriate rescue analgesic medications for that subject (based on the approved options). Subjects are also required to use appropriate non -hormonal m ethods of contraception. Subjects who have signed the informed consent and did not complete the Day 1 visit will be considered screen failures. Subjects who initially screen f ail for the study may be permitted to re-screen following re-consent. The subject must meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria during re-screen ing to qualify for the study. There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to re-screen for the study. Treatment Period: The Treatment Period begins with Study Da y 1. Study Day 1 will occur between Cycle Days 1 to 10 of a subject's menses (Cycle Day 1 is defined as first day with full menstrual flow) for all subjects who meet eligibility cri teria during the Screening Period.

Monthly on-site study visits will be conducted during the first 6 months of the Treatment Period. Subjects will be expected to come in to the site every other month during Treatment Months 7 – 12 and every third month during Treatment Months 13 – 24. Telephone contacts will be conducted at months without an on-site visit. Subjects will be asked to complete various patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires at desi gnated study visits. At the Day 1 visit (prior to dosing) and at all monthly visits (on-site and telephone contacts), site staff will administer to subjects the overall endometriosis-associated pain questionnaire, an 11-point NRS with a 7-day recall period. Starting at Treatment Month 1 and at all on-site study visits thereafter, subjects will complete the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) questionnaire. Pregnancy (serum and/or urine) tests will be performed at each visit throughout the Treatment Period. Urine pregnancy test kits will be provided to subjects for use at home for the study visits when subjects are not required to come into the clinic/site. Subjects will self-administer the tests and report the results to the site at the telephone contact visits. A positive urine pregnancy test result (including those from home pregnancy testing) must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test. If a serum pregnancy test result is positive at any time during the Treatment Period, study drug will be discontinued. Subjects will continue to use the daily e-Diary to record DYS, NMPP; dyspareunia; Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS; rescue analgesic use for endometriosis-associated pain and the presence and intensity of uterine bleeding through Treatment Month 6. Throughout the 24-month Treatment Period, all subjects will continue to be allowed to take protocol specified rescue analgesic medication for endometriosis-associated pain. Use of non-protocol specific analgesic or prophylactic analgesic medications for endometriosis-associated pain will not be allowed. Subjects will record the use of protocol specific analgesic rescue medications for endometriosis-associated pain in the daily e-Diary un til Treatment M onth 6; thereafter, use of protocol specific analgesic rescue medications will be assessed and documented at the study visits."
29,page_29,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 30 At designated study visits during the 24-m onth Treatment Period, blood samples will be collected for clinical safety labs, including vitamin D levels. In addition, bl ood samples will be collected for assay of serum estradiol, plasma concentrations of elagolix and norethindrone. BMD will be assessed throughout the Treatment Period. Following baseline, DXA scans will be obtained at Treatment Months 6, 12, 18 and 24. A DXA scan will be required if a subject discontinues at the time of or after the Treatment Month 6 visit or if the reason for premature discontinuation is due to the occurrence of a fracture or any newly diagnosed bone condition. Vital signs assessments will be conducted at all on-site study visits. Additional safety assessments are completed as appropriate at designated study visits throughout the Treatment Period. Adverse event and concomitant medication review will be conducted at all Treatment Period study visits. Criteria for Assessment of Subject Status Following the Open-Label Run-In Period: At the Treatment Month 3 study visit, subjects will be assessed as either an 'efficacy responder' or an 'incomplete efficacy responder' based on responses entered in the e-Diary on the Daily Diary endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS. The status of a subject will be determined within the e-Diary system as follows: ●Efficacy responder: ≥ 30% decrease (improvement) from Baseline based on the average of the Daily Diary for endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS over a 35 day window ●Incomplete efficacy responder: < 30% decrease (improvement) from Baseline based on the average of the Daily Diary for endometriosis-associated pain score via NRS over a 35 day window ●Following conclusion of the Open-Label Run-In Period, treatment arm assignment for all subjects will become and remain blinded for the remainder of the 24-month Treatment Period.

Dose Escalation During the Treatment Period: Subjects assessed as ""efficacy responders"" (as defined above) will be assigned to continue dosing with elagolix 150 mg QD (Group A) in a blinded manner via Interactive Response Technology (IRT). All other subjects asse ssed as ""incomplete efficacy responders"" will be assigned randomly (in an equal ratio) vi a IRT to either elagolix 150 mg QD (Group B) or elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD (Group C) for 3 months. To preserve the blind, IRT will be utilized for study drug assignment for all subjects. The first dose from the newly assigned study drug kit at Treatment Month 3 will be administered at the site. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics samples must be obtained prior to study drug administration at the Treatment Month 3 visit. At the Treatment Month 6 study visit, in a blinded manner via IRT, all subjects who were incomplete efficacy responders and randomly assigned at Treatment Month 3 to elagolix 150 mg QD will again be assessed for efficacy response in the same manner as was done at the Treatment Month 3 visit.

A positive urine pregnancy test result (including a home urine pregnancy test) must be confirmed with a quantitative serum pregnancy test. The subject should temporarily discontinue study drug administration while waiting for the results of the serum pregnancy test. If a serum pregnancy test result is positive at any time during the Treatment Period, the site will immediately i nform the subject to discontinue study drug dosing (Section 5.4.1 ). If a subject is confirmed as pregnant, the subject will be prematurely discontinued from the study. If the subject becomes pregnant at any time after baseline up through 30 days post last dose of study drug, an ultrasound examination will be performed during the first trimester of pregnancy to assess the gestational age and estimated date of delivery. Refer to Section 6.1.6 for instructions on reporting a pregnancy to the Sponsor and the required follow-up on the subject's fetus, pregnancy outcome and infant. 5.3 Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic and Safety Assessments/Variables 5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow Chart Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are summarized in tabular format in Appendix C ."
52,page_52,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 53 5.3.1.1 Procedures The study procedures outlined in Appendix C are discussed in detail in this section, with the exception of study drug dispensing/compliance/accountability (Section 5.5.7 ), contraception counseling/contraceptive dispensing (Section 5.2.4 ), the collection of concomitant medication (Section 5.2.3 ), randomization (Section 5.5.3 ) and adverse event information (Section 6.0). All study data will be recorded on the eCRFs with the exception of the e-Diary, select PRO data and data from central lab/imaging vendor. The Screening Period will occur within approximately 1.5 to 4 months prior to administration of the first dose of study drug on Day 1. For procedures repeated during the Screening Period (as allowed per protocol or at the discretion of the AbbVie TA Scientific Director/MD), the procedure performed closest prior to dosing will serve as a baseline for clinical assessment. Scheduled monthly visits during the Treatment and Follow-Up Periods are based on a 28-day month. All scheduled study visits during the Treatment and Follow-Up Periods should occur within ± 5 days of the schedu led date. However, the TVU, DXA scan, Pap test and endometrial biopsy may be performed within approximately ± 15 days around the associated scheduled Treatment Month visit. This protocol provides recommendations regarding the sequence of procedures to be performed during the study. In no case should these recommendations outweigh clinical judgment or standard of care. If the protocol indicates that the AbbVie TA Scientific Director is to be contacted prior to performing a procedure, yet the timing of the request would either interrupt a procedure or would interfere with standard of care and clinical judgment, then clinical judgmen t should prevail and the AbbVie TA Scientific Director should be notified afterwards. Informed Consent The IRB/IEC approved informed consent will be signed by the subject before discontinuing any hormonal contraception/th erapies or other prohibited medications or"

Subjects who have signed informed consent and did not enroll on Day 1 because they either did not complete the Washout Period (if applicable), did not complete the study-specific procedures during the Screening Period or did not meet all entry criteria w ill be considered Screen Failures. The reason(s) for screen failure will be recorded in the source documents and will be captured in the eCRF. Medical/Social History A complete medical history, including documentation of any clinically significant medical conditions, procedures and applicable medications (Section 5.2.3.1 ), history of tobacco and alcohol use will be collected during the Washout Period (if applicable) or during the Screening Period for those subjects who do not require washout. The medical history will be reviewed and should be updated if significant clinical findings are noted on Day 1 prior to dosing and will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment. Gynecological and Endometriosis History A gynecological and endometriosis history wi ll be collected either during the Washout Period (if applicable) or during the Screening Period for those who do not require washout. The gynecological and endometriosis history w ill be reviewed and should be updated if needed prior to dosing on Day 1 and will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment. Physical Examination A complete physical examination will include height (at Screening only) and weight measurements (the subject should wear lightweight clothing and not wear shoes). A brief, symptom-directed physical examin ation will be performed at Washout (if applicable)."
54,page_54,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 55 Visits requiring either the complete physical examination (including weight) or a brief, symptom-directed physical examinations are outlined in the Study Activities Table in Appendix C . Clinically significant physical examination findings prior to study drug dosing on Day 1 will be recorded as medical or gynecological history. Any clinically significant physical examination findings after initiation of dosing will be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRFs as adverse events. The complete physical examination performed during Screening will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment. Gynecological Examination A complete breast and pelvic examination, including external genitalia, will be performed during the Screening and Treatment periods as listed in Appendix C . Timing of brief symptom-directed gynecologic examinations are outlined in Appendix C , but may also be performed at any time throughout the study as de emed clinically necessary. The complete breast, pelvic and external genitalia examination completed during Screening will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) A resting 12-lead ECG will be conducted during the Screening Period. The ECG should be obtained prior to any blood collection. For any abnormal screening test results, th e ECG may be repeated one time prior to/on Day 1, however the subject may not be enrolled if any clinically significant findings are noted on the repeat ECG. Final results (i.e., results used to determine eligibility) will be entered into the eCRF. The Investigator or qualified designee at the study site will determine if any findings are clinically significant (in consultation with a cardiologist, if necessary), and document this on the ECG tracing/report, sign and date it. The original ECG tracing or a certified copy"
55,page_55,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 56 of the original tracing with the physician's a ssessment will be retained in the subject's source records at the study site. Vital Signs Vital sign determination of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature will be obtained at all visits during the study as indicated in Appendix C . The blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate measurements should be taken prior to scheduled blood collections (if applicable). Measurements should be assessed consistently throughout the study and will be recorded in the source documents and eCRF. The vital signs measurements obtained prior to dosing on Day 1 will serve as the baseline measurements for clinical assessment. Mammogram Mammograms at Screening will only be required for subjects who are 39 years of age or older and have not had one performed within 3 months prior to the time of entry into Screening. If a subject's mammogram results are incomplete (BI-RADS 0) and need to be repeated, the AbbVie TA Scientific Director does not need to be contacted for approval prior to conducting the repeat mammogram or other mode of imaging (e.g., ultrasound, spot compression). If these results meet entry requirements, subject would be allowed to continue in Screening. If the repeat mammogram or other breast imaging results indicate further testing is required (e.g., breast biopsy) to rule out any potential exclusionary findings, the subject is not eligible for the study. Any further imaging or testing will be performed outside of the protocol and should follow standard of care. Mammograms will be read locally and the local radiologist's interpretation will be used to determine if a subject meets eligibilit y criteria. Subjects with normal or benign findings or BI-RADS Classifications 1 or 2 (via mammogram or other mode of imaging) as outlined in Appendix D will be eligible for study drug dosing on Day 1. Subjects with an"

Subjects should continue with recommended mammography testing outside of the protocol per local guidelines and standard of care during the study. TVU The TVU will be performed by the site, affiliated Radiology Department or ultrasound facility per the acquisition guidelines provide by the Central Imaging Core Lab (central reader). The ultrasonographer or designee for each investigative site should submit electronically the subject's TVU imaging data to the central reader within 3 business days following co llection in order to determine eligibility for participation in this study and for subject evaluation during the course of the study. TVUs will be assessed both locally and by a central reader. The TVU performed during the Screening Period will assess subject eligibility and establish baseline findings. The Central Imaging vendor will issue a qualification form documenting the presence or absence of protocol-defined exclusionary pathology during Screening. Subject eligibility will be based on the central reader's or AbbVie TA Scientific Director/MD's assessment, which will override the local radiologist's assessment. If a repeat TVU is performed per protocol, data reported from both procedures may be taken into the consideration by the AbbVie TA Scientific Director/MD when assessing eligibility. Th e TVU data from the central imaging vendor will be used for analysis and for subject management. The Investigator should consult the local ultrasound report (or images if the report is not available) in order to make any safety related judgments con cerning the subject. In this case, the local ultrasound reports will be maintained in the subject's source documents and copies may be collected upon request by the Sponsor. Data from the local ultrasound report will not be reported in the eCRF un less associated with an adverse event. The Screening TVU should be performed during the subject's early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle (approximately Days 4 – 8 of the cycle). The Screening TVU may be repeated per protocol (e.g., ovarian cyst criteria) or as clinically appropriate."
57,page_57,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 58 During the Treatment Period, a TVU will also be performed at Month 12 and Month 24 or the Premature Discontinuation (PD) visit (for subjects who prematurely discontinue at the time of or after their Treatment Month 6 visit, unless the subject had a study TVU within approximately 1 month prior to the PD visit). Sites will receive reports from the central reader detailing the results of the TVU performed for these visits. The TVU for the Month 12 and Month 24 visit may be performed within approximately ± 15 days of the scheduled corresponding visit to allow for the evaluation of results. Per Investigator review of the report from th e central reader, subjects with clinically significant ovarian, endometrial or other abnormal findings in the opinion of the Investigator will require a repeat TVU, saline infusion sonography (SIS) or office hysteroscopy. The repeat TVU will be submitted to the central reader; the SIS or office hysteroscopy will be read locally, with results recorded in the source and eCRF. If in the Investigator's clinical judgment, the clinically significant findings persist on the repeat procedure and would preclude the subject from continuing in the Treatment Period due to safety reasons, the subject will be discontinued from the Treatment Period (Section 5.4). If a repeat TVU is performed per protocol, data reported from both procedures may betaken into the consideration by the Investigator/AbbVie TA Scientific Director/MD when assessing. Assessments to be completed by the central imaging vendor include, but are not limited to: ●endometrial thickness (double layer, mm) ●other clinically relevant endometrial findings ●presence/size/location of uterine fibroids ●presence/size/appearance (simple versus complex) of ovarian cysts ●presence/size/appearance of endometriomas."

Information regarding this procedure should be recorded in the source documents and eCRF. Bone Mineral Density (DXA Scan) DXA scans of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip will be performed throughout the study as indicated in Appendix C , by qualified technologists/radiologists at the site or affiliated imaging facility utilizing GE Lunar or Hologic equipment and per the acquisition guidelines provided by the central imaging vendor selected for the study. The DXA technologist/radiologist or designee for each investigative site should electronically submit the subject's DXA images to the central imaging vendor for review and analysis within 3 business days following acquisition. Subject eligibility and treatment management will be made based on results issued by the central imaging vendor. Sites will receive reports from the central imaging vendor detailing the results (including BMD measurements and Z- and T-scores of the DXA scans performed. Instructions on calibration and standardization of instruments and any additional required information will be specified in a manual from the central imaging vendor that will be provided to all study sites.

DXA Scans Performed in the Follow-Up Period DXA scans of the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck will be obtained at Follow-Up Months 6 and/or 12 for those subjects whose follow-up period visits occur prior to the study conclusion (i.e., approximately 30 days after the last completed Treatment Period visit). Endometrial Biopsy Endometrial biopsies will be performed during the Screening and Treatment Periods, as indicated in Appendix C . Instructions on endometrial biopsy collection, processing and shipping procedures will be provided by the central laboratory selected for this study. All central laboratory pathologists will be blinded to the subjects' treatment group assignments. Endometrial biopsies will be independently read by two qualified central laboratory pathologists. If the results are discrepant, the biopsy will be read by a third central laboratory pathologist to facilitate resolution and the worst case reading (of all three reads) will be taken as the final diagnosis. A final pathology report containing the final diagnosis from the central laboratory will be issued to the Investigator in all cases. Prior to performing the endometrial biopsy, a negative urine pregnancy result must be obtained on the day of the procedure. The Investigator should write a brief procedure note in the source documentation noting the depth of placement of the Pipelle during the procedure. Pre-med ication for the endometri al biopsy procedure is allowable. At the investigator's discretion, misoprostol for cervical dilation is allowable. In addition, lidocaine may be used as local anesthesia on the cervix. Any medications used for the procedure should be recorded in source documents and on the appropriate eCRF. If an endometrial biopsy cannot be performed b ecause of anatomical reasons, the AbbVie TA"
61,page_61,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 62 Scientific Director should be contacted who will consult with AbbVie TA MD for further guidance. If the endometrial biopsy is performed on the same day as the Pap test or TVU, the endometrial biopsy should be performed after the Pap test and TVU. Biopsy results from the central laboratory must be obtained and reviewed by the Investigator to ensure eligibilit y criteria are met before the subject can be randomized on Day 1. In case of an insufficient sample the biopsy should be repeated. Subjects must have an adequate endometrial biopsy with results documenting no significant endometrial pathology in order to be eligible for study enrollment on Day 1. However, if the repeat sample is deemed insufficient by the central laboratory, the AbbVie Scientific Director should be contacted who will consult with AbbVie TA MD and provide recommendation regarding eligibility. On the Screening endometrial biopsy, if a clinically significant abnormal finding such as endometrial hyperplasia (with or without atypia) or endometrial cancer is reported, subjects will not be eligible for enrollment into the study. If the Investigator determines that an abnormal finding (e.g., endometritis) can be treated outside of the protocol, a repeat biopsy can be performed after treatment at the Investigator's discretion. The results of the repeat biopsy will determine if the subject may remain in Screening. The repeat biopsy must meet eligibility criteria prior to study enrollment. The endometrial biopsies required during the Treatment period may be performed within approximately ± 15 days around the scheduled study visit. At Treatment Month 12, subjects with significant endometrial pat hology (e.g., acute or chronic endometritis, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer) w ill not be allowed to continue in the Treatment Period and will be prematurely discontinued. Treatment of subjects with endometrial pathology should be mana ged according to the Investigator's clinical judgment and local standard of care, and should be documented appropriately in source documents and eCRFs. Clinically significant changes from baseline should bedocumented as an adverse event."

All Month 3 ""incomplete efficacy responders"" that were randomly assigned to be on Treatment Group B who become ""efficacy responders"" will continue dosing in Treatment Group E in a blinded manner. All other Month 3 'incomplete efficacy responder' subjects on Treatment Group B who are assessed as 'incomplete efficacy responders' at Month 6 will escalate dosing to Treatment Group D. To preserve the blind, at Month 6, IRT will be utilized for treatment assignment of all subjects; however, only Month 3 'incomplete efficacy responder' subjects on Treatment Group B for the additional 12 weeks after Treatment Month 3 will have a chance for dose modification. The subject number assigned via IRT at Washout of Screening does not change throughout the study. The treatment assignments following the Treatment Month 6 study visit will continue for all sub jects for the duration of the Treatment Period in a blinded manner. There will not be further dose adjustments following the Treatment Month 6 visit for any subject. 5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject Selection of the doses used for this study is discussed in Section 5.6.4 . Subjects will be assigned or randomized into treatment groups as appropriate described in Section 5.5.1 . Study drug will be administered at the study site on Day 1 and subjects will be instructed thereafter self-administer study drug once a day in the morning with approximately 8 oz (240 mL) of water. The first dose of study drug from the newly dispensed study drug kit(s) will be administered at the study site at Treatment Months 3 and 6. Starting at Treatment Month 3, subjects will be instructed to thereafter self-administer study drug twice a day (once in the morning and once in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart) with approximately 8 oz (240 mL) of water. Subjects must return all study drug containers (cartons and blister cards, used or unused) at the subsequent on-site study visit. 5.5.4.1 Treatment Interruption AbbVie or the Investigator may request that a subject temporarily discontinue study drug administration, which will be referred to as ""treatment interruption."" The following are"
87,page_87,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 88 examples for reasons when the investigator may consider whether a subject should undergo temporary treatment interruption: ●Adverse event that, based on clinical judgment, requires temporary suspension of study drug or prevents a subject from taking study drug ●Due to malfunction of protocol-specified methods of contraception or unprotected intercourse ●After a positive urine pregnancy test while waiting for results of the serum test ●Clinical laboratory findings that require repeating or confirmation of a clinically significant value (e.g., may necessitate discontinuation from the study). These examples are not all-inclusive; if the Investigator has any questions, these should be directed to the AbbVie TA Scientific Director who will discuss with AbbVie TAMD and provide a recommendation. 5.5.5 Blinding 5.5.5.1 Blinding of Investigational Product The active elagolix dose will be ident ical in appearance to its matched placebo; each active E2/NETA dose will be ident ical in appearance to its matched placebo. The study site personnel and subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment during the blinded portion of the study (starting at the Treatment Month 3 visit and will continue until the end of the Treatment Period Month 24). The IRT will provide access to blinded subject treatment information during the blinded portion of the study. AbbVie must be notified before the blind is broken, unless identification of the study drug is required for medical emergenc y, i.e., situation in which the knowledge of the specific blinded treatment will affect the immediate management of the subject/patient's conditions (AbbVie must then be notified within 24 hours after the blind being broken). The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documents and eCRF, as applicable."

Additionally the study will evaluate women at risk for greater decreases in DXA based on modifiable risk factors. 5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements The co-primary efficacy endpoints for this trial will be based upon the mutually-exclusive scales for daily assessment of DYS and NMPP measured by the 4-point Endometriosis Daily Pain Impact Diary. Use of protocol allowed rescue analgesic medication for endometriosis-associated pain will be included in the responder definition of the primary endpoints. Additional secondary efficacy measures of DYS and NMPP, dyspareunia, and the PGIC are widely used in e ndometriosis as assess ment tools. In addition to assessment of pain reduction, the effects of treatment can be assessed using evidence of impact on subjects' functioning and overall well-being as well as subjects' utilization of health"
90,page_90,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 91 resources and loss of time from work. Thus, PRO endpoints will also be utilized in the study. The safety assessments used in this study are standard, widely used and generally recognized as reliable, accurate and relevant within the context of this study design. For measurement of endometrial health, TVU has been selected as a reliable and established clinical assessment tool. TVU will also be utilized for evaluation of subjects for evidence of exclusionary gynecologic findings. Endometrial biopsy will provide a direct measure of any effect of elagolix on the endometrium. DXA is a standard accepted measure of bone mineral density, and will be utilized to assess the effect of elagolix plus E2/NETA. Given the known relationship between estradiol levels and bone loss, serum E2 measurements will also be utilized to assess potential bone effects of elagolix plus E2/NETA. 5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population Premenopausal women 18 to 49 years of age with moderate to severe endometriosis- associated pain were selected for this study because this is the demographic that suffers from endometriosis with associated pain, including dyspareunia. No studies in males or females outside of their reproductive years are necessary for this indication. 5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study Elagolix has a dose-dependent effect on BMD loss that is mediated through suppression of estradiol levels. Preliminary efficacy data from the completed Phase 3 clinical development program supports the ability of elagolix to reduce endometriosis-associated pain at both the 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID dose levels in a dose-dependent fashion (higher responder rate for 200 mg BID than for 150 mg QD). Also consistent with E2 suppression and findings from previous elagolix studies, there was a dose dependent effect on BMD, such that longer duration of treatment with the higher elagolix dose (200 mg BID) would likely require concomitant use of hormonal add back therapy to"
91,page_91,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 92 mitigate BMD decrease. Furthermore, data from the Phase 2b study of elagolix in subjects with heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids demonstrated the effect of E2/NETA on mitigating the BMD decrease associated with elagolix 300 mg BID. E2/NETA is approved for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal (estrogen-deficient) women. As such, the elagolix 200 mg BID dose, in combination with E2/NETA add-back therapy was selected for this Phase 3 study, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of this regimen in premenopausal women with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain. The objective is to generate data that would support a longer duration of use of this regimen for the proposed indication of mana gement of endometriosis with associated pain, similar to the ongoing Phase 3 registration program. 6.0 Complaints A Complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical character istics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performan ce of a product/device after it is released for distribution. Complaints associ ated with any component of this investigational product must be reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2 ). For adverse events, please refer to Sections 6.1 through 6.1.5 . For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2. 6.1 Medical Complaints The Investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a routine basis throughout the study. The Investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken. For serious adverse eventsconsidered as having ""no reasonable possibility"" of being associated with study drug, the Investigator will provide an 'Other' cause of the event. For adverse events to be"
92,page_92,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 93 considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity. Adverse events, whether in response to a query , observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded. All adverse events should be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. 6.1.1 Definitions 6.1.1.1 Adverse Event An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event. Any worsening of a subject's endometriosis-associated pain during the course of the study will not be captured as an adverse event unless it meets the criteria for a serious adverse event (Section 6.1.1.2 ), at which point, it will be reported as such. Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities, changes in BMD (during the Tr eatment Period) and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the Investigator considers them to be adverse events. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is b eing performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed"
93,page_93,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 94 earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event. 6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event. Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject. Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle)."
94,page_94,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 95 Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form. 6.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest Some adverse events, such as SAEs and adverse events of special interest (AESI), may require additional information to be collected, including family history. AESIs include, but are not limited to rash/hypersensitivity, fracture, neuro-psychiatric (depression, mood swings, etc.) and vasomotor symptoms (e.g., hot flush, night sweats). 6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity The Investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse event: Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject. Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities. Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening."
95,page_95,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 96 6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the use of study drug: Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug will be considered ""associated."" Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered ""not associated."" In addition, when the Investigator has not reported causality or deemed it not assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated. If an Investigator's opinion of ""no reasonable po ssibility of being related to study drug"" is given, another cause of event must be provi ded by the Investigator for serious adverse events. 6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period All adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug have elapsed will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject. All nonserious adverse events of bone fracture, clinically significant BMD loss, or newly diagnosed medically-related bone condition will be collected during the Follow-Up Period, until the subject discontinues from study participation. In addition, serious adverse events and protocol-related nonserious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent."

Subjects who become pregnant during the Treatment or Follow-Up Periods of the study must be discontinued (Section 5.4and Section 5.4.1 ). A positive urine pregnancy test result must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test. While waiting for the results of the serum pregnancy test, study drug should be temporarily discontinued pending results of the serum pregnancy test. If a serum pregnancy test result is positive at any time during the Treatment Period of the study, the site will immediately inform the subject to discontinue study drug. Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected for any study subject with a positive serum pregnancy test from the signing of the informed consent (i.e., washout [if applicable] or screening) through completion of the Follow-Up Month 1 visit. The site will report a positive pregnancy test to the Sponsor, will follow the course of the subject's pregnanc y, and report to the Sponsor on the health of the subject and fetus at each trimester, the newborn at the first post -delivery pediatrician visit and the infant 6 – 12 months post-delivery. If the subject becomes pregnant during the study, no additional study procedures, including protocol required DXA scans, will be conducted. However, an ultrasound examination will be performed as early as possible during the first trimester of pregnancy to assess the gestational age and document an intrauterine pregnancy. The following information on the outcome of a pregnancy that occurs after signing of the informed consent, regardless of when the subject became pregnant (i.e., either during the Washout, Screening, Treatment or through Follow-Up Month 1) should be collected: fetal outcome (e.g., spontaneous or elective abortion, live infant or still birth), date and mode of delivery, birth weight, birth length, gender, congenital anomaly and medically significant complications during pregnancy or labor or delivery.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints will be the proportion of responders at Month 6 based upon the mutually-exclusive scales for daily assessment of DYS and NMPP measured by the 4 point Endometriosis Daily Pain Impact Diary using the daily e-Diary. For each of the co-primary endpo ints, the criterion for defining a subject as a responder at Month 6 of the Treatment Period will include a reduction of X or greater from baseline in the average pain score as well as no increased analgesic rescue use for endometriosis-associated pain. The subjects will record use of these rescue analgesic medications on a daily basis in the e-Diary for the first 6 months of the treatment period. The definition of increased analgesic use is as follows: ●For the primary endpoints of DYS and NMPP, subjects will be considered non-responders if they have a 15% or greater increase from baseline in average pill count of rescue analgesics (endometriosis-associated) as further specified in Appendix H . For the first 6 months, the rescue analgesic use for any defined period will be based on the average pill count during the analysis window for each class of rescue analgesics: NSAIDs, opioids, and any (NSAIDs and/or opioids). The total pill count for each class of rescue analgesic is the sum of the pill count of the corresponding class of rescue analgesic, as reported in the e-Diary during the time period of interest. For the purposes of the rescue analgesic analysis, the number of pills within each class of rescue analgesic (NSAID or opioid) will be considered equi valent, regardless of specific pill choice,"
104,page_104,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 105 e.g., average NSAID pill count will consider all types of NSAIDs specified in Table 3 and will not be conducted separately by NSAID type. For both DYS and NMPP, responses of ""None,"" ""Mild,"" ""Moderate,"" and ""Severe"" will be assigned a score of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The average pain score for DYS or NMPP for Month 6 will be based on a 35 day window. If a subject's mean score for dysmenorrhea is undefined numerically for a time point because her daily e-Diary reports indicate she did not experience her period on any days during the 35 calendar day time period, then mean score for DYS for that time point w ill be set equal to zero (which reflects the absence of any dysmenorrhea during that reporting time period). For each of the co-primary endpoints, the criterion for defining a subject as a pain responder at Month 6 will be a reduction of X or greater from baseline. The threshold for response in the responder analysis (i.e., the value of X) will be chosen to represent a clinically meaningful reduction in pain. The threshold will be determined based on a ROC analysis using the PGIC at Month 6 as an anchor and change from baseline at Month 6. The PGIC is a 7-point response scale: ""Since I started taking the study medication, my endometriosis related pain has: very much improved (1), much improved (2), minimally improved (3), not changed (4), minimally worse (5), much worse (6), very much worse (7)."" The responses of ""much improved"" and ""very much improved"" on PGIC will be used to define responders, and the threshold for response (the value of X) will be chosen to balance sensitivity and specificity. That is, it will be the value that corresponds to the point on the ROC curve that is closest to the upper left corner when plotting 1-specificity versus sensitivity, i.e., closest to 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. No other covariates will be included in the ROC analysis."

Full analysis details will be provided in the SAP.Post-treatment bone mineral density scans w ill be summarized similarly, as appropriate. 8.1.5.5 Uterine Bleeding Descriptive statistics for uterine bleeding as collected in the daily e-Diary will be presented. 8.1.5.6 Endometrial Variables Endometrial biopsy result and ultrasound assessments will be summarized. 8.2 Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Plasma concentrations of elagolix and norethindrone and serum concentrations of estradiol will be listed for each subject by visit day and dose regimen, as applicable. Pharmacokinetic data may be combined with data from other studies in women. Exposure-response analyses may be conducted as appropriate. For example, if pharmacokinetic exposures are estimated, analyses may be conducted to assess the relationship of pharmacokinetic parameters and estradiol concentrations, versus efficacy and safety. Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate. 8.3 Determination of Sample Size This study plans to enroll approximately 890 subjects to ensure a sufficient number of subjects receive elagolix 150 mg QD for 24 months. Assuming the efficacy responder rate for the D aily Diary endometriosi s-associated pain score via NRS is 50% during the open label elagolix 150 mg QD group at Month 3, 50% of subjects who complete Month 3 of the open-label period and are incomplete responders to 150 mg QD will be randomized in equal ratio to 150 QD and 200 BID plus E2/NETA."
112,page_112,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 113 Among those, assuming Month 6 DYS and NMPP responder rates of 20% for subjects who are randomized to elagolix 150 mg QD group (Group B) and 50% for subjects who are randomized elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA treatment group (Group C), this sample size provides greater than 90% power to detect a difference in response rate based on a 2-sided test at the significance level of α = 0.05. The above sample size was calculated using nQuery advisor 7.0. Assuming 80% of incomplete responders to 150 mg QD who are randomized to 150 QD at Month 3 are switched to elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA at Month 6 and a 25% completion rate, the current sample size will provide at least 120 subjects who receive elagolix 150 mg QD treatment group for 24 months (Group A and E). 9.0 Ethics 9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., a dvertisements used to recruit subjects) and any other necessary documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB. The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted. IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site. Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval prior to implementation of any changes made to the study design. The investigator will be required to submit, maintain and archive study essential documents according to ICH GCP and all other applicable regulatory requirements. Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by local regulations, will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory"
113,page_113,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 114 Agencies, as required by local regulations. During the conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by local regulations) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects. Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie. 9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles th at have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A . 9.3 Subject Information and Consent The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject, and answer all questions regarding this study. Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed, signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements. A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record. An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy. Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form. In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the study, stored biomarker samples will continue to be used for research and analysis. In the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using these samples, the subject may request that their samples be withdrawn. Once AbbVie receives the request, remaining biomarker"
114,page_114,"Elagolix M16-383 Protocol 115 samples will be destroyed. If the subject changes his/her consent, and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data. An informed consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, must be voluntarily signed and dated before samples are collected for optional exploratory research. The nature of the testing should be explained and the subject given an opportunity to ask questions. The informed consent must be signed before the samples are collected and any testing is performed. If the subject does not consent to provide samples for the optional exploratory research, it will not impact their participation in the study. In the event a subject withdraws from the main study, optional exploratory research samples will continue to be stored and analyzed unless the subject specifically withdraws consent for the optional samples. If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the subject must inform their study doctor, and once AbbVie is informed, the optional samples will be destroyed. However, if the subject withdraws his/her consent and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data. 10.0 Source Documents and Case Report Form Completion 10.1 Source Documents Source documents are defined as original documents, data and records. This may include hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory data/information, subjects' diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing and other records, recorded data from automated instruments, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, and/or x-rays. Data collected during this study must be recorded to the appropriate source document. The Investigator Awareness Date (SAE CRF) may serve as the source for this data point. This adverse event data point required for eCRF completion can be entered directly in the eCRF."

Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the Investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data. It will be possible for the Investigator to make paper printouts from that media. Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) Patient reported data must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this study. Some of these data are being collected with an Electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) tool called TrialMax ®, provided by the technology vendor CRF Health of Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA. The ePRO system is in compliance with Title 21 CFR Part 11. The documentation related to the system validation of the ePRO tool is available through the vendor, CRF Health, while the user acceptance testing of the study-specific PRO design will be conducted and maintained at AbbVie. The subject will enter the data on an electronic device; these data will be uploaded to a server. The data on the server will be considered source, and maintained and managed by CRF Health. Internet access to the ePRO data will be provided by CRF Health for the duration of the trial. This access will be available for the duration of the trial to the site investigator, as well as delegated personnel. Such access will be removed from investigator sites following the receipt of the study archive.
