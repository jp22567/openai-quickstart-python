8,page_8,"Acupuncture for Chemotherapy -Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Among Ca ncer Patients Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC ) CCCWFU # 97118 Page 2 of 55 1.0 Introduction and Background Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is broadly defined as damage to the peripheral nervous system caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction .1 Chemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common consequence of cytotoxic chemotherapies and results in length - dependent sensory predominant impairments with symptoms of numbness, tingling, burning and pain in hands and feet. CIPN is consistently associated with lower self -reported physi cal function and quality of life and may contribute to increased cancer mortality as patients often do not complete their full course of chemotherapy due to dose reductions, modifications, or treatment discontinuation . Although the underlying mechanisms of CIPN are only partially understood ,2 CIPN is a small fiber neuropathy that results in reduced nerve fiber density in the skin and can lead to physiologic changes in nerve conduction and anatomic changes in peripheral nerve anatomy. CIPN is more prevalent and more severe in African American (A -A) compared to women of other races, but the reason for this is not understood.3,4 CIPN is a significant problem for cancer survivors. Prevalence rates of CIPN vary widely based on different patient populations, different grading systems and symptom assessmen ts, but have been found in up to 80% of patients receiving chemotherapy .5 In fact, CIPN i s the most common reason for dose reduction in breast cancer patients receiving taxane chemotherapy. One study found that 42% of early stage breast cancer survivors had CIPN two years after chemotherapy6 and another reported that 50% of women cancer survivors reported symptoms of CIPN six years after treatment.7 Similarly, platinum agents including cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin also commonly result in peripheral neurotoxicity. Transient neurotoxic effects are experienced by nearly all patients following oxaliplatin infusion with patients describing cold hypersensitivity within hours of infusion. Chronic peripheral neuropathy is estimated to occur in up to 70% of patients receiving oxaliplatin. Disruption of cal cium signaling leads to axonal hyperexcitability and peripheral nerve dysfunction leading to oxaliplatin -induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) .8,9 A recent NCI Symptom Management and Health -related Quality of Li fe Steering Committee symposium concluded that research was needed to understand the mechanisms of CIPN and to identify therapies to prevent or treat CIPN.10 This group expressed particular interest in non - drug interventions. The NCI considers the development of adjuncts for the prevention and relief of CIPN as essential for patient care.11 Acupuncture has been found to effectively treat other types of pain including chronic low -back pain, migraine and tension headaches, as well as chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting .12,13 Acupuncture is a safe, non -toxic treatment that unlike other pharmacologic agents that target mechanisms of CIPN does not interfer e with chemotherapeutic efficacy. A recent systematic review found that acupuncture showed benefit for neuropathy caused by diabetes, Bell’s palsy, and carpal tunnel syndrome, and probably for the treatment of HIV - related neuropathy ( which also causes a s evere sensory -predominant polyneuropathy) .12 The review further concluded that acupuncture appears to improve nerve conduction study parameters in both sensory and motor nerves. There were not enough randomized control trials [ RCTs ] for cancer -related neuropathy that met the inclusion criteria to review this condition .12 However, t wo small nonrandomized pilot studies suggest that ac upuncture may be"
9,page_9,"Acupuncture for Chemotherapy -Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Among Ca ncer Patients Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC ) CCCWFU # 97118 Page 3 of 55 effective for reducing CIPN .14,15 These pilot studies support further investigation into how acupuncture works and whether patient -reported symptom improvement is associated with underlying physiologic changes in the ner ve. There are strong mechanistic links between acupuncture and CIPN. The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is a critical site for peripheral nerve health and plays an important role in mediating the pathologic changes with CIPN and the action of acupuncture. In animal models and human studies, acupuncture has been shown to modulate dorsal horn and DRG neurotransmission including transmission of opioid, norepinephrine, serotonin, and glutamate signals.16 Cell bodies in the DRG lack a blood -nerve barrier and are thus subject to the toxic effects of most chemothera py. Taxane chemotherapies disrupt axonal transport from the DRG and perturb normal axonal flow resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and nerve swelling.17–20 For oxaliplatin, calcium dysregulation leads to a channelopathy in the terminal nerve branches disrupting axoplasmic flow and causing hyperexcitability wit hin the nerve and dorsal root. This results in impaired conduction along peripheral sensory nerves as assessed by nerve conduction studies (NCS), reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density detected by skin biopsy, and emerging evidence of nerve swel ling on neuromuscular ultrasound. These standard of care tests provide a window into pathologic changes of CIPN and the potential effect of acupuncture on peripheral neurotoxici ty. The results of this pilot study will be applicable to other causes of perip heral neuropathy as there is no compelling reason to believe that acupuncture’s mechanisms of action (if proven to be effective) for treating CIPN would be different for other etiologies of peripheral neuropathy. This pilot study seeks to obtain prelimin ary evidence for the evaluation of acupuncture in reducing the severity and/or progression of CIPN due to neurotoxic chemotherapy. We hypothesize that acupuncture can improve CIPN and prevent the escalation of CIPN as measured by patient –reported outcomes and the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE ) Neuropathy Sensory Subscale (https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_50 ). We also hypothesize that the reduction in CIPN will allow for patients to continue their course of chemotherapy. We will also investigate whether improving CIPN symptoms is associated with improved objective measures of nerve function, which will provide potential mechanisms for how acupuncture works in treating PN. We hypothesize that acupuncture’s effect on improving self-reported symptoms will be evidenced by improved objective nerve function as assessed by nerve conduction studies (NCS), intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density, and/or nerve swelling by ultrasound. Standard of Care, Objective Assessments of Nerve Function CIPN manifests via several different pathophys iological mechanisms that can be assessed by currently available standard of care methods including physical examination, nerve conduction studies (NCS), skin biopsy to evaluate intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENF), peripheral nerve ultrasound , and pa tient-reported outcome measures . Each of these studies are standard of care for the assessment of sensory -predominant neuropathies such as CIPN. Physical Examination : Physical exam with q uantitative sensory testing (QST) uses tuning forks or monofilaments to objectively measure the sensory threshold for proprioception . QST may be a useful addition to self -reported symptoms as it is n on-invasive, easily implemented, and well -"

Although promising, it has not been sho wn to provide early detection of subclinical taxane -induced C IPN.22,23 Patient -Reported Outcome Measures : the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ -CIPN20 Questionnaire is a 20 -item self -reported survey that is easy to administer and was validated across participants in four large cooperative group trials.24 The QLQ -CIPN20 sensory scale has been studied specifically with TIPN among breast ca ncer patients and was shown to be correlated with patient -reported symptoms from the Common Toxicity Criteria (0.79, p < 0.00001). Since taxanes and oxaliplatin are not associated with hearing loss, that corresponding item was exclu ded from analysis in tha t study.25,26 For normative comparison, non -cancer patients t end to have very low scores on the QLQ -CIPN20 with a sum score average of 3.6 (standard deviation 7.2) and subtotals of 3.2 (7.3) for sensory measures, 3.8 (9.2) for motor, and 4.4 (10.7) for autonomic. The vast majority of non -cancer patients (90.1%) had a sum score of 0 -10%; older age and self -reported comorbidities were associated with higher QLQ -CIPN20 scores. Based on the results from that study, age - matched normative data has been generated for the QLQ -CIPN20.27 PRO -CTCAE is an item library containing 124 items reflecting 78 symptomatic cancer treatmen t-related symptoms .28,29 Two PRO -CTCAE items address CIPN concerning the severity of the numbness and tingling and the degree that these sym ptoms have interfer ed with usual or daily act ivities . These ite ms have previously been shown to have good psychometric properties.30 The two PRO -CTCAE items have the potential of providing a feasible patient -reported measure in a clinic setting. Nerve Conduction S tudies (NCS) : NCS measure s impairment of electrical func tion in large peripheral nerves. NCS measure s amplitude and latency of neuronal signaling. Reduction in the conduction velocity within a peripheral nerve indicates damage to the myelin, while reduction in the amplitude indicates axonal damage. Typical NCS findings suggestive of TIPN include slowed conduction velocity at common sites of entrapme nt (such as the carpal tunnel) and an earlier reduction of sural sensory amplitude relative to the radial nerve .31 A prospective study of patients receiving paclitaxel and carboplatin found a reduction in sural nerve conduction from baseline in terms of the sensory action potential amplitude (14.5 +/ - 9.0 uV to 9.7 +/ - 7.1) and the sensory conduction velocity (54.6 +/ - 7.7 m/s to 46.3 +/ - 8.8).32 A series of patients who received paclitaxel and cisplatin had a reduction in the sural nerve amplitude of sensory action potential from average 13.7 uV (standard deviation 6.5) to 6.5 (standard deviation 4.1 ).33 NCS can be mildly painful for the patient; require s expertise and time to administer, and can only detect CIPN once it has progressed to the point that there is functiona l impairment of large peripheral nerves .34 Other functional assays besides NCS have been investigated. Sudomotor tes ting is a novel technique that uses the topical administration peripheral nerves. Although non -invasive, sudomotor testing tends to have wide variability which can make interpretation difficult and it has not yet been tested in chemotherapy -induced periphe ral neuropathy. A n erve excitability stud y is a novel non -invasive functional assay that detects the threshold of current that is needed to elicit an action potential . Similar to US, this experimental technique has been shown that it can detect oxaliplati n-induced peripheral neuropath.35 Skin Biopsy and Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber Density (IENF) : skin biopsies are able to detect CIPN wi th good diagnostic sensitivity that may be superior to NCS in chronic CIPN.36 Measurement of the IENF density is a standard clinical assessment used in the evaluation of"
11,page_11,"Acupuncture for Chemotherapy -Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Among Ca ncer Patients Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC ) CCCWFU # 97118 Page 5 of 55 sensory predominant peripheral neuropathies. Healthy control participants have an average IENF density of 21.1 (standard deviation 10.4) at the thigh and 13.8 (standard d eviation 6.7) in the distal leg.37,38 Typical IENF density findings in C IPN include reduced nerve fiber density that is typically more pronounced distally at the lower leg (mean 3.0, range 0.5 -6.3) as compared to the thigh (mean 5.5, range 0.7 -13.2) .39 As expecte d, the IENF density likely continues to decrease with continued exposure to chemotherapy and worsening neuropathy, as a small longitudinal study of patients receiving oxaliplatin found that the distal leg IENF density progressively decreased from baseline 15.39 (6.75) to 12.89 (4.73) at 6 months to 9.45 (3.92) at 12 months .40 However, IENF density has not been shown to be predictive of chemotherap y-induced peripheral neuropathy . Peripheral Nerve Ultrasound (US): US is a non -invasive, non -irradiating , emerging imaging modality which can be used to assess peripheral nerves. Nerve fiber cross -sectional area (CSA), echogenicity, and vascularity are assessed and provide an indication of nerve health and potential pathology. The majority of US data have been publish ed on detection of entrapment syndromes such as carpal tunnel syndrome. In these cases the most common US findings include nerve enlargement, decreased echogenicity proximal to the entrapment, and an increase in nerve vascularity .41 Other studies have found that US can detect other peripheral nerve lesions or neuropathies, with the most reliable fin ding a change in nerve CSA. Ultrasound measurements of the sensory sural nerve at the distal calf in healthy participants without neuropathy had an average CSA of 5.3 mm2 with standard deviation 1.8 mm2 for a normal reference range of 1.7 -8.9 mm2.42 Another ultrasound study assessed the sural nerve more distally at the ankle and found a smaller CSA which was significantly enlarged (p <0.001) in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy as compared to healthy controls (mean/standard deviation 2.59 / 0.96 mm2 as compared to 1.40 / 0.59 mm2).43 Each of these assessments including patient -reported outcomes, physical examination, NCS, skin biopsy for IENF, and peripheral nerve ultrasound are standard of care for patients with sensory -predominant neuropathies such as CIPN and will be included in this trial to provide an objective assessment of peripheral nerve function. As standard of care tests, the risks of these studies are not different than those that would be encountered in routine clinical care for a patient undergoing comprehensive eletrophysiological evaluation of peripheral nerve pathology. Since the skin biopsy is an exploratory aim, patients will be allowed to participate in the study even if they are unwilling to have this measure. 2.0 Objectives The goal of this study is to obtain pre liminary evidence of the effect of 8 a cupuncture treatments over 10 weeks in breast and GI cancer patients who are currently receiving or recently completed active neurotoxic chemotherapy and have clinically documented grade 1 or 2 neuropathy .

Clinical assessment will take place in the CCC outpatient clinic and wi ll include a focused history by one of the study investigators or research employees. The medical record will also be reviewed to confirm details of the medical history. The focused history will assess age, body -mass index (BMI), cancer staging, types and dosages of chemotherapy received, corticosteroid and analgesic use, and presence of comorbidities (diabetes, B12 deficiency, thyroid disorders, alcoholism, depression, carpal tunnel syndrome, sciatica). A physical examination will occur and will also assess peripheral pulses and peripheral sensation. Clinical symptoms of peripheral neuropathy of grade 1 or grade 2 as measured by the NCI -CTCAE will be verified. The QLQ -CIPN20 questionnaire and Pro -CTCAE will also be administered at this encounter. Participants will be scheduled for the NCS, ultrasound, and skin biopsy (approximately 2-2.5 hours) . Patients will receive a $ 25.00 gift card upon completion of the baseline peripheral nerve assessment and a $75 gift card upon completi on of the follow -up assessment . Patients that live 60 miles or more from WFBMC wi ll receive an additional"
17,page_17,"Acupuncture for Chemotherapy -Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Among Ca ncer Patients Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC ) CCCWFU # 97118 Page 11 of 55 $50 gift card upon completion of the baseline peripheral nerve assessment and an additional $50 gift card upon completion of the follow -up assessment. 4.5 Peripheral Nerve Assessment Peripheral nerve evaluation will be performed in the Diagnostic Neurology clinic at the WFBMC. Patients will undergo abbreviate d neurological exam to assess strength of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius and deep tendon re flex exam of the Achilles tendon . Nerve conduction studies, nerve ultrasound and skin biopsies will be performed per standard of care on the affected lower limb and completed at a single visit . As standard of care tests, these tests results will be reporte d in the medical record for review by the patient’s treating oncologist. Skin biopsy tissue that remains after clinical assessment of IENF will be sent to Dr. Shiozawa’s lab for storage and exploratory assessment (see Section 4.5.4). 4.5.1 Nerve Conduction Study CS technique and reference values for the sural and tibial nerves among healthy adults are based on data from Chen et al .44 and standard institutional practice .44 NCS assessment of the sural sensory nerve involves electrode placement at the ankle (posteroinferior to the lateral malleolus) and more distally with a 3cm bar for a distance of approximately 14cm; the nerve is stimulated at the calf midline with a display sensitivity 2 -5 uV/div and sweep of 1 ms/ div. The sural sensory nerve reference values for amplitude is a lower limit (3rd percentile) of 4 uV (onset -to-peak) and 4 uV (peak -to- peak); and for latency is an upper limit (97th percentile) of 3.6 ms (onset) and 4.5 ms (peak). NCS assessment of the ti bial motor nerve involves electrode placement at the medial foot (slightly anterior/inferior to the navicular tubercle) and more distally at the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint for a distance of approximately 8cm; the nerve is stimulated at the ankle (posterior to the medial malleolus) and knee (at the midpopliteal fossa) with a display sensitivity 5 mV/div and sweep of 5 ms/div. The tibial motor nerve reference values for distal amplitude is a lower limit (3rd percentile) of 4.4 mV across all ages; a nd for distal latency is an upper limit (97th percentile) of 6.1 ms. 4.5.2 Skin Biopsy One skin biops y will be obtained as 4 -5mm punch biopsy at distal end of leg in sural nerve territory (10cm above lateral malleolus). As described in a review by Lauria and Devigili45, biopsied tissue will be cut into 50 uM sections which will be hematoxylin and eosin stained and also immunostained with an antibody to PGP (protein gene product) 9.5, a neuron - and neuroendocrine cell -specific ubiquitin ca rboxy -termi Form O nal hydrolase expressed throughout the peripheral nervous system. Slides will be reviewed by Dermatopathology ( Dr. Sangueza ) in order to count PGP9.5 -positive fibers as they cross the de rmal-epidermal junction to calculate linear density of IENF (IENF/mm). Additional staining will be done as indicated. Routine processing of specimens and comparison to standardized values (similar to those described by McArthur et al .37 will be done by Dermat opathology as per their institutional guidelines. These methods are standard clinical procedures for the routine assessment of IENF density. Dermatopathology will also obtain descriptive measures of morphologic changes that will be analyzed as an explorato ry outcome. Additional unstained slides or blocks will be"
18,page_18,"Acupuncture for Chemotherapy -Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Among Ca ncer Patients Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC ) CCCWFU # 97118 Page 12 of 55 stored . Patients who are eligible to participate in the study, but unwilling to have a skin biopsy will be allowed to participate. 4.5.3 Nerve Ultrasound Peripheral nerve US technique and reference values for the sural sensory (measured at the ankle) and tibial motor nerves are based on institutional data and standard institutional practice. These reference values were de -identified historical data which have also been published by Cartwright et al.42 as noted in the Introduction and Background section. Peripheral nerves will be assessed at non -compressive sites with a routine 15Hz linear probe. If available, a higher resolution 70Hz linear probe may be used – this would allow for descriptive characterization of nerve changes and would not be anticipated to cause variability in terms of CSA measurement as compared to the standard 15Hz US. 4.5.4 Storage of Serum and Skin Biopsy Material Venous blood will be sampled at the time of peripheral nerve assessment (e.g. pre - treatment and end -of-treatment) to explore potential circulating markers of peripheral nerve health. If the patient will undergo regularly scheduled phlebotomy on the day of peripheral nerve assessment, this blood draw will be preferentially added to the routinely collected specimens. Some participants may require an additional blood draw if insufficient blood samples were collected or regularly scheduled blood draw is not planned on the date of peripheral nerve assessment . For the purposes of this study, 16 mL of venous blood (8mL at each of two draws) will be collected in (2) 4m L (green -top) collection tube s and then transferred directly to Dr. Shiozawa’s lab for processing. Serum will be stored in Dr. Shiozawa’s lab . Blood Sample Preparation 1. Email notification will be sent to Matt Eber ( meber@wakehealth.edu) , Sun Park (shpark @wakehealth.edu ) and Yusuke Shiozawa (yshiozaw@wakehealth.edu) the d ay before the blood collection. 2. Blood will be collected in a green -top vacutainer tube containing heparin (60 USP Units of Lithium Heparin/ 4 mL tube), and immediately inverted 8 -10 times to prevent coagulation. Attention: Protocol #: CCCWFU # (97118 ) and the OnCore PID in addition to the other standard information should be on the tube . 3. Samples will then be transported from the Cancer Center to the Shiozawa lab (Lab: 3 -6624, 3-5119, Office: 6 -8743). 4.6 Randomization Following completion of the baseline visit, participants will be randomized to receive acupuncture immediately (acupuncture group) or to a usual care control group using a"
19,page_19,"Acupuncture for Chemotherapy -Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Among Ca ncer Patients Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC ) CCCWFU # 97118 Page 13 of 55 randomized block design developed by Dr. Tooze . The randomization will be stratified by cancer type and race (AA, non -AA) to ensure balance within each race strata. Block sizes will be chosen randomly to ensure that future assignments cannot be inferred from previous ones. 4.7 Intervention: Acupuncture Treatments Participants randomized to the acupuncture group will be scheduled to receive 8 acupuncture treatments over a 10 -week period. All treatments will be conducted by a licensed acupuncturist at the Wake Forest Baptist Health Integrative Medicine Clinic Center . The first a cupuncture treatment will be scheduled by the Stu dy Coordinator. Future appointments will be scheduled by the participant and the Center. Up to 20 acupuncture points (bodily locations where acupuncture needles are inserted) will be selected for needling. We will use a standardized treatment plan rather than a personalized treatment plan given that the etiolo gy of the symptoms is presumably the chemotherapy and that a procedure -based approach is more appropriate for CIPN than a diagnostic appr oach. In the case that a patient has a comorbidity effecting a specific area of the body, study investigators may allow for a deviation to the standardized acupuncture treatment plan as appropriate. Week 12 End of Treatment Assessment All patients will be sc heduled for a follow -up assessment to occur 10 (+2) weeks after baseline (referred to as Week 12 assessment) , regardless of whether they have completed all acupuncture treatments . The same protocol will be performed as described in Section 4.5 with ad dition of the QLQ -CIPN20 and PRO -CTCAE as described in Section 4.4 . Peripheral neuropathy grade, as measured by the NCI - CTCAE, will be assessed at this time by a clinician who is blinded as to the patient’s group (acupuncture vs. usual care ) assignment. Participants who complete this assessment will receive a $ 75 gift card. If the patient lives 60 miles or more from WFBMC will receive an additional $50 gift card upon completion of the follow -up assessment. 4.8 Acupuncture for Usual Care Control Group Following completion of all me asures, patients in the usual care group will be scheduled for their acupuncture visits. They will be instructed to contact the Wake Forest Baptist Health Integrative Medicine Clinic Center and provided up to 4 acupuncture treatments. These treatments are b eing provided as an incentive for patients to remain in the study to receive the end of treatment assessment. 5.0 Adverse Events List and Reporting Requirements 5.1 Adverse Event List for Acupuncture 5.1.1 Acupuncture may sometimes cause temp orary discomfort or pain, bleeding, bruising, or soreness."
20,page_20,"Acupuncture for Chemotherapy -Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Among Ca ncer Patients Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC ) CCCWFU # 97118 Page 14 of 55 5.1.2 There have been very rare reports of acupuncture causing minor nerve damage, hematomas (bleeding under the skin or inside your body), infections, or pneumothorax (puncture of a lung). 5.2 Adverse Ev ent List for Nerve Conduction Studies 5.2.1 Standard risks include discomfort or pain from the procedure. 5.3 Adverse Event List for Biopsies 5.3.1 Risks associated with skin biopsies may include brief pain (common), bleeding or bruising (uncommon), or in rare instances , infection (rare). Standard precautions will be used for these tests. The risks are not expected to be different from routine clinical procedures. We do not expect any long -term, or life -threatening risks. 5.4 Adverse Event List for Ultrasound 5.4.1 Ultrasound is a safe procedure. Patients may experienc e a slight warming and coldness from the gel. 5.5 Adverse Event Characteristics  CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ (see Section 7.1 above) for expedited reporting purposes only.  Attribution of the AE: Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment. Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment. Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment. Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment. 5.6 STRC SAE Reporting Requirements The Safety and Toxicity Reporting Committee (STRC) is responsible for reviewing SAEs for WFBCCC Institutional studies as outlined in. The Safety and Toxicity Reporting Committee (STRC) is responsible for reviewing SAEs for WFBCCC Institutional studies as outlined in Appendix K. All Adverse Events that occur during proto col intervention and are coded as either 1) unexpected grade 4, 2) unplanned inpatient hospitalization > 24 hours (regardl ess of grade), or grade 5 (death)"
21,page_21,"Acupuncture for Chemotherapy -Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Among Ca ncer Patients Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC ) CCCWFU # 97118 Page 15 of 55 must be reported to the STRC using the using the SAE console in WISER. All WFBCCC Clinical Protocol and Data Management ( CPDM ) staff members assisting a Principal Investigator in investigating, documenting and reporting an SAE qualifying for STRC reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC as well as the entire committee via the email notification proce dure of the occurrence of an SAE. 5.7 WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adverse events shall be promptly reported to the IRB, according to institutional policy. Reporting to the IRB is r equired regardless of the funding source, study sponsor, or whether the event involves an investigational or marketed drug, biologic or device. Reportable events are not limited to physical injury, but include psychological, economic and social harm. Repor table events may arise as a result of drugs, biological agents, devices, procedures or other interventions, or as a result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or other interactions with research subjects. All members of the research team are responsi ble for the appropriate reporting to the IRB and other applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others. The Principal Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible for ensuring the prompt reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others to the IRB. The Principal Investigator is also responsible for ensuring that all reported unanticipated risks to subjects and others which they receive are reviewed to determine whether the report represents a chan ge in the risks and/or benefits to study participants, and whether any changes in the informed consent, protocol or other study -related documents are required. Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at a site where the study has been approved by the WFUHS IRB (internal events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of the event. Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at another site conducting the same study that has been approved by the WFUHS IRB (external events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of the ev ent. Any event, incident, experience, or outcome that alters the risk versus potential benefit of the research and as a result warrants a substantive change in the research protocol or informed consent process/document in order to insure the safety, right s or welfare of research subjects. 6.0 Duration of Follow -up Following recruitment, patients will be s cheduled for neurodiagnostic assessments with 2 weeks. Acupuncture treatments will occur over 10 weeks, after which, patients will return to neurology f or follow -up assessment within 2 weeks. Patients randomized to usual care will have the oppo rtunity to receive four acupuncture treatments . All patient will receive a telephone foll - up call 30 days (+ or – 5 days) after their follow -up neurodiagnositc assess ments to identify whether any adverse events have occurred."

There is an asymptote for the gain in the precision to estimate the variance with 20 degrees of freedom. With a sample size of 22, the probability is 0.80 (80% confidence) that the estimate of the SD will be no more than 14% of the true population SD below the true population SD. 8.2 Analysis of Primary Objective Because this is a pilot study, analyses will be primarily descriptive to estimate variances and effect sizes for future work. Therefore, we will estimate means and standard deviations by group for the EORTC QLQ -CIPN20 sensory subscale at baseline and week 12, the correlation between the two measures , and the within -person change from baseline to week 12 . To estimate effect size, we will use an ANCOVA model at week 12, which will include the group and the baseline value. The estimated difference between the groups and the variance will inform sample size calculations for fu ture studies. The ANCOVA approach is the most efficient method comparing change of an outcome between two groups. We will estimate means by cancer type, treatment received, gender, and overall. 8.3 Analysis of Secondary Objectives Because the primary goals of the secondary objectives are to provide preliminary data on the effect of the intervention on the secondary outcomes of interest, we will use the same general approach as outlined above for the continuous variables (Objective 2.2.1, EORTC QLQ -CIPN20 mo tor and autonomic neuropathic pain subscale; Objective 2.2.2, PRO -CTCAE Numbness and Tingling; Objective 2.2.4, Dose and number of cycles of chemotherapy; Objectives 2.2.4, 2.2.5, and 2.2.6, Peripheral Nerve Assessments) , i.e., means and standard deviation s will be computed at baseline and week 12 by group, and for the change in the measures, and we will also estimate the correlation between the measures at the two time points, and fit ANCOVA models for each outcome of interest . Because the primary interes t in the measure of the CTCAE measure of CIPN is in the time to change of this categorical outcome, it will be assessed using frequencies of grade by time point (baseline, week 12) , as well as whether the grade of CIPN increased, decreased or remained stab le from baseline to week 12. A Fisher’s Exact test will be used to compare the groups at each time point and for the change"
24,page_24,"Acupuncture for Chemotherapy -Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Among Ca ncer Patients Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC ) CCCWFU # 97118 Page 18 of 55 during the study period. We will estimate means by cancer type, treatment received, gender, and overall. 8.4 Analyses of Exploratory O utcome To meet objective 2.3.1, all of the descriptive statistics for the primary and secondary objectives will be computed by race subgroup (A -A, non -A-A), and ANCOVA models will be run including baseline value, group, race, and the interaction with race. To meet o bjective 2.3.2 (to obtain preliminary evidence of the effect of acupuncture on intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENF) via skin biopsy , means and standard deviations will be computed at baseline and week 12 by group and for the change in measu res. We will estimate the correlation between the measures at the two time points . Objective 2.3. 3 will be analyzed through calculating Pearson correlations of the association of the peripheral nerve assessments with each other and with the patient repor ted outcomes at each visit; change in the measures over the study will also be correlated. Objective 2.3. 4. will be analyzed by correlating the expectancy rating scale score with baseline, 12 week, and changes in the EORTC QLQ -CIPN20 and PRO -CTCAE overall and by arm. We will also classify participants into expectancy categories, and compare baseline, 12 week, and changes in EORTC QLQ -CIPN20 and PRO -CTCAE overall and by arm using an ANOVA. If expectancy is related to baseline scores, we may use a mixed ef fects model to examine the trajectory of change related to expectancy, including arm in the model. 8.5 Accrual Rate 4 participants per month . 8.6 Length of Study 12 months 9.0 Data Management Informed consent document EPIC Protocol Registration Form (Appendix B ) EPIC Clinical Evaluation from History/Exam ( Appendix D) WISER/OnCore EORTC QLQ -CIPN20 (neuropathy scale) ( Appendix E) REDCap PRO -CTCAE Numbness and Tingling (Appendix E ) REDCap Nerve Conduction Study Data Collection Form ( Appendix F ) WISER/OnCore Ultrasound Nerve Diameter Data Form ( Appendix G ) WISER/OnCore Nerve Fiber Density Data Collection Form ( Appendix H ) WISER/OnCore Adverse Events Log ( Appendix I) WISER/OnCor e"

A trial is considered a WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trial if the following criteria are met: 1. The Principal Investigator (PI) of the trial is a member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. 2. WFBCCC is considered as the primary contributor to the design, implementation and/or monitoring of the trial. 3. The trial is designated as “Interventional” using the Clinical Research Categor ies definitions provided by the NCI in the Data Table 4 documentation. (https://cancercenters.cancer.gov/GrantsFunding/DataGuide#dt4 ) There are two distinct types of WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials based on where patient enrollment occurs. These include: 1. Local WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials defined as trials where all patients are enrolled from one of the WFBCCC sites. These include the main outpatient Cancer Center clinics (located in Winston -Salem) as well as WFBCCC affiliate sites located in Bermuda Run (Davie Medical Center), Clemmons, Lexington, High Point, or Wilkesboro. 2. Multi -Center WFBCCC Investigator Initiated i nterventional trials defined as trials where patients are enrolled from other sites in addition to WFBCCC sites. There are three types of trials that are included in this category: a. Trials sponsored by the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) that are conducted at multiple sites where the PI is a member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. b. Trials sponsored by Industry that are conducted at multiple sites and the PI is a member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. c. Trials sponsored by WFBCCC that are conducted at multiple sites and the PI is a member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. All Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur on any patients enrolled on WFBCCC Investigator Initiated Interventional trials must be entered"
48,page_48,"Acupuncture for Chemotherapy -Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Among Ca ncer Patients Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC ) CCCWFU # 97118 Page 42 of 55 into the WISER system. The only exception to this requirement is for patients enrolled on NCORP trials at non- WFBCCC sites. AEs and SAEs for NCORP patients enrolled at WFBCCC sites must be entered into the WISER system. Once these AEs and SAEs are entered in WISER, certain actions must be taken regarding the reporting of specific Adverse Event s to the STRC. All Adverse Events that occur during protocol intervention (defined below) and are coded as either 1) unexpected grade 4, 2) unplanned inpatient hospitalization > 24 hours (regardless of grade) , or grade 5 (death) must be reported to the ST RC using the using the SAE console in WISER. A research nurse or clinical research coordinator when made aware that an adverse event meets one of the above criteria has occurred on a WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trial, is responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC by phone (or in -person) about the adverse event. The nurse/coordinator should contact the treating physician prior to calling the STRC clinical member to obtain all details of the SAE, as well as all associated toxi cities to be recorded along with the SAE. In addition, this nurse or coordinator is responsible for entering the adverse event information into the SAE console in WISER. Once the adverse event has been entered into the SAE console an email informing the e ntire STRC committee will be generated. THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any staff member on the study team for a WFBCCC Institutional Interventional trial. Ultimately, the protocol PI has the primary responsibility for AE identification, documenta tion, grading and assignment of att ribution to the investigational agent/intervention. However, when an AE event as described above is observed, it is the responsibility of the person who observed the event to be sure that it is reported to the STRC. What is considered during protocol intervention ? During protocol intervention is considered to be the time period while a patient is on study treatment or during the time period within 30 days of last study treatment (even if patient begins a new (non -study ) treatment during the 30 days). This window of 30 days should be the standard window to be used in all protocols unless a specific scientific rationale is presented to suggest that a shorter window can be used to identify events. If it is a trial sponsore d by Industry and the sponsor requires a longer window for monitoring of SAEs, then the longer window of time specified by the sponsor should be followed. What is considered as an Unexpected Grade 4 event? Any grade 4 event that was not specifically li sted as an expected adverse event in the protocol should be considered as unexpected. A grade 4 adverse event can be considered to be unexpected if it is an event that would not be expected based on the treatment being received or if it is unexpected based on the health of the patient. In either case, if there is any uncertainty about whether a grade 4 adverse event is expected or unexpected it should be reported to STRC."

Make a phone call (or speak in person) to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as listed below (page if necessary) 2. Enter a new SAE into the SAE module that is located in the Subject>> CRA Console in WISER WITHIN 24 HOURS of first knowledge of the event. Information can be entered and saved, but the STRC members will not be notified until a date is entered into the STRC Notification Date Field. This will ensure that all persons that need to be made aware of the ev ent (i.e., study team members and STRC members) will be notified; remember to file a copy of the confirmation. 3. Document that the appropriate person(s) on the STRC has been contacted. Indicate the name of the STRC clinician that was contacted in the Event Narrative field in the SAE console of the particular subject. 4. Document whether or not the protocol should be suspended based on the discussion with the STRC clinician. This is the major function of the email notification. Enter whether the protocol should be suspended in the Event Narrative Field. 5. Follow up/update the clinical member(s) of STRC regarding any new developments or information obtained during the course of the SAE investigation and reporting process. Elements needed to complete the SAE form in the Subject Console in WISER (see Screen Shot 3): 1. Event Date 2. Reported Date 3. Reported by 4. If Grade 5, enter Death Date 5.

The Clinical Members of STRC to Notify by Phone or Page: Bayard Powell, MD – Glenn Lesser, MD –Stefan Grant, MD, JD Jimmy Ruiz, MD - Mercedes Porosnicu, MD - Michael Farris, MD – Definition of Unavailabl e: As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contacted does not respond to the phone call or page within 30 minutes, then initiate contact with a different STRC clinician. Allow up to 30 minutes for the new STRC clinician to respond to a phone call or page before contacting another member. These times (30 minutes) are a general guideline. Best judgment as a clinical research professional should be used giving considerations of the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is appropriate to contact backup clinicians. If the event occurs near the end of day, then leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting the STRC notification form. It is important"
51,page_51,"Acupuncture for Chemotherapy -Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Among Ca ncer Patients Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC ) CCCWFU # 97118 Page 45 of 55 to take reasonable steps and to docume nt that some type of contact has been initiated to one or more of the clinical members of STRC. STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY: It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events as they are reported; and co mmunicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and the members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to the information reported; there may be times when additional information is needed in order for an assessment to be made and fur ther communication directly with the investigator may be warranted. STRC reserves the right to disagree with the Investigator's assessment. If STRC does not agree with the Investigator, STRC reserves the right to suspend the trial pending further investiga tion. If ther e is any immediate danger or harm that could be present for a future patient based on the information provided in the STRC report then an immediate suspension of enrollment should be considered. AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS REPORTS If all pertin ent information is unavailable with the initial submission, once the additional information is available do not submit a new report . Rather, go to the original email that was sent to the STRC and using that email “reply to all”. Entitle this new email “Ame ndment for (list date of event and patient ID)” this will avoid duplications of the same event. List the additional information being reported. This information needs to be entered into WISER as well. To do this, go to the Subject console and click SAEs on the left column. Click on the appropriate SAE number that needs updating.

If you are eligible, you will be asked to come into the clinic for an initial visit where you will receive a physical exam of your nerve sensations and your medical history will be reviewed . If you are still eligible for our study, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your neuropathy pain. You will also be scheduled for your next study visit that will take place in approximately 1 -2 weeks. At your second study visit, you will re ceive a standard evaluation of your neuropathy. This will take place at the Wake Forest Baptist Health Neurology Clinic. This will involve a nerve conduction test, ultrasound imaging, skin biopsy, and blood draw. This will last approximately 1.5 hours. After your second visit, you will be randomized into one of two study groups. You will have an equal chance of being placed in either group. The two study groups include an acupuncture group and a waitlist group. If you are randomized to the acupuncture group, your first acupuncture visit will be scheduled by the Study Coordinator to take place within 2 weeks. Acupuncture treatments will take place at the Wake Forest Baptist Health Integrative Medicine Clinic Center at 755 Highland Oaks Drive in Winston - Salem , NC. You will then receive 8 acupuncture treatments (approximately 1x/week) over a period of 10 weeks. These can be scheduled at your convenience. If you are randomized to the waitlist group, you will continue to receive your usual medical care and trea tments with your clinical providers, but you will not receive any acupuncture treatments. After your third study visit, which will be 10 -12 weeks from the second study visit, you will be offered up to 4 acupuncture treatments at the Wake Forest Baptist Hea lth Integrative Medicine Clinic. You will be provided with parking passes for all study visits. You will also receive a $25 gift card at study visit 2 and a $75 gift card at study visit 3. These are the two visits that involve clinical measures. If you live 60 miles or more from WFBMC, you will receive an additional $50 gift card upon completion of the baseline peripheral nerve assessment and an additional $50 gift card upon completion of the follow -up assessment.
