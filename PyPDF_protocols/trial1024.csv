In 2019, an international, H2020 funded randomized controlled trial (FURTHER) wil l be started comparing MR -HIFU with the current standard o f care, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) , and the combination of both modalities in terms of rapid and long lasting pain relief. For this purpose, feasibility and optimal logistics of the combined treatment need to be evaluated. Objective The PRE -FURTHE R project aims to evaluate the feasibility of the combined EBRT and MR -HIFU treatment for relief of metastatic bone pain, and to optimize the combined treatment logistics. Study design: Prospective case series ( n = 6 - 10), stage I and IIA study accordi ng to the Innovation, Development, Evaluation, Assessment and Long term evaluation (IDEAL ) recommendations. Study population: The study will be performed in male and female adult ( ≥ 18 years) cancer patients capable of giving informed consent and referred for EBRT of painful bone metastases (Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ≥ 4). Intervention : Following standard EBRT (single or multiple fraction), patients will receive one MR-HIFU treatment with the Profound Sonalleve MR -HIFU device on the most painful of their bone metastases. Patients will be followed up until 4 weeks after treatment. During follow -up they will be phoned around day 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 to retrieve pain scores, pain medication and (serious) a dverse events. At day 3 the patient’s experience with the combined treatment will also be inquired. Main study parameters /endpoints : The main outcome of this study is feasibility of the procedure, in terms of plannability as well as patient -tolerability of the combined treatme nt within a short time frame (3 hours - 4 days interval ). In addition, pain relief and safety of the combined procedure will be monitored . Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: In terms of benefits, patients participating in this study may experience a more rapid and longer lasting pain relief as a result of the MR -HIFU intervention. In terms of burden, patients in most cases will need to pay an extra visit to the ho spital, undergo a rather lengthy additional inter vention (MR -HIFU treatment), under conscious sedation. In addition, they are contacted regularly by phone. Serious adverse events due to the combined treatment are not to be expected."

Due to rising canc er incidence rates and improved survival, the number of cancer patients living long enough to develop bone metastases is increasing rapidly. Dependi ng on the location of the primary tumour approximately 30 -80% of patients with advanced cancer develop bone metastases, with pain as a common and devastating consequence (Ripamonti , 2000, 2001 ; Portenoy, 2011; Lipton, 2010 ; Coleman 2006; Suva 2011 ). Metastatic bone pain strongly interferes with quality of life and daily functioning of patients and their families (Mantyh, 2014, Paice and Ferrell, 2011). Intermittent episodes of extreme pain, either occurring spontaneously or by movement of the affected limb, are often referred to as “breakthrough” pain, as it breaks through the opiate pain palliation regime, and is refractory to pharmacologic pain treatment . Metastatic bone pain affects mobility, productivity and independence, placing an increasing burden on heal th-care and social care systems . 1.2. Current standard of care : external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) The current standard of care for patients with uncomplicated painful bone metastase s includes palliative locoregional treatment using external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (Ripamont i, 2010; Chow, 2014 ; Huisman, 2015), often in combination with systemic therapy and analgesics. EBRT alleviates pain through induction of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage, leading to tumour shrinkage, and through inhibit ion of the release of chemical pain mediators. Multiple randomized controlled trials and several systematic reviews over the past 30 years have demonstrated the efficacy of radiotherapy in palliating pain from uncomp licated bone metastases (Jones, 2014). O verall, approximately 25% of patients can expect to have complete pain relief whereas a total of 60 -70% of patients can expect some response to radiotherapy. However, time to optimal symptom control, even after short courses of radiotherapy, is usually mea sured in weeks to months after radiation treatments are delivered, as clearly demonstrated in the case of pain relief from bone metastases. On average, it takes four weeks for EBRT to induce adequate pain relief. In the Dutch Bone Trial, including 1100 pat ients, only 71% of patients reported adequate pain response (van der Linden, 2004 ; Westhoff, 2015). In the large hospital based PRESENT (prospective evaluation of interventional studies on bone metastases; METC 13 -261) cohort of unselected patients with bo ne metastases, 64% of patients experienced pain response following EBRT (van der Velden , 2018). Moreover , approximately 50% of responders experience recurrent pain. Radiotherapy retreatment of non -responders or those with recurrent bone pain is limited by cumulative doses of radiation delivered to sensitive structures surrounding the"
10,page_10,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 11 of 50 bone metastases. In addition, re -irradiation is only effective in a small majority (5 8%) of patients (Huisman, 2012). In summary, there is a clear clinical need for a treatment that provides rapid pain relief with a lasting effect, at least to bridge the time it takes for EBRT to take effect. In addition, since 30 - 40% percent of patients do not respond to EBRT, alternative treatment strategies could be of added value for the lar ge group of patients that we are currently unable to treat effectively. 1.3. MR-HIFU treatment Pain palliation may be substantially improved by including magnetic resonance image guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU ) as alternative or in addition to EBRT. MR HIFU is a non -invasive outpatient treatment modality that delivers acoustic energy to heat lesions to ablative temperatures of more than 60°C. The combination of focused ultrasound with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables physicians to perform localized tumor tissue ablation, with real -time temperature monitoring usin g magnetic resonance ( MR) thermometry (Jolesz, 2008). The biological mechanism of pain relief induced by MR-HIFU treatment has not been completely elucidated, although it is generally assumed that periosteal denervation induced by cortical heating plays a major role . The importance of this therapy is that it offers a low-risk, non-invasive, focal therapy, avoiding side -effects to surroundi ng normal tissue that occur with radiation therapy . In contrast to EBRT, i t does not require computed tomography (CT) for treatment planning or therapy . Preliminary clinical studies on the use of MR -HIFU for palliation of painful bone metastases demonstra ted excellent response rates and safety (Catane, 2007; Gianf elice, 2008; Napoli, 2013; Huisman, 2014). Hurwitz et al (2014) reported results of a multicenter randomized placebo -controlled trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of MR -HIFU for treating bone metastases in patients with persistent or recurrent pain. This study demonstrated that MR - HIFU is a safe and effective, non -invasive treatment for alleviating pain caused by bone metastases. Response to MR -HIFU was typically rapid, with about two -thirds of responses seen within days after treatment (Hurwitz, 2014). A recent single -centre matched -pair study showed that MR -HIFU provides a similar overall treatment response rate but faster pain relief compared with EBRT and thus has the potential to serve as th e first -line treatment for painful bone metastasis i n selected patients (Lee, 2017). University Medical Center Utrecht participated in a multicenter pilot study (METC 12 -035) in which an early improvement in pain and quality of life in patients with painful bone lesions treat ed with MR -HIFU was shown (Harding, 2018). These studies were , however , performed i n patients who were ineligible, or who failed or declined radiation. As such, there is a lack of evidence that supports the uptake of MR -HIFU as a standard (first -line) treatment option and alternative to"
11,page_11,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 12 of 50 EBRT, even though these results show that MR -HIFU has the potential to provide added value in standard care. 1.4 The FURTHER study Hitherto, no Phase III clinical trial has been conducted in which EBRT and MR -HIFU have been compared as a first -line treatment. Thus , strong evidence and context is lacking for wide-spread implementation of MR -HIFU into routine care. A consortium of partners from 5 European countries and the Focused Ultrasound Foundatio n recently joined forces to provide the evidence base to stimulate the uptake of MR -HIFU as a first line treatment option in clinical guidelines for the treatment of cancer induced bone pain. Reaching this ambitious goal will require a demonstration of the added value of MR-HIFU in standard care with comprehensive outcome testing that will convince a wide variety of stakeholders of the added value of including and reimbursing MR -HIFU as part of standard care and a feasible alternative for the golden standar d EBRT treatment . The FURTHER consortium will undertake a three armed phase III multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a pain management pathway pilot. The multicenter RCT is designed to compare outcomes of EBRT, MR -HIFU alone and EBRT in combination with MR-HIFU , for palliation in patients that present with painful bone metastases. By combining the two modalities in one RCT arm the hypothesis can be tested whether the combined treatment has superiority over either modality alone with r egard to overall pain response. 1.5 Combining EBRT and MR -HIFU : the PRE -FURTHER study There are several hypotheses about the possible synergistic effect of EBRT and MR - HIFU . By combining both modalities, a substantial proportion of patients with painful bone metastases are expected to experience early pain relief and improved response durability, while all of the tumour tissue receives radiation. Additionally, it is recognised that radiation and heat both induce tumour -specific immune responses (Wattenber g 2014; Udono 1993; Milani 2002; Hurwitz 2010). The putative main mechanism of pain relief by EBRT involves the inactivation of osteoclasts to change the microenvironment of bone resorption followed by sterilization of cancer cells to reduce tumor -induced compression (Hartsell, 2007). The direct mechanism of action of EBRT is damage to DNA of tissues, including both single strand and double strand DNA breaks, originating mostly from different oxygen radicals. The mechanism of action of MR -HIFU is coagulati ve necrosis and apoptosis of tissue due to heat leading to rapid and durable pain relief from immediate periosteal nerve ablation"
12,page_12,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 13 of 50 and thermal necrosis of the targeted bone tumor followed by remineralization of the trabecular bone and bone healing a few mon ths later. Since the mechanism of action of EBRT and MR -HIFU differ, MR -HIFU provides an alternative means to overcome radioresistance and is recommended for patients with bone metastasis for whom radiotherapy ( RT) is considered to have failed (Hurwitz , 2014). Since the mechanism of action of EBRT and MR -HIFU differ, the two methods may be synergistic in first -line, or when applied nearly simultaneously . Heat -induced coagulative ablation is the main action of MR -HIFU, hence its pain palliation effect is ex pected to be rapid. However, heat distribution is often spatially heterogeneous in bone metastases because of the fact that absorption of ultrasound energy depends on many factors including the degree of bone lysis or formation, and incident ultrasound ang le. Therefore, it might be that the, more long -term, systemic responses of EBRT of the tumor and its microenvironment, reduction of tumor -induced compression and inactivation of osteoclasts, can be augmented by local ablation of periosteal nerve ablation b y MR - HIFU. Some ot her effects should be mentioned: - Hyperthermia (temperatures 42 -45°C) beyond the ablated area results in complementary radiosensitization (reduction of hypoxia; inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms) (van der Zee, 2000 ; Dababou , 2018) thereby increasing the risk of damage to surrounding tissue. - Coagulative ablation by MR-HIFU (temperatures around 60° C) also may lead to reduction/elimination of local perfusion leading to hypoxia of the treated area. This may render subsequent EBR T less efficient (less production of oxygen radicals) . Because of the above arguments, our patients will first undergo the EBRT treatment followed by MR -HIFU with an interval of at least three hours. In the PRE -FURTHER study University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht and I sala Zwolle will collaborate in determin ing the feasibility of the EBRT/MR-HIFU combination treatment . As part of the multicenter RCT design, both treatments should not be more than 4 days apart , but the aim is to minimize this tim e by optimizing hospital logistics. The benefits of the expected earlier pain relief when both modalities are combined, are substantial, considering the relatively short life expectancy of these patients."
13,page_13,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 14 of 50 Until now the combined EBRT and MR -HIFU treatment was only applied to patients w ith radiation refractory metastatic bone pain with an interval of at least several weeks between the two treatments. Hitherto, no information on feasibility is available when t he two modalities are combined within a time frame of 4 days. We may have to decide that we will not include the combined treatment in the FURTHER RCT, when hos pital logistics hamper s us from providing the combined treatment within a defined time frame, when patients are not willing to undergo the combined treatment or when the combined treatment leads to serious adverse events which are the result of combining EBRT and MR -HIFU , 1.6 IDEAL recommendations This pilot study will be set up according to the IDEAL recommendations (McCulloch 2009 ; Verkooijen 2017 ). These recommendations provide direction for reporting and evaluation of innovative surgical procedures which are being undertaken for the first time, and for adoption of new procedures in oth er centers and by other teams. IDEAL is an acronym for the five stages that complex interventions go through, namely Innovation, Development, Evaluation, Assessment and Long term evaluation. Stage 1 demonstrates feasibility and absence of unexpected detri mental effects. The initial patients are usually highly selected on an individual basis. Feasibility, duration and complication are reported for a small number of patients. These reports should contain clear anonymous details of the patient, their conditio n, the rationale and background for use of the procedure, exactly what was done, and adequate details of relevant outcomes. After Stage 1 has shown technical feasibility, without major unexpected toxicities or complications, the technique enters Stage 2a. Stage 2 a aims to refine the technique and to optimize the work -flow. Outcomes of this stage are technical feasibility and safety. With practitioners maintaining confidence, the new approach becomes a practical alternative to the standard procedure. Report ing during this stage needs to include: selection criteria and proportion of eligible patients selected; a clear description of the procedure and each modification, with timing; and relevant outcomes, with recognized standard definitions of important categ ories, such as specific complications. Transition to stage 2b (Evaluation or Exploration) is justified by improvements in procedure times and the avoidance of adverse events, with major refinements of the method completed. This stage consists of a larger s eries of consecutive patients. Stage 3 (Assessment) aims to answer the essential question: Is the clinical efficacy of this intervention better than the standard treatment? Comparative studies, preferably with a randomized component, are favored. Stage 4 ( Long term evaluation) starts when the effectiveness of new intervention"
14,page_14,NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 15 of 50 has been demonstrated and the intervention is implemented in daily clinical practice. Th is pilot study is a combination of stage 1 (Idea) and stage 2a (Development).

STUDY DESIGN This study will be a prospective develop ment study (IDEAL stage 1 and 2a) (McCullo ch, 2009 ; Verkooijen , 2017 ) performed at the UMC Utrecht and Isala Zwolle. A group of 6-10 patients with painful bone metastases will be studied to evaluate feasibility and l ogistics of the combined EBRT MR -HIFU treatment within a 3 hours - 4 day time window . Participating doctors will be informed about the study and will be asked to inform possible eligible patients about its existence. If the patient is considered to be eligible for MR -HIFU by the treating physicians and investigators and when the patient is willing to participate , the investigator or an authorized delegate will take over and inform the patient in more detail about the s tudy, explaining the study design and procedures and collecting informed consent and baseline data . The inclusion preferably takes place shortly after the patient has been diagnosed and before treatment is started. Patients who fulfil all inclusion crite ria, none of the exclusion criteria, and sign a n informed consent will first receive the standard of care, single or multiple fraction EBRT, followed by MR-HIFU within a 3 hours - 4 day time window . The optimal logistic approach for administering both treatments will be assessed and protocolled . For this purpose, we will test several treatment schedule s and make adjustments when needed. We will aim for the shortest time interval possible between the t wo treatments with a minimum interval of 3 hours and we set out to minimize additional hospital visits for participating patients. During a follow -up period of 4 weeks , patients will be contacted by phone to retrieve information about their level of pain and pain medication around 3 days and 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after the MR -HIFU treat ment . A general flowchart of the study is given in the figure on the next page for both single and multiple fraction EBRT ."

STUDY POPULATION 4.1 Population (base) The study population will consist of male and female adults (age ≥ 18 years) with painful bone metastases who have given informed consent . This is a group of (often elderly) patients, with a limited life expectancy, in whom maintenance of quality of life a nd pain control is of utmost importance. In the UMC Utrecht, the subjects will be recruited from the PRESENT cohort . In PRESENT, patients planned for radiation treatment of bone metastatic disease at the department of Radiation Oncology of the UMC Utrech t are included (around 400 per year). In Isala patients will be recruited from patients that visit the outpatient clinic of the department of Radiation Oncology .

TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 5.1 Investigational product/treatment The intervention that will be studied is single or multiple fraction EBRT in combination with MR-HIFU within a 3 hour - 4 day time window . The combined treatment is aimed at rapid and persistent relief of metastatic bone pain. For more information on the Sonalleve MR -HIFU Bone metastases Therapy System we refer to the Investigator’s brochure . 5.2 Use of co -intervention 5.2.1 EBRT In a first step, patients will undergo EBRT a ccording to the standard of car e on a priority base within maximally 7 days after they visit the outpatient clinic of the Department of Radiation Oncology. Patients undergo a planning CT scan , as part of standard care, in treatment position. EBRT is provided as single fraction radiother apy or multiple fraction radiotherapy. According to the American Society for Radiation Oncology (2012) evidence -based guidelines for the management of bone metastases, a single fraction of 8 Gray ( Gy) has an equivalent pain relief quality indicator compare d to longer courses of radiotherapy, including 5 or 6 fractions of 4 Gy and 10 fractions of 3 Gy (Lutz et al, 2014). However, multiple fraction radiotherapy may have a larger contribution to local tumor control and is therefore often used in patient s with a longer life expectancy. The above dose fractionation schemes are recommended as quality indicators of palliative radiotherapy by the American National Quality Measures for EBRT for bone metastases. Acute and late side effects of radiotherapy for bone met astases ar e generally similar with single fraction versus multi fraction regimens, with some studies showing decreased acute side effects in patients receiving single -fraction radiotherapy. Time to pain relief also appears similar, with an optimal time to measure pain relief of 2 months after the completion of palliative radiotherapy. 5.2.2 Pain medication Subjects should receive pain medication if and as required by their symptoms, both before and after the combined EBRT and MR-HIFU treatment. The amount of pain medication used is part of the sec ondary endpoints of the study, and should be recorded at baseline before treatment and during the fol low-up after treatment. Pain medication used for treatment -related pain shall be noted in a separate Data Element in the CRF and in Concomitant Medication Forms. The fact that the medication was used for"
22,page_22,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 23 of 50 treatment related pain is marked on the Concomitant Medication Forms, and the use of this medication will not be considered in the assessment of the pain res ponse. Patients can continue to use chemotherapy, targeted therapies (e.g. angiogenesis inhibitors) or bisphosphonates if they are already using them. The treatment type and the date the treatment was started/stopped will be recorded. During the MR-HIFU treatment the patient will be under conscious sedation. This will enable adequate pain control and ensure a stable patient position during treatment. The sedatives used are at the preference of the anaesthesiologist /sedation specialist."

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 6.1 Name and description of investigational product The Profound MR-HIFU Sonalleve System integrates a high intensity phased array focused ultrasound transducer with a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging system and electromechanical trans ducer positioning system to deliver spatially and temporally controlled ultrasound energy and thermal heat to tissues non -invasively. The MR system is used to provide images to plan the therapy, and to guide and monitor the thermal ablation with thermal im aging during the treatment. The MR -HIFU system consists of:  HIFU Therapy Console, where treatment planning, treatment control and post - treatment operations are performed ;  Generator Cabinet that houses the control electronics and the 256 -channel ultrasound generator with individually programmable amplitude and phase ;  Patient Tabletop that houses the electromechanical transducer positioning system, the phased array 256 -channel ultrasound transducer immersed in a liquid bath, and integrated radiofrequency sur face and wrap -around coils for MR imaging. Patient contact materials are described in the Investigator’s Brochure. The users are required to be trained for safety, system/treatment workflow and quality assurance (QA) procedures. The Profound Sonalleve M R-HIFU system used in Isala and UMC Utrecht is a CE- marked device for pain palliation of bone metastases . They we re manufactured by Philips Medical Systems Oy, Vantaa, Finland. The systems will be traceable by their serial number and the Device History Rec ords maintained by the manufacturer. One Sonalleve MR -HIFU device is available at each study location. Traditionally, the Profound Sonalleve MR -HIFU device allows physicians to heat and ablate tissue under MR image guidance. Bone metastases cause bone destabilization (due to destruction) leading to stimulation of the mechanosensitive receptors in the periosteum (outer bone covering). HIFU treatment will aim at ablating the periosteum and thus reducing the localized bone pain. Ablation can be performed w ith volumetric techniques, which are designed to allow heating of larger zones or cells in one sonication. During a sonication, the transducer applies heat in a continuous manner to adjacent points within the treatment cell. In the bone HIFU treatment, the treatment cells"
24,page_24,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 25 of 50 are placed within a target treatment area to sonicate the targeted bone. Full treatment is performed by stepping through several treatment cells with cooling times between each sonication. Each HIFU ablation is performed with user selected ultrasound power set to achieve sufficient tissue heating to ablate the periosteal nerves, typically achieved in the temperature range 55 -70°C. Heating of the surrounding tissue can be monitored by MR temperature mapping. The duration of the exposures lin ked with the cell size are fixed by the system. Three different ablation approaches will be used to ablate the periosteum, i .e., the near - field approach, the direct approa ch and the soft -tissue approach . The main factors determining choice of ablation appr oach are the presence of cortical destruction , tissue in the far field and safety concerns. In patients with an intact cortex at metastasis level ablation of the metastasis is not possible. In that case the periost is ablated by heating the cortex. In pati ents with a (partly) destructed cortex it is unclear which part of the periost is still intact. The tumor itself and the overlying periost will be ablated. All three approaches aim for pain reduction. The Profound Sonalleve MR -HIFU system displays real -time temperature data overlaid on anatomical MR images, accumulated thermal dose information, and the ultrasound therapy parameters such as transmitted output power, frequency, and timing. Additionally, the operator can select specific thermal areas to obt ain temperature readouts. The temperature display is updated every 3 seconds with new information. For more details about the system, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure. 6.2 Summary of findings from non -clinical studies See Investigator’s brochure for the summary of findings from non -clinical MR -HIFU studies (pages 17 - 24). 6.3 Summary of findings from clinical studies See chapter 1 .3 and Investigator’s brochure for the summary of findings from clinical MR - HIFU studies (pages 25 - 30). 6.4 Summary of known and potential risks and benefits The Profound Sonalleve MRI -HIFU system is able to elevate temperatures at the bone interfaces, inside the bone and inside the bone metastasis with fast acquisition of thermal maps covering a large volume (including the skin), and with continuous heating of adjacent points, which reduces the amount of energy deposed. The device provides the user with"
25,page_25,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 26 of 50 sufficient information about the location of temperature elevation, volume of the ablation, and the temperature and thermal dose behavior of the heated tissue. With the dev ice the temperature of the bone surface can be elevated and a part of the soft tissue ablated to the extent that provides a significant improvement to the symptoms experienced by the patient. The risks are HIFU physics and clinical practice dependent rath er than specific HIFU device dependent. The highest risk is unintended heating of tissue causing burn s. The Sonalleve device is equipped with several safety measures to reduce the risks. The system offers e.g. real-time feedback to inform the operator of various safety parameters. The user can monitor for:  Undesired temperature elevations in off -focal and focal areas.  A significant drop in transmitted power.  A significant drop in temperature versus time curve at the focus The ultrasound system will automatically shut down if:  The transducer heats to critical temperatures.  The measured output power is higher or substantially lower than the requested power.  High levels of reflected/backscattered power are detected in the amplifiers.  Any system control element fails to respond correctly to a control request. The sonication can also be shut down manually by the Patient Emergency Stop Button, the operator controlled Safety Device, or the stop button in the User Interface. A sonication shut down is indicat ed both by the user interface and by an indicator light on the operator console. A manual reset or other action by the operator is required to continue use of the system after a safety shutdown or use of the stop button by a patient. The duration of the t reatment is dependent on the area which needs to be ablated. In genera l, it takes one to two hours t o treat the average patien t with one or more painful bone metasta ses. Since EBRT only takes up to 20 minutes and there is no need for sedation, patients cou ld experience the MR -HIFU treatment as more cumbersome. Based on the results from previous studies we have valid reason to tell our patients that, even though MR-HIFU is more cumbersome, it is expected to lead to much faster pain relief and perhaps even lo nger lasting pain relief in the majority of patients."

METHODS 7.1 Study parameters /endpoints 7.1.1 Main study parameter /endpoint The main outcome of this study is the feasibility of the combined procedure in terms of  Patient tolerance : assessed with a short patient reported experience measure (PREM) .  Optimal logistics and standardization of the procedure (treatment planning, extra hospital visits) . 7.1.2 Secondary study parameter s/endpoints The secondary study endpoints of this study are:  The pain reducing capabil ities of the combined treatment: Pain scores related to the target lesion treated as measured by patient’s self -assessment on a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire (Cleeland 1994) post inclusion and post treatment by phone around day 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after the MR -HIFU treatment . The BPI is a well -established, thoroughly validated tool for pain self -assessment, which can be considered a gold standard. Patients will rate the worst and a verage pain that they felt from the treated area over the last three days, and the pain they feel currently.  Safety of the combined treatment . 7.1.3 Other study parameters Several patient and tumor related parameters will be assessed such as a ge, gender, primary tumor, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), location of targeted volume, number of symptomatic bone metastases, date of diagnosis of primary tumor, date of diagnosis of first symptomatic bone metastasis, prior systemic treatments received, current sy stemic therapy, prior radiotherapy received (including dose/fractionation schedule and dates) and MR-HIFU treatment data such as treatment duration (time in scanner, sonication time) and amount of sonications. 7.2 Randomisation, blinding and treatment alloca tion This study is a non -randomized pilot study . All eligible subjects will first receive EBRT followed by MR-HIFU . As such, there will be no blinding of the study participants and their doctors."
27,page_27,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 28 of 50 7.3 Study procedures At least one day after the visit to the outpatient clinic the investigator or an authorized delegate will phone the patient to inform him/her about eligibility for the study. In case of eligibility the investigator or an authorized delegate will ask the pa tient for oral informed consent. If the patient is willing to participate in the study the investigator or an authorized delegate will make an appointment with the patient when the informed consent will be signed. This will preferably coincidence with the patient’s next visit to the hospital but latest before the preoperative screening and the MR -HIFU treatment. When written informed consent is given, the investigator or an authorized delegate will collect standard baseline demographic factors , disease hist ory, and previous therapy for bone metastasis from participating patients and response to prior radiotherapy when applicable , as well as help the patient to fill out the BPI and record total analgesic consumption during the previous 24 hours. Patients wil l be formally enrolled in the study following written informed consent, after inclusion criteria are met and none of the exclusion criteria apply . Patient screening and enrollment will be recorded on the Screening / Enrollment log. Information on withdrawal will also be recorded in this log. The Screening / Enrollment log will be used for subject accountability. Treatment procedure Usually single fraction EBRT is performed on the day of the patient’s first visit to the outpatient clinic of the Radiation O ncology Department. The MR -HIFU treatment will be subsequently applied within the shortest time interval possible but at the latest 4 days after EBRT . Multiple fraction EBRT is usually started within one to maximally seven days after t he patient’s first visit to the outpatient clinic of the Radiation O ncology Department . When multiple fraction EBRT is indicated, the MR -HIFU treatment will be minimally 3 hours and maximally 4 days after the last multiple fraction session . Planning of MR -HIFU treatment is more ch allenging than planning of EBRT. Most of the time treatment planning can be done on the basis of the available (CT) images. During the MR-HIFU treatment procedure, an intravenous catheter will deliver MR contrast media and medications (such as sedation and analgesics if required) within the MR room. The need for a urinary bladder cathether is determined by the treating physician . The body temperature of the patients will be measured prior to the procedure. In the MR room the"
28,page_28,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 29 of 50 patients will be asked to lie still on the HIFU patient table inside the MRI magnet. The operator will locate the target tissue and mark the volume to be treated using MRI images. The operator starts the treatment and monitors the progress of the treatment with MR thermal and dose maps according to the Sonalleve Instructions for Use to ensure safety. Due to the pain associated with the MR -HIFU procedure, anaesthesiologists/sedation specialists need to be involved to provide procedural sedation and analgesia. The pre - operative screening will be preferab ly take place on a day that the patients is already in the hospital. Patients will receive sedation during treatment administered by an anaesth esiologist or sedation specialist. Medication given will be a combination of pain medication (e.g. rapifen) and a nesthetics (e.g. propofol in combination with lidocaine for injection) at the preference of the anaesthesiologist/sedation specialist. The use of medication for treatment -related pain shall be recorded. Following the MR -HIFU procedure, a set of MR images of the target region will be acquired with the use of a MR contrast agent. When the whole planned volume has been treated, the operator stores the full treatment history and technical data as available from the Profound Sonalleve MR -HIFU device. The patients are then conducted to the recovery room for medical supervision. Before discharge, follow -up instructions will be given to the patient. We expect that by gaining more clinical experience with the combined treatment, we will be able to provide the combined treatment in a faster, patient -friendly way. Follow -up Follow up will be approximately 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after the MR -HIFU treatment. The investigator or an authorized delegate will contact patients by phone to ask the m whether any possible complications/adverse events have occurred. He/she will also interview the patient about their pain medication use and fill in the BPI questionnaire . At the third day after the MR -HIFU treatment the investigator will also inquire about the patient’s experience with the combined treatment. 7.4 Withdrawal of individual subjects Subjects can leave the study at any time for any reason if they wish to do so w ithout any consequences. The investigator can decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent medical reasons."

SAEs need to be reported till end of study within the Netherlands , as defined in the protocol . 8.6 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) / Safety Committee The investigators will perform continuous safety monitoring and will evaluate reported adverse events for agreement in determination of seriousness and causal relationship with the treatment (either procedure and/or device). In those instances where it cannot be determined if the event was linked to the treatment, this will also be noted on the patient file event report. If at any point during the study, the investigators conclude that continuation of the study will endanger the safety of the patients, the study shall be terminated. Both EBRT and MR -HIFU have been proven to be safe when applied alone .

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS In order to reach the objectives, a two stage approach will be used following the IDEAL recommendations: IDEAL stage 1, i.e. innovation/proof of concept of EBRT followed by MR - HIFU within a 3 hours - 4 days time window, followed by IDEAL stage 2a, i.e. dev elopment of the new treatment strategy. In the first stage, we will include three patients in whom the combined treatment will be applied and tested for the first time. In this stage, the main objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of the combined tr eatment strategy and describe it in detail. The report will contain clear anonymous details of the patient, exact description of the primary tumor, site of metastases, extent of the index lesion, rationale for the use of this procedure in these particular patients and a very detailed description of technical and clinical aspects of the procedures. For all patients, technical success, detailed pain scores (baseline and follow up), neurological symptoms (baseline and follow up), complications, toxicity, use o f analgesics, and other relevant outcomes will be reported on an individual level. The patients reported experience will also be used to make adjustments to the logistics and treatment protocol. After stage 1 , an interval of at least two weeks will be imp lemented before treating the next patient to allow identification of early major problems. Progression to stage 2a (Development) will be justified after we have demonstrated feasibility of the combined procedure, without major technical problems or safety issues. In stage 2a, the main focus is safety and technical feasibility of the combined procedure, which will be measured in 3-7 consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria . For all patients, we will re port toxi city and pain response. The patient -reported worst pain will be used. This is consistent with the latest version of the International Consensus for clinical trial endpoints on bone pain palliation with radiotherapy. Pain responders are defined as patients with: 1. Pain score (numerical rating scale; NRS) at the treated site of zero without analgesic increase (complete response); 2. Reduction of pain score of at least 2 points at the treated site without analgesic increase (partial response); 3. Analgesic reduction of 25% or more without increase in pain (partial response). In addition, pain medication pre - and post -procedure as reported by the patient and in medication records are documented. Opioid analgesics are expressed as the oral equivalent daily morphine use (OMED). Results will be presented as descriptive statistics and no statistical tests will be performed . Early terminations and withdrawals, will also be reporte d."

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1 Regulation statement The study will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (20 13, www.wma.net) and in accordance with :  All national and local laws of the pertinent regulatory bodies, including the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) in the Netherlands,  Internal Standard O perating Procedures, and  This protocol . 10.2 Recruitment and consent In the UMC Utrecht subjects will be recruited from the PRESENT cohort. In Isala patients will be recruited from patients that visi t the outpatient clinic of the D epartment of Radiation Oncol ogy. The radiation oncologist will perform a first eligibility check on the basis of clinical parameters and images (PET -CT) which are usually already available when patients with painful bone metastases are referred to the Department of Radiation Oncology . If information on medical history, indication for treatment and capability to communicate with the physician indicate that the patient is likely to satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria (section 4.2 and 4.3), the radiation oncologist will inform t he patient about the PRE -FURTHER study. Patients interested in participating in the study will receive a participant information letter including the informed consent form explaining the purpose and the details of the study, particularly the potential risk s and burdens associated with the combined treatment. In case the patient is likely to give informed consent, eligibility of the patient is discussed in detail in a Multidisciplinary Consultation Meeting with the radiation oncologist and radiologist. The investigator or an authorized delegate will conduct the informed consent process. He/she will contact the patient by phone at least one day after the initial hospital visit and in case of eligibility he/she will provide more details on the study if needed and will ask the patient for his/her oral consent to participate in the study. The time window of minimally one day for an oral informed consent has been chosen as these procedures are almost always planned within one week after first presentation in the outpatient clinic. The one -day time window allows us to plan the combined treatment as soon as possible. In our opinion, with one day patients have a reasonable amount of time to consider this experimental combination without the risk on treatment delay."
37,page_37,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 38 of 50 The patients are requested to sign the informed consent form before the preoperative screening, the MR-HIFU treatment and befor e any other data are collected . Thus, patients also have the chance to revoke consent at this stage. Signature to the consent form should take place in the presence of the principal investigator or an authorized delegate. 10.3 Benefits and risks assessment, g roup relatedness The PRE -FURTHER study is designed to assess the feasibility of the combined EBRT MR - HIFU treatment of painful bone metastases . EBRT is the current standard of care. The most common adverse event of EBRT is a temporal increase of the pain after the treatment also known as pain flare (Mavrogenis , 2016). ‘Pain flare’ is observed in 2 to 44 percent of patients and can have an important impact on quality of life. Pathologic fractures of weight -bearing bones occur in 10 -20% of patients with bo ne metastases, with femoral metastases accounting for the largest part of these fractures (Body, 1992; Eastley, 2012) The risk of pathological fractures after radiotherapy has been well documented . In the most recent systematic review of palliative radiotherapy trials for bone metastases, comparing single versus multiple faction regimens, one of the secondary outcomes was pathological f racture rate after radiotherapy (Chow, 2007) . Several studies reported data for pathological fracture rates (Bone Pa in Trial Working Party, 1999; Cole, 1989; Hartsell, 2005; Kaasa, 2006, Nielsen, 1998; Price, 1986; Roos, 2005) . The pooled pathological fracture rates ranged from 2.8% to 3.2% with no significant differences for treatment schedules. Most of these studies e xcluded patients with (impending) pathological fractures, which is also the case in th is pilot study. However, EBRT is only effective in part of the patients and it may take several weeks before pain reduction is achieved. The additional MR -HIFU treatment is expected to lead to a more rapid pain relief and may even prevent or reduce the pain flare . Besides occasional minor thermal skin burns, no serious adverse effects are expected as a result of the additional MR - HIFU treatment . A detailed summary of the results of the complete risk analysis performed by the Supplier is given in the Investigator’s Brochure (chapter 10 and appendix 1) . The Investigator’s Brochure summarizes the outcomes and reported adverse events of previous key MR -HIFU studies. The benef its and positive outcomes reported in these previous studies have been weighed against the identified risks. Th is weighing has led to CE label ing of the device in Europe."
38,page_38,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 39 of 50 In addition to those procedure - or device -related adverse events the following adverse events are anticipated in this patient population, but expected to be unrelated to the combined treatment procedure:  Death due to progression of the underlying cancer or cancer -related complications ;  Hospitalization for cancer treatment or due to cancer -related complications ;  Fracture at site (s) of bone metastas es unrelated to treatment requiring hospitalization and/or surgical intervention ;  Increase of cancer -related pai n unrelated to treatment ;  Progression of the underlying disease . For the combined treatment , patients will in most cases need to pay an extra visit to the hospital to undergo a rather lengthy additional intervention (MR -HIFU treatment), under conscious se dation . There is no data available about the possible complications and risk of the combination of EBRT and MR-HIFU within 4 days . However, b oth treatments have proven to be safe when applied alone , their mechanism of action differs and the minimal interval of 3 hours between the two treatments has be en chosen in such a way that a detrimental interaction between the two treatments is not to be expected. 10.4 Compensation for injury The sponsor/investigator has a liability insurance whi ch is in accordance with article 7 of the WMO. The sponsor (also) has an insurance which is in accordance with the legal requirements in the Netherlands (Article 7 WMO). This insurance provides cover for damage to research subjects through injury or death caused by the study. The insurance applies to the damage that becomes apparent during the study or within 4 years after the end of the study. 10.5 Incentives Reasonable travel expenses and parking costs arising from an additional or prolonged hospital visit because of the MR -HIFU treatment will be reimbursed to enrolled subjects. Besides travel expenses and parking costs , there will be no extra compensation for study participants."

ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS , MONITORING AND PUBLICATION 11.1 Handling and storage of da ta and documents A clinical database will be set-up using OpenClinica. As part of the data entry workflow, the OpenClinica software will assign a “study ID”. The reference between the Study ID and the hospital patient number is listed in the Subject Identi fication Log per site. The Subject Identification Log will only be accessible by authori zed personnel. The study ID will also be used to tag the inbound technical patient data. Data will be pseudonymized according to the applicable regulations and rules. Each eCRF will be completed on site by the investigator or an authorized staff member. MRI and HIFU data will be stored on location . All individual patient data records will be collected on confidential basis and according to the applicable national data protection, privacy, and secrecy laws (General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (In Dutch: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming (AVG)). The investigators, auditors, monitors and employees of the ‘Inspectie Gezondheidszorg en Jeugd ’ may have access to the medical and research data of the patients. It is the investigator’s responsibility to complete and approve all treatment related data. Anonymized d ata collected from subjects treated under this protocol may be used in submissions to regulatory agencie s, and for publications. Summaries of data and information from each patient data form may be used for reporting of the investigation's findings during the study . Records of the study must be maintained at least as long as local document retention regula tions require. In the event that the investigator withdraws or relocates, study records will be transferred to identified site personnel or to the sponsor. This transfer is subject to the sponsor’s approval. Procedures for data management are detailed in a separate Data Management Plan. 11.2 Monitoring and Quality Assurance Each site will be monitored by its own institutional monitor. The clinical monitor will be responsible for verifying adherence to the protocol , reviewing subject records and source data, maintaining records of all actions taken to correct protocol deficiencies during the investigation, and assuring that the data needed to complete the study is complete and accurate. Monitoring will be documented to the study files by monitor reports. The monitor plan is attached as an addendum."

STRUCTURED RISK ANALYSIS 12.1 Potential issues of concern In the PRE -FURTHER study patients with painful bone metastases will receive both (single or multiple fraction) EBRT and MR -HIFU within a rather short interval of 3 hours - 4 days. Since EBRT is the current standard of care for these patients this structured risk analysis focuses on any risks caused by the MR -HIFU treatment and by th e combination of the two treatments. a. Level of knowledge about mechanism of action The putative main mechanism of pain relief by EBRT involves the inactivation of osteoclasts to change the microenvironment of bone resorption followed by sterilization of cancer cell s to reduce tumor -induced compression (Hartsell et al 2007). The direct mechanism of action of EBRT is damage to DNA of tissues, including both single strand and double strand DNA breaks, originating mostly from different oxygen radicals. The mechanism of action of MR - HIFU is coagulative necrosis and apoptosis of tissue due to heat leading to rapid and durable pain relief from immediate periosteal nerve ablation and thermal necrosis of the targeted bone tumor followed by remineralization of the trabecular b one and bone healing a few months later. Since the mechanism of action of EBRT and MR -HIFU differ, MR -HIFU provides an alternative means to overcome radioresistance and is recommended for patients with bone metastasis for whom RT is considered to have fail ed (Hurwitz , 2014 ). Since the mechanism of action of EBRT and MR -HIFU differ, the two methods may be synergistic in first -line, or when applied nearly simultaneously. Heat -induced coagulative ablation is the main action of MR -HIFU, hence its pain palliati on effect is expected to be rapid. However, heat distribution is often spatially heterogeneous in bone metastases because of the fact that absorption of ultrasound energy depends on many factors including the degree of bone lysis or formation, and incident ultrasound angle. Therefore, it might be that the, more long -term, systemic responses of EBRT of the tumor and its microenvironment, reduction of tumor -induced compression and inactivation of osteoclasts, can be augmented by local ablation of periosteal n erve ablation by MR -HIFU. Some other effects should be mentioned. - Hyperthermia (temperatures 42 -45°C) beyond the ablated area results in complementary radiosensitization (reduction of hypoxia; inhi bition of DNA repair mechanisms) ( van der Zee, 2000, Dababou 2018) thereby increasing the risk of damage to surrounding tissue."
42,page_42,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 43 of 50 - Coagulative ablation by M R-HIFU (temperatures around 60° C) also leads to reduction/elimination of local perfusion leading to hypoxia of the treated area. This may render subsequent EBRT less efficient (less production of oxygen radicals) . b. Previous expos ure of human beings with the test product(s) and/or products with a similar biological mechanism To date, MR-HIFU treatments of uterine fibroids, prostate cancer, breast cancer, b one metastases, brain tumors and pancreas -, liver - and kidney tumors are either a clinical application or in development. Currently HIFU is mostly used for the ablation of prostate canc er and uterine fibroids. Many HIFU treatments are performed under MR -guidance. MRI provides accurate guidance during HIFU treatment, as it offers good soft tissue visualization and enables treatment planning. Moreover MRI provides temperature maps for excellent therapy monitoring and evaluation of treatment results. For these reasons, MRI is considered the best and safest m ethod for HIFU guidance. Results of previous studies are presented in chapter 1.3 and the Investigator’s Brochure. The combined EBRT MR -HIFU treatment is applied for the first time within the relatively short interval of 3 hours - 4 days in human beings. c. Can the primary or secondary mechanism be induced in animals and/or in ex-vivo human cell material? Animal studie s were focused on:  The Treatment Protocol for sonication on bone  Safety Issues including skin, near field heating, cooling times, targeting accuracy  Cavitation Detection: passive receive technique  Full integrated HIFU system performance in a representative in vivo model These studies confirmed the potential benefit but their relevance to the clinical situation is limited because of the following reasons: - The origin of the primary tumor in the PRE -FURTHER and FURTHER projects varies (breast, prostate, etcet era), and hence also the genotype and phenotype of the bone metastasis. - The anatomical location of the bone metastasis varies necessitating an individual planning and adaptation of both EBRT and MR -HIFU."
43,page_43,"NL68441 .041.19 PRE-FURTHER Version 2; 16-02-2019 44 of 50 - The degree of bone lysis/bone growth differs affecti ng the ultrasound absorption necessitating specific MR -HIFU planning . - EBRT efficacy varies with relation to the degree of hypoxia and perfusion. - MR-HIFU efficacy differs with respect to ultrasound absorption, incidence angle of the ultrasound beam, and deg ree of bone lysis/bone growth. In addition, pain scores are difficult to obtain in animal models. Also, the starting pain level in drug refractory patients in this trial is at such an elevated level that animal models are ethically questionable. See for more detail page 21 -24 of the Sonalleve Investigator’s brochure. To the best of our knowledge there are no data available from animal studies that combined EBRT and MR -HIFU. d. Selectivity of the mechanism to target tissue in animals and/or human beings The mechanism of MR -HIFU thermal ablation does not depend on cell types, receptors or other biological characteristics, but merely on the targeted locations of the HIFU beam focal point. The targeting precision is in the range of milli meters. MR imaging is used for target definition and allows the physician to depict organs at risk of thermal damage (in the HIFU beam, i.e. in front of, or behind the focal point). e. Analysis of potential effect Thermal damage can be quantified with the thermal dose concept, which has been validated extensively ex vivo, in vivo and in the clinical setting (Chung, 1999; Dewhirst , 2003; McDannold, 2000 & 2006; Yarmolenko, 2011). A thermal dose of > 240 cumulative equivalent minutes (EM) at 43°C is generall y considered lethal. In addition, tissue that is heated (for any duration) to > 60°C can be considered coagulated. This is regardless of whether malignant or (accidently) healthy tissue is targeted. During the MR -HIFU procedure, the thermal dose and temper ature are visualized on the HIFU console in real -time. This allows the physician to continuously monitor the deposition of thermal energy, and to abort the sonication when a temperature elevation or thermal dose deposition is observed outside the targeted location. Thus, adjacent healthy organs can be monitored continuously for damage, and the physician can act immediately to prevent damaging these organs."

Interaction with other products Not applicable for this study . h. Study population The research subjects are male and female adults (age ≥ 18 years) with painful bone metastases. This is a group of (often elderly) patients, with a limited life expectancy . Since we will only include pat ients with a life expectancy longer than 3 months, the condition of these patients is expected to be good enough to undergo an additional treatment n ext to the standard EBRT treatment . Eligibility for the study will be assessed by the treating radiation oncologist and radiologist , the anesthesiologist and the investigator. i. Predictability of effect MR-HIFU tissue ablation has been demonstrated to have a high predictability of effect. Protein denaturation, causing cell death, occurs at temperatures ≥ 60 °C, or when a cumulative thermal dose is reached of ≥ 240 EM. This mechanism has been demonstrated both ex vivo and in vivo in multiple studies, and has been validated in clinical studies on uterine fibroid ablation (Chung, 1999; Dewhirst, 2003; McDannold, 2000 & 2006; Yarmolenko, 2011) . In addition, each treatment is preceded by a test sonication. This is a low-powered sonication that only causes a small increase in temperature. It is used to validate (and, if required, adjust) the HIFU beam targeting for optimal accuracy of the therapeutic shots. j. Can effects be managed? During MR -HIFU sonications, temperature development in the targeted and surrounding tissue is closely monitored with the proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) method. The treating phy sician is able to follow the deposition of thermal energy in real -time. If needed, sonications are aborted in order to, for example, prevent lethal heating of surrounding healthy tissue. Abortion of the sonications is automatically done by the system or ma nually by the treating physician. Additionally an anesthesiologist will monitor the patient during treatments. He or she may abort or pause the treatment in case changes in the patient’s vital signs indicate to do so. After the MR -HIFU procedure, the patient will be allowed to recover from the procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA), after which he/she will be transferred to the ward. Local standard procedures, if applicable, will be followed. In principle, patients will stay in the"

This allows (per)acute complications to become overt. In that case, adequate medical and/or surgical support is left at the discretion of the attending physician. 12.2 Synthesis MR-HIFU ablation is a powerful technique that can rapi dly increase the temperature in tissues to lethal temperatures. This makes it an useful tool for the treatment of a whole array of diseases. However, MR -HIFU can also potentially induce thermal damage to vital tissues and organs. For this reason, clinical studies focus on real -time treatment monitoring and optimizing the accuracy and precision of the ablation process. Previous MR -HIFU studies for painful bone metastases demonstrate d that MR -HIFU is sufficiently safe and effective . The MR-HIFU procedures are performed under MRI guidance which means that the treated tissue is visualized during the entire treatment and that the temperature of the targeted region is continuously depicted in temperature maps. In the presented literature, minor adverse events occu rred in some patients and mainly consisted of mild skin burns and mild pain . No severe adverse event s were reported. All minor adverse events subsided within a maximum of 10 days and had no sequelae . The use of PSA for the MR -HIFU treatment has two major advantages over using local or no anesthesia. First, patients are able to lie still during the entire treatment, which decreases the risk of side effects and impaired treatment efficacy due to patient motion. Second, subjects experience less discomfort and pain during MR -HIFU treatment. The risks of the sedation used are very low. We cannot fully exclude unexpected complications and (serious) adverse events due to the combination of EBRT and MR -HIFU. However, t he minimal interval of 3 hours between the EBRT and MR -HIFU treatment was chosen in such a way that a detrimental interaction between the two treatments is not to be expected . Moreover, their mechanism of action differs and both treatments have proven to be safe when applied alone . Therefore, we do no t expect any SAE . Overall, it is deemed that the potential benefits of this study, both to the individual patient, as manifested by potential rapid and long lasting pain relief at the treated lesion, and in the end to the wider patient community, as manifested by potential wider availability of an additional non-invasive option for pain palliation in bone metastases, outweighs the potential risks."
