Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be assessed at baseline and after 3 months. Clinical assessments will comprise of medical history, WHO functional class, electrocardiogram, blood gas analysis, lung function, 6 -minute walking distance, echocardiography, laboratory incl uding NT -proBNP, invasive hemodynamics using right heart catheterization, cardiopulmonary exercise testing with stress -Doppler echocardiogra phy and quality of life questionnaire (SF-36) at baseline and after 3 months, worsening of saturation and clinical w orsening events. Interventions Patients will be divided in a supplemental -oxygen group and no-supplemental -oxygen group (control group) - Patients in the supplemental -oxygen group will be prescribed >16 -hour oxygen (liquid oxygen) for 12 weeks, aiming at O2 saturation values of >90% at rest and during exercise or physical activity. Oxygen flow will be determined by titration - Patients in the control group will not receive oxygen supply throughout the study (12 weeks), unless severe resting desaturation (SpO 2 ≤80%) or severe exercise -induced desaturation (SpO 2 <80% for ≥10 minutes) developed. If eit her of these conditions develop , oxygen will be prescribed and the oxygen requirement will be reassessed after 30 days. - Patients of the control group will be offer ed to participate in the interventional treatment arm after they have terminated the control period (partial cross -over; secondary intervention group). Assessments of the secondary control group will be performed in analogy to the primary intervention grou p. Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio. Study duration Q1 2019 - Q4 2021 * Background Most patients with PAH, except those with congenital heart defects and pulmonary -to-systemic shunts, have minor degrees of hypoxemia at rest and during the night (Hildebrand et al. 2012). Current recommendations including the pneumological"
9,page_9,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 10 guidelines for LTOT (Galiè et al. 2015) are based on evidence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as data for patients with PH are lacking: - When O2 partial pressure is repeatedly <8 kPa (<60 mmHg; alternatively, 90% of O 2 saturation), patients are ad vised to use O 2 to achieve a saturation of >8 kPa. (Galiè et al. 2015) - The use of ambulatory O 2 can be considered when there is evidence of a symptomatic response or correction of exercise -induced desaturation. In patients with COPD it has already been shown that supplemental oxygen improves dyspnea and the distance walked during a five -minute walk test compared to supplemental air (Nonoyama et al. 2007). Data regarding survival benefits due to long -term oxygen therapy in COPD is inconsistent (Medical Research Council Working Party 1981, Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial Group 1980, Chaouat et al. 1999, Górecka 1997). There are only few studies investigating the effect of oxygen supply in pulmonary hypertension, most of which merely investigate acute effects of O 2 administration. Short -term oxygen administration has been shown to reduce mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and to increase cardiac output in PAH patients (Leuchte et al. 2013, Roberts et al. 2001). In one study, oxygen supply also reversed the progression of PH in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Weitzenblum et al. 1985). One recent randomized -controlled trial indicates that O2 given during cardiopulmonary exercise significantly improves maxi mal work rate and endurance (Ulrich et al. 2017). Furthermore, nocturnal oxygen supply for one week significantly improved 6 -minute walking distance in patients with PH (Ulrich et al. 2015) , sleep - associated breathing difficulties, exercise performance during the day as well as cardiac repolarisation (Schumacher et al. 2014). Patients with Eisenmenger’s syndrome gain little benefit from nocturnal O 2 therapy (Sandoval et al. 2001). Whether these positive effects of O 2 supplementation during exercise would tr anslate into long -term improvements of exercise capacity, quality of life, hemodynamics and disease progression is not known to date. Up to now, there are no randomised studies suggesting that long -term O 2 therapy is indicated or when it should be initiate d."

Oxygen treatment with liquid oxygen as applicable will be prescribed to patients of the intervention group. Oxygen flow will be determined by titration, aiming at O2 saturation values of >90% at rest. Patients in the control group will be offered prescription of oxygen supply after the end of control period (control phase), serving as secondary intervention group. Indication PAH patients experiencing oxygen desaturations at rest and during physical activity, when O2 partial pressure is repeatedly <8 kPa (<60 mmHg; alternatively, 90% of O 2 saturation). Aims and Objectives 1) To determine patient benefits from a long -term oxygen therapy (LTOT) given continuously during ≥16h/day for 12 weeks, measured by improvement of exercise performance assessed by the 6 minute walking distance (6MWD) 2) To investigate effects of oxygen treatment on QoL, measured with SF-36 questionnaire 3) To determine the hemodynamic and functional responses during long term oxygen treatment by echocardiography , stress -doppler echocardiography cardiopulmonary exercise testing and right heart catheterisation 4) To investigate the change of clinical parameters such as blood gas analysis, laboratory (NT -proBNP), WHO functional class 5) To assess time to worsening of oxygen saturation and time to clinical worsening Sample size N= 40 (with 20 patients randomized in each group) The minimally important difference of 6 -minute walking distance in patients with pulmonary hypertension is considered to be 33 meters, according to the literature (Mathai et al. 2012). A recent study of Ulrich et al. has shown a 2 5 meter difference between nocturnal oxygen and sham -O2 for an intervention period of one week with a concentrator device in patients with pulmonary hypertension (Ulrich et al. 2015). We assume a standard deviation of the difference of 50 meters (as seen i n the data of Ulrich et al.) and a higher effect of 35 meters due to a longer intervention period and the use of oxygen supply ≥16h/day, which lies also above the threshold of minimally important difference for the 6 -minute walking distance. The primary en dpoint will be analysed in a hierarchical testing strategy with: 1. Intra -individual analysis of 6MWD in the primary and secondary intervention group (difference from baseline to follow -up)"
13,page_13,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 14 2. If (1) is significantly different, the treatment effect on 6MWD will be compared between the primary intervention group and the control group. Sample size assumptions : 1) If the true treatment effect is at least an increase of 35meters in the 6 -minute walking distance in the intervention group with a standard deviation of 50 meters, a sample size of 29 patients will provide a >95% power with a matched -pairs two -sided student’s t-test with a significance level of 0.05 (intra -individual comparison of difference baseline to follow -up of patients from primary and secondary intervention group). 2) If the true treatment effect is at least a control group corrected increase of 50meters in the 6 -minute walking distance with an equal standard deviation of 50 meters, a sample size of 17 patients in each group (total sample size n=34) will provide a n 80% power with a two -sided student’s t -test with a significance level of 0.05 comparing two independent means (comparison of differences baseline to follow -up between the two groups).

26,page_26,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 27 2 Introduction 2.1 Scientific Background Most patients with PAH, except those with congenital heart defects and pulmonary -to-systemic shunts, have minor degrees of arterial hypoxemia at rest and during the night (Hildebrand et al. 2012). Current recommendations including the pneumological guidel ines for LTOT (Galiè et al. 2015) are based on evidence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as data for patients with PH are lacking: - When O 2 partial pressure is repeatedly <8 kPa (<60 mmHg; alternatively, 90% of O 2 saturation), pati ents are advised to use O 2 to achieve a saturation of >8 kPa. (Galiè et al. 2015) - The use of ambulatory O 2 can be considered when there is evidence of a symptomatic response or correction of exercise -induced desaturation. In patients with COPD it has al ready been shown that supplemental oxygen improves dyspnea and the distance walked during a five -minute walk test compared to supplemental air (Nonoyama et al. 2007). Data regarding survival benefits due to long -term oxygen therapy in COPD is inconsistent (Medical Research Council Working Party 1981, Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial Group 1980, Chaouat et al. 1999, Górecka 1997). There are only few studies investigating the effect of oxygen supply in pulmonary hypertension, most of which merely investigate ac ute effects of O 2 administration. Short -term oxygen administration has been shown to reduce mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and to increase cardiac output in PAH patients (Leuchte et al. 2013, Roberts et al. 2001). In one st udy, oxygen supply also reversed the progression of PH in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Weitzenblum et al. 1985). One recent randomized -controlled trial indicates that O 2 given during cardiopulmonary exercise significantly im proves maximal work rate and endurance (Ulrich et al. 2017). Furthermore, nocturnal oxygen supply for one week significantly improved 6 -minute walking distance in patients with PH (Ulrich et al. 2015), sleep -associated breathing difficulties, exercise performance during the day as well as cardiac repolarisation (Schumacher et al. 2014). Patients with Eisenmenger’s syndrome gain little benefit from nocturnal O 2 therapy (Sandoval et al. 2001)."
27,page_27,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 28 Whether these positive effects of O 2 supplementation during exerc ise would translate into long - term improvements of exercise capacity, quality of life, hemodynamics and disease progression is not known to date. Up to now, there are no randomised studies suggesting that long -term O 2 therapy is indicated or when it should be initiated. This will be the first study to investigate the effect of long -term oxygen treatment for ≥16h/day for 3 months compared to no oxygen supply in patients with PAH or CTEPH on 6 -minute walking distance, clinical parameters, quality of life and hemodynamics. Exercise capacity, clinical parameters, quality of life and invasive hemodynamics will be measured at baseline and after 3 months (12 weeks). 2.2 Trial Rationale/ Justification Treatment of O2 naïve patients with PAH will be included in th is investigator -initiated trial (IIT) to assess efficacy and safety of oxygen substitution. Noctur nal oxygen substitution improved the 6MWD compared to placebo in one clinica l trial in PAH patients (Ulrich et al. 2015). Due to the positive results in the tre atment of patients with PAH, the initiation of this proof -of-concept study is justified. 2.3 Benefit/ Risk Assessment One recent randomized -controlled trial indicates that O 2 given during cardiopulmonary exercise significantly improves maximal work rate and en durance (Ulrich et al. 2017). Furthermore, nocturnal oxygen supply for one week significantly improved 6 -minute walking distance in patients with PH (Ulrich et al. 2015) , sleep -associated breathing difficulties, exercise performance during the day as well as cardiac repolarisation (Schumacher et al. 2014). Patients with Eisenmenger’s syndrome gain little benefit from nocturnal O 2 therapy (Sandoval et al. 2001). Whether these positive effects of O 2 supplementation during exercise would translate into long - term improvements of exercise capacity, quality of life, hemodynamics and disease progression is not known to date. Up to now, there are no randomised studies suggesting that long -term O 2 therapy is indicated or when it should be initiated. 2.4 Steering Committ ee In order to monitor specific aspects of the current trial the following Reference Committees will be established: The clinical study will be an investig ator initiated trial in the Thor axclinic in Heidelberg specialized in the treatment of patients with PH. The Steering Committee will be responsible for coordinating the conduct of this trial. The Steering Committee will also protect the safety interests of patients in this trial by monitoring the progress and safety data of the trial."

Patients will be divided in a supplemental -oxygen group (primary intervention group) and no- supplemental -oxygen group (control group). Patients of the control group wil l be offered to participate in the interventional treatment arm after they have terminated the control period (partial cross -over; secondary intervention group). Efficacy of long term oxygen therapy will be investigated by assessing invasive and non - invasi ve clinical parameters at baseline and after 3 months. Efficacy parameters will be compared intra -individual ly (primary and secondary intervention group) and between the intervention and the control group. Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio."

The minimally impo rtant difference of 6 -minute walking distance in patients with pulmonary hypertension is considered to be 33 meters, according to the literature (Mathai et al. 2012)."
30,page_30,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 31 A recent study of Ulrich et al. has shown a 25 meter difference between nocturnal oxygen and sham -O2 for an intervention period of one week with a concentrator device in patients with pulmonary hypertension (Ulrich et al. 2015). We assume a standard deviation of the difference of 50 meters (as seen in the data of Ulrich et al.) and a higher ef fect of 35 meters due to a longer intervention period and the use of oxygen supply ≥16h/day, which lies also above the threshold of minimally important difference for the 6 -minute walking distance. The primary endpoint will be analysed in a hie rarchical te sting strategy with Intra-individual analysis of 6MWD in the primary and secondary intervention group (difference from baseline to follow -up). If (1) is significantly different, the treatment effect on 6MWD will be compared between the primary intervention group and the control group. Sample size assumptions If the true treatment effect is at least an increase of 35 meters in the 6 -minute walking distance with an equal standard deviation of 50 meters, a sample size of 29 patients will provide a >95% power w ith a matched -pairs two -sided student’s t -test with a significance level of 0.05 (intra - individual comparison of difference baseline to follow -up in primary and secondary intervention group). If the true treatment effect is at least a control group correct ed increase of 50 meters in the 6 - minute walking distance with an equal standard deviation of 50 meters, a sample size of 18 patients in each group will provide a n 83% power with a two -sided student’s t -test with a significance level of 0.05 comparing two independent means (comparison of differences baseline to follow -up between the two groups). The sample size of 18 patients in each group with an anticipated dropout rate of 10% leads to a final sample size of 40 (20 in each group).

35,page_35,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 36 Storage conditions: no special storage conditions required Marketing authorization holder: different marketing authorization holders will be available, as oxygen will be prescribed according to marketing approval in Germany /(e.g. VitalAire, Linde, Vivisol, …). Devices: liquid oxygen may be applied via different devices, such as Freelox, Liber ator, Stroller, Spirit, Helios, Inogen One 7.2 Therapeutic Effects Most patients with PAH, except those with congenital heart defects and pulmonary -to-systemic shunts, have minor degrees of hypoxemia at rest and during the night (Hildebrand et al. 2012). Current recommendations including the pneumological guidelines for LTOT (Galiè et al. 2015) are based on evidence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as data for patients with PH are lacking:  When O 2 partial pressure is repeatedly <8 kPa (<60 mmHg; alternatively, 90% of O2 saturation), patients are advised to use O 2 to achieve a saturation of >8 kPa. (Galiè et al. 2015)  The use of ambulatory O 2 can be considered when there is evidence of a symptomatic response or correction of exercise -induced desaturation. In patients with COPD it has already been shown that supplemental oxygen improves dyspnea and the distance walked during a five -minute walk test compared to supplemental air (Nonoyama et al. 2007). Data regarding survival benefits due t o long -term oxygen therapy in COPD is inconsistent (Medical Research Council Working Party 1981, Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial Group 1980, Chaouat et al. 1999, Górecka 1997). There are only few studies investigating the effect of oxygen supply in pulmonar y hypertension, most of which merely investigate acute effects of O 2 administration. Short -term oxygen administration has been shown to reduce mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and to increase cardiac output in PAH patients (L euchte et al. 2013, Roberts et al. 2001). In one study, oxygen supply also reversed the progression of PH in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Weitzenblum et al. 1985). One recent randomized -controlled trial indicates that O 2 given during cardiopulmonary exercise significantly improves maximal work rate and endurance (Ulrich et al. 2017). Furthermore, nocturnal oxygen supply for one week significantly improved 6 -minute walking distance in"
36,page_36,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 37 patients with PH (Ulrich et al. 2015), sleep-associated breathing difficulties, exercise performance during the day as well as cardiac repolarisation (Schumacher et al. 2014). Patients with Eisenmenger’s syndrome gain little benefit from nocturnal O 2 therapy (Sandoval et al. 2001). Whether these p ositive effects of O 2 supplementation during exercise would translate into long - term improvements of exercise capacity, quality of life, hemodynamics and disease progression is not known to date. Up to now, there are no randomised studies suggesting that l ong-term O 2 therapy is indicated or when it should be initiated. 7.3 Known Side Effects People exposed to high concentrations of oxygen for long periods of time are at risk for oxygen toxicity. These include ventilator patients, premature infants and people r eceiving hype rbaric oxygen treatment (Collopy et al. 2012). For this reason, it is recommended that when oxygen therapy is warranted, the lowest effective dose be given (Jenkinson et al. 1993). Possible side effects of oxygen treatment are drying out of the mucous membranes in case of inappropriate application, coughing and increased dyspnea in case of oversupply. Patients with a serious adverse event occurring during the study treatment will be followed by the study team until the serious adverse event w ill have resolved to the pre -study level and/or will have been addressed according to best clinical practice. Patients withdrawing from the study prematurely will have a final physical examination. 7.4 Dosage Schedule, Titration and Administration Study medic ation will be oxygen (O 2) in diverse concentrations, titrated until a SaO 2>90% or pO2 >60 mmHg is achieved, for 20 patients vs. no supplemental O 2 for 20 patients over 90 ± 7 days. Patients of the control group will be offered to participate in the interve ntional treatment arm after they have terminated the control period (partial cross -over; secondary intervention group). After the end of the study it is up to the judgment of the investigator to prescribe oxygen to all patients who might benefit from the t reatment. This decision will be based on the physician’s and the patient’s estimation taking into account the observed individual treatment effect, progression of disease, patient view and any comments from the Ethics Committee, if applicable. Patient care and monitoring will be performed in the patients’ specialized centers . Titration Oxygen flow adaptation (titration): Until a S pO2 >90% or pO 2 >60mmHg is achieved Administration"

Screening number will ascend, starting with 001, 002, etc. If the patient is eligible for the prospective drug trial, a 1:1 randomization will be performed into oxygen and no-supplemental oxygen group and a consecutive randomization number will be allocated to the patient. The oxygen supplier will provide the oxygen to the patients in the intervention group in a concentration based on the initial titration performed during baseline. The trial medication will be administered to subjects only after confirming their eligibility after the initial screening. Subjects withdrawn from the trial retain their identific ation codes (e.g. randomization number, if already given). New subjects must always be allotted a new identification code. 7.6 Randomization PAH patients experiencing oxygen desaturations at rest and during physical activity, when O 2 partial pressure is repea tedly <8 kPa (<60 mmHg; alternatively, 90% of O 2 saturation). Patients will be divided in a supplemental -oxygen group (primary intervention group) and no- supplemental -oxygen group (control group). Patients of the control group will be offered to participat e in the interventional treatment arm after they have terminated the control period (partial cross -over; secondary intervention group). Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization to one of the groups will be performed by block randomizat ion. Randomization lists will be created by the data management using a computer to generate random numbers. 7.7 Labelling and Supply Indication of oxygen supply will be determined according to current recommendations of long term oxygen treatment in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Oxygen treatment with liquid oxygen as applicable will be prescribed to patients of the intervention group. Oxygen flow will be determined by titration, aiming at O2 saturation values of >90% at rest. Patients in the control g roup will be offered prescription of oxygen supply after the end of the control period (control phase), serving as secondary intervention group. 7.8 Supplies and Accountability Oxygen treatment with liquid oxygen as applicable will be prescribed to patients of the intervention group."

Physical examinations will be performed to ensure suitability according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and to document the health status before and following treatment with the IMPs. 8.2.2 Hemodynamic parameters Hemodynamic parameters will be determined by right heart catheterization according to current guidelines (Opitz et al. 2011). The right heart catheterization (RHC) will be performed at baseline only in patients who have not performed a RHC within the preceeding 6 months during Visit 2 and end of the study only to the control group. Directly, invasive measured parameters are: right atrial pressure, mean pulmo nary arterial pressure (mPAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PAWP), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), and venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2). During the right heart catheterization, a continuous ECG will be performed. The values will be based on two to three measurements at one time point. Hemodynamics will be measured at rest and during exercise with a supine bicycle ergometer (all parameters except right atrial pressure, which will be measured at rest and optionally during exercise).

Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnoea of fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. Class II: Patients with PH resulting in slight limitation of physical activi ty. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. Class III: Patients with PH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary act ivity causes undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope."

These patients manifest signs of right heart failure. Dyspnoea and/or fat igue may even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity. 8.2.5 Lung function tests and blood gas analysis Lung function test: Body plethysmography (preferred method) including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in on e second (FEV 1), total lung capacity (TLC), diffusion - limited carbon monoxide (DLCO ), residual volume), normally accounting for about 25% of TLC. Blood gas analysis: capillary or arterial blood gas analysis; partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation (S pO2), pH values, bicarbonates, base excess. If the patient receives oxygen the amount will be recorded in the CRF in liters/minute. 8.2.6 6-minute walking distance and Borg dyspnea Score (CR 10) Both tests will be performed according to ATS guidelines (ATS 2002). The patient is asked to walk along a prescribed path as far as possible during a 6 minute interval of time. The patient may walk at whatever pace he/she feels comfortable with the goal of walking th e most distance he/she feels possible. If the patient feels the need to rest, he/she may do this. Blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation will be measured before and after the test. The test will be performed two times at each time point: one test will be performed without oxygen; one test will be performed with oxygen supply (for all tests with the same amount of oxygen for each patient, which will be determined at baseline by titration). In between tests, the patient should rest for at least 30 m inutes to prevent from interacting effects of oxygen and/or exhaustion. The Borg Scale (Breathlessness Scale) is commonly used to measure shortness of breath of patients or in sports medicine. In this study, the Borg Scale will be applied to record dyspnea immediately following the 6 -minute walk test.

Scoring will be carried out according to the test manual. The SF -36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0 -100 scale, i.e. a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. The eight sections are: vitality; physical functioning; bodily pain; general health perceptions; physical role functioning; emotional role functioning; social role functioning; mental health. 8.2.8 Vital signs Blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation will be measured after the patient has been at rest for at least 5 minutes. Blood pressure (BP; systolic and diastolic) will be measured by means of a standard manual or an automatic blood pressure measuring device (cuff method) . Nevertheless, the same method should be used during the entire study period (the type of device has to be recorded into the CRF). The same upper arm will be used for each measurement of blood pressure, preferably the left arm. Heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SaO 2) will be measured by pulse oximetry. 8.2.9 Electrocardiography A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed. For deriving the 12 -lead ECGs the patients should always be in supine position. The 12 -lead ECGs should be derived after a resti ng period of at least 10 minutes. The investigator will review the ECGs for potential AEs. A continuous 3 -lead ECG monitoring will be applied during right heart catheterization. 8.2.10 Clinical laboratory investigations Clinical laboratory investigations will comprise: Biomarkers NT-proBNP Additional laboratory tests that usually include inflammation factors, kidney, liver, blood cell count parameters All laboratory assessments will be determined locally on -site. 8.3 Study Phases and Visits 8.3.1 Screening Phase Eligible patients will be asked to participate upon written informed consent.

This decision wil l be based on the physician’s and the patient’s estimation. Patient care and monitoring will be performed in the patients’ specialized centers . 9 Adverse Events 9.1 Definitions 9.1.1 Adverse Event According to Good Clinical Practice GCP, an adverse event (AE) is defi ned as follows: Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnor mal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the IMP. An AE may be: - New symptoms/ medical conditions - New diagnosis - Significant changes of laboratory para meters - Intercurrent diseases and accidents - Worsening (change in nature, severity or frequency) of medical conditions/ diseases existing before clinical trial start - Recurrence of disease - Increase of frequency or intensity of episodical diseases. - Events related or possibly related to concomitant medications A pre -existing disease or symptom will not be considered an adverse event unless there will be an untoward change in its intensity, frequency or quality. This change will be documented by an investigat or. Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE. Planned surgical measures permitted by the clinical trial protocol and the cond ition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition leading to the measure was present prior to inclusion into the trial. AEs are classified as ""non -serious"" or ""serious"". 9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that at any dose:"
48,page_48,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 49 - Results in death - Is life -threatening (the term life -threatening refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of event and not to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe) - Requires subjec t hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (unless the admission results in a stay of less than 12 hours or the admission is pre -planned or the admission is not associated with an adverse event) - Results in persistent or significant disab ility/ incapacity or - Is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect. - Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should also usually be considered serious (e.g. treatment at home for alle rgic bronchospasm). The following events don’t need to be reported as an SAE: - Planned hospitalization due to scheduled elective catheterization (e.g. reevaluation for Eurotranplant listing), scheduled hospitalization for further diagnostics or therapeut ic measures. 9.1.3 Expectedness An ‘unexpected’ adverse event is one the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable “Summary of Product Characteristics” (SmPC) or scientific literature. Furthermore, reports which add significant informati on on specificity or severity of a known adverse reaction constitute ‘unexpected’ events. 9.1.4 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) SAEs that are both suspected, i.e. possibly related to IMP and ‘unexpected’, i.e. the nature and/ or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information are to be classified as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs). The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misu se and abuse of the product."
49,page_49,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 50 In case, either the investigator who primarily reported the SAE or the second assessor classify the SAE as ‘suspected’ (i.e. either related or probabl y or possibl y related to the IMP or not assessable ) and the SAE is unexpected it will be categorized as a SUSAR. All SUSARs are subject to an expedited reporting to the responsible ethics committee, the competent higher federal authority, i.e. Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM), and to all participating investigators. 9.1.5 Grading of AEs The grading of an AE should be assessed by the investigator according to the 5 -grade scale defined in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0 established by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the United States of America (USA) as follows: Grade 1: mild AE, temporary event which is tolerated well by the subject Grade 2: moderate AE; event which results in discomfort for the subject and impairs his/ her normal activity Grade 3: severe AE; event which results in substantial impairment of normal activities of subject Grade 4: life-threatening AE or AE causing disablement Grade 5: death related to AE 9.1.6 Relationship and outcome of AEs, action taken The investigator will evaluate e ach AE that occurred after administration of the IMP regarding the coherency with the administration of the investigational medicinal product possibly: related: There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by IMP. A certain event h as a strong temporal relationship and an alternative cause is unlikely. probable: An AE that has a reasonable possibility that the event is likely to have been caused by IMP. The AE has a timely relationship and follows a known pattern of response , but a potential alternative cause may be present. possible: An AE that has a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by IMP. The AE has a timely relationship to the IMP; however, the pattern of response is untypical , and an alternative cause seems more likely, or there is significant uncertainty about the cause of the event. unlikely: Only a remote connection exists between the IMP and the reported adverse event. Other conditions including concurrent illness, progre ssion or expression of the disease state or reaction of the concomitant medication"
50,page_50,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 51 appear to explain the reported adverse event. not related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence related to IMP and is likely to have been produced by t he subject’s clinical state, other modes of therapy or other known etiology. not assessable: There is insufficient or incomplete evidence to make a clinical judgement of the causal relationship. The outcome of an AE at the time of the last observation w ill be classified as: Recovered/ resolved all signs and symptoms of an AE disappeared without any sequels at the time of the last interrogation Recovering/ resolving the intensity of signs and symptoms has been diminishing and/ or their clinical pattern has been changing up to the time of the last interrogation in a way typical for its resolution Not recovered/ not resolved signs and symptoms of an AE are mostly unchanged at the time of the last interrogation Recovered/ resolved with sequel actual signs and symptoms of an AE disappeared but there are sequels related to the AE Fatal resulting in death. If there is more than one adverse event only the adverse event leading to death (possibly related) will be characterized as ‘fatal‘ Unknown the outcome i s unknown or implausible and the information cannot be supplemented or verified The action taken with the IMP will be assigned to one of the following categories: ‘Dose not changed’: no change in the dose of IMP. ‘Dose reduced’: reduction in the dose of IMP. ‘Dose increased’: increase in the dose of IMP. ‘Drug withdrawn’: discontinuation of IMP. ‘Unknown’: the information is unknown or implausible and it cannot be supplemented or verified. ‘Not applicable’: the question is implausible (e.g. the subj ect is dead). The term ‘Countermeasures’ refers to the specific actions taken to treat or alleviate adverse events or to avoid their sequels. The following categories will be used to categorize the countermeasures to adverse events:"
51,page_51,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 52 None: no action taken Drug treatment: newly -prescribed medication or change in dose of a medication Others: other countermeasures, e.g. an operative procedure 9.2 Period of Observation and Documentation All AEs reported by the subject or detected by the investigator, will be collected during the trial and must be documented on the appropriate pages of the CRF. AEs must also be documented in the subject’s medical records. In this trial, all AEs that occur after first administration of the IMP up to the last visit (i.e. follow -up visit) will be documented on the pages provided in the CRF. AEs will be assessed by the investigator using no -leading questions or observed during any visit during the whole study. The patient should be motivated to report any AEs by phone to the investi gator occurring in between study visits. All subjects who have AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the trial medication or not, must be monitored to determine the outcome. The clinical course of the AE will be followed up until resolution or normalization of changed laboratory parameters or until it has changed to a stable condition. Each event should be described in detail along with start and stop dates, severity, relationship to investigational product, action taken and outcome. 9.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events by the Investigator All SAEs must be reported by the investigator to the responsible Safety Officer within 24 hours after the SAE becomes known using the ""Serious Adverse Event"" form. The initial report must be as complete as pos sible, including details of the current illness and (serious) adverse event, information regarding onset, end date, severity, outcome and action taken with the IMP, an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the trial medication . The re porting will be performed by faxing a completed ‘SAE Form’ to the KKS Heidelberg, Fax number: 06221 -56-33725 At the time of the initial report, the investigator will fill in a SAE form comprising the following information: - Patient/subject demographics - Start and end date of treatment with the IMP - Nature of the AE including date of onset, severity and treatment (including hospitalization) - Action taken with respect to the IMP"

Any requested supporting documentation (e.g. ECG, laboratory results, autopsy report) should be sent to the same address stated above. The original SAE -reports and all other reports will be kept by the investigator. 9.4 Expedited Reporting SUSARs are to be r eported to the ethics committee, competent higher federal authority (BfArM), and to all participating investigators within regulative defined timelines, i.e. they are subject to an expedited reporting. All SAE will be subject to a second assessment by a de signated person, who will be independent from the reporting investigator and the trial sponsor. The designated person for the present trial, referred to as second assessor is : Dr. Christian Nagel. The assessor will fill out a ‘Narrative Second Assessment Form’ for each SAE containing at least the following information: i) Assessment of relationship between SAE and IMP; ii) Assessment of expectedness of SAE (derived from SmPC); iii) Assessment of rel ationship between SAE and underlying disease iv) Statement if the benefit/ risk assessment for the trial did change as a result of the SAE. The expedited reporting (to competent authority, responsible ethics committee and investigators) will be carried out by the responsible Safety Officer at KKS Heidelberg. Details concerning the SAE management including the reporting o f SUSARs will be described in the separate document “Safety Manual”. 9.5 Emergency Treatment During and following a subject’s participation i n the trial, the investigator should ensure that adequate medical care is provided to a subject for any AE including clinically significant laboratory values. The investigator should inform a subject when medical care is needed for intercurrent illness(es) of which the investigator becomes aware."

The minimally important difference of 6 -minute walking distance in patients with pulmonary hypertension is considered to be 33 meters, according to the literature (Mathai et al. 2012). A recent study of Ulrich et al. has shown a 25 meter difference between nocturnal oxygen and sham -O2 for an intervention period of one week with a concentrator device in patients with pulmonary hypertension (Ulrich et al. 2015). We assume a standard deviation of the difference of 50 meters (as seen in the data of Ulrich et al.) and a higher effect of 35 meters due to a longer intervention period and the use of oxygen supply ≥16h/day, which lies also above the threshold of minimally important difference for the 6 -minute walking distance. The primary endpoint will be analysed in a hierarchical testing strategy. The main comparison will be the difference in a) intra -individual treatment effect and b) between oxygen arm and no oxygen. The primary endpoint will be the intra -individual analysis of 6MWD in the primary and secondary intervention group (difference from baseline to follow -up). If the primary endpoint is significantly different, the treatment effect on 6MWD will be com pared between the primary intervention group and the control group. In order to cover a possible 20% drop -out rate, we will include 20 patients in each group N= 40 patients in total. The sample size was calculated by means of a two -sided two -sample t -test. Primary efficacy analysis will be performed by an ANCOVA model including baseline scores as covariate, thereby yielding a power advantage over the standard t -test used for sample size calculation. The calculated sample size will thus provide 90% power or more. Sample size assumptions 1. If the true treatment effect is at least an increase of 35 meters in the 6 -minute walking distance with an equal standard deviation of 50 meters, a sample size of 29 patients will provide a >95% power with a matched -pairs two -sided student’s t -test with a significance level of 0.05 (intra -individual comparison of difference baseline to follow -up in primary and secondary intervention group)."
54,page_54,"EudraCT: 2018 -001387 -39 1.2 Version 14.01.2019 SOPHA 55 2. If the true treatment effect is at least a control group corrected increase of 50 meter s in the 6 -minute walking distance with an equal standard deviation of 50 meters, a sample size of 18 patients in each group will provide a 83% power with a two -sided student’s t - test with a significance level of 0.05 comparing two independent means (compa rison of differences baseline to follow -up between the two groups). The sample size of 18 patients in each group with an anticipated dropout rate of 10% leads to a final sample size of 40 (20 in each group). The sample size was calculated by means of a tw o-sided two -sample t -test. Primary efficacy analysis will be performed by an ANCOVA model including baseline scores as covariate, thereby yielding a power advantage over the standard t -test used for sample size calculation. The calculated sample size will thus provide 90% power or more. The primary endpoint, 6 -minute walking distance, will be compared by ANCOVA of the differences (baseline to follow -up) (1) intra-individual and (2) between the two groups with the baseline value as covariate, providing a power-advantage over the student’s t -test which leads to a power of >95% and 83% or more, respectively. 10.2 Analysis Variables Primary Outcome: The primary endpoint will be analysed in a hierarchical testing strategy with 1. Intra -individual analysis of 6MWD in the primary and secondary intervention group (difference from baseline to follow -up) 2. If (1) is significantly different, the treatment effect on 6MWD will be compared between the primary intervention group and the control group. Secondary Outcome V ariables: The following study procedures will be performed in every patient according t o the visits schedule and analyz ed as secondary efficacy variables . The methods for analysis will be the same as for the primary endpoint. Parameters/assessments comprise - quality of life assessed by the SF -36 questionnaire (two main summation scores, eight subscales) - Feasibility of oxygen treatment, assessed by patient consent to participate in the study (recruitment rate) and by patient compliance"

A randomized patient is valid for the intention -to-treat, if he/she had at least one day of oxygen administration . Major protocol deviations are: 1. Patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria 2. Administration of study medication not according to protocol (e.g. compliance less than 80% or greater than 120%) The above specifications of the analysis populations are in accordance with the recommendations given in the ICH -E9 Guideline “Note for guidan ce on statistical principles for clinical trials”."

The per -protocol analysis will be supportive. Primary endpoint The evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint will be the change from baseline to 6 months in the 6 -minutes walking distance in meters . The primary analysis set will be intention to treat set. Cases of missing values, where the patient withdraws or dies will be described and compared to the per -protocol set. The main comparison will be the difference in treatment effect between O2 arm and no O 2 supply arm. 95% confidence intervals of treatment difference will also be calculated.
