STUDY DESIGN This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg administered after each dialysis session. The study includes a Double-blind Phase, an Open- label Exten sion Phase , and a Follow-up Period. Double -blind Phase Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"
7,page_7,"Cara Therapeutics, Inc. Confidenti al Page 8 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2.2 The Double -blind Phase of the study will consist of a Screening Visit, a 7-day Run-in Period and a 12-week Double- blind Treatment Period. Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study- specific procedures. The Screening Visit will occur within 7 to 28 days prior to randomization to assess eligibility. The site has the option to conduct the Screening Visit within the Run-in Period at the discretion of the Investigator. Eligible patien ts will complete a 7 -day Run-in Period during the week prior to randomization to confirm eligibility, preferably starting on the first dialysis session of that week (ie, Monday for patients on a Monday-Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule or Tuesday for patients on a Tuesday -Thursday- Saturday dialysis schedule). The purpose of the Run-in Period is to confirm that each patient has moderate- to-severe pruritus (ie, weekly average worst itch score ≥5), as measured by the patient-daily reported 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS, and to establish a baseline itch intensity. Patients must not be informed that they need to report a weekly average worst itch score ≥5 to be enrolled in the study. During the first visit of th e Run-in Period, patients will be trained on completion of the 24- hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS and will start the reporting of their Worst Itching Intensity NRS daily score. For consistency, patients will be requested to complete the NRS worksheets (either at home or in the dialysis unit, as required) each day at a similar time of day around the normal start time of their dialysis . Patients will be trained on other itch- related patient -reported outcome (PRO) worksheets during the Run-in Period or on Day 1 of the Double-blind Treatment Period. If patients continue to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria at the end of the 7-day Run-in Period, they will be randomized into the Double-blind Treatment Period in a 1:1 ratio to receive either IV CR845 0.5 mcg/kg or placebo. Patients will be stratified according to their use or non-use of concomitant medications to treat their itch during the week prior to randomization (Run- in Period) as well as the presence or absence of specific medical conditions. T hese specific medical conditions include: • History of fall or fracture (related to fall) • Confusional state or mental status change or altered mental status or disorientation • Gait disturbance or movement disorder Day 1 of the Double-blind Treatment Period will be defined as the day of administration of the first dose of study drug and will occur preferably on the first dialysis session of the first treatment week (ie, Monday for patients on a Monday- Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule, or Tuesday for patients on a Tuesday -Thursday-Saturday dialysis schedule). Patients will be administered CR845 or matched placebo as an IV bolus after the end of each dialysis session during the Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

Each patient is to receive CR845 or placebo 3 times weekly for a total of up to 36 doses. During the Double-blind Treatment Period, patients will continue to report their daily Worst Itching Intensity NRS score over the previous 24 hours. In addition, during selected study visits (Day 1 and first day of Weeks 5, 9, 11, and 13 [ ie, Days 29, 57, 71, and 85] ), they will complete other PRO measures (such as Skindex-10 Scale, 5- D Itch Scale, and Patient Global Impression of Change). Patients will be instructed to record patient- reported outcome measurements , including Worst Itching Intensity NRS scores, at a similar time of day, whether in the dialysis unit (on dialysis days) or at home (on non-dialysis days). Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests will be collected at the Screening Visit and on Days 1 and 85. Blood samples for biomarkers will be collected on Days 1 and 85. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be monitored at the Screening Visit and on Day 85. Vital signs will be monitored periodically, and adverse events and concomitant medications w ill be continuously recorded during the Double -blind Phase. Use of antipruritic medications and missed dialysis will be recorded throughout the Double -blind Phase. A Structured Safety Evaluation will be performed once during the Run-in Period and weekly (preferably on Wednesday/Thursday) during the Double-blind Treatment Period. The Structured Safety Evaluation is performed by study staff using a list of specific signs/symptoms (eg, mental status change, falls, gait disturbance). Open -label Extension Phase Patients who received at least 30 doses of study drug (either active or placebo) during the 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period and continue to meet other eligibility criteria will be eligible to receive open-label CR845 for an additional 52 weeks. Each patient will receive CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg after each dialysis session, 3 times per week for up to 52 weeks, regardless of whether they had been previously administered placebo or CR845. Prescription dry body weight wil l be recorded at the start of and every 12 weeks during the Open-label Extension Phase ; if there is a ±10% or more change from the prescription dry body weight recorded at Screening, then the CR845 dose will be adjusted according to the newly recorded dry body weight. The first visit and first dosing for the Open-label Extension Phase of the study will occur immediately on the day of the last visit of the Double-blind Treatment Period or up to 1 week following the Double- blind Treatment Period. Patients will complete the 5 -D Itch Scale during Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 52 (preferably at the end of the specified weeks). Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, adverse events, and concomitant medications will be monitored throughout the Open- label Treatment Period.

Safety Endpoints The safety endpoints used to evaluate the overall safety and tolerabi lity of CR845 will be adverse events, ECG, vital signs, and clinical safety laboratory evaluations. INTERIM ASSESSMENT (Double-blind Phase) Safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Sponsor and a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The operation of the DSMB will be governed by a charter that will describe the group’s meeting frequency, procedures, and requirements for reporting its observations to the Sponsor. The DSMB will not be part of the study team and will receive unblinded safety results on a regular basis. A single interim assessment for sample size re- estimation is planned after approximately 50% of the first 350 randomized patients either complete the 12 -week Double -blind Treatment Period or discontinue study drug prematurely. The interim assessment will be conducted by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Members of the IDMC will not participate in the DSMB and will not be members of the study team.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Analysis Populations The Enrolled Population is defined as the group of patients who sign informed consent. The intent-to-treat (ITT) Population is defined as the group of patients who are randomized to a treatment group. The Double-blind Safety Population is defined as the group of randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug during the Double- blind Treatment Period. Following the intent -to-treat principle, patients in the ITT Population will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment, regardless of the actual treatment received. Patients in the Double-blind Sa fety Analysis Population will be analyzed according to the actual treatment received. The Double-blind Safety Population will be used to analyze all safety endpoints collected during the Double-blind Phase, while the ITT Population will be used to analyze all efficacy endpoints collected during the Double-blind Phase. The Per-Protocol Population is defined as the subset of patients in the ITT Population who do not have any major protocol deviations that could affect the efficacy analyses of the double- blind data. Inclusion in the Per-Protocol Population will be determined prior to unblinding the data and will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan. The Open- label Safety Population is defined as the group of patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug in the Open- label Extension Phase. The Open- label Safety Population will be used to analyze all safety endpoints collected during the Open -label Extension Phase, and during exposure to CR845 combining data from both the Double-blind and the Open- label Extension Phases. Safety Analyses Safety data will be summarized descriptively. No inferential statistics are planned. Analyses of safety data will include summaries of treatment-emergent adverse events including Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), serious adverse events, and adverse events resulting in study drug discontinuation. Vital signs, chemistry and hematology data, and ECG data will be presented by visit as applicable, in addition to change from baseline. Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

Confidenti al Page 13 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2.2 Efficacy Analyses (Double -blind Treatment Period) All efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT Population. An analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy variables for the Per - Protocol Population will also be performed. Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the proportion of patients achieving at least a 3 -point improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score at Week 12 (Days 79 -85) of the Double- blind Treatment Period. The weekly mean of the 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score will be defined as the sum of the daily Worst Itching Intensity NRS score reported during a specific week during the Double-blind Treatment Period (eg, Days 2 to 8, Days 9 to 15, Days 16 to 22, … Days 79 to 85) divided by the number of days with non- missing scores for that week. If the daily worst itching score is missing for >3 days during a specific week, the corresponding weekly mean worst itching score will be set to missing. The baseline score will be defined as t he average of the daily 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS scores collected over the Run-in Period, including pre-randomization assessments collected on Day 1. In the primary efficacy analysis, missing NRS data will be imputed using a multiple imputation (MI) approach, assuming that patients who discontinue double -blind treatment early would have similar Worst Itching Intensity NRS scores as other patients in their respective treatment arm that have complete data: • Intermittent missing NRS scores will first be imputed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented with the SAS MI procedure, which is appropriate for non-monotonic missing data. • NRS scores missing after patients discontinue study drug ear ly will then be multiply imputed with the SAS MI procedure using a method appropriate for monotone missingness (eg, regression statement). • The proportion of patients who have an improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score ≥ 3 points will be calculated for each imputed dataset. Differences between CR845 0.5 mcg/kg and placebo with respect to the primary endpoint will be compared using a logistic regression model containing terms for treatm ent group, baseline NRS score, use of prior anti-itch medication, presence of specific medical conditions, and country /region. • Results of the logistic regression on the multiply imputed data sets will be summarized by the SAS MIANALYZE procedure.

13,page_13,"Cara Therapeutics, Inc. Confidenti al Page 14 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2.2 Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted to evaluate the robustness of study results under different assumptions and imputation algorithms (Section 8.7.1). Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The proportion of patients achieving ≥4-point improvement from baseline at Week 12 of the Double- blind Treatment Period, t he proportion of patients achieving ≥3 -point improvement from baseline at Week 8 and Week 4, and the proportion of patients achieving ≥4- point improvement from baseline at Week 8 and Week 4 with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS will be analyzed following a similar methodology to the one employed in the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. The Skindex- 10 Scale total score and the 5 -D Itch Scale total score change from baseline at Week 12 will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that contain s treatment as fixed effect , with baseline score, region, and the randomization s tratification variables as covariates. For each domain in each questionnaire, missing values at Week 12 will be imputed using a MI approach, assuming that patients who discontinue double -blind treatment early would have similar domain scores as other pati ents in their respective treatment arm that have complete data: • Intermittent missing scores will first be imputed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented with the SAS MI procedure, which is appropriate for non- monotonic missing data. • The monotone missing values will then be multiply imputed with the SAS MI procedure using the monotone regression method. It is important to note that, in HD patients, the study drug administered during the last dialysis of a particular week is not cleared until the first dialysis of the next week. Therefore, measurements that would reflect treatment effect at the end of a specific week (eg. Week 4) will actually be collected during the first day of the next week (eg. Week 5). Hypothesis Testing Stra tegy Testing of the primary efficacy endpoint will be 2-sided and conducted at the 5% error level. The study will be considered positive if the null hypothesis of no treatment difference in the primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint (proportion of patients with a ≥3 -point improvement from baseline at Week 12 of the Double- blind Treatment Period with respect to the Worst Itching Intensity NRS) is rejected in favor of the alternative that patients randomized to CR845 experience significantly less itching compared to patients randomized to placebo.

14,page_14,"Cara Therapeutics, Inc. Confidenti al Page 15 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2.2 To protect the Type 1 error, a gate -keeping strategy will be implemented. Although the p-values corresponding to the hypothesis testing of the secondary variables will be reported, they will only be considered inferential if the primary analysis is statistically significant. Testing of the secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed sequentially at a 2 -sided 5% error level in the order specified below. If the test of an endpoint in the sequence is not statistically significant, the p-value for the tests corresponding to the remaining endpoints in the sequence will not be considered inferential and the null hypotheses for the subsequent tests will not be rejected. 1.

Confidenti al Page 22 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2.2 4.0 Introduction 4.1 Background and Rationale CR845 is a kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist with a peripheral mechanism of action being developed by Cara Therapeutics, Inc. (designated as Cara Therapeutics or Sponsor in this protocol) as a novel therapeutic agent for the symptomatic relief of acute and chronic pain and pruritus. Opioid receptors are involved in the modulation of itch and pain signals and consist of 3 subtypes: mu, kappa, and delta. These receptor subtypes are found in the central nervous system (CNS), in peripheral nervous system tissues, such as skin and viscera, and in the imm une system (see Investigator’s Brochure for references and further details). CR845 was designed to only activate KORs located primarily in the peripheral nervous system, which are known to modulate itch, pain, and inflammatory signals, without producing t he side effects associated with the activation of mu -opioid receptors, such as respiratory depression, abuse liability, and constipation. CR845 is a potent and selective KOR agonist with no activity at mu- and delta-opioid receptors or other receptors, ion channels, or transporters. CR845’s unique peptidic structure significantly differs from other small molecule KOR agonists developed to date, which, for the most part, are CNS-active. Being a hydrophilic peptide, CR845 has limited membrane permeability b y passive diffusion, which limits its access to the CNS. Since CR845 does not activate receptors other than KORs and does not readily enter the CNS, it is expected to be safer and better tolerated than other opioid agonists, including CNS active kappa agonists. Thus far, CR845 has shown no abuse properties and no respiratory depression effects (see Investigator’s Brochure for details). Uremic pruritus is a chronic, unremitting, and highly bothersome condition in patients with chronic kidney disease that adversely affects sleep, mood, and ability to socialize [Kumagai 2010]. Patients with uremic pruritus frequently exhibit considerable mechanical skin damage because of continuous scratching with excoriations, superimposed infections, and chronic lesions of prurigo nodularis or skin lichenification often occurring. The mechanical skin damage can become an additional source of itching. Consequently, these patients are at increased risk of related morbidities associated with infection, eg, cellulitis, sepsis, bacteremia, cutaneous infections, and infections of the dialysis access, and are at higher mortality risk (>15%) [Pisoni 2006; Narita 2006] . Large multinational studies (Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns) and studies based in the United States have demonstrated that approximately 30 to 40% of hemodialysis patients have moderate- to-severe pruritus. There are no approved treatments for this condition in the United States and current off- label therapies are unable to successfully treat uremic pruritus . Although the pathophysiology of moderate- to-severe pruritus in hemodialysis patients is not well understood, there is increasing evidence that it is likely multifactorial and that an Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"
22,page_22,"Cara Therapeutics, Inc. Confidenti al Page 23 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2.2 immune system dysfunction (including elevated proinflammatory activity) and imbalance in the endogenous opioid system (with over-expression of mu-opioid recep tors in dermal cells and lymphocytes and concomitant downregulation of KORs ) are involved [Kimmel 2006; Narita 2006 ; Phan 2012; Patel 2007; Mettang 2002; Tey 2011]. In nonclinical studies, CR845 has been shown to exhibit antipruritic and anti-inflammatory properties [ Investigator’s Brochure ]. Thus, CR845 is intended to reduce the severity of itching in hemodialysis patients and thereby decrease the likelihood of developing additional serious conditions associated with uremic pruritus. 4.2 Clinical Experience 4.2.1 Overall Exposure As of the writing of this protocol, the intravenous (IV) formulation of CR845 has been evaluated in 722 patients and healthy volunteers across eight Phase 1 studies (including 2 studies conducted in Japan), three Phase 2 studies for the r elief of moderate- to-severe, acute postoperative pain, and two Phase 2 studies for the relief of moderate- to-severe pruritus in hemodialysis patients. In the United States, CR845 has been evaluated both as an IV bolus and a 15-minute infusion of single or repeated doses ranging from 0.5 to 40 mcg/kg. Of the patients exposed to IV CR845 to date, 213 hemodialysis patients (127 males and 86 females) have received single or repeated IV injections of CR845 doses (for up to 8 weeks) ranging from 0.5 to 6 mcg/kg across two Phase 1 studies and two Phase 2 safety and efficacy studies. 4.2.2 Safety in Hemodialysis Patients A review of the aggregate safety data shows that CR845 was generally well tolerated in hemodialysis patients when administered after each dialysis session for up to 8 weeks at IV doses ranging from 0.5 mcg/kg to 6 mcg/kg. Although patients exposed to CR845 reported more adverse events compared with placebo patients, most events were mild or moderate in nature. Generally mild, transient paresthesias (facial tingling) and/or hypoesthesias (in different anatomic locations), mostly on the first week of dosing, as well as headache, dizziness, and somnolence, were the most frequently reported adverse events associated with CR845 administration. Of note, side effects (eg, dysphoria and hallucinations) commonly associated with centrally -acting kappa opioids were not reported in patients exposed to CR845. Consistent with its lack of affinity for mu-opioid receptors, CR845 did not cause euphoria or respiratory depression. CR845-CLIN2101 evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of repeated IV doses of CR845 compared to placebo over an 8-week treatment period in 174 hemodialysis patients. As expected with patients on hemodialysis, a significant number of the reported serious adverse events (SAEs) were considered not treatment- related, but related to the disease and/or comorbid conditions. There were 31 (17.8%) of Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"
23,page_23,"Cara Therapeutics, Inc. Confidenti al Page 24 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2.2 174 patients randomized and treated in the study who had treatment- emergent SAEs. Of the 31 SAE reports, 4 (9%) occurred in 45 placebo -treated patients and 27 (21%) in 129 CR845-treated patients. Only 1 SAE of mental status changes (moderate in severity) in a patient who received CR845 1.5 mcg/kg IV was considered by the Investigator to be probably related to study drug. However, based on the Sponsor’s medical review, an alternate etiology of urgent/emergent hypertension offers a more plausible explanation for the acute change in mental status. There were 4 patient deaths ( 1 in placebo group, 1 in CR845 0.5 mcg/kg group, and 2 in CR845 1.5 mcg/kg group; 2.3% of the total study population) in the study, all of which were considered not related to the study drug. In patients with normal renal function, CR845 can cause free- water diuresis (aquaresis) and increased serum sodium. However, as would be expected in patients undergoing dialysis in whom there are few functioning nephrons, there was no evidence of aquaresi s or significant increases in serum sodium concentrations. There were no adverse trends in clinical chemistry or hematology values (drawn pre-dialysis), including no apparent differences between the placebo and CR845 groups in serum sodium. There were no discernable differences between treatment groups in vital sign results. Of particular note, among patients receiving CR845, there was no apparent reduction in blood pressure or respiratory rate following dosing. Adverse event summary tables can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure , with further details of the safety profile of CR845. 4.2.3 Efficacy of CR845 in Hemodialysis Patients with Uremic Pruritus The efficacy of CR845 in uremic pruritus was evaluated in two Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (CR845-CLIN2005 [Part B] and CR845-CLIN2101). CR845-CLIN2005 (Part B) included 65 hemodialysis patients with moderate -to-severe uremic pruritus who received either IV CR845 1.0 mcg/kg (n=33) or placebo (n=32) 3 times per week for 2 weeks, after each hemodialysis session . CR845 significantly decreased itching intensity compared with placebo (p=0.016), as measured by a visual analog scale (VAS) and significantly improved quality of life related to itching (Skindex- 10 Scale) (see Investigat or’s Brochure for details). Furthermore, CR845-treated patients exhibited statistically significant reductions in both daytime (p=0.03) and nighttime (p=0.007) worst itching scores compared with placebo, and the reduction in itching intensity scores was s imilar on dialysis and nondialysis days. The mean change from baseline VAS curves over time showed numerical separation between the treatment groups within the first week of treatment. CR845-CLIN2101 evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of repeated IV doses of CR845 compared to placebo over an 8-week treatment period in 174 hemodialysis patients experiencing moderate -to-severe uremic pruritus daily or near-daily for 4.4 years on average. The study was conducted at 33 dialysis centers and assessed the effect of 3 doses of CR845 (ie, 0.5 mcg/kg, n=44; 1 mcg/kg, n=41 and Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

Confidenti al Page 25 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2.2 1.5 mcg/kg, n=44) or placebo (n=45) administered at the end of each dialysis session (ie, 3 times/week). The primary efficacy endpoint for Study CR845-CLIN2101 was based on i tch intensity measurement and defined as the change from a 1 -week baseline recorded prior to the start of study drug to the last week of the 8-week treatment period with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity numerical rating scale (NRS) score. The least squares (LS) mean (±standard error [SE]) treatment group difference from placebo at Week 8 across all CR845 doses was -1.3 (±0.41) (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.1 to -0.5) (p=0.002) with an average NRS score reduction from baseline of -3.2 (±0.22) (LS mean ±SE) and 95% CI ranging from -3.7 to -2.8. Examination of the individual CR845 dose group results for the Full Analysis Population indicates that a substantial improvement over placebo was observed with all 3 doses. These differences from placebo were statistically significant for the lower dose group of 0.5 mcg/kg (p<0.001) and the 1.5 mcg/kg group (p=0.019), with an effect size estimated as 0.82, 0.39, and 0.62 for the 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mcg/kg doses, respectively. Average reduction from baseline (LS mean ± SE) ranged from -2.8 (±0.38) in the 1.0 mcg/kg dose group (95% CI ranging from -3.5 to -2.0) to -3.8 (±0.38) in the 0.5 mcg/kg dose group (95% CI ranging from -4.5 to -3.1). 4.2.4 Pharmacokinetics in Hemodialysis Pat ients CR845 is eliminated primarily through the kidney and no major metabolites have been identified in humans. Consequently, total body clearance of CR845 in patients with severe renal impairment is reduced relative to healthy, matched, control patients (CR845-CLIN1005) such that plasma levels of CR845 remain relatively constant until cleared during dialysis in hemodialysis patients (CR845- CLIN1003 and CR845-CLIN2005 [Part A]). Half-life ranges between 26 and 34 hours in hemodialysis patients compared to a typical range of 2 to 3 hours in patients with normal renal function. Thus, lower doses of CR845 can be administered at a less frequent interval in hemodialysis patients to achieve the same or higher overall exposure compared to individuals with normal renal function. Based on this pharmacokinetic profile, CR845 does not need to be administered more than 3 times a week after each hemodialysis session, which is convenient for this patient population and ensures treatment compliance in a population already burdened with complex medication schedules. The pharmacokinetic profile of repeat -dose CR845 was studied in 24 hemodialysis patients who received doses of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mcg/kg 3 times per week for 1 week (CR845-CLIN2005 [Part A]). In this study, th ere were dose-proportional increases in maximum concentration and area under the curve, and minimal to no accumulation with repeat doses due to clearance of the drug by hemodialysis (see Investigator’s Brochure for details). 4.3 Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits During preclinical development, no specific safety findings to preclude the use of CR845 in humans were observed.

Confidenti al Page 26 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2.2 administered to healthy volunteers; patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, including end- stage renal disease (ESRD) and hemodialysis patients; recreational poly -drug users; and postsurgical patients. The effects of CR845 have been shown to be in line with the underlying pharmacological mechanism of KOR activity. Consistent with the nonclinical abuse liability studies conducted to date, the results of an abuse-potential study in humans indicated that CR845 appears to present a low risk for abuse potential in humans in comparison to currently clinically used opioids. Overall, tingling/numbness, dizziness, fatigue and/or drowsiness/somnolence have been the most common adverse events. Precaution is recommended in the operation of machinery for patients who experience dizziness, fatigue, and/or drowsiness/somnolence. This is described in the informed consent form (ICF), as appropriate, and will be discussed with each patient prior to initiation of the study. In general, CR845 appeared to be generally well tolerated in both single - and repeat -dose clinical studies in hemodialysis patients, which support continued study and development of this compound.

The study includes a Double-blind Phase and an Open- label Extensi on Phase. CR845 will be evaluated relative to placebo over a 12- week Double -blind Treatment Period in hemodialysis patients with moderate -to-severe pruritus. At the end of the Double-blind Treatment Period, patients who received at least 30 doses of stud y drug during the 12-week Double- blind Treatment Period will be eligible to receive open -label CR845 for an additional 52 weeks . A follow-up visit will be conducted 7- 10 days after the last study visit on treatment or after early termination. 6.1.1 Double -blind Phase The Double-blind Phase of the study will consist of a Screening Visit, a 7 -day Run-in Period, and a 12 -week Double-blind Treatment Period. Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study- specific procedures. The Screening Visit wi ll occur within 7 to 28 days prior to randomization in order to assess eligibility. The Screening Visit can be conducted during the Run -in Period at the discretion of the Investigator. 6.1.1.1 Screening Visit During the Screening Visit, patients will sign the Informed Consent, and will be evaluated for eligibility by assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria, medical history, physical examination, prescription dry body weight, pre-dialysis 12- lead electrocardiogram, pre- dialysis vital s igns, pre- dialysis hematology and serum chemistry, adverse events, and prior medications. Serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential must be performed within 7 days prior to the first study dose. During Screening and before the first visit of the Run-in Period, patients will be trained on completion of the 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS scale. Patients may also be trained on other patient-reported outcome (PRO) worksheets during Screening (ie, Skindex-10 scale, 5 -D itch scale and PGIC ). 6.1.1.2 Run-in Period Eligible patients will complete a 7 -day Run-in Period during the week prior to randomization to confirm eligibility, preferably starting on the first dialysis session of that week (ie, Monday for patients on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday dialysis schedule or Tuesday for patients on a Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday dialysis schedule). The purpose of the Run-in Period will be to confirm that each patient has moderate- to-severe pruritus (ie, weekly average score ≥5), as measured by the 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS, Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

Th ese criteria for eligibility should not be communicated to the patients. This period will also be used to record each patient’ s use of itch medications. During the first visit of the Run-in Period, patients will start the reporting of their Worst Itching Intensity NRS daily score. P atients may continue to be trained on PRO worksheets during the Run-in Period. For consistency, patients will be requested to complete the NRS worksheets (either at home or in the dialysis unit, as required) at a similar time of day around the normal start time of their dialysis. A Structured Safety Evaluation will be performed during the Run-in Period (preferably on Wednesday/Thursday). The Structured Safety Evaluation is performed by study staff using a list of specific signs/symptoms (eg, mental status change, falls, gait disturbance). 6.1.1.3 Double -blind Treatment Period If patients continue to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria at the end of the 7- day Run-in Period, they will be randomized into the Double-blind Treatment Period in a 1:1 ratio to receive either IV CR845 0.5 mcg/kg or placebo. Patients will be stratified according to their use or non- use of concomitant medications to treat their itch as well as the presence or absence of specific medical conditions. Day 1 of the Double-blind Treatment Period will be defined as the day of administration of the first do se of study drug and will occur preferably on the first dialysis day of the first treatment week (ie, Monday for patients on a Monday- Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule or Tuesday for patients on a Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday dialysis schedule). Patients w ill be administered CR845 or matched placebo as an IV bolus after the end of each dialysis session during the 12-week Double- blind Treatment Period so that each patient will receive CR845 or placebo 3 times weekly for a total of up to 36 doses. During the Double-blind Treatment Period, patients will continue to report their Worst Itching Intensity NRS score on a daily basis, covering the previous 24 hours. In addition, during selected study visits (Day 1 and first day of Weeks 5, 9, 11, and 13 [ie, Days 29, 57, 71, and 85]) , they will complete other PRO measures ( such as Skindex-10 Scale, 5 -D Itch Scale, and Patient Global Impression of Change). Patients will be instructed to record patient -reported outcome measurements, including Worst Itching Intensity NRS scores, at a similar time of day, whether in the dialysis unit (on dialysis days) or at home (on non-dialysis days). Blood samples for inflammatory biomarkers will be collected for all randomized patients prior to dialysis on Day 1 and prior to the last dialysis at the End -of-Treatment Visit for the Double-blind Treatment Period (Day 85).

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be monitored at the Screening Visit and Day 85 or Early Termination Visit. The number and reason(s) for missed dialysis as well as the use of antipruritic medications will be recorded throughout the study. A Structured Safety Evaluation will be performed weekly (preferably on Wednesday/Thursday) during the Double-blind Treatment Period. The Structured Safety Evaluation is performed by study staff using a list of specific signs/symptoms (eg, mental status change, falls, gait disturbance). 6.1.2 Open -label Extension Phase Patients who received at least 30 doses of study drug (either placebo or active) during the 12-week Double -blind Treatment Period and continue to meet other eligibility criteria will be eligible to receive open-label CR845 for an additional 52 weeks. The Open -label Extension Phase will be comprised of the Open- label Treatment Period and the Follow - up Period. The first visit and first dosing for the Open -label Extension Phase of the study will occur immediately on the day of the last visit of the Double-blind Treatment Period or up to 1 week following the Double- blind Treatment Period . Each patient will receive CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg after each dialysis session, 3 times per week for up to 52 weeks, whether they had been previously administered placebo or CR845. Prescription dry body weight will be recorded at the start of and every 12 weeks during the Open- label Extension Phase; if there is a ±10% or more change from the prescription dry body weight record ed at Screening, then the CR845 dose will be adjusted according to the newly recorded dry body weight. Patients will complete the 5 -D Itch Scale during Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 52 (preferably at the end of the specified weeks). Clinical laboratory tests , vital signs, adverse events, and concomitant medications will be monitored throughout the Open- label Treatment Period. Blood samples for inflammatory biomarkers will be collected periodically until the End -of-Treatment or Early Termination Visit. An electrocardiogram will be performed at the End-of-Treatment or Early Termination Visit. The number and reason(s) for missed dialysis and the use of antipruritic medications will be recorded throughout the Open- label Extension P hase.

Any patient who becomes pregnant during treatment must be withdrawn from the study (see Section 6.5.4.7). Whenever possible, withdrawal of a patient from study drug by the Investigator should be discussed with the Medical Monitor before the patient stops study drug. If study drug is discontinued, regardless of the reason, an Early Termination Visit should be completed at the first dialysis after the last dose of study drug or, if not feasible during that timeframe, as soon as feasible. If at all possible, a Follow-up Visit is to be completed 7-10 days after the Early Termination Visit. A patient may withdraw consent from continued participation in the study at any time. Although a patient will not be obliged to give a reason for withdrawing prematurely, the Investigator must make a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while fully respecting the patient’s rights. The reason(s) for termination and date of stopping study drug must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF) and source documents. If a patient discontinues early due to an adverse event, the event will be followed until resolution, the patient returns to baseline status, the condition stabilizes, or the patient is lost to follow -up. A patient will be considered lost to follow -up when no response is received from the patient after at least 3 documented attempts to contact the patient over a minimum time of 2 weeks by the study site. If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. Patients who discontinue after the administration of the first dose of study drug will not be replaced. 6.3.2 Discontinuation or Suspension of Entire Study The Sponsor may suspend or terminate the study or part of the study at any time for any reason. Reasons may include the following, among others: 1. Investigators have not been able to enroll patients within a reasonable period of time or according to inclusi on/exclusion criteria; 2. The target number of subjects required for the study is enrolled earlier than expected; 3. Unexpected safety concern. If the study is suspended or terminated, the Sponsor will ensure that applicable regulatory agencies and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) are notified, as appropriate.

Patients will receive IV CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg or placebo after each dialysis session, generally 3 times per week for up to 64 weeks (ie, 12 weeks double-blind and 52 weeks open -label) as an IV bolus into the venous line of the dialysis circuit at the end of each dialysis session and may be given either during or after rinse back of the dialysis circuit. If the dose is given after rinse back, following the IV push of study drug the venous line must be flushed with at least 10 mL of normal saline. If the dose is given during rinse back, no additional normal saline is needed to flush the line. If a patient receives additional dialysis during a given week for any reason, an additional dose of CR845 or placebo will be administered following dialysis. A maximum of 4 doses per week is allowed. No additional doses will be given for patients receiving an additional unscheduled ultrafiltration treatment. The patient’s prescription dry body weight (ie, the target post- dialysis weight, as determined by the patient ’s nephrologist or dialysis unit during screening) will be used to calculate the dose of the study drug to be administered throughout the Double-blind Treatment Period. During the Open- label Extension Phase, the patient’s current prescription target dry body weight should be compared to the screening dry body weight. If the difference is less than ±10%, then continue dosing based on the patient’s dry body weight recorded at screening. If the difference is ±10% or more, use the patient’s newly recorded dry body weight to calculate the volume of CR845 to be administered. Dosing will be adjusted every 12 - weeks if prescription dry body weight changes by ±10% or more from dry body weight recorded at screening . 6.4.2 Iden tity of Investigational Product(s) 6.4.2.1 Formulation of Study Drug Study drug will be supplied by the Sponsor as a solution in 2- mL glass vials containing a minimum extractable volume of 1.3 mL of CR845 at a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL in Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

These specific medical conditions include: • History of fall or fracture (related to fall) • Confusional state or mental status change or altered mental status or disorientation • Gait disturbance or movement disorder All eligible patients will receive CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg starting on Day 1 of the Open-label Extension Phase. 6.4.5 Preparation of CR845 In the Double-blind Phase of the study, a single vial of study drug will be used for each patient. Each patient’s prescription dry body weight will not exceed 135.0 kg. In the Open-label Extension Phase of the study, 1 vial of CR845 will be used for patients with a prescription dry body weight ≤135.0 kg. For patients with a prescription dry body weight >135.0 kg, 2 vials of CR845 will be used to ensure that the full volume of study drug can be prepared. Further details will be provided in the ISF. Information on the study drug preparation can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 6.4.6 Managem ent of Missed Doses If a patient misses a dialysis visit and the planned dose of CR845 for that visit, dosing should resume at the next dialysis visit. Contact the Medical Monitor if patient compliance or safety is of concern. 6.4.7 Treatment Compliance Patient compliance with study drug is documented as part of standard procedures at the dialysis units where study drug is administered. 6.4.8 Blinding During the Double-blind Treatment Period, patients, Investigators, study staff, and the Sponsor will be blinded to study drug assignment. For medically urgent or emergent situations that necessitate knowledge of study drug assignment for patient management, the blind may be broken via the IVRS/IWRS. Except for when patient’s care requires the treatment assignment immediately, the Medical Monitor should be contacted prior to breaking the blind.

All questionnaires must be completed in strict adherence to the Training Manual for Patient Reported Assessments. 6.5.3.1 Worst Itching Intensity Numerical Rating Scale Intensity of itch will be measured using an NRS scale ( Appendix 2, Section 14.2) on a worksheet on which patients will be asked to indicate the intensity of the worst itching they experienced over the past 24 hours by marking one of 11 numbers, from 0 to 10, that best describes it, where “0” is labeled with the anchor phrase “no itching” and “10” is labeled “worst itching imaginable.” Patients will be provided with these worksheets to record their 24 -hour worst itching assessment scores, both at the clinic on dialysis da ys and at home on nondialysis days. The Worst Itching Intensity NRS has been widely utilized for evaluation of chronic itch, including uremic pruritus [ Kumagai 2010; Pisoni 2006; Mathur 2010; Ständer 2013]. 6.5.3.2 Skindex -10 Scale Developed specifically for uremic pruritus, the Skindex-10 Scale ( Appendix 3, Section 14.3) is an instrument for measurement of quality-of- life that correlates with itch intensity [Mathur 2010]. Patients are asked to mark 1 of 7 boxes numbered from 0 (labeled with the anchor phrase “never bothered”) to 6 (labeled as “always bothered”) for each of the 10 questions describing how often they have been bothered by their itch and its impact over the past week. The total score is the sum of the numeric value of each answered question. The total score is subdivided into 3 domain scores, which are sums of the scores of the following questions: disease domain (questions 1 to 3), mood/emotional distress domain (questions 4 to 6), and social functioning domain (questions 7 to 10). 6.5.3.3 5-D Itch Scale The 5-D Itch Scale was developed as a brief, multidimensional questionnaire designed to be useful as an outcome measure in clinical studies. The 5 dimensions of itch assessed are degree, duration, direction, disability, and distribution ( Appendix 4, Section 14.4). Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

Confidential Page 51 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2. 2 Patients are asked to mark boxes that best describe the impact of their itch over the past 2 weeks. The scale has been validated in patients with chronic pruritus, including hemodialysis patients and has been shown to be sensitive to changes in pruritus over time [Elman 2010]. 6.5.3.4 Patient Global Impression of Change The Patient Global Impression of Change is a global PRO measure that assesses the change in itch (no change, improvement or worsening) overall relative to the start of the study [Dworkin 2005]. The scale has only 1 item , and the patient is asked to mark the category that best describes the change in itch ranging from “Very Much Improved” to “Very Much Worse” ( Appendix 5, Section 14.5). 6.5.4 Safety Assessments During both the Double-blind and Open- label Extension Phase s, the safety assessments for each patient are the following: • Severity, seriousness, and relationship of adverse events to study drug • Structured Safety Evaluation by site staff (Double-blind Phase only) • Physical examination • Vital signs • 12-lead ECGs • Clinical laboratory tests 6.5.4.1 Adverse Events Definition of Adverse Event s An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. In this study, adverse events will be captured from the time a patie nt signs the ICF to the Follow-up Visit and include the following: • Any new sign, symptom, or disease; • Any new clinically significant or symptomatic laboratory/diagnostic test abnormality; • Any clinically significant worsening of laboratory/diagnostic test abnormality; Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"
51,page_51,"Cara Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Page 52 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2. 2 • Any worsening (ie, clinically significant change in frequency, nature, and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition. A pre-existing condition is a condition that is present prior to signing the ICF for the study. Pre-existing conditions, such as illnesses, symptoms, reactions, progression of disease states, and other comorbidities, as well as laboratory/diagnostic test abnormalities, will be documented in the patient’s record as medical history. Signs and symptoms will be reported individual ly as adverse events (non -serious), unless a medical diagnosis was provided. Medical diagnosis, whenever provided, will be reported rather than individual signs and symptoms. Any adverse event that satisfies any of the seriousness criteria described below will be reported as an SAE using the SAE Report Form, in addition to documenting in the eCRF. Serious adverse events that occurred up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug need to be documented on an SAE Report Form if they are deemed by the Investigator to be “Related” to study drug. An SAE that occurred after a period of 30 days from the last dose of study drug must be reported when the investigator becomes aware of it and if there is a possible relationship to the study drug or the conduct of the study. Adverse Event Severity Assessment The Investigator will assess the severity (ie, intensity) of each adverse event (serious and non-serious) reported during the study based on his/her clinical judgment. The severity of each adverse event will be assigned to one of the following categories: Mild : Transient, requires no special treatment, is easily tolerated by the patient, causes minimal discomfort, and does not interfe re with the patient’s daily activities Moderate : Introduces a level of inconvenience or concern to the patient that may interfere with daily activities, but usually is ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures Severe : Interrupts a patient’s usual daily activity and requires systemic drug therapy or other treatment Definition of Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: • Results in death; • Is life-threatening; NOTE: The term ""life -threatening"" in the definition of ""serious"" refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These are usually considered serious. Severe versus Serious Adverse Event The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). An adverse event as well as an SAE must be assessed for severity. An adverse event that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. “ Severity” is not the same as “Serious,” which is based on patient outcome or reaction criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory repor ting obligations. Adverse Event Causality or Relatedness to the Study Drug Every effort should be made by the Investigator to explain each adverse event and assess its relationship, if any, to study drug. The Investigator should consider many factors, including, but not limited to, temporal association of the event and date/time of study drug, duration of study drug, medical/biologic plausibility, pharmacology and adverse event profile of study drug, medical history (past medical history, underlying diseas e, comorbidities, intercurrent illness), concomitant medications, medical judgment, dechallenge, rechallenge, drug interaction, other plausible causes, etc., to determine the causality assessment of an event. The Investigator as well as the Sponsor will determine adverse event/SAE causality as ‘Related’ or ‘Not Related’ to study drug. Although there is no international consensus on how to define ‘Related’ and ‘Not Related,’ in general, an event is considered ‘Related’ if there is reasonable possibility that the event is related to study drug rather than to any other possible cause(s). Conversely, an event is considered ‘Not Related’ if there is reasonable possibility that the event is related to other factors than the study drug. Adverse Event Documentat ion and Follow- up All adverse events, including observed, elicited, or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms are to be recorded on the adverse event page in the patient’s eCRF from the Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

The need to capture this information is not dependent upon whether adverse events are related to study drug. Serious adverse events that occurred up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug need to be documented on an SAE Report Form if they are deemed by the Investigator to be “Related” to study drug. Each adverse event is to be documented with a verbatim/reported term, start and stop date and time, severity, causal relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, and outcome (resolved, resolved with sequelae, resolving, fatal, unknown). The Investigator must review new adverse events and the outcome of ongoing adverse events frequently throughout the study. In addition to recording all adverse events (serious and non- serious) in the patient’s eCRF, all SAEs must also be documented on the SAE Report Form for the study. The Investigator will follow all adverse events until they resolve, the Investigator assesses them to be stable, or the patient’s participation in the study ends, whichever comes first. In addition, the Investigator will follow all adverse events assessed as related to study drug that are ongoing at the time of the patient’s last visit, until they resolve or the Investigator assesses them as stable, even if the patient's participation in the study has ended. Resolution of such events is to be documented in the patient’s record as appropriate. It is anticipated that some patients may underg o procedures and/or experience events that are common in the study population under investigation, independent of study therapy. Preplanned procedures and procedures (eg, kidney transplant, catheter replacement) or events that are independent of study therapy, according to the Investigator’s assessment, will be documented as specified in the Safety Management Plan. Serious Adverse Event Notification, Documentation, and Reporting The Investigator will report an SAE within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. An SAE Report Form will be completed regardless of relationship to the study drug. The initial report will not be delayed in order to obtain additional information. Any additional information will be reported as a follow-up to the initial report within 24 hours of collection. Details for reporting and follow-up of SAEs are provided in the ISF. In the event of any SAE (other than death) occurring after the last dose of study drug and prior to the Follow- up Visit, the patient will be instructed to contact the Investigator or designee immediately using the instructions provided on the ICF. The Medical Monitor will review reported SAEs and may contact the Investigator directly for further information. Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

It is the responsibility of the Sponsor or designee to send all regulatory reports to the appropriate regulatory authorities . Adverse events that are serious, related to the study drug, and unexpected (per the Investigator’s Brochure) will be reported to the regulatory authorities as specified in the Safety Management Plan. For regulatory reporting purposes, the Sponsor can upgrade the Investigator’s assessment (eg, from not related to related); however, Sponsor cannot downgrade the Investigator’s assessment unless the Investigator determines that a re -assessment of causality is necessary. The Medical Monitor will review and comment on any upgrade made to a report. If there is any doubt concerning the relationship between study drug and the event, then the relationship should be considered to be related to study drug. As applicable, the Sponsor will also notify other participa ting Investigator(s) of all IND Safety Reports to ensure prompt notification of significant new adverse events or risks with respect to study drug. This notification will occur as soon as possible and in compliance with country- specific regulations. Refer to the Safety Management Plan for further details about SAE reporting and processing. The Medical Monitor should be contacted by study sites requiring additional clarification on an SAE. 6.5.4.2 Structured Safety Evaluation A weekly Structured Safety Evaluation will also be used during the Double-Blind Phase to proactively identify and monitor adverse events of special interest. The Structured Safety Evaluation will be performed once during the Run-in Period and weekly (preferably on Wednesday/Thursday) during the Double- blind Treatment Period . The Structured Safety Evaluation will be performed by qualified study staff using a list of specific signs/symptoms , including mental status change, falls and gait disturbance. 6.5.4.3 Physical Examination Physical examinations will include an examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities, and neurological and vascular systems. Clinically significant abnormalities or worsening findings observed after the first dose of study drug will be reported as treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs). 6.5.4.4 Vital Signs Vital signs include sitting or semi-recumbent body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure and will be measured prior to start of dialysis.

Females are consid ered to be of childbearing potential unless they are: • Surgically sterile (ie, tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, and/or hysterectomy); or • Over 55 years of age and have not had a menstrual period in at least 1 year Once they have consented to participate in the study, all women of childbearing potential will be counseled on the importance of avoiding pregnancy and on the need to practice adequate birth control for the duration of the study, from screening until 7 days after the last dose of study drug. Medically acceptable methods of birth control include hormonal contraceptives for at least 1 cycle of treatment before study enrollment, an intrauterine device, and barrier with spermicide . Per inclusion criteria, male patients will agree not to donate s perm after the first dose of study drug until 7 days after the last dose of study drug, and will agree to use a condom with spermicide or abstain from heterosexual intercourse during the study until 7 days after the last dose of study drug. No restrictions are required for a vasectomized male, provided his vasectomy was performed ≥4 months prior to dosing. If sexual abstinence is chosen by the patient, it must be the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient and must be practiced for the entire duration of the study. Women will be counseled to contact the Investigator or his/her staff immediately if pregnancy is suspected. Males will be instructed to report to the Investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study. If a patient beco mes pregnant during the Double-blind Treatment Period or Open-label Extension Phase or within 7-10 days after the last dose of study drug, the Investigator will immediately discontinue the patient from the study and contact the Sponsor or designee.

A randomized, double-blind design was chosen to minimize bias. A 12 -week duration of treatment was selected to demonstrate durability of the efficacy observed in a prior 8 -week treatment study (ie, Study CR845-CLIN2101) and to further evaluate safety during a longer exposure. The primary efficacy endpoint was determined using the Worst Itching Intensity NRS scale, which measures itching intensity over 24 hours. This scale has been validated for this patient population and is identical to the primary efficacy endpoint used in the dose-ranging, Phase 2 study, CR845- CLIN2101. The open- label part of the study was designed to evaluate the long- term safety of CR845 0.5 mcg/kg IV administered after each dialysis session (generally 3 times per week for up to 52 weeks) in patients who completed the 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period of this study. This design is commonly used in clinical development to obtain long- term safety information. The duration of the study is in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) and FDA guidance [ Guidance for Industry February 2016]. 7.2 Selection of Doses in the Study The combined safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy data from CR845-CLIN2101 provided the basis for the selection of the dose and dose regimen of CR845 to be used in this study. The lowest dose tested (0.5 mc g/kg IV) appeared to be well tolerated and effective at reducing itch intensity over a period of 8 weeks. 7.3 Appropriateness of Measurements Standard clinical, laboratory, and statistical procedures and methodology will be utilized in this study. The PRO assessments to be used in this study are appropriate. Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

The analysis of safety and efficacy dat a collected during the Open-label Extension Phase will be included in the SAP. The SAP will provide a detailed description for the handling of missing data, patient eligibility criteria for the analysis, and statistical methodology. If differences occur between analyses of double-blind data described in the SAP and the current protocol, those found in the SAP will assume primacy. In addition, the SAP will provide details for the analysis of data collected during the Open -label Extension Phase, including t he analysis of safety data during exposure to CR845 across both the Double-blind and the Open-label Extension Phase s. Unless otherwise noted, continuous variables will be summarized using number of non-missing observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum; categorical variables will be summarized using the frequency count and the percentage of patients in each category. In addition to the descriptive summaries, pertinent data listings will be provided. All analyses will be performed using SAS ® version 9.2 or higher, unless otherwise specified. 8.2 Determination of Sample Size The planned sample size for this study is 350 (175 per treatment group) male and female hemodialysis patients with chronic moderate- to-severe pruritus (mean baseline 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score ≥5 ), randomized at approximately 95 clinical sites. The sample size may be increased to 500 patients (250 per treatment group) based on the results of a planned unblinded interim assessment conducted when approximately 50% of the planned 350 first patients have been randomized and have either completed the 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period or have discontinued from double-blind treatment early. The planned interim assessment will be conducted by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Details related to the sample size re -estimation are included in Section 8.4.1. The sample size calculation is based on results of a completed Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled study (CR845-CLIN2101) of CR845 in hemodialysis patients who had moderate -to-severe pruritus. In this study, approximately 30% of patients randomized to the placebo group reported ≥3- point improvement from baseline with respect to the 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS at the end of treatment (Week 8). The proportion of patients who received CR845 and reported a similar improvement in itch scores ranged from approximately 60% to 45% (ie, 30% to 15% difference from Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

Given a sample size of 350 patients ( 175 per treatment group) and assuming a true response rate of 30% for the placebo group and a true response rate of 50% for the CR845 group (defining response as an improvement from baseline ≥3 points with respect to the Worst Itching Intensity NRS at Week 12), a 2-sided continuity corrected Chi-square will have 9 6% power to detect a treatment difference.

The weekly mean of the 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score will be defined as the sum of the daily Worst Itching Intensity N RS scores reported during a specific week during the Double-blind Treatment Period (eg, Days 2 to 8, Days 9 to 15, Days 16 to 22, … Days 79 to 85) divided by the number of days with nonmissing scores for that week. If the daily worst itching score is miss ing for >3 days during a specific week, the corresponding weekly mean worst itching score will be set to missing. The baseline score will be defined as the average of the daily 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS scores collected over the Run-in Period, i ncluding pre -randomization assessments collected on Day 1. In the primary efficacy analysis, missing NRS data will be imputed using a multiple imputation (MI) approach, assuming that patients who discontinue double- blind treatment early would have similar Worst Itching Intensity NRS scores as other patients in their respective treatment arm that have complete data: • Intermittent missing NRS scores will first be imputed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented with the SAS MI procedure, which is appropriate for non-monotonic missing data. • NRS scores missing after patients discontinue study drug early will then be multiply imputed with the SAS MI procedure using a method appropriate for Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

Differences between CR845 0.5 mcg/kg and placebo with respect to the primary endpoint will be compared using a logistic regression model containing terms for treatment group, baseline NRS score, use of prior anti- itch medication , presence of specific medical conditions, and country /region. • Results of t he logistic regression on the multiply imputed data sets will be summarized by the SAS MIANALYZE procedure. The final p -value will be calculated using the Cui, Hung, Wang (CHW) procedure where the z-score is a weighted average of the z -score at the inter im and the z-score observed for data collected after the interim , following the formula below. Z final=Zinterim * √(n/N) + Z post-interim * √(1- n/N) where n is the number of patients at the interim and N is the initial number of patients planned (300). Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted to evaluate the robustness of study results under different assumptions and imputation algorithms.

This sensitivity analysis is to investigate the departure from MAR assumption by progressively decreasing the treatment differences with respect to the NRS scores over the missing visits in active treatment group until conclusion from the primary analysis is overturned. The MI procedure includes the following steps: o Uses MCMC methodology from PROC MI by treatment group to impute the intermittent missing data to a monotone missing pattern o Uses a standard MAR-based MI approach from PROC MI to impute data from monotone missing data o For patients in the active treatment group, shift parameter from PROC MI will be progressively applied to impute the missing data, until the p-value >0.05 To evaluate the p otential impact of the IA on the properties of statistical inference at the end of the trial, the primary and sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will also be presented separately for the sample of patients enrolled into the study after the IA. 8.7.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary efficacy endpoints are the: • Proportion of patients achieving ≥4- point improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS at Week 12 (Day 79 to 85) of the Double- blind Treatment Period ; • Proportion of patients achieving ≥3- point improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS at Week 8 of the Double- blind Treatment Period ; • Proportion of patients achieving ≥3- point improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24 -hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS at Week 4 of the Double- blind Treatment Period ; Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

Results of the ANCOVA on the multiply imputed data sets will be summarized by the SAS MIANALYZE procedure. The LS means, standard errors, 95% CIs, and differences between treatment groups reported with LS means, standard errors, and 95% CIs derived from the ANCOVA on the imputed datasets will be reported. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the 5D Itch scale and the Skindex-10 scale will be performed to describe the time course of the treatment respon se over the 12- week treatment period using a mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM). The model will contain treatment, week, and treatment- by-week interaction as fixed effects; baseline score, prior anti- itch medication usage , presence of speci fic medical conditions , and country/region as covariates. Repeated measures will include values collected at the end of Weeks 4, 8, 10, and 12 (end of treatment). It is important to note that, in HD patients, the study drug administered during the last dialysis of a particular week is not cleared until the first dialysis of the next week. Therefore, measurements that would reflect treatment effect at the end of a specific week (eg. Week 4) will actually be collected during the first day of the next week (eg , Week 5). An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within -subject errors. Should the model fail to converge, a compound symmetric covariance m atrix will be used instead. The Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. Missing scores will not be imputed. Assuming that the data are MAR, the estimates of the treatment differences calculated from the MMRM described above are unbiased. Standard descriptive statistics will be reported for each time point on the values and changes from baseline along with the least squares (LS) means, standard errors, 95% CIs and differences between treatment groups reported with LS means, standard errors, and 95% CIs. 8.7.3 Hypothesis Testing Strategy The efficacy of CR845 0.5 mcg/kg compared to placebo in pivotal Phase 3 study CLIN3103 will be evaluated based on 1 primary and 7 secondary efficacy endpoints. Testing of the primary efficacy endpoint will be 2 -sided and conducted at the 5% error level. The study will be considered positive if the null hypothesis of no treatment difference in the primary efficacy analysis of the pr imary endpoint (proportion of patients achieving ≥3-point improvement from baseline with respect to the Worst Itching Intensity NRS) is rejected in favor of the alternative that patients randomized to CR845 experience significantly less itching compared to patients randomized to placebo.

Treatment difference will be tested using the Cochran - Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusting for strata. An exact test, such as the Fisher’s Exact Test, may be used if the observed count in a particular cell is small (ie, <5). 8.7.4.2 Itch-related Quality -of-Life Measures Itch-related quality -of-life measures and their analyses will include: • Change from baseline in itch -related quality of life at each week of the Double-blind T reatment Period, as assessed by the 5 -D Itch Scale total score . Treatment differences between CR845 and placebo at each postbaseline time point will be evaluated using the same MMRM fitted for the secondary efficacy analysis. • Change from baseline in itch -related quality -of-life at each week of the Double-blind Treatment Period, as assessed by the Skindex- 10 Scale total score. Treatment differences between CR845 and placebo at each postbaseline time point will be evaluated using the same MMRM fitted for th e secondary efficacy analysis. • Change from baseline in itch -related quality of life at Week 12 of the Double-blind Treatment Period and at each of the remaining weeks of the Double-blind Treatment Period with respect to each of the 3 domains of the Skindex-10 Scale. Treatment differences with respect to each domain will be evaluated using a model similar to the MMRM fitted for the analysis of the change from baseline in the overall Skindex- 10 Scale score ( Section 8.7.2). 8.8 Safety Analysis Analysis of all safety data collected during the Double-blind Phase will be performed on the Double-blind Safety Population. The SAP will provide further detail for the analyses to be applied to each safety parameter, and will also include analyses of safety data collected during the Open -label Extension Phase and during exposure to CR845 during both the Double-blind and Open- label Extension Phases.

Day 1 of the Double- blind Treatment Period will be defined as the day of administration of the first dose of study drug. The last day of the Double-blind Treatment Period will be defined as the day of the dialysis session immediately following the last injection of study drug. Exposure and treatment compliance during the Double- blind Treatment Period will be summarized by the following parameters: • Duration of treatment (days) • Total number of doses actually received • Number of missed doses Duration of treatment (days) = (date of first dialysis after last dose) – (date of first dose) + 1. If a patient receives additional dialysis during a given week for any reason, an additional dose of CR845 will be administered following dialysis. A maximum of 4 doses per week is allowed. No additional doses will be given for patients receiving an additional unscheduled ultrafiltration treatment. The number of patients getting such an extra treatment will be summarized. 8.8.2 Adverse Events All adverse events , as reported by the si te, will be coded using MedDRA to MedDRA SOC and Preferred Term for standardization and summary purposes. All reported adverse events (whether or not treatment-emergent) will be included in a by-patient adverse event listing. Only TEAEs will be included in summary tables which will present results by treatment group and by study period, as appropriate. Adverse events that are considered “treatment emergent” relative to the Run -in Period are identified as any adverse event with an onset date after the s tart of the Run-in Period and up to the first dose of study drug during the Double-blind Period. Adverse events that are considered “treatment emergent” relative to the Double -blind Period are identified as any adverse event • with an onset date after the f irst dose of the double-blind study drug up to the Follow-up Visit or Early Termination Visit (or 7 to 10 days after the last dose if no Early Termination Visit was conducted), whichever is later, for patients who do not enter the Open- label Extension Phase.

The number and percentage of patients experiencing TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group and by period. A patient will be counted only once in the incidence count for a MedDRA SOC or Preferred Term, although a patient may have multiple occurrences (start and stop) of an event associated with a specific MedDRA Preferred Term or SOC. The most frequent TEAEs (≥5% of patients in any treatment group) will also be tabulated by SOC and Preferred Term. The incidence and percentage of patients experiencing treatment -emergent SAEs and TEAEs leading to study discontinuation will be presented by the appropriate MedDRA SOC and Preferred Term. Adverse events that result in death will also be summarized. Treatment -emergent adverse events will also be summarized by severity for each study period of the Double-blind Phase and by relationship to double-blind study drug for the Double-blind Period. If the severity and/or relationship to the study drug of an adverse event is missing, a worst- case scenario will be assumed (ie, the adverse event will be categorized as “severe” and/or “related” to t he study drug). If a patient reports the same TEAE multiple times the event with the worst severity and the strongest relationship to study drug will be tabulated. For each period of the Double-blind Phase, an overall summary table will be provided, presenting for each treatment group: the number and percentage of patients with an adverse event (both treatment and non- treatment emergent) during that period, a TEAE, serious TEAE, related TEAE, severe TEAE, TEAE leading to dose interruption, and TEAE leadin g to study drug discontinuation. This table will also include the number of events for each specific Preferred Term. All adverse events will be listed in chronological order, including patient identifier, age, race, gender, a flag indicating whether the event was treatment -emergent, and all related event status information (start and stop dates, whether the event was ongoing, study day of onset, severity, seriousness, relationship to study medication, action taken with study treatment, and outcome). Separate listings will be generated for SAEs, deaths, and adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation. Additionally, a coding list of Preferred Terms and the verbatim text associated with them will be produced. 8.8.3 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations Summary statistics for each scheduled time point measured and mean changes from baseline to each time point (when applicable) will be presented for clinical laboratory results.

Laboratory values will be r eported in Système International units. Laboratory test results will be assigned an L/N/H classification according to whether the value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory parameter’s reference range. Comparisons will be based on 3×3 tables (shift tables) that, for a particular laboratory test, compare the baseline L/N/H classification to the highest and/or lowest L/N/H classification during the treatment period. Clinically important laboratory values based on prespecified criteria defined in the SAP will also be summarized. Additionally, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase will be presented in a separate listing, with 3× and 5×ULN flagged for alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase; 2×ULN flagged for bilirubin, and 1.5×ULN flagged for alkaline phosphatase. 8.8.4 Vital Signs and ECGs Summary tables will include descriptive statistics for baseline and each postbaseline assessment. Descriptive statistics will be calculated o n both the actual score and the change from baseline score. Baseline is defined as the last measurement taken on or prior to the first day of dosing. Note that the Day 1 assessment can be included in the evaluation of baseline if that the assessment is p erformed prior to dosing. All vital sign summaries will include the patients in the Double -blind Safety Population who have at least a postbaseline time point (for criteria based on postbaseline assessments) and with both a baseline and at least 1 postbas eline time point (for criteria evaluating changes from baseline). Clinically notable vital signs will be identified based on the criteria defined in the SAP . For each vital sign parameter, the number and percentage of patients with at least 1 notable value will be tabulated by week and overall for the Double-blind Phase. All vital signs will be listed in by -patient listings, including visit and collection date/time, and will be sorted by patient identifier and date/time of assessment. Electrocardiogram r esults include an overall interpretation of ‘normal,’ ‘abnormal but not clinically significant,’ or ‘abnormal and clinically significant.’ These results will be tabulated at each time point. Electrocardiogram results will be listed for each visit, inclu ding visit, whether ECG was performed (yes/no), explanation (if not performed), assessment date/time, study date, overall interpretation, and relevant medical history number or adverse event number, if deemed a clinically significant abnormality.

No data are to be recorded directly in the eCRFs (eg, all data will have a unique source). The Invest igator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically signing the eCRF. The Investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the eCRF. The Investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/I EC review, and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study, including quality checking of the data. Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participa nts are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH -GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the Investigator for 2 years after the marketing approval of the study drug or after discontinuing clinical development unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the Sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the Sponsor. If the Investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility. If a custodial change or a change in record location occurs, the Sponsor must be notified in writing. Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"

Protocol deviations due to lack of patient compliance must also be documented. The site monitor will review protocol deviations throughout the course of monitoring visits and document new findings of deviations. The monitor will notify the Investigators of deviations verbally or in writing. The IRB/IEC should be notified of all protocol deviations in a timely manner according to IRB/IEC requirements. 12.2 Publication of Study Findings All information regarding CR845 provided by Sponsor to the Investigator is privileged and confidential information. By conducting t his study, the Investigator affirms to the Sponsor that he/she will maintain, in strict confidence, information furnished by the Sponsor, including data generated from this study, except as exempted for regulatory purposes.

For multiple imputations and other instances where random seeds are required, the values used (in order) are: 8392857 2985729 1843255 9086284 5547484 8017456 9597295 2252256 4821871 9852467 5126715 3232132 9841654 3645284 1587345 Note that not all seeds may be required in programming the multiple imputations. If additional seeds are n eeded, they will be chosen by adding 1 to each of the values above, again using them in order. The number of imputations for the multiple imputations will be 20. For the primary analysis, a multi- stage process will be applied: Stage 1: Subjects will have their 11-point NRS scores imputed. First, using all visits, intermittent missing data will be imputed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented with the SAS MI procedure; data imputed following subject discontinuation via this process will be censored out of the resulting dataset so that only intermittent missing data is imputed via this method. Second, monotone missing data will be imputed following subject discontinuation using SAS proc MI. For each stage, MI will be performed within treatment group with covariates for baseline NRS score, use of prior anti-itch medication, and presence of select medical conditions. Should convergence issues occur due to small cell size for the one or both of the categorical covariates at either stage, the appropriate covariate(s) will be removed from the model. Stage 2: Using the resulting complete datasets, the change from baseline with respect to the 11-point NRS will be calculated; patients will be categorized as responder if they have a 3-point (or greater) improvement over baseline. Week 12 values will serve as the primary timepoint. The 20 MI runs will be analyzed independently using a logistic Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"
91,page_91,"Cara Therapeutics Inc. Confidential Page 92 of 92 CR845-CLIN3103 10 September 2019 Version 2. 2 model and the results combined using SAS proc MIANALYZE. Logistic model covariates will include trea tment, baseline NRS score, use of prior anti- itch medication, and presence of select medical conditions. As with the MI, should convergence issues occur due to small cell sizes, the appropriate categorical covariate(s) will be dropped as necessary. Should a sample size increase occur, the above process will be implemented completely independently among subjects contributing the interim results and those following the interim analysis. For the tipping point analysis, a shift parameter will be applied to only subjects in the active group, running from 0 to 5 points in 0.25-point increments or until the conclusions of the analysis “tip” and the results are no longer significant. This analysis will not be performed should the initial primary results fail to a chieve significance. Cara Therapeutics, Inc., CR845 IND 123140, SN 0072"
