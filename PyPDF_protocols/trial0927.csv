Secondary Objective: To assess the effect of 3 doses of GP MDI compared to Placebo MDI and Spiriva Respimat on exacerbations, quality of life, and symptoms over 24 weeks in subjects with persistent asthma. Safety Objective: To assess the safety of 3 doses of GP MDI compared to Placebo MDI and Spiriva Respimat over 24 weeks in subjects with persistent asthma. 24-Hour Holter Monitoring Sub-Study Objective: To assess the cardiovascular safety of 3 doses of GP MDI compared to Placebo MDI and Spiriva Respimat as evaluated by 24-hour Holter monitoring. Study Design This Phase II/III randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multi-center, dose confirmation study w ill compare 3 doses of GP MDI (28.8, 14.4, and 7.2 μg) to Placebo MDI and open-label Spiriva Respimat (2.5 μg). The 3 doses of GP MDI and the Placebo MDI will be administered twice daily (BID) and Spiriva Respimat will be administered once daily (QD), both for 24 weeks. At Visit 1, subjects will sign an informed consent form (ICF) and assent form (as applicable) and inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed. All eligible subjects must have been taking a stable regimen of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting β2- agonist (LABA) for at least 4 weeks, and be willing to continue this medication regimen throughout the trial. Subjects also taking tiotropium 2.5 μg QD for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 may be enrolled if they are willing to discontinue tiotropium at Visit 1. Tiotropium will be replaced with Sponsor-provided ipratropium bromide hydrofluoroalkane (hereafter referred to as ipra tropium) taken as 2 inhalations 4 times daily until randomization, when ipratropium will be discontinued.

Subjects must demonstrate a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) of >40% and <85% of predicted (>40% and <90% of predicted for subjects 12 to <18 years of age) at Visit 1 (and Visit 2 if spirometry is re quired), and must demonstrate reversibility to albuterol at Visit 1 or Visit 2. Subjects will return for Visit 2 after adequate washout of prohibited asthma medications. There will be a minimum of 7 days between Visit 1 and Visit 2. Spirometry will only be performed at Visit 2 if reversibility criteria to albuterol were not met at Visit 1. The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) will be administered, and multiple other assessments will be made including fractional nitric oxide in inhaled breath (F ENO). At Visit 3, reversibility of FEV 1to ipratropium will be assessed for characterization and randomizatio n stratification. For sub jects participating in the Holter monitoring sub- study, a 24-hour Holter monitor will also be placed. At Visit 4, subjects meeting randomization cr iteria (including demonstrating an FEV 1of >40% and <85% of predicted [>40% and <90% of predicted for subjects 12 to <18 years of age]) will be rando mized in a 2:2:2:2:1 scheme to 1 of the following 5 treatment groups: •GP MDI 28.8 μg BID (double-blind) •GP MDI 14.4 μg BID (double-blind) •GP MDI 7.2 μg BID (double-blind) •Placebo MDI BID (double-blind) •Spiriva Respimat 2.5 μg QD (open-label) Randomization will be stratified by baseline percent predicted FEV 1(≤60% or >60%), reversibility to iprat ropium (<12% or <200 mL vs ≥12% and ≥200 mL improvement in FEV 1), and by the ICS included in their fixed-dose ICS/LABA combination product (budesonide [eg, Symbicort®, with formoterol fumarate dihydrate], mometasone furoate [eg, Dulera®, with formoterol fumarate dihydrate], fluticasone furoate [eg, Breo®Ellipta®, with vilanterol trifenatate], or fluticasone propionate [eg, Advair®or AirDuo™ RespiClick®, with salmeterol]). Following randomization, sub jects will enter the Treatment Period and undergo 6 additional treatment visits over 24 weeks. For subjects participating in the Holter monitoring sub-study, a Holter monitor will be placed at Visit 7 and removed the following day.

The model will include treatment, visit, background ICS/LABA, a nd treatment by-visit interaction as categorical covariates and baseline FEV 1, percentage reversibility to ipratropi um, and blood eosinophil count at screening as continuous covariates. Sample Size A sample size of 1125 subjects (250 subjects per double-blind treatment group, 125 subjects in the open-label Spiriva Respimat treatment group) will provide approximately 93% power to detect a 120 mL difference between the GP MDI treatment groups and Placebo MDI in the analysis of change from baseline in FEV 1AUC 0-4 at Week 24. The assumed standard deviation is 348 mL at each visit. The 2-sided alpha for each pairwise comparison is 0.05. This sample size assumes that approximately 20% of randomized subjects will have discontinued study drug prior to Week 24. Comparisons of GP MDI to Spiriva Respimat will be focused on estimation as the study is not formally powered to demonstrate non-inferiority or superiority. Data Monitoring Committee: An independent, external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be set up to review all serious adverse events (including deaths and all hospitalizations) and cardiovascular events. Members of the DMC will review summaries of these safety data generated externally and independently of the Sponsor in a semi-blinded or unblinded manner at predetermined intervals. If significant safety issues arise in between scheduled meetings, ad hoc meetings will be scheduled to review the data. Based on the safety implications of the data, the DMC may recommend modification or termination of the study.

These drug products are metered dose inhalers (MDIs) formulated as a suspension with micronized active pharmaceut ical ingredients and Co-Suspension™ Delivery Technology. The Co-Suspension Deliv ery Technology consists of spray-dried porous particles comprised of the phospholipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and calcium chloride suspended in a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant. When used in combination MDI products, these particles form strong non-specific associations with the active pharmaceut ical i ngredients, preventing the drugs from interacting with each other in the suspension and providing reproducible drug delivery and long-term stability. The test formulation to be evaluated in this study is an MDI containing Glycopy rronium Inhalation Aerosol (henceforth referred to as GP MDI), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). Further details about the to-be-tested formulations are provided in Table 6-1 and the current version of the PT001 investigator brochure (IB). 1.1 Background Information on the Treatment of Asthma Asthma is a heterogeneous disease that is characterized by chronic airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity. It is defined by a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow obstruction. The variations in symptoms and airflow obstruction are often triggered by factors such as exercise, allergen or irritant exposure, changes in weather, noxious fumes, or viral respiratory infections. Symptoms and airflow obstruction may resolve spontaneously or in response to therapy. Importantly, worsening asthma symptoms/airway obstruction can be severe, resulting in an asthma exacerbation that may be life-threatening. Such events pose a significant burden to patients and result in significant direct and indirect economic costs (Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] 2017). The main objective of asthma treatment is to maintain asthma control (GINA 2017). The concept of ‘asthma control’ is not synonymous with ‘asthma severity’ and is defined as ‘the extent to which the various manifestations of asthma have been reduced or removed by treatment’. This concept encompasses 2 co mponents: the patient’s recent clinical status/current disease impact (symptoms, night awakenings, use of rescue medication, and lung function) and future risk (exacerbations, decline in lung function, or treatment-related side effects). According to the GINA guidelines, asthma is controlled when a patient has daytime symptoms twice or less per week, no limitation of daily activities, no nocturnal symptoms, no exacerbations, the need for rescue medication use is twice or less per week, and normal or near normal lung function. The GINA guidelines specify 5 treatment steps for asthma, each step outlining options for higher levels of treatment for controlling as thma in patients 5 years of age and older (GINA 2017). Within this stepwise approach, GINA proposes a classification of asthma severity based on the type and intensity of controller medication required for the control of"
21,page_21,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 21 of 163the disease (Steps 1 to 5). The GINA guidelines also propose a classification in 3 categories (mild, moderate, and severe asthma) assessed retrospectively once the patient is on regular controller treatment for several months. Per GINA guidelines, the goal of the stepwise approach to treatment is to achieve and maintain control. In this regard, the level of asthma control obtained with treatment determines the need to step up or step down to the next treatment step in order to achieve optimum control with the minimum amount of medication. The majority of asthma patients can achieve and maintain clinical control with standard treatment regimens that generally include inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) with or without inhaled long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) as well as short-acting β2-agonists (SABAs). However, some patients with asthma have inadequately controlled disease despite the use of an ICS with or without a LABA. Treatment options that may be considered in these patients include adding a LAMA such as tiotropium and, in certain subsets of patients, biologic agents (eg, omalizumab, mepolizumab), bronchial thermoplasty, and lo w-dose oral corticosteroids (GINA 2017). This information indicates that LAMAs have a significant role in the management of asthma when used in combination with other controller medications (Barnes 2011). The goal of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 doses of GP MDI in comparison to Placebo MDI and Spiriva®Respimat®over 24 weeks in subjects whose asthma is not optimally controlled despite treatment with an ICS/LABA or an ICS/LABA plus tiotropium."

The 3 doses of GP MDI and the Placebo MDI will be administered twice daily (BID) and Spiriva Respimat will be administered once daily (QD), each for 24 weeks. The subject will also continue on their own ICS/LABA regimen during the Screening Period and throughout the Treatment Period. Figure 4-1 displays the overall study design. Figure 4-1 Study Design Overview This study will be conducted at approximately 250 sites, contributing a pproximately 4 to 6 subjects per site. It is planned that approximately 2250 prospective subjects will be screened, with approximately 1125 subjects randomized to provide approximately 900 subjects who complete the study."

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 27 of 163At Visit 1, subjects (or the parents or legal guardians of subjects <18 years of age) will sign an informed consent form (ICF); subjects <18 years of age will sign an assent form. All eligible subjects must be taking a stable regimen of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long- acting !2-agonist (LABA) for at least 4 weeks; this ICS/LABA regimen will be continued throughout the Screening and randomized Treatment Periods. Subjects who are also taking tiotropium will discontinue its use at Visit 1 and replace tiotropium with Sponsor-provided ipratropium bromide HFA MDI (hereafter referred to as ipratropium) taken as 2 inhalations 4 times daily (QID) during the Screening Period. Beginning with Visit 1, subjects will use an eDiary BID to record ICS/LABA use (Screening Period only), albuterol sulfate HFA MDI (hereafter referred to as albuterol) use, asthma symptom scores, PEFR, and study drug use (Treatment Period only). Subjects must demonstrate an FEV 1>40% and <85% of predicted (>40% and <90% of predicted for subjects 12 to <18 years of age) at Visit 1, Visit 2 (if applicable) and Visit 4. Reversibility to albuterol must be demonstrated at either Visit 1 or Visit 2. A subject will be considered reversible to albuterol if the improvement in FEV 1from pre-albuterol to post- albuterol is ≥12% and ≥200 mL (Section 7.1.1.3 ). Subjects will return for Visit 2 after adequate washout of prohibited asthma medications. There will be a minimum of 7 days between Visit 1 and Visit 2. At Visit 2, the ACQ will be administered along with multiple other assessments including F ENO. Spirometry will only be performed at Visit 2 if reversibility to al buterol was not demonstrated at Visit 1. A subset of approximately 562 sub jects (125 subjects from th e GP MDI groups and Placebo MDI group and 62 subjects from the Spiriva Respimat group) will participate in the 24-hour Holter monitor sub-study. In these subjects, a 24-hour Holter monitor will be collected between Visit 3 and Visit 4 (Holter Monitor Baseline) and at Visit 7 (Week 12). Those subjects who have clinically significant abnormal findings defined as (but not limited to) criteria in Section 5.5during the baseline 24- hour Holter monitor MUST be screen failed from the full study. Subjects unable to provide a minimum of 18 hours of acceptable quality recording in a 24-hour period after 2 attempts will not be eligible for the Holter monitoring sub-study, but DO NOT need to be screen failed from the full study. Reversibility to ipratropium will be assessed at Visit 3 for characterization and rando mization stratification purposes. For subjects participating in the Holter monitoring sub-study, a 24- hour Holter monitor will also be placed at Visit 3 (Section 7.2.4 ) and removed the following day. Subjects meeting rando mization criteria at Visit 4 (S ection 5.3) will continue to take their same ICS/LABA regimen throughout the randomized Treatment Period, discontinue ipratropium (if applicable), and be randomized in a 2:2:2:2:1 scheme to 1 of the following 5 treatment groups for 24 weeks: •GP MDI 28.8 μg BID (n=250) •GP MDI 14.4 μg BID (n=250)"

Following rando mization, subjects will undergo 6 additional tr eatment visits over 24 weeks. For subjects participating in the Holter monit oring sub-study, a Holter monitor will be placed at Visit 7 (Section 7.2.4 ) and removed the following day. Note: The end of study is defined as the date on which data are collected 14 (+2) days after the last dose of study drug. Data collection can occur via a follow-up telephone call (Section 8.11) or a study visit, whichever provides 14 (+2) days of follow-up. 4.2 Rationale GP MDI is being developed for use in the treatment of asthma. This study will characterize the efficacy and safety of GP MDI, evaluating multiple doses in order to determine the most appropriate GP MDI dose(s) to treat subjects with asthma who remain symptomatic despite treatment with an ICS/LABA. 4.2.1 Population The primary intended use of GP MDI in asthma will be as add-on therapy to ICS/LABA in line with GINA guidelines (GINA 2017). This study will include subjects with persistent asthma who remain symptomatic, as demonstrated by an ACQ-5 (see Section 7.1.4.1 ) total score≥1.5, despite treatment with an ICS/LABA. Symptomatic subjects receiving tiotropium in addition to an ICS/LABA are also included in order to cover the spectrum of asthma severity for which the addition of a LAMA to an ICS/LABA may be appropriate. 4.2.2 Choice of Study Doses Efficacy and safety data from Phase I a nd II studies indicate that GP MDI 28.8, 14.4, and 7.2μg administered BID may be ap propriate doses to eval uate in a Phase III study in subjects with uncontrolled persistent asthma despite treatment with an ICS/LABA. In a Phase II study, GP MDI 28.8 μg was most similar to salmeterol, the active comparator, for all outcome measures, and the GP MDI 14.4 and 7.2 μg doses were similar to salmeterol for some endpoints. GP MDI doses below 7.2 μg were appreciably less effective than salmeterol. The previous GP MDI Phase II study included subjects with asthma who were either on a"
29,page_29,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 29 of 163low dose of an ICS or not on an ICS. Therefore, confirmation of the optimal GP MDI dose in subjects with uncontrolled persistent asthma despite treatment with an ICS/LABA is warranted. Doses above 28.8 μg have not been evaluated in subjects with asthma, and thus, the 28.8 μg dose is the highest dose planned for evaluation in this study. Furthermore, based on data from prior Phase I and Phase II studies, doses below 7.2 μg are not expected to have appreciable efficacy, and thus, the 7.2 μg dose is the lowest dose planned for inclusion in the study. Refer to the current PT001 IB for further details on the Phase I and Phase II GP MDI studies. The dose chosen for Spiriva Respimat, 2.5 μg QD, is the approved dose in the current prescribing information for the treatment of asthma in individuals 6 years of age and older (Spiriva Respimat 2017). 4.2.3 Choice of Comparators/Control Groups Spiriva Respimat will be included in this study as an active comparator to benchmark the GP MDI results. Placebo MDI will serve as the control arm. 4.2.4 Study Duration The specified study duration of 24 weeks will provide sufficient time to observe lung function changes in the chosen subject population.

Avoid freezing. 6.5 Instructions for Dispensing and Preparation of Study Drugs for Administration Before dispensing the study drug to the subject, authorized study staff must confirm the identifier given by the IWRS and the com ponent identification num ber written on the label are the same. To document dispensing of the study drug, the authorized study staff will write the subject number and treatment visit number on each of the 2-part labels and affix the ‘tear off’ part of the label onto the IWRS confirmation report. All GP MDIs and Placebo MDIs must be primed before the first use. To prime the inhaler, gently shake the inhaler for 5 to 10 seconds and then spray once into the air away from yourself and others. Wait approximately 30 seconds and repeat the process 3 more times (see Appendix 5 for complete instructions). Shaking and primi ng the inhaler fills a chamber inside the canister with the correct dose and mix of medication so that the inhaler is ready to use. Priming should occur in a separate room from the subject treatment area. Similarly, the Spiriva Respimat inhaler must be primed before the first use. To prime the inhaler, in brief, point the inhaler toward the ground and press the dose-release button. If a mist is seen, repeat for 3 more actuations; if a mist is not seen, follow the manufacturer’s instructions (see Appendix 6 for complete instructions). Once the inhalation device is primed, the first dose (2 puffs) of study drug should be taken by the subject in the clinic under site personnel supervision. The date and time of the second puff should be recorded as the time of dose administration (ie, in iDataFax for in-clinic doses and in the e-Diary for at-home dosing). Subjects should be instructed to inhale 2 puffs in the morning and, unless randomized to Spiriva Respimat, 2 puffs in the evening approximately 12 hours apart. The timing of the morning administration should match ±1 hour of in-clinic study drug administration."

Instructions for the albuterol MDI and ipratropium inhaler are provided in Appendix 7 and Appendix 8 , respectively. 6.6 Emergency Unblinding The Investigator or designee may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in the case of an emergency , when knowledge of the study treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject. Emergency unblinding of study drug, for a given subject, must be done utilizing the IWRS as a study treatment disclosure envelope will not be provided with the clinical supplies. Whenever possible, the Investigator should first discuss options with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or other appropriate study personnel from the Sponsor before unblinding the subject’s treatment assignment. If this is impractical, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible, but without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded subject, unless that information is important for the safety of other subjects currently enrolled in the study. If the Investigator contacts IWRS to unblind a subject, s/he must provide the requested subject identifying information and confirm the necessity to unblind treatment. The date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded in the appropriate eCRF. 6.7 Drug Accountability/Return of Clinical Supplies Under no circumstances will the Investigator(s) allow the study drug to be used other than as directed by this protocol. Investigational clinical supplies must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safely and properly, and kept in a secure location to which only the Investigator and designated study personnel have access. Clinical supplies should be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. The Investigator or designee is responsible for keeping accurate records of the clinical supplies received from the Sponsor, the amount dispensed to and returned by the subject, and the amount remaining at the conclusion of th e study. Study drug should be handled in accordance with Good Pharmacy Practices (eg, gloves should always be worn by study personnel if directly handling study drug that is returned). The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee should be contacted with any questions concerning investigational products where special or protective handling is indicated. At the end of the study, all clinical supplies including partial and empty containers must be returned as directed by the Sponsor. Sites should check with the Sponsor representative for appropriate documentation that needs to be completed for drug accountability."

A detailed visit schedule for all pre- and post-dose assessments is described in Table 8-2 . A summary of 24-hour Holter monitoring sub-study procedures is in Table 8-3 . 7.1 Efficacy Assessments 7.1.1 Pulmonary Function Tests 7.1.1.1 Spirometry Standardization All pulmonary function tests (PFTs) including FEV 1, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory flow in the midpoint as defined in ATS/ERS guidelines will be performed in accordance with ATS criteria ( Appendix 2 ; Miller 2005) and will be assessed using a spirometer that meets or exceeds minimum performance reco mmendations of the ATS (Appendix 3 ). To standardize spirometry, all si tes will be provided with ident ical spirometry sys tems with customized, study-specific software. Every effort will be made to provide all sites with standardized spirometry equipmen t. The volume accuracy of the spirometer is to be checked daily with appropriate documentation in a cali bration log prior to the conduct of PFTs on each test day. The volume accuracy of the spirometer is checked using a 3 L syringe across 3 flow ranges (ie, low, medium, and high flows), with temperature and barometric pressure correction. The calibration syringe must meet ATS specifications and not be used beyond the expiry d ate. Required accuracy is ±3% (ie, 3.09 L to 2.91 L; ATS/ERS). The results will be printed and maintained in a calibration log, which will be monitored for compliance during the monitoring visits (see Appendix 2 ). All study staff responsible for performing PFTs will receive standardized training at the Investigator Meeting. All technicians are require d to demonstrate proficiency in the use of the equipment and the ability to perform technically acceptable PFTs (ATS criteria) prior to performing PFTs on study subjects (Miller 2005). After each test is performed, the spirometry software will provide immediate feedback to the technician indicating whether the effort meets ATS acceptability and repeatability standards (Miller 2005). All PFTs will be stored electronically. After completion of testing, the study staff will electron ically transmit the spirometry measurements for centralized quality assurance review Feedback on the quality of the measurements will be provided to the investigational site and to the Sponsor or designee for central data management. As spirometry results are primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for this study, it is important for the medication withholding conventions and timing of spirometry to be consistently managed throughout the study (Section 8.1)."

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 48 of 1637.1.1.2 Spirometry Schedule Spirometry collection is briefly outlined below. For exact spirometry collection and specifications, please refer to Table 8-1 and Section 8. •Visit 1: - Spirometry, including reversibility to albuterol, will be performed at Visit 1 only if the subject did not take their morning doses of inhaled asthma maintenance medications and if albuterol was not administered within 6 hours. If the subject has not withheld their dose(s) of regular asthma medications (Section 8.1) or albuterol, Visit 1 should be re scheduled no sooner than the following day. - Spirometry will be conducted at 60 and 30 minutes prior to bronchodilator (albuterol) administration and 30 minutes post-bronchodilator (Section 7.1.1.3 ). If subjects are not reversible to albuterol at 30 minutes post-dose, the post-dose PFTs can be repeated at 60 minutes post-dose. - The average of the 2 pre-bronchodilator FEV 1values will be calculated to determine if the subject meets the inclusion criterion (ie, FEV 1>40% and <85% of predicted normal value fo r subjects 18 to 80 years of age or FEV 1>40% and <90% of predicted normal value for s ubjects 12 to <18 years of age). -F E V 1repeatability must be demonstrated at one of the pre-dose measurements. •Visit 2:- Spirometry will only be conducted in those subjects who did not demonstrate reversibility to albuterol at Visit 1. - Subjects who did not meet albuterol reversibility criteria at Visit 1 must meet these criteria at Visit 2. - When spirometry is conducted at Visit 2, the procedures will be the same as those described above for Visit 1 (eg, FEV 1inclusion criterion must be met). •Visit 3: spirometry will be conducted 60 and 30 minutes prior to ipratropium administration and 30 minutes post-ipratropium (Section 7.1.1.3 ). •At Visits 4, 7, and 10/Final Visit or the Treatment Discontinuation Visit: spirometry will be conducted 60 minutes and 30 minutes prior to study drug and ICS/LABA administration and 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, and 4 hours post-dosing with study drug and ICS/LABA (if a subject discontinues taking study drug but agrees to continue in the study and complete all remaining study visits, the subject’s usual inhaled asthma maintenance medication(s) will be administered for spirometry testing instead of study drug). At Visit 4, the averag e of the 2 pre-dose FEV 1values will be calculated to determine if the subject meets the inclusion criterion. •At Visits 5, 6, 8, and 9: spirometry will be conducted 60 minutes and 30 minutes prior to study drug and ICS/LABA administration. Subjects will be required to return to th e clinic at approximately the same time of day for all treatment visits. All in-clinic dosing must occu r prior to 10 am with consistent in-clinic dose"
49,page_49,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 49 of 163timing throughout the randomized Treatment Period; visits must be planned accordingly (Section 8.1). The subjects will be required to remain at the clinic until completion of all protocol-defined assessments. 7.1.1.3 Reversibility to Albuterol and Ipratropium Reversibility to albuterol will be evaluated for subject qualification purposes, and reversibility criteria must be met at either Visit 1 or Visit 2 (Section 5.1). If reversibility criteria are met at Visit 1, reversibility testing will not be repeated at Visit 2. If reversibility criteria are not met at Visit 1, subjects may conti nue to Visit 2; however, reversibility criteria must be met at Visit 1 or Visit 2 to continue to Visit 3. Reversibility to ipratropi um will be evaluated at Visit 3 for characterization and randomizatio n stratification purposes. The procedures for determining reversibility to albuterol and ipratropium are as follows: 1. Determine if morning doses of all maintenance asthma medications were withheld and that short-acting bronchodilators were not administered within 6 hours of testing 2. Perform prebronchodilator PFTs at 60 and 30 minutes prior to administration of bronchodilator 3. Administer 4 puffs of albuterol (Visit 1 and, if needed, Visit 2) or 4 puffs ipratropium (Visit 3). 4. Perform postbronchodilator PFTs 30 minutes after the administration of either albuterol or ipratropium (as appropriate per visit). If subjects are not reversible to albuterol at 30 minutes, the post-dose PFT can be repeated at 60 minutes post-dose. Repeat spirometry at 60 minutes post-dose is not necessary for reversibility testing to ipratropium. Reversibility will be a comparison of the average best FEV 1effort obtained at 60 and 30 minutes prebronchodilator to the best FEV 1effort obtained at 30 minutes (or up to 60 minutes, if repeated for albuterol) postbronchodilator following administration of either albuterol or ipratropium. A subject is considered reversible to albuterol if the improvement in FEV 1 at 30 minutes (or up to 60 minutes) post-albuterol is ≥12% and ≥200 mL. 7.1.2 Subject’s eDiary Data Collection At Visit 1, subjects will be trained on and receive their eDiary. Prior to issuing the eDiary to the subject, site personnel are responsible for programming the eDiary and training subjects on its use. Subjects will enter the following information into the eDiary BID beginning with Visit 1 and for the duration of the study during both Screening and Treatment Periods: daytime and nighttime asthma symptom scores, and use of rescue albuterol. During the Screening Period, time of ICS/LABA administration will also be entered (this will be QD for ICS/LABAs that are only administered QD and BID otherwise); ipratropium use, if applicable, will be recorded as a concomitant medication. During the Treatment Period, time"
50,page_50,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 50 of 163of study drug administration will also be enter ed; time of ICS/LABA administration will then be recorded as a concomitant medication. 7.1.2.1 eDiary Compliance Requirement Between Visits 1 and 4, subjects will be required to demonstrate acceptable eDiary collections and compliance in order to be eligible for randomization. Subject participation may be terminated at any time during the study for the following reasons: •Subjects who are unable to meet the compliance requirement ( ≥70% subject completion of eDiary assessments) in the 7 days prior to Visit 4 will be considered a screen failure •Chronic failure in the judgment of the Investigator (eg. noncompliance with the eDiary), despite documentation at the site of repeated efforts to reinforce compliance. As defined for this study, compliance requires ≥70% subject completion of eDiary assessments for the duration of the study. The Sponsor may also instruct a site to discontinue a subject based on consistent noncompliance. 7.1.2.2 Rescue Medication Use Use of rescue medication will be recorded in the eDiary each morni ng (reflecting nighttime albuterol use) and each evening (reflecting daytime albuterol use). The subject will record the total number of “puffs” of albuterol used over the time period as the number of actuations on the canister. For example, when rescue medication is required and 2 actuations are inhaled, this should be recorded as 2 “puffs.” If the subject requires 4 actuations, this should be recorded as 4 “puffs.” 7.1.2.3 PEFR The PEFR is to be assessed using the Sponsor-provided PEFR meter, which will be paired with the eDiary via Bluetooth. Subjects will be dispensed and trained on the device at Visit 1. The eDiary will remind the subject BID when it is time to obtain their peak flow. Once the subject has completed the peak flow assessment, the data will be automatically transmitted from the PEFR to the eDiary. The best (highest) of 3 PEFR efforts BID will be captured in the eDiary. Subjects will complete the PEFR maneuver at home once in the morning and once in the evening before dosing with ICS/LABA (and ipratropium, if applicable) during the Screening Period, and once in the morning and once in the evening before dosing with study drug and ICS/LABA during the Treatment Period. In addition, PEFR should be measured before use of rescue albuterol. On the morning of all clinic visits, PEFR will be assessed at home prior to coming to the clinic. Subjects do not need to bring their peak fl ow meter to clinic visits, except to their final visit."
51,page_51,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 51 of 163At Visit 4, a PEFR stability limit will be automatic ally calculated by the eDiary. The stability limit is defined as the average of the available morning PEFR eDiary recordings during at least 4 of the last 7 days before Visit 4 (ie, the baseline PEFR), multiplied by 0.8. The PEFR stability limit will be used to help identify moderate asthma exacerbation as described in Section 7.1.3 . 7.1.2.4 Asthma Symptoms The subject will record their asthma symptom scores in the eDiary each morning (reflecting nighttime symptoms) and each evening (reflecting daytime symptoms). This symptom assessment should occur before determining PEFR and before administration of any medications during the Screening Period or randomized Treatment Period. Subjects will assess the symptoms of cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness and enter a single score that is inclusive of all symptoms for their daytime and nighttime symptom scores. Symptom scores will be used to help identify moderate asthma exacerbations as described in Section 7.1.3 . The following symptoms will be assessed:Daytime Symptom Score (determined in the evening) 0=No symptoms during the day1=Symptoms for 1 short period during the day 2=Symptoms for 2 or more short periods during the day 3=Symptoms for most of the day that did not affect my normal daily activities 4=Symptoms for most of the day that did affect my normal daily activities 5=Symptoms so severe that I could not go to work or perform normal daily activities Nighttime Symptom Score (determined in the morning) 0=No symptoms during the night 1=Symptoms causing me to wake once (or wake early) 2=Symptoms causing me to wake twice or more (including waking early) 3=Symptoms causing me to be awake for most of the night 4=Symptoms so severe that I did not sleep at all On clinic visit mornings, the nighttime symptom score will be determined and recorded at home prior to the clinic visit."

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 52 of 1637.1.2.5 Study Drug and Other Study Medication Compliance During the Screening Period, subjects will record the times of ICS/LABA dosing in the eDiary for practice. Rescue medication (albuterol ) use will also be recorded as described in Section 7.1.2.2 . During the Treatment Period, subjects will record the times of study drug dosing (morning and evening for BID treatments, morning only for the QD treatment) in the eDiary, except on the mornings of in-clinic dosing. ICS/LABA dosing during the Screening Period and during the Treatment Period will be recorded as concomitant medications. Study drug compliance will be checked at all visits . Any issues identified will be documented in the appropriate study file and reinstruction will be completed as necessary. 7.1.2.6 Symptom Worsening Assessment and eDiary Alert System The eDiary will be programmed to monitor for signs of a potential asthma exacerbation by monitoring decreases from baseline in morning or evening PEFR, increases from baseline in the number of puffs of albuterol used per da y, and/or increases in daytime or nighttime asthma symptom scores (Section 7.1.3 ). If any of these parameters meet the pre-defined thresholds for a moderate asthma exacerbation ( Table 7-1 ), the eDiary will generate an alert to the subject and the clinical site. This alert is intended to generate a contact between the subject and the Investigator to assess the status of the subject’s asthma. 7.1.3 Asthma Exacerbations 7.1.3.1 Definitions and Treatments The definitions of mild, moderate, and severe asth ma exacerbations to be used in this study are shown in Table 7-1 . These definitions are based on the ATS/ERS Statement “Asthma Control and Exacerbations, Standardizing Endpoints for Clinical Asthma Trials and Clinical Practice” (Reddel 2009)."

Deterioration of asthma is defined by the occurrence of 1 or more of the following for ≥2 consecutive days: •PEFR: a decline of ≥20% from baseline (see Section 7.1.2.3 for baseline PEFR stability limit calculation) •Rescue albuterol use: >4 puffs/day and ≥2×baseline •Symptoms: nighttime score that is >baseline and ≥2 OR a daytime score that is >baseline and ≥3 Mild A deterioration of asthma (as defined above) •Not requiring treatment OR •Requiring treatment with a systemic corticosteroid or a new or increased dose of ICS for <3 days Abbreviation: ER=emergency room. aSubjects who have died because of asthma will be considered to have had a severe asthma exacerbation regardless of whether they received systemic corticosteroids or were hospitalized. bWill be captured via the eDiary. cFor subjects who discontinue study drug, the Investigator will place subjects on appropriate asthma medications and the subjects will be encouraged to stay in the study and complete all remaining study visits and procedures. In cases where the subject meets the criteria for a moderate or severe asthma exacerbation, the Investigator or designee will enter the information into the eCRF on the asthma exacerbation page (refer to Section 7.1.3.3 ). A mild exacerbation will be captured by the eDiary. The recommended treatment for a moderate asthma exacerbation is a short course (5-7 days) of an increased dose of ICS or an additional ICS as outlined below, to help avoid progression to a severe exacerbation: •Budesonide 400 ∀g BID for 5 to 7 days"
54,page_54,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 54 of 163Note : Each actuation of Pulmicort Turbuhaler 200 ∀g delivers 160 ∀g budesonide from the mouthpiece, which is the same amount as deliv ered by an actuation of Pulmicort Flexhaler 180∀g. For an individual subject, the same increased dose of ICS or additional ICS should be used throughout the study when possible. The recommended (GINA 2017) treatment for a severe asthma exacerbation is a short course of oral corticosteroids as outlined below: •Prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day up to 50 mg for adults and adolescents) QD (preferably in the morning) for 5 to 7 days •Tapering the prednisolone dose is not needed if the treatment has been given for <2 weeks Additional information about treatment of asthma exacerbations is provided in Section 5.7.2.2.2 . 7.1.3.2 Onset and Duration of Asthma Exacerbations For a severe asthma exacerbation, the start date is defined as the start date of prescribed treatment with a systemic corticosteroid or the date of ER visit or hospitalization for asthma. The stop date is defined as the last day on which systemic corticosteroids were used, or the discharge date from the ER or hospital for asthma, whichever is later. For a moderate asthma exacerbation, the start date is defined as the first day of the increased dose of ICS or new ICS treatment (for example, adding inhaled budesonide) and the end date is defined as the last day of this treatment. For a mild asthma ex acerbation, the start date is defined as the first day of 2 consecutive days of deterioration and the end date is defined as the first day the subject no longer meets the deterioration criteria OR the last day of tr eatment, whichever is later. Treatment must be for less than 3 days to meet the criteria for a mild exacerbation. In order to ensure that the same event is not counted twice, consecutive exacerbations with start and stop dates ≤7 days apart will be considered to be the same event of the highest severity. Any exceptions and clarifications to this rule w ill be provided in detail in the statist ical analysis plan. 7.1.3.3 Approach for Capturing Asthma Exacerbations Asthma exacerbations occurring prior to Visit 1 will be considered part of the subject’s medical history and will be captured in the medical history eCRF."

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 55 of 163All moderate and severe asthma exacerbations occurring after Visit 4 must be captured on the asthma exacerbation eCRF page. Mild exacerbations will be identified and captured by the eDiary alert system. Asthma exacerbations will be considered expected study endpoints and will not be reported as AEs unless they meet the criteria for a seri ous adverse event (SAE). The start date for an SAE of severe asthma exacerbation should be th e start date of systemic corticosteroids or the date of ER visit or hospitalization for asthma as stated in Section 7.1.3.2 . 7.1.4 Subject Questionnaires Subject questionnaires (ACQ and the AQLQ + 12) will be completed on site utilizing study- supplied electronic questionnaire devices (not the subject’s eDiary) at specified visits throughout the study. 7.1.4.1 ACQ The ACQ will be completed at Visits 2 and 4 through 10/Final Visit, or if the subject withdraws consent/discontinues study drug, at the Treatment Discontinuation or Study Withdrawal Visit, before any other study procedures are performed. The ACQ ( Appendix 9 ; Juniper 1999a) was developed to measure asthma control and has been fully validated for use in adults and in children 6 to 17 years of age. International guidelines for the treatment of asthma have identified that the primary clinical goal of asthma management is to optimize asthma control (minimization of symptoms, activity limitation, bronchoconstriction, and rescue bronchodilator use) and thus reduce the risk of life- threatening exacerbations and long-term m orbidity. The ACQ was developed to meet these criteria by measuring both the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control, which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of treatment. The ACQ, comprising 7 questions, is completed in the clinic and requires subjects to recall their experiences during the previous week (7 days) prior to the study visit. The ACQ-5, -6, and -7 (questions 1-5, 1-6, and 1-7, respectively) have all been validated. The ACQ-5 measures 5 symptoms (woken at night by sympto ms, wake in the morning with symptoms, limitation of daily activities, shortness of breath, and wheeze); the ACQ-6 is these symptom measurements plus daily rescue medication use as recalled by the subject; and the ACQ-7 is the ACQ-6 plus airway caliber as measured by pre-bronchodilator FEV 1percent predicted. Each question is scored on a 7-point scale (generally, 0=no impairment, 6=maximum impairment), the questions are equally weighted, and the ACQ score is the mean of the item responses and therefore ranges from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). 7.1.4.2 AQLQ +12 The AQLQ +12 will be completed at Visits 4 through 10/Final Visit, or at the Treatment Discontinuation or Study Withdrawal Visit, after the ACQ and before any other study procedures are performed."
56,page_56,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 56 of 163The AQLQ +12 is a 32-item validated subject-administered questionnaire that was developed to measure the functional problems (physical, emoti onal, social and occupational) that are most troublesome to adults ( ≥18 years of age) and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) with asthma (Juniper 2005, Juniper 1999b, Juniper 1994, Juniper 1993, Juniper 1992). The 32 questions in the AQLQ +12 are in 4 domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function, and environmental stimuli). All 4 domains contain standard specific questions relating to each domain. Subjects are asked to think about how they have been during the previous 2 weeks and to respond to each of the 32 questions on a 7-point scale (7=no impairment to 1=severe impairment). The overall AQLQ +12 score is the mean of all 32 responses and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains. A change in score of 0.5 on the 7-point scale is the smallest change that can be considered clinically important, known as the minimal clinically important difference. Additi onal information about the AQLQ +12 is provided in Appendix 10 . 7.1.5 F ENO The F ENOwill be collected at Visits 2, 4, 5, 7, and 10/Final Visit, or at the Treatment Discontinuation or Study Withdrawal Visit, prior to spirometry. The procedure is described in Appendix 11 . Measurement of F ENOis a noninvasive and established clinical biomarker for airway inflammation that is recommende d by the ATS to monitor eosinophilic airway inflammation in subjects with asthma (Dweik 2011). Each site will be provided with a F ENOdevice (Niox Vero®[Circassia Pharmaceuticals Inc., Chicago, Illinois, US]) and all required accessories (eg, test kits) and receive training on its use and care ( Appendix 11 ). Clinically meaningful increases and decreases in F ENOare defined in Section 9.5.3.9 . 7.2 Safety Assessments Safety assessments for this study are AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, 24-hour Holter monitoring, and clinical laboratory tests. 7.2.1 Medical/Surgical/Asthma Exacerbation History and Physical Examination Medical history will be collected at Visit 1 and updated during the Screening Period, if necessary. The number of asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, emergency room visits, and/or hospitalizations within the previous 12 months will be collected at Visit 1. A complete physical examination w ill be pe rformed at Visits 1 and 10/Final Visit. The complete physical examination will include the following: •Weight, general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck (including thyroid), lymph nodes, chest, heart, abdomen, extremities, and nervous system"

When the subject returns to the clinic the follo wing day, the quality of the Holter monitor recordings will be assessed at the site. If the first Holter monitoring attempt is not successful (ie, <18 hours of acceptable quality recording), th e Holter monitor will be reconnected for another 24 hours using a new Holt er monitor hook-up kit. The subject will be instructed to continue his/her medications as per study prot ocol. The subject will return the following day for removal of the Holter monitor. This second attempt should be scheduled so that the Holter monitoring will be completed at least 24 hours before administration of the morning dose of study drug and ICS/LABA at Visit 4. If the Holter monitoring recording remains inadequate on the second attempt, the subject will not be eligible to participate in the Holter monitoring sub-study, but DOES NOT need to be excluded from the full study. If clinically significant findings (as defined in Holter monitor exclusion criteria [Section 5.5]) are noted on any of the Holter monitor recordings, there will be no further attempts; the subject will be considered a screen failure and will not be eligible to enroll in the full study."

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 62 of 1637.3 AEs 7.3.1 Performing AE Assessments The Investigator is responsible for promptly documenting and reporting all AEs observed during the study in the subject’s eCRF and on the AE reporting form. If the AE is unexpected, the Investigator should report the AE immediately to the Sponsor. In addition, certain AEs are classified as ‘serious’ (as described in Section 7.3.9 ) and must be reported no later than 24 hours after the Inve stigator recogni zes/classifies the event as an SAE to the Sponsor or its designee. In the case of SAEs, after discussing the details of the event, the Investigator and the Medical Monitor may discontinue the subject from study drug. 7.3.2 AE Definitions The following definitions of terms are guided by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceut icals for Human Use, the US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 312.32) and European Union Directive 2001/83/EC and are included herein. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (eg, off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. Adverse events include, but are not limited to the following: •Any symptom or condition not previously reported by the subject (medical history) •An exacerbation of a pre-existing symptom or condition •A significant increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing episodic event or condition •A drug interaction •A condition first detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study An AE does notinclude the following: •Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, bl ood transfusion); the condition th at leads to the procedure is an AE (eg, bleeding esophageal varices, dental caries)"
63,page_63,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 63 of 163•Overdose of either study drug or concurrent me dication without any clinical signs or symptoms •Abnormal laboratory values that are not clinically significant; if accompanied by signs/symptoms, the signs or sy mptoms are considered an AE 7.3.3 Pre-Randomization AEs Any AE occurring from the time the subject signs informed consent until the subject is randomized will be summarized as medical history and not as an AE unless the event meets the definition of an SAE as defined in Section 7.3.9 . 7.3.4 Severity The Investigator must categorize the severity of each AE according to the following guidelines: Mild : associated with no limitation of usual activities or only slight discomfort; generally not requiring alteration or cessation of study drug ad ministration; and/or not needing therapeutic intervention Moderate : associated with l imitation of usual activities or significant discomfort; generally requiring alteration or cessation of study drug administration; and/or requiring therapeutic intervention Severe : associated with inab ility of subject to carry out usual activities or very marked discomfort; considered to be life threatening; resulting in significant disability or incapacity; and requiring therapeutic intervention 7.3.5 Relationship to Study Drug The Investigator will assess causal relationship between investigational product and each AE, and answer yes/no to the question, “Do you consid er that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?” For SAEs, causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure, the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’. 7.3.6 Asthma Exacerbations and Associated Symptoms of Asthma Asthma exacerbations may occur as a manifestation of asthma despite using standardized drug treatment or treatment(s) with combination therapies. As a result, the Sponsor has classified an asthma exacerbation as a protocol-specified expected event, and it is not to be reported as an AE unless considered an SAE. Moderate and severe asthma exacerbations must be captured on the asthma exacerbations eCRF; mild asthma exacerbations will be captured by the eDiary."
64,page_64,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 64 of 163Since asthma exacerbations are expected events in this study, any individual case safety reports received related to an exacerbation of asthma will not be submitted on an expedited basis as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction unless further assessment is required by the Sponsor. Associated symptoms of asthma (eg, wheeze, breathlessness, cough), the disease under study, will not be reported as AEs, unless considered an SAE. 7.3.7 AEs of Special Interest Certain AEs have been identified as adverse events of special interest (AESIs) due to the class of drugs being studied. These AEs will be captured through spontaneous reports, and the reporting of these AESIs will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Some events are described below but this is not a comprehensive list of all AESIs. 7.3.7.1 LAMA Effects Known effects of LAMAs include dry mouth, cardiovascular effects, ocular disorders, urinary retention, and gastrointestinal disorders. 7.3.7.2 Paradoxical Bronchospasm Monitoring for paradoxical bronchospasm will occ ur at Visits 4, 5, 7, and 10/Final Visit at 15 and 30 minutes post-dose. In this study, paradoxical bronchospasm is defined as a reduction in FEV 1of >20% from baseline with associated symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, or cough that occur within 30 minutes post-dosing. Baseline is defined as the mean of the FEV 1values obtained 60 and 30 minutes prior to study drug and ICS/LABA administration at that visit. 7.3.8 Clinical Laboratory AEs Many laboratory abnormalities observed during the course of a study will be included under a reported AE describing a clinical syndrome (eg, elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine in the setting of an AE of renal failure, or decreased hemoglobin in a case of bleeding esophageal varices). Isolated labor atory abnormalities should be reported as AEs if they are considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator. Criteria for a ‘clinically signi ficant’ labor atory abnorm ality are the following: •A laboratory abnormality that leads to a dose- limiting toxicity (eg, an a bnormality that results in study drug dose suspension or treatment discontinuation) •A laboratory abnormality that results in any therapeutic intervention (ie, concomitant medication or therapy) •Other laboratory abnormality judged by the Investigator to be of any particular clinical concern (eg, significant fall in hemoglobin not requiring transfusion)"
65,page_65,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 65 of 163•For laboratory abnormaliti es that do not meet the above criteria, but are outside of normal range (eg, < or > normal reference range), the Investigator should indicate whether the value is clinically significant or not clinically significant for the subject. 7.3.9 SAEs An AE is considered ‘serious’ if, in the view of the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: •Death •A life-threatening AE •In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization •A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions •A congenital anomaly/birth defect Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious wh en, based upon appropriate judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Hospitalization for a pre-existing condition (including elective procedures) that has not worsened does not constitute an SAE. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered life threatening if, in the view of the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse reaction or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the current IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 7.3.9.1 Reporting SAEs In agreeing to the provisions of this protocol, the Investigator accepts all legal responsibilities for AE identification, documentation, grading, assignment of causality, and prompt notification of SAEs to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department or designee. All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor Pharmacovigilance Department or designee no later than 24 hours after the Investigator recognizes/classifies the event as an SAE. All SAEs should be documented and reported using the eCRF. At a minimum, a description of the event and the"
66,page_66,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 66 of 163Investigator’s judgment of causality must be provided at the time of the initial report using the appropriate form (eg, SAE report form). After the initial report, as necessary, the Investigator must provide any additional information on an SAE to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department or designee within 2 working days after receiving the information. Follow-up information will be a detailed written report that may include copies of hospital records, case reports, autopsy reports, and other pertinent documents. For subjects who complete the entire study, all AEs/SAEs will be collected through 14 (+2) days after the last dose of study drug via a follow-up telephone call (see Section 8.11). For subjects who discontinue randomized study drug but are planning to continue study participation (ie, planning to complete all r emaining study visits and procedures), see Section 8.9.1 , Treatment Discontinuation. For subjects who withdraw from the study, see Section 8.9.2 , Study Withdrawal . Post-treatment SAEs following the last dose of st udy drug must be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department as described in Section 7.3.9.3 . The Investigator is responsible for continuing to report any new or relevant follow-up information that s/he learns about the SAE. 7.3.9.2 Supplemental Investigations of SAEs The Investigator and supporting personnel responsible for subject care should discuss with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee any need for supplemental investigations of SAEs. If additional assessments are conducted, results must be reported to the Sponsor. If a subject dies during study participation and if a postm ortem examination is performed, a copy of the autopsy report should be submitted to the Sponsor. 7.3.9.3 Notification of Post-Study SAEs Investigators are not obligated to actively follow subjects after completion of the study. However, if the Investigator becomes aware of a post-study SAE occurring within the 14 days following the last dose, the SAE must be reported to the Sponsor, whether or not the event is attributable to study drug. All SAEs mu st be reported to the Sponsor no later than 24 hours after the Investigator recognizes/classifies the event as an SAE. 7.3.9.4 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Notification of SAEs The Investigator is responsible for promptly notifying her/his Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of all SAEs, including any follow-up information, occurring at their site and any SAE regulatory report, including any follow-up reports received from the Sponsor. Documentation of IRB/IEC submission must be retained for each safety report. The Investigator is also responsible for notifying the Sponsor if their IRB/IEC requires revisions to the ICF or other measures based on its review of an SAE Report."

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 67 of 1637.3.9.5 Health Authority Safety Reports The Sponsor or its representatives will submit a safety report to the appropriate regulatory agencies for any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected within the timeframe specified by each regulatory agency. The Sponsor or its representatives will send c opies of each submitted safety report to Investigators actively participating in Pearl-sponsored clinical studies. Safety reports must also be submitted to the appropriate IRBs/IECs as soon as possible. Documentation of submission to the IRB/IEC must be retained for each safety report. 7.3.10 Post-Study Follow-Up of AEs and SAEs Any AEs/SAEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last AE assessment in the study are to be followed up by the Investigator for as long as medically indicated but without further recording in the eCRF. The Sponsor retains the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 7.3.11 Overdose An overdose is defined as any dose greater than the highest dose investigated in this study that results in clinical signs and symptoms. In the event of a study drug overdose, the Investigator should use their best clinical judgment in treating the overdose, and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor should also be contacted. Investigators should refer to the relevant document(s) for detailed information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, AEs, and other significant data pertaining to the study drug(s) being administered. Such document(s) may include but are not limited to the IB for GP MDI and approved product labeling for open-label products. 7.3.12 Pregnancy To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy from Visit 1 until study completion must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed in its entirety to ascertain outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy should be recorded on a paper pregnancy report form and reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department or designee. Pr egnancy follow-up should be recorded on the same pregnancy paper form and should include possible relationship to the study drug in response to the pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE report form. 7.3.13 Paternal Exposure If a male subject's partner becomes pregnant during the course of the study, it must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator learning of its occurrence."

Members of the DMC will review summaries of these safety data generated externally and independently of the Sponsor in a semi-blinded or unblinded manner at predetermined intervals. If significant safety issues arise in between scheduled meetings, ad hoc meetings will be scheduled to review the data. Based on the safety implications of the data, the DMC may recommend modification or termination of the study. 7.4 Termination of Study An Investigator may choose to discontinue study participation at any time, for any reason and should provide sufficient notice per the te rms of the contract with the Sponsor. The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons. Such a termination must be implemented by the Investigator, if instructed to do so by the Sponsor, in a timeframe that is compatible with the subjects’ welfare."

The overall schedule of events is provided in Table 8-1 . A detailed schedule is provided for the timing of assessments of all post-randomization visits in Table 8-2 . A detailed schedule of events for 24-hour Holter monitoring sub-study at Visits 3 and 7 is provided in Table 8-3 . 8.1 General Study Considerations •In order to minimize diurnal variance, sites should make every effort to assess subjects in clinic at the same time throughout the study. The first dose of study drug administered in the clinic should be planned to occur at approximately the same time the subject will typically administer study drug in the morning at home. However, sites should also make every effort to ensure that the morning study drug dosing occurs before 10 am. •The subject should then be advised that subsequent morning study drug dosing should occur at approximately the same time every day and that evening study drug dosing should occur as close as possible to 12 hour s from the time of morning study drug dosing. •Sites should discuss the importance of study drug dosing at a consistent time linked to the time of study drug dosing at randomization. For example, if the study drug dose at randomization is administered at 8 am, all subsequent doses should be administered as close as possible to 8 am and 8 pm. In this case, all visits should be scheduled to support in-clinic dosing as close to 8 am (the timing of the initial dose at Visit 4) as possible. •Subjects will be required to return to clinic at approximately the same time as Visit 1 for all treatment visits (±1 hour) and dosing time should not exceed 10 am. Subjects will be required to remain at the clinic until completion of all protocol-defined assessments. •The day before study visits, sites should c ontact subjects to confirm timing of the evening study drug dose and the expected timing of the in-clinic study drug dose. If the in-clinic dose will occur later than the subject typically takes their morning dose, the subject must be instructed to take their evening dose 12 hours prior to the expected in-clinic dosing time. Sites should instruct each subject as follows during this reminder phone call: - To take their last dose the evening before the scheduled visit - To bring their study medications and eDiary with them to the clinic- To withhold all inhaled medications (oral and intranasal) for at least 6 hours prior to PFTs •Subjects who inadvertently took asthma medication(s) within 6 hours of the start of study procedures must have their clinic visit delayed (but not to exceed study drug dosing by 10 am) or rescheduled within the specified visit window. •Subjects must not ingest xanthine and/or xanthine analogue (caffeine)-containing foods or beverages or caffeine-containing medications for at least 6 hours prior to each study visit and for the duration of each study visit. Examples of such products include coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola. Decaffe inated beverages are acceptable."
70,page_70,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 70 of 163•Site personnel will instruct subjects not to take any asthma medications without site personnel permission during a clinic visit until all study procedures have been completed, and the subject is discharged. Site personnel should take every precaution to prevent subject use of asthma medications during the study visit. Subjects will be asked to abstain wherever possible from using rescue albute rol during study clinic visits. If a subject is experiencing severe symptoms and requires albuterol for relief of asthma symptoms at any time during a study visit, site personnel must note the time and justification of use in the subject’s chart and all subsequent spirometry assessments should be stopped. However, safety assessments should be continued at the discretion of the Investigator."

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 90 of 1639 STATISTICAL METHODS 9.1 Introduction This is a double-blind, parallel group study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of GP MDI compared to Placebo MDI and open-label Spiriva Respimat over a 24-week Treatment Period in approximately 1125 subjects with persistent asthma who are symptomatic despite treatment with an ICS/LABA or ICS/LABA + tiotropium. During the Screening and Treatment Periods, subjects will remain on their ICS/LABA regimen. At randomizatio n, subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:2:2:1 ratio to 1 of the following 5 treatment groups: •GP MDI 28.8 μg BID (n=250) •GP MDI 14.4 μg BID (n=250) •GP MDI 7.2 μg BID (n=250) •Placebo MDI BID (n=250) •Spiriva Respimat 2.5 μg QD (n=125) The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of 3 doses of GP MDI compared to Placebo MDI and Spiriva Respimat on lung function over 24 weeks. 9.2 Protocol Variables The study endpoints are found in Section 3. 9.3 Analysis Sets and Estimands 9.3.1 Analysis Sets The following analysis sets are defined in this study: •The Intent-to Treat (ITT) analysis set is defined as the data from all sub jects who are randomized to treatment and use any amount of the study treatment. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they were assigned at randomization. Data obtained after discontinuation of treatment, but prior to withdrawal from the study, will be included in the ITT analysis set. •The Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) analysis set is a subset of the ITT analysis set and is defined as the data from all subjects with post-randomization d ata obtained prior to discontinuation from treatment. Any data collected after completion of or discontinuation from randomized study medication will be excluded from the mITT analysis set but will still be included in the ITT analysis set. Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment group. It is noted that a subject who used a study treatment, but took less than 1 full dose of treatment, will qualify for this analysis set. The mITT"
91,page_91,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 91 of 163analysis set will be the primary analysis set for all efficacy analyses. Note: The knowledge that a subject did not have an exacerbation constitutes an efficacy assessment. •The Safety analysis set is defined as data from all subjects who are randomized to treatment and receive an y amount of the study treatment. However, subjects will be analyzed according to treatment received rather than randomized. If a subject receives more than 1 randomized treatment, they will be analyzed and included in summaries according to the treatment they received the most. Subjects receivi ng no study treatment will be excluded, as will subjects who have no post-dose safety assessments. Note: The statement that a subject has no AEs also constitutes a safety assessment. •The Holter Monitoring analysis set is defined as all subjects in the Safety analysis set who had at least 18 hours of acceptable quality Holter monitoring data at both Visit 3 (Holter Baseline) and Visit 7 (Week 12). Data judged to be impacted by major protocol deviations will be determined prior to database lock and excluded per the statist ical protocol deviation plan. 9.3.2 Estimands Three estimands are of interest in this trial: •The primary estimand of interest is the Efficacy Estimand, defined as the effect of the randomized treatments in all subjects assuming continuation of randomized treatments for the duration of the study, regardless of actual compliance. •The second estimand of interest is the Attributable Estimand, defined as the effect of treatment in subjects attributable to the randomized treatment. For this estimand, discontinuation of randomized treatment for reasons such as tolerability or lack of efficacy is considered a bad outcome. •The third estimand of interest is the Treatment Policy Estimand, defined as the effect of randomized treatment over the study period regardless of whether randomized treatment is continued. Analysis of the Efficacy Estimand will be conducted using the mITT analysis set where only data obtained prior to subjects discontinuing from randomized treatment will be utilized. This assumes that efficacy observed on treatment is reflective of what would have occurred after discontinuation of randomized treatment had they remained on treatment. Analysis of the Attributable Estimand will be conducted in the mITT analysis set, but data that are missing due to treatment discontinuation will be imputed based on the 95 thor the 5th percentile of the reference arm’s distribution if the reason is reasonably attributable to tolerability or lack of efficacy. The 95 thpercentile would apply to an endpoint for which a higher value is a worse outcome, while the 5thpercentile would apply to an endpoint for which a higher value is a better outcome. More detail about the computation of the Attributable Estimand will be provided in the SAP."
92,page_92,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 92 of 163Analysis of the Treatment Policy Estimand will be conducted in the ITT analysis set, in which all observed data will be utilized rega rdless of whether subject s remain on rando mized treatment. 9.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and baseline characteristics data will be summarized by treatment for the mITT and Safety analysis sets. 9.5 Efficacy Analysis All efficacy assessments are relative to baseline. Baseline for spirometry endpoints will be defined as the mean of the 60- and 30-minute pre-dose values at the randomization visit. Though all possible comparisons will be performed, the key comparisons will be those between each dose of GP MDI with Placebo MDI and, for benchmarking purposes, Spiriva Respimat. 9.5.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis The primary analysis will be conducted for the Efficacy Estimand where only data obtained prior to subjects discontinuing from study drug will be utilized. Analyses will also be conducted for the Attributable and Treatment Policy Estimands. For the primary comparisons, the null hypothesis for each pair-wise comparison will be that the mean treatment difference is zero (mean treatment effects are equal). The alternative hypothesis is that the mean treatment difference is not zero (mean treatment effects are not equal). All p-values will be reported as 2-sided. 9.5.1.1 Change From Baseline in FEV 1AUC 0-4 Change from baseline in FEV 1AUC 0-4will be analyzed using a linear repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The model will include treatment, visit, background fixed-dose ICS/LABA combination product, and treatment-by-visit interaction as categorical covariates and baseline FEV 1, percentage reversibility to ipratropium, and blood eosinophil count at screening as continuous covariates. An unstructured matrix will be used to model the variance-covariance structure. If this model fails to converge, an alternative structure will be employed as pre-specified in the SAP. Contrasts will be used to obtain estimates of the treatment differences at Week 24. Two-sided p-values and point estimates with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be produced for each treatment difference. The FEV 1AUC 0-4will be calculated for the changes from baseline using the trapezoidal rule and will be normalized by dividing by the time (in hours) from dosing to the last measurement included (ie, 4 hours). For the Efficacy Estimand analysis, only 1 non-missing, post-dose value is required for the calculation of FEV 1AUC 0-4. Actual time from dosing will be used in the calculation if available; otherwise, scheduled time will be used."

Analyses will also be conducted for the Attributable and Treatment Policy Estimands. 9.5.2.1 Change From Baseline in Morning Pre-Dose Trough FEV 1 Change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV 1 will be analyzed using a linear repeated measures ANCOVA model. The model will be similar to the one used for FEV 1 AUC 0-4. Contrasts will be used to obtain estimates of the treatment differences at Week 24. Two-sided p-values and point estimates with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be produced for each treatment difference 9.5.2.2 Rate of Moderate/Severe Asthma Exacerbations The ratio of the rates of moderate/severe asthma exacerbations will be analyzed with negative binomial regression. Asthma exacerbations will be considered separate events if more than 7 days are between the recorded stop date of the earlier event and start date of the later event. Time at risk of experiencing an exacerbation will be used as an offset variable in the model. Time during an exacerbation or in the 7 days following an exacerbation will not be included in the calculation of exposure. Treatments will be compared adjusting for baseline post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV 1, baseline asthma exacerbation history, blood eosinophil count at screening, background ICS/LABA, and reversibility to ipratropium. The number and percentage of subjects with exacerbations in each treatment group will be tabulated. 9.5.2.3 Change From Baseline in ACQ-7, ACQ-5, and AQLQ +12 Change from baseline in ACQ-7, ACQ-5, and AQLQ +12 will be analyzed using a linear repeated measures ANCOVA model. The model will include treatment, visit, background fixed-dose ICS/LABA combination product, and treatment-by-visit interaction as categorical covariates and baseline post-bronchodilator FEV 1percent predicted, baseline score for the patient-reported outcome instrument, percen tage reversibility to ipratropium, and bl ood eosinophil count at screening as continuous covariates. Contrasts will be used to obtain estimates of the treatment differences at Week 24. Two-sided p-values and point estimates with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be produced for each treatment difference. 9.5.3 Other Efficacy Analyses Other efficacy analyses will be conducted for the Efficacy Estimand only. 9.5.3.1 Percentage of Responders in ACQ-5, ACQ-6, ACQ-7, and AQLQ +12 Responder analyses will be performed for ACQ-5, ACQ-6, ACQ-7, and AQLQ +12 at Week 24 and over the Treatment Period.

Subjects who discontinue treatment for any reason will be classified as non-responders. Logistic regression will be used to compare the treatment groups with background ICS/LABA as categorical covariates and baseline instrument score, blood eosinophil count at screening, percentage reversibility to iprat ropium, and baseline post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV 1as continuous covariates. P-values and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be produced for each treatment comparison. 9.5.3.2 Change from Baseline in ACQ-6 Change from baseline in ACQ-6 will be analyzed using a linear repeated measures ANCOVA model. The model will include treatment, visit, background fixed-dose ICS/LABA combination product, and treatment-by -visit interaction as categorical covariates and baseline post-bronchodilator FEV 1percent predicted, baseline score for the patient- reported outcome instrument, percentage reve rsibility to ipratropium, and blood eosinophil count at screening as continuous covariates. Contrasts will be used to obtain estimates of the treatment differences at Week 24. Two-sided p-v alues and point estimates with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be produced for each treatment difference. 9.5.3.3 Time to First Asthma Exacerbation Time to first moderate or severe asthma exacerbation will be analyzed with a Cox regression model to compare the treatment groups, adjusted for asthma exacerbation history, background ICS/LABA, reversibility to iprat ropium, blood eosinophil count at screening, and baseline post-bronchodilator FEV 1percent predicted. Time to first severe asthma exacerbation and time to first exacerbation of any severity will each be analyzed in a manner similar to the analysis of time to first moderate or severe asthma exacerbation. 9.5.3.4 Rate of Severe Asthma Exacerbations or Exacerbations of Any Severity Severe asthma exacerbations and asthma exacerbations of any severity will each be analyzed in a manner similar to the analysis of the rate of moderate/severe asthma exacerbations. 9.5.3.5 Peak FEV 1 Change from baseline in peak FEV 1will be analyzed at each clinic visit using a linear repeated measures ANCOVA model. The model will be similar to the one used for the primary analyses. 9.5.3.6 Percentage of Symptom-Free Days, Rescue-Free Days, and Asthma Control Days The percentages of symptom-free days, rescue-free days, and asthma control days will each be analyzed over the entire Treatment Period. A dditionally, analyses will be conducted over each 4-week interval in the study. An ANCOVA model will be used with treatment, the"

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 95 of 163number of the relevant 4-week interval (interval 1 to 6), asthma exacerbation history, background ICS/LABA, and the treatment-by-4-week interval interaction as categorical covariates. Baseline percentage of endpoint days (where endpoint is symptom free, rescue free, or asthma control per model), baseline post-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted, percentage reversibility to i pratropium, and blood eosinophil count at screening will be continuous covariates. 9.5.3.7 Rescue Medication Usage The mean daily number of puffs of rescue medication use will be calculated overall and for each of the 4-week intervals during the Treatment Period. For every period of time for which the mean number of puffs of re scue medication will be calculated, missing values will be ignored in both the numerator and denominator. As such, the denominator will be adjusted based on the number of days (including half days) with non-missing values. A linear repeated measures ANCOVA model will be used to analyze change from baseline in average daily rescue albuterol use. The m odel will include treatment, the number of the relevant 4-week interval (interval 1 to 6), asthma exacerbation history, background ICS/LABA, and the treatment-by-4-week interval interaction as categorical covariates and blood eosinophil count at screening, baseline daily rescue albuterol use, percentage reversibility to iprat ropium, and ba seline post-bronchodilator FEV 1percent predicted as continuous covariates. An unstructured variance-covariance matrix will be fit. If this model fails to converge, an alternative structure will be employed as pre-sp ecified in the SAP. Contrasts will be used to obtain estimates of the treatment differences over 24 weeks. Two-sided p-values and point estimates with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be produced for each treatment difference. 9.5.3.8 Change From Baseline in Morning PEFR and Evening PEFR Change from baseline in morning PEFR and evening PEFR will be analyzed over 4-week intervals using a linear repeated measures ANCOVA model. 9.5.3.9 F ENO Change from baseline in F ENOwill be analyzed using a linear repeated measures ANCOVA model. The model will be similar to the one used for the primary analyses. Clinically meaningful increases and decreases from baseline in F ENOwill be summarized descriptively by visit. The clinically meaningful changes are defined below: •A clinically meaningful increase in F ENOis defined as an increase of 20% or more from baseline if the baseline is 50 parts per billio n (ppb) or more or an incr ease of more than 10 ppb from bas eline if the baseline is less than 50 ppb."

At each visit, the percentage of subjects with F ENOless than 25 ppb, between 25 and less than 50 ppb, and at least 50 ppb will be summarized descriptively by treatment. 9.5.3.10 CompEx Time to first CompEx event will be analyzed with a Cox regression model to compare the treatment groups adjusted for asthma exacerbation history, background ICS/LABA, reversibility to iprat ropium, blood eosinophil count at screening, and baseline post- bronchodilator FEV 1percent predicted. Subjects who do not experience a CompEx event will be censored at their Week 24 Visit. 9.5.4 Subgroup Analyses Analyses of the primary, secondary, and othe r endpoints may be performed by various subgroups. In addition to baseline and d emographic subgroups, other factors (T-helper cell type 2 high or low, GINA classification, etc) w ill be used to create subgroups of interest. All subgroup analyses will be described fully in the SAP. 9.5.5 Type I Error Control The Type I error rate will be controlled within the primary and secondary efficacy analyses. As a general strategy, the Type I error rate will be strongly controlled within the primary analysis. The Type I error rate will also be controlled within the family of secondary analyses within a GP MDI treatment group. Primary analysis testing will be conducted in descending dose order, with the highest dose of GP MDI tested against placebo at the nominal alpha. Testing will continue through the GP MDI doses as long as the results are successful. Testing will stop if any comparison of GP MDI versus placebo fails to meet statistical significance. Through this strategy, the Type I error rate of the primary analyses of all 3 GP MDI doses versus placebo will be strictly controlled to the nominal alpha. The secondary analyses for each dose of GP MDI versus placebo will proceed only if the primary analysis for that GP MDI dose is successful. The Type I error rate within the secondary analyses of each GP MDI dose versus placebo will be controlled with a multiple comparison procedure as specified in the SAP."

Adverse events will be tabulated at the level of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term. The version of MedDRA current at the time of database lock will be used in the tabulations and listings. Tabulations will be broken down by severity, seriousness, AEs leading to discontinuation, and by relationship to study drug. No hypothesis tests will be performed. 9.6.2 AESIs The AESIs will be tabulated by treatment group. Additional analyses may be performed and will be detailed in the SAP. 9.6.3 Clinical Laboratory Measurements Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation [SD], and range) of change from baseline values will be tabulated for each treatment and each assessment time. For clinical laboratory measurements, baseline will be defined as the last available value prior to randomization. Potenti ally clinically significant values will be identified and summarized. 9.6.4 Vital Signs Summary statistics (mean, median, SD, and range) of change from baseline will be tabulated by vital sign parameter and treatment for each scheduled assessment time. For vital signs, baseline will be defined as the average of the values prior to dosing on the day of randomization. In addition, potenti ally clinically significant values will be identified and summarized. 9.6.5 ECGs Summary statistics (mean, median, SD, and range) for absolute values and change from baseline will be tabulated by ECG parameter and treatment for each scheduled assessment time. For ECG parameters, baseline values will be defined as the last value obtained prior to randomization. In addition, potenti ally clinically significant values will be identified and summarized. 9.6.6 24-Hour Holter Monitoring Holter monitoring endpoints are listed in Section 3.5. Change from baseline in the ventricular and supraventricular variables will be analyzed with nonparametric methods. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test will be used to produce p-values for the pairwise comparison of treatments. The med ian treatment differences will be presented with 95% confidence intervals based on the Hodges-Lehmann approach. The number of"

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 98 of 163subjects experiencing a ventricular couplet, ventricular run, supraventricular couplet, and supraventricular run at Week 12 will be analyzed with a logistic regression model. Alternative analysis methods may be employed if found to be appropriate and will be pre- specified in the SAP. Additionally, for the endpoints that involve incidences and proportions of events, those values will be summarized by treatment. 9.7 Sample Size Consideration A sample size of 1125 subjects (250 subjects per double-blind treatment group, 125 subjects in the open-label Spiriva Respimat treatment group) will provide approximately 93% power to detect a 120 mL difference between the GP MDI treatment groups and Placebo MDI in the analysis of change from baseline in FEV 1AUC 0-4at Week 24. The assumed SD is 348 mL at each visit. The 2-sided alpha for each pairwise comparison is 0.05. Comparisons of GP MDI to Spiriva Respimat will be focused on estimation as the study is not formally powered to demonstrate non-inferiority or superiority. For the secondary endpoint of change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV 1at Week 24, it is assumed that the difference between GP MDI and Placebo MDI is 90 mL, with each treatment group having an SD of 317 mL at each visit. Under these assumptions, the study will have 80% power to declare GP MDI superior to Placebo MDI in the analysis of change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV 1at Week 24. The Type I error rate will be strongly controlled for the primary analyses. The Type I error control strategy for the primary and second ary analyses are described in Section 9.5.5 . This sample size assumes that approximately 20% of randomized subjects will have discontinued study drug prior to Week 24. 9.8 Data Validation and Transformation In general, the distribution of spiromet ry measures is well approximated by a normal distribution. Under some circumstances, however, extreme and atypical values can arise. Such values have high influence on estimatio n of variance parameters and on standard errors of fixed effect estimates. The distribution of residuals and influence statistics will be examined to identify such cases prior to unblinding. In the event that a single or small number of such outlying values are found to exist and found to be highly influential, the effects may be ameliorated either by transformation or by removal of the outlier. Transformations to be considered may include the logarithmic transformation, or normal rank transformations. Any changes will be documented prior to unblinding and, where outliers are removed, sensitivity analyses including those values will be reported. Changes in spirometry measures from baseline, and from time point to time point will be examined graphically before data base lock, and before unblinding, as part of data quality management."

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 104 of 163responsible for the accuracy of the data entered into the study databases and for the accuracy of the analyses conducted. 2.Authorship and Publication Committee: The Sponsor, in collaboration with the Investigators, will establish the appropriate authorship and responsibility for drafting study documents in accordance with the principles of the ICMJE and ISMPP. It is anticipated that a publication committee will be formed to assume oversight of these activities. All manus cripts will be reviewed and agreed upon before submission for publication by all authors. 3.Sponsor Review of External Manuscripts: Consistent with the first bullet point, drafts of any and all publications or presentations that may arise from this study must be submitted at least 30 days prior to submission for publication or presentation to the Sponsor for review, approval, and to ensure consistency with the policy in this protocol. The Sponsor will have the right to request appropriate modification to correct facts and to represent its opinions, or th e opinions of the publication committee, if these differ with the proposed publication. 4.Confidentiality: Investigators will conduct all interactions with the Sponsor and with third parties consistent with the executed confidentiality agreements. While publication, by intention, presents the critical scientific d ata in a public forum, some information (such as future plans, results of nonclinical studies, or chemical formulae) may st ill need to remain confidential. 5.Medical Journal Review: Consistent with the intention of the Sponsor to publish the study in a fair and accurate manner, the Sponsor supports diligence in the publication review process of medical journals. Accordingly, upon request, all pertinent study data and information will be made available as supplemental information for journal editors and reviewers to evaluate and audit, eg, protocol and amendments, data tabulations, etc. The journal and reviewers will need to make arrangements to maintain the confidentiality of such supplemental information, where relevant, and the Sponsor will make suitable arrangements to ensure that the identity of journal reviewers is kept confidential. Records will be maintained of reviewers and the respective documents and datasets that were reviewed by each of them. 6.Reporting of Clinical Trials Results: To provide transparency in the conduct and reporting of randomized clinical trials, the Sponsor reports clinical findings based on the guidance of The CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement (Moher 2012) and a 25-item checklist that is intended to improve the reporting of a randomized controlled trial, facilitate reader understanding of the trial design, conduct, analysis and interpretation, and to support their ability to assess the validity of its results. 7.Internet Clinical Trial Listing: In addition, also consistent with the recommendations of the ICMJE, the Sponsor will make available appropriate information regarding the study via the internet. This will include registration and listing of the study on www.clinicaltrials.gov, the US National Institutes of Health listing of clinical trials."

Acceptable start of exhalation with brisk upstroke, no hesitation or false start, and back extrapolation volume (EV) <5% of forced vital capacity (FVC) or 0.150 L, whichever is the greater. (Refer to example in Figure A1-1) 2. No cough during the first second.3. No valsalva maneuver.4. No leak.5. No obstruction of mouthpiece.6. No extra breaths.7. Plateau achieved, ie, the volume-time curve shows no change in volume (<0.025 L) for ≥1 second, and the patient has tried to exhale for at least 6 seconds. An acceptable test meets all 7 criteria listed. This is to be considered the “gold standard”. Usable spirometry tracings are those that only meet criteria 1 and 2 (Figure A1-1). When this occurs, repeat testing up to 8 attempts in an effort to obtain 3 acceptable spirograms. If only usable tests are obtained, report results based on the 3 best usable results with observed limitations. Figure A1-1.

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 111 of 163Appendix 3 Spirometry Performance Recommendations Spirometry data of the highest quality must be obtained for proper interpretation of the results of this protocol. To these ends, a standard spirometer will be used (provided by Pearl), central training provided, qualification will be required, and specific operating instruction will also be provided. The following instructions are supported by ATS/ERS defined criteria (Miller 2005). FEV 1AND FVC MANEUVERS Equipment Requirements The spirometer must be capable of accumulating volume for ≥15 s (longer times are recommended) and measuring volumes of ≥8 L (body temperature (ie, 37°C), ambient pressure, saturated with water vapor, body temperature and pressure saturated [BTPS]) with an accuracy of at least ±3% of reading or ±0.050 L, whichever is greater, with flows between 0 and 14 L-s -1. The total resistance to airflow at 14.0 L-s -1must be <1.5 cmH 2O L-11s -1 (0.15 kPa L-11s -1). The total resistance must be measured with any tubing, valves, pre filter, etc. included that may be inserted between the subject and the spirometer. Some devices may exhibit changes in resistance due to water vapor condensation, and accuracy requirements must be met under BTPS conditions for up to 8 successive forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers performed in a 10-minute period without inspiration from the instrument. Display For optimal quality control, both flow volume and volume time displays are useful, and test operators should visually inspect the performance of each maneuver for quality assurance before proceeding with another maneuver. This inspection requires tracings to meet the minimum size and resolution requirements set forth in this standard. Displays of flow vs. volume provide more detail for the initial portion (first 1 s) of the FVC maneuver. Since this portion of the maneuver, particularly the peak expiratory flow rate, is correlated with the pleural pressure during the maneuver, the flow–v olume display is useful to assess the magnitude of effort during the initial portions of th e maneuver. The ability to overlay a series of flow–volume curves registered at the point of maximal inhalation may be helpful in evaluating repeatability and detecting sub maximal efforts. However, if the point of maximal inhalation varies between blows, then the interpretation of these results is difficult because the flows at identical measured volumes are being achieved at different absolute lung volumes. In contrast, display of the FVC maneuver as a volume–time graph provides more detail for the latter part of the maneuver. A volume–time tracing of sufficient size also allows independent measurement and calculation of parameters from the FVC maneuvers. In a display of multiple trials, the sequencing of the blows should be apparent to the user. For the start of test display, the volume–time display should include >0.25 s, and preferably 1 s, before exhalation starts (zero volume). This time period before there is any change in volume is needed to calculate the back extrapolated volume (EV) and to evaluate effort during the initial portion of the maneuver. Time zero, as defined by EV, must be presented as the zero"

The last 2 s of the maneuver should be displayed to indicate a satisfactory end of test. When a volume–time curve is plotted as hardcopy, the volume scale must be ≥10 mm L-1 (BTPS). For a screen display, 5 mm L-1is satisfactory (Table A2-1). Table A2-1. Recommended Minimal Scale Factors for Time, Volume and Flow on Graphical Output Parameter Instrument DisplayHardcopy Graphical Output Resolution Required Scale Factor Resolution Required Volume* 0.050 L 5 mm-L-10.050 L Flow* 0.200 L-s-12.5 mm L-1s-10.200 L-s-1 Time 0.2 s 10 mm-s-10.2 s *The correct aspect ratio for flow versus volume display is two units of flow per one unit of volume The time scale should be ≥20 mm-s -1, and larger time scales are preferred ( ≥30 mm-s -1) when manual measurements are made. When the volume–time plot is used in conjunction with a flow–volume curve (ie, both display methods are provided for interpretations and no hand measurements are performed), the time scale requirement is reduced to 10 mm-s -1from the usually required minimum of 20 mm-s -1(Table A2-1). The rationale for this exception is that the flow–volume curve can provide the means for quality assessment during the init ial portion of the FVC maneuver. The volume–time curve can be used to evaluate the latter part of the FVC maneuver, making the time scale less critical. Validation It is strongly recommended that spirometry sy stems should be evaluated using a computer driven mechanical syringe or its equivalent, in order to test the range of exhalations that are likely to be encountered in the test population. Testing the performance of equipment is not part of the usual laboratory procedures. Quality Control Attention to equipment quality control a nd calibration is an important part of Good Laboratory Practice. At a minimum, the requiremen ts are as follows: 1) a log of calibration results is maintained; 2) the documentation of repairs or other alterations which return the equipment to acceptable operation; 3) the dates of computer software and hardware updates or changes; and 4) if equipment is changed or relocated (eg, industrial surveys), calibration checks and quality control procedures must be repeated before further testing begins. Key aspects of equipment quality control are summarized in Table A2-2."

A calibration check is different from calibration and is the procedure used to validate that the device is within calibration limits, eg, ±3% of true. If a device fails its calibration check, then new calibration procedure or equipment maintenance is required. Calibration checks must be undertaken daily, or more frequently, if specified by the manufacturer. The syringe used to check the volume calibration of spirometers must have an accuracy of ±15 mL or ±0.5% of the full scale (15 mL for a 3 L syringe), and the manufacturer mu st provide recommendations concerning appropriate intervals between syringe calibration checks. Users should be aware that a syringe with an adjustable or variable stop may be out of calibration if the stop is reset or accidentally moved. Calibration syringes should be periodically (eg, monthly) leak tested at more than one volume up to their maximum; this can be done by attempting to empty them with the outlet corked. A dropped or damaged syri nge should be considered out of calibration until it is checked. With regard to time, assessing mechanical recorder time scale accuracy with a stopwatch must be performed at least quarterly. An accuracy of within 2% must be achieved. Quality Control for Volume Measuring Devices The volume accuracy of the spirometer must be checked at least daily, with a single discharge of a 3 L calibrated syringe. Daily calibration checking is highly recommended so that the onset of a problem can be determined within 1 day and also to help define day to day laboratory variability. More frequent checks may be required in special circumstances, such as: 1) during industrial surveys or other studies in which a large number of subject maneuvers are carried out, the equipment’s calibration should be checked more frequently than daily; and 2) when the ambient temperature is changing (eg, field studies), volume accuracy must be checked more frequently than daily and th e BTPS correction factor appropriately updated."
114,page_114,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 114 of 163The accuracy of the syringe volume must be considered in determining whether the measured volume is within acceptable limits. For example, if the syringe has an accuracy of 0.5%, a reading of ±3.5% is appropriate. The calibration syringe should be stored and used in such a way as to maintain the same temperature and humidity of the testing site. This is best accomplished by keeping the syringe in close proximity to the spirometer, but out of direct sunlight and away from heat sources. Volume type spirometer systems must be evaluated for leaks every day. The importance of undertaking this daily test cannot be overstressed. Leaks can be detected by applying a constant positive pressure of ≥3.0 cmH 2O (0.3 kPa) with the spirometer outlet occluded (preferably at or including the mouthpiece). Any observed volume loss of 0.30 mL after 1 minute indicates a leak and needs to be corrected. At least quarterly, volume spirometers must have their calibration checked over their entire volume range using a calibrated syringe or an equivalent volume standard. The measured volume should be within ±3.5% of the readi ng or 65 mL, whichever is greater. This limit includes the 0.5% accuracy limit for a 3-L syringe. The linearity check procedure provided by the manufacturer can be used if it is equivalent to one of the following procedures: 1) consecutive injections of 1-L volume incr ements while comparing observed volume with the corresponding cumulative measured volume (eg, 0–1,1–2, 2–3,…6–7 and 7–8 L, for an 8-L spirometer); and 2) injection of a 3-L volume starting at a minimal spirometer volume, then repeating this with a 1-L increment in the start position (eg, 0–3, 1–4, 2–5, 3–6, 4–7, and 5-8 L, for an 8-L spirometer). The linearity check is considered acceptable if the spirometer meets the volume accuracy requirements for all volumes tested. Quality Control for Flow Measuring Devices With regards to volume accuracy, calibration checks must be undertaken at least daily, using a 3-L syringe discharged at least three times to give a range of flows varying between 0.5 and 12 L-s -1(with 3-L injection times of 6 s and 0.5 s). The volume at each flow should meet the accuracy requirement of ±3.5%. For devices usin g disposable flow sensors, a new sensor from the supply used for subject tests should be tested each day. For linearity, a volume calibration check should be performed weekly with a 3-L syringe to deliver three relatively constant flows at a low flow, then three at a mid-range flow and finally three at a high flow. The volumes achieved at each of these flows should each meet the accuracy requirement of ±3.5%. VITAL CAPACITY AND INSPIRATORY CAPACITY MANEUVERS Equipment For measurements of vital capacity (VC) and inspiratory capacity, the spirometer or flow meter must comply with the requirements for FVC (as described previously) and be capable of accumulating volume for >30 s. Expiratory maneuvers or, ideally, both inspiratory and"
115,page_115,"Glycopyrronium Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 115 of 163expiratory maneuvers should be included in the display of VC maneuver. Regardless of whether the inspiratory or expiratory maneuver is used for deriving measurements, a display of the entire recorded VC maneuver must be provided. The maximal expiratory volume must be assessed to determine whether the subject has obtained a plateau in the expiratory effort. For display of the slow VC, the time scale may be reduced to 5 mm-s -1. TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS Minimal Recommendations for Spirometry Systems Accurate results require accurate equipment. Spirometer equipment recommendations apply to all spirometers and are minimal requirements. In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to exceed these requirements (ie, in some research/surveillance applications). Instrumentation reco mmendations should be followed to provide accurate spirometric data and information that is comparable from laboratory to laboratory and from one time period to another. The accuracy of a spirometry system depends on characteristics of the entire system, from the volume or flow transducer and the use of an in line filter, to the recorder, display or processor. Changes in any aspect of the equipment or errors at any step in the process can affect the accuracy of the results. For exam ple, if the BTPS correction factor is wrong, an accurately measured FVC will be incorrectly reported. Spirometers are not required to measure all of the indices in Table A2-3, but must meet the recommendations for those that are measured. Accuracy and repeatability recommendations apply over the entire volume range of the instrument. Table A2-3.

Excursions permitted up to 30°C (86°F). •The contents of the canister are under pressure. Do not puncture or throw the canister into a fire or incinerator. Do not use or store it near heat or open flame. Storage above 120ºF may cause the canister to burst. •Keep the product and all medicines out of the reach of children. For Oral Inhalation Only Parts of the Inhaler: •The parts of your inhaler are seen in Figure A4-1 . Figure A4-1 •The Dose indicator lets you know about how many puffs ar e left in your inhaler and is the part of the inhaler that is pressed to dispense a puff of medication. See Figure A4-1 . •The Dose indicator should be pointing just to the right of 120 when your inhaler is new. See Figure A4-1 . •The Dose indicator has numbers for every 20 puffs. The Dose indicator display will move after every tenth puff."

To these ends, a standard measurement device will be used, and training provided on its use and care; specific operating instruction will also be provided. Equipment The device and all required accessories (eg, test kits) will be provi ded by Pearl and used by all sites. The device is suitable for children, approximately 7 to 17 years of age, and adults 18 years and older. A User Manual will also be provided (elect ronically, printed, or both) which includes detailed information for installation, use, troubleshooting, and preventive care for the Niox Vero device. Procedures Two valid, reproducible F ENOmeasurements are required, in accordance with testing procedures recommended by the manufacturer and similar to those published by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS 2005). If either or both of the first 2 valid F ENOmeasurements is < 30 ppb and the measurements are within 2 ppb of each other, or if both measurements are > 30 ppb and within 10% of each other, then the test is considered reproducible and complete. Two values below or above the measurement range (5-300 ppb) are also considered reproducible. If the reproducibility criteria are not met within the first 2 exhalations, a participant has 2 additional exhalations to satisfy the criteria (up to a total of 4 trials). The examinee's exhalations for which the device does not display a valid reading, ie, exhalations that are either too strong or too weak, or any other reasons for failing to achieve a successful exhalation, will be recorded as attempts. Examinees may not always able to meet the criteria for a reproducible measurement. The results of each attempt will be recorded in the appropriate eCRF.Reference American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society.

The Investigator is respons ible for determining wh ether a subject meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. The Investigator participates, together with the Sponsor clinical representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria are met. Hy’s Law criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by study drug. The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes. DEFINITIONS Potential Hy’s Law The levels of AST or ALT ≥3×ULN with TBL ≥ 2×ULN at any point during the study irrespective of an increase in ALP. The elevations do not have to occur at the same time or within a specified t ime frame. Hy’s Law The levels of AST or ALT ≥3×ULN with TBL ≥ 2×ULN, where no other reason, other than the study drug, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, or a nother drug. The elevations do not have to occur at the same time or within a specified time frame. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any subject who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination: •ALT ≥3×ULN •AST ≥3×ULN •TBL ≥2×ULN When a subject meets any of the identification criteria in combination, the central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Investigator and the Sponsor representative."

Subsequent to this contact, the Investigator will: •Monitor the subject until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. •Investigate the etiology of the event and perfo rm diagnostic investigations as discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. •If at any time (in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor) the PHL case meets serious criteria, report the event as an SAE using standard reporting procedures."

Clinical Study Protocol: PT001102-04 Version 5.0 Confidential and Proprietary Page 161 of 163REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES The instructions in this section should be fo llowed for all cases where PHL criteria are met. No later than 2 weeks after the biochemis try abnormality was initi ally detected, the Sponsor Medical Monitor contacts the Investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the study drug. The Sponsor Medical Monitor and other subject matter experts (as appropriate) will collaborate in the review and assessment of these cases. According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Investigator will follow the instructions below. If there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for an SAE: •If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the eCRF according to the Sponsor’s standard reporting procedures. •If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the comment form within the eCRF. If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations other than the study drug: •Report as an SAE (report term “Hy’s Law case”) according to Sponsor standard processes - The “Medically Important” serious criterion should be used if no other serious criteria apply - As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of “related” should be assigned If, there is an unavoidable delay of over 2 weeks in obtaining the information necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation. Until an informed decision can be made, the following procedure should be followed: •Report as an SAE (report term “Potential Hy’s Law”) applying serious criteria and causality assessment as per above. Continue follow up and review according to the agreed plan. Once the necessary supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are met. Update the SAE Report Form according to the outcome of the review."
