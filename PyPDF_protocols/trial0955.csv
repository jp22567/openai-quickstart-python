The Per Protocol (PP) population will consist of all enrolled and randomized subjects, except subjects who have major deviations from the protocol. The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will consist of the entire population enrolled and randomize d. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will be used to impute missing values of lesion counts. Analysis population definitions and pooling of centers will be decided before the database lock and unblinding. The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the superiority of Ivermectin associated with Doxycycline MR vs. Ivermectin associated with Placebo, in terms of % change from Baseline in Inflammatory Lesion count at Week 12. The primary efficacy cr iterion will be analyzed by using the Cochran - Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) statistic, stratified by center (or analysis -center) after ridit transformation with the row mean difference statistics, testing the hypothesis of equality. The p -value will have to be inf erior to 0.05 at Week 12, on ITT/LOCF population. PP analysis will be also performed to assess the robustness of the results obtained on ITT/LOCF population. The other variables will be analyzed similarly as primary analysis on appropriate population. Ea ch test will be two -sided, at the 0.050 significance level. The subject characteristics (previous medication, concomitant medication, demographics, baseline characteristics…), lesion counts and adverse events, will be summarized by descriptive statistics (usual statistics and frequency distribution)."

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR THE CLINICAL TRIAL Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects around 10% of the population in Europe. Clinical characteristics include diagnostic features (persistent centrofacial erythema, phymatous changes); primary features (transient erythema or flushing, inflammatory papules/pustules, telangiectasia, ocular manifestations) and secondary features (burning sensation, stinging sensation, oedema, dry sensation) in various combinations1.1,1.2. Following the onset of the disease, patients with rosacea will experience cycles of relapse and remission of symptoms throughout their lives. Rosacea usually presents in the second or third decade of life, with prevalence of rosacea varying from less than 1% to more than 20%1.3,1.4. It is reported more frequently in fair -skinned people1.5,1.6,1.7. Rosacea is known to have a negative impact on quality of life and is associated with depression and social isolation, hampering both social and professional lives. In a recent National Rosacea Society survey of 1675 patients, 95% in patients with severe symptoms reported an adverse impact on their general outlook on life, highlighting that the emotional impact on patients appears to increase as symptoms become more severe1.8. Patients with inflammatory lesion of rosacea (papulo-pustular) show a chronic and recurrent course of their disease and it is usually accompanied by a persistent central facial erythema, potentially associated with telangiectasia. Eruptions usually occur on the center of the face with frequent involvement of the forehead and chin. The etiology of rosacea remains unknown, with both genetic and environmental factors potentially impacting pathogenesis. These etiological factors include enhanced vasomotor lability, immune system and sebaceous gland abnormalities, and greater susceptibility to heat and ultraviolet (UV) light exposure1.9. Patients with rosacea are reported to have an upregulated innate immune system, which can be triggered by various factors (including certain foods, UV exposure and temperature changes). This heightened immune response induces signaling cascades associated with inﬂammatory and vasoregulatory pathways. In addition, microorganisms such as the hair follicle mite Demodex folliculorum have been suggested to play a key role. Penetration of the mite into the dermis may stimulate a delayed hypersensitivity reaction and inflammation. Several published studies report abnormally high numbers of Demodex in subjects with papulo-pustular rosacea1.8."
29,page_29,"GALDERMA RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Protocol N° RD.03.SPR.113322 version Final dated 10-FEB-2017 Page 29 of 106 CONFIDENTIAL In rosacea, the frequency of outbreaks varies with time, ranging from once or twice a year to continuous presence of symptoms. Management of the inflammatory lesions and the associated erythema warrants adherence with continued therapy1.10. Treatment options for rosacea with inflammatory lesions include various topical therapies such as ivermectin, metronidazole, azelaic acid, and sodium sulfacetamide-sulfur1.11,1.12. Systemic treatment with sub- antimicrobial dose formulation of doxycycline (referred to as doxycycline 40 mg modified release) incorporating 30-mg immediate-release and 10-mg delayed-release beads administered once daily; first FDA-approved (2006) as oral treatment for rosacea with papulopustular lesions. Doxycycline 40 mg modified-release (Oracea®) has shown to decrease both gene expression and protein levels of MMPs, KLK, and cathelicidin, which resulted in a reduction in inflammatory lesion counts . By inhibiting the production and activity of MMPs, doxycycline 40 mg modified-release blocks multiple inflammatory pathways, which inhibits the production of proteins contributing to the pathophysiology of inflammation and thus exhibits anti-inflammatory properties while not exhibiting any antibiotic effect in rosacea patients1.10. Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone derivative with dual anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic properties. Approved for the treatment of onchocerciasis, strongyloidiasis and scabies in humans by oral route, and in lotion foam for topical head lice treatment. Oral ivermectin has been demonstrated to be effective as an anti-parasitic agent in reducing the number of Demodex mites in demodicidosis and in blepharitis. Ivermectin (IVM) has also been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-induced production of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF- α) and interleukin (IL) -1β, while increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Ivermectin is able to suppress production of the inflammatory mediators and modulation of NO, iNOS, COX-2, and PGE- 2 release which are major contributing factors during the inflammatory process. It ’s therapeutic effect as a topical cream in rosacea is assumed to be due to both, its anti-inflammatory and anti-demodex properties1.10."
30,page_30,"GALDERMA RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Protocol N° RD.03.SPR.113322 version Final dated 10-FEB-2017 Page 30 of 106 CONFIDENTIAL The approval of Ivermectin 1% cream (FDA, 2015 ) for the treatment of the inflammatory lesions of rosacea was based upon two identically-designed large vehicle-controlled Phase 3 randomized trials that demonstrated efficacy and safety in adults with moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea on a 12-week treatment period. In both studies, a greater proportion of subjects in the IVM 1% group achieved treatment success. Ivermectin was superior to vehicle in terms of reduction from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts (76% and 75% versus 50% for both vehicle groups, respectively)1.13. For Doxycycline the two placebo- controlled pivotal phase 3 trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of doxycycline 40 mg modified release (MR) once daily versus placebo in participants with moderate to severe rosacea. These participants had 10 to 40 papules and pustules and moderate to severe erythema and telangiectasia. Both studies showed marked reductions in the number of inflammatory lesions compared with placebo. Treatment with doxycycline 40 mg MR significantly reduced the number of lesions from the first follow-up assessment at 3 weeks throughout the entire 16- week study compared with placebo (P≤ 0.005). Study by Sanchez et al.1.14 using doxycycline with metronidazole versus metronidazole alone did demonstrate in moderate to severe rosacea that adjunctive use of sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline significantly reduced the clinical signs of rosacea compared with metronidazole alone1.6. Based on the complementary mechanism of action of doxycycline MR and ivermectin1.10, a scientific rationale to assess the combined therapy targeting inflammatory lesions in severe rosacea is planned. Topical ivermectin cream is a promising first-line treatment to target the inflammatory lesions of rosacea, which can be used in combination with systemic doxycycline modified-release as per the recent Canadian Rosacea guideline1.15 to provide an optimal treatment approach considering all inflammatory pathways involved in rosacea with inflammatory lesions. Unlike clinical studies evaluating monotherapy approaches, clinicians often use a combination of topical and oral therapy for patients with severe rosacea, as an increased or additive benefit has been suggested with combination regimens. Topical ivermectin cream 1% and oral anti-inflammatory doxycycline (40 mg MR, modified-release) are both approved for the treatment of rosacea with inflammatory papules and pustules. Associating those two products, each having demonstrated a good safety profile and efficacy on rosacea features, should lead to optimized clinical outcomes in a complex disease that has been proven difficult to manage comprehensively and would reflect a controlled study of that which is already prescribed in clinical practice1.15. In an attempt to further optimize comprehensive management of severe rosacea, this study aims to investigate the efficacy, patient satisfaction and safety of the association of topical Ivermectin 1% cream and oral Doxycycline MR 40mg once a day treatment."

Both are approved for rosacea treatment and are well tolerated. See respective product information ( PI-SmPC) for detailed efficacy and safety information. 2.3 RISK/B ENEFIT ASSESSMENT Rosacea is a chronic , non-life-threatening skin disease characterized by two major features which are a persistent central facial erythema and recurrent eruptions of inflammatory lesions (i.e., papules, pustules, or both). The two investigational products are marketed individually for rosacea treatment and with proven efficacy and good safety profile including severe rosacea population. Whatever the randomization arm, all study subjects will benefit from an efficient and safe rosacea treatment. The association of investigational products is not expected to raise new tolerability issues and has the potential to reach to better and possibly faster efficacy outcome. 3. CLINICAL TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS 3.1 CLINICAL TRIALS OBJECTIVES The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Ivermectin 1% topical cream associated with Doxycycline 40 mg capsules MR compared with Ivermectin 1% topical cream monotherapy in the treatment of severe rosacea with papulopustular lesions. The Safety and Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) will be also evaluated. 3.2 CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS Associating IVM 1% cream and oral Doxycycline 40 mg MR in a comprehensive approach to address the severe inflammatory lesions of rosacea and should lead to an optimized clinical outcome. Both drugs have only been evaluated individually so far, but never as an association. This study aims to assess both treatment evaluations on rosacea symptoms and will allow for the evaluation of the potential benefit of such treatment association on cumulative efficacy, time to onset of action with 2 products in rosacea, safety, and patient satisfaction needed in severe condition of rosacea."

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 5.1 OVERALL CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN This clinical trial will be conducted as a multi-center, randomized, investigator-blind, controlled and parallel-group study in subjects with severe rosacea characterized by persistent diffuse facial erythema and inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules), and meeting other specific eligibility criteria. A total of 270 subjects will be enrolled (ie: 135 in each group) in approximately 50 sites in the USA, Canada and Europe. Approximately 5 subjects are planned from each site. Subjects will be enrolled at baseline and treated for 12 weeks with either Ivermectin 1% cream associated with Doxycycline 40 mg MR (CD2475-101) capsules or Ivermectin 1% cream associated with CD2475- 101 placebo capsules. There will be two parallel groups, randomized in a ratio of [1:1]. There will be up to 5 trial visits: at baseline, Screening/Baseline, Week 4 (±3 days), Week 8 (±3 days), and Week 12 (±5 days). 5.2 DISCUSSION OF CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN IVM 1% cream and oral Doxycycline 40 mg MR have been individually approved for rosacea treatment in US, Canada and Europe, with demonstrated efficacy and good safety profile including in severe rosacea population. They will be used in this trial in their indication and approved dose and regimen. Unlike clinical studies evaluating monotherapy approaches, clinicians often use a combination of topical and oral therapy for patients with severe rosacea, as an increased or additive benefit has been suggested with combination regimens. Topical Ivermectin cream (10 mg/g) and systemic, oral Doxycycline 40 mg MR (modified- release) have only been evaluated individually so far, but never as an association. The combined therapeutic approach of both drugs association may be more beneficial, but has never been assessed for rosacea treatment in a randomized clinical trial. To ensure an appropriate evaluation of this association benefit, it will be compared to Ivermectin 1% topical cream alone associated to the placebo of Doxycycline 40 mg MR (CD2475- 101). This clinical trial will compare the efficacy and safety of Ivermectin 1% topical cream associated with Doxycycline 40 mg Modified release (MR) capsules compared to Ivermectin 1% topical cream associated with Placebo in the treatment of severe Rosacea."

53,page_53,"GALDERMA RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Protocol N° RD.03.SPR.113322 version Final dated 10-FEB-2017 Page 53 of 106 CONFIDENTIAL Accountability 6.4.1 Upon receipt of the clinical supplies at the site, the investigational product dispenser will conduct a complete inventory of all investigational products and assume responsibility for their storage, accountability and dispensation. The Investigator or designee will sign the original “Receipt of Clinical Supplies ” Form (or any acknowledgment of receipt) upon receipt and inspection of the supplies, send the signed copy and the temperature curve to GALDERMA R&D and retain the receipt in the Investigator Site File (ISF). All supplies sent to the investigator site will be accounted for and in no case used in any unauthorized situation. At the end of the trial, all used and unused investigational products will be returned to GALDERMA R&D or the designated contractor for further reconciliation, appropriate inventory and destruction. Dispensing 6.4.2 Investigational products will be prescribed only to subjects enrolled into the clinical trial, at no cost and in accordance with the conditions specified in the protocol. Dispensation will be appropriately documented on the product dispensation log by the investigational product dispenser at each visit. It is important that no subject run out of clinical trial supplies between visits. The investigational product dispenser will follow the accurate prescription according to the allocated kit. Each Subject kit will contain 3 visit treatment boxes (each for 1 month of treatment) to be dispensed at Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8 visits, respectively. Each visit treatment box will contain 1 tube of Ivermectin 1% cream and 2 bottles of Doxycycline 40 mg MR or its placebo. All efforts will be taken to keep the evaluator (investigator or designee) blinded by restricting his/her contact with the investigational products. The investigational product dispenser must be different from the clinical trial efficacy and safety evaluator in order to maintain the blind (see section 6.4).Treatment kits will be dispensed in ascending sequential order according to the chronological order of enrolment of subjects into the clinical trial."

The investigational product(s) will be collected and counted at all visits by the investigational product dispenser. Subjects will also be questioned regarding the application technique, intake, frequency and missed doses of investigational products and the use of any other additional topical, systemic drug as well as OTC product. A subject ’s diary will be given to each subject in order to record the use of investigational products and Facial Moisturizer. The investigational product dispenser will review the subject ’s diary at every visit. The return of investigational products will be appropriately documented on the product dispensation log by the investigational product dispenser. During the data review meeting, investigational product compliance for all subjects will be determined and reviewed by the sponsor ’s clinical team for possible exclusion from the Per Protocol (PP) population. Storage of investigational product 6.4.4 The investigator has to agree to keep all investigational products in a safe, temperature controlled and secure area with restricted access, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., in the site pharmacy, if applicable). Investigational products should be stored at appropriate storage conditions specified by GALDERMA R&D (see section 6.1.1 ). Return of investigational product 6.4.5 The investigational product dispenser will inform each subject about the importance of returning their investigational products (used and/or not used) at each trial visit. In the event of early termination/suspension of the clinical trial for safety reasons, a rapid recall of the trial products will be initiated. The investigator or designee must immediately instruct all subjects to stop the clinical trial treatment regimen and return the investigational products to the clinical trial site."
55,page_55,"GALDERMA RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Protocol N° RD.03.SPR.113322 version Final dated 10-FEB-2017 Page 55 of 106 CONFIDENTIAL As a general procedure, GALDERMA R&D will provide the investigator with a detailed list of units being recalled so that any of the units remaining on site can be put immediately into quarantine. 6.5 BLINDING Verification of blinding 6.5.1 The clinical trial design is considered investigator-blind based on the following rationale: 1. Oral placebo capsules will be free from marking unlike the Oracea capsules. Aside from this difference, both oral trial products will be filled in the same type of primary packaging materials (ie: bottle) and there will be no other sign that could indicate which one is the active product and which one is the placebo. 2. The investigational products will be dispensed by someone other than the evaluator (investigator or designee) designated as the investigational product dispenser in order to maintain the blind. 3. Additionally, both the investigational product dispenser and the subject will be instructed not to discuss the investigational products with the evaluator (investigator or designee) 4. The investigational product dispenser and the investigator will not have access to the unblinded randomization list. The randomization list will be maintained secured in a locked cabinet and/or an electronic file with restricted access to only the designated personnel directly responsible for labeling and handling the study drugs at the Sponsor’s/designee’s location. The independent statistician providing analyses requested will be able to access the randomization list upon request. Unblinding during the clinical trial 6.5.2 Emergency un-blinding during the clinical trial may be required for therapeutic or for regulatory reasons (e.g. for expedited safety reporting). A blind-break system will be available for Investigators. At the clinical trial center, the blinded label containing the identification of the assigned study drug(s) will be revealed in emergency situations only. In such an emergency, the Investigator will only break the blind for the subject involved. Treatment identification for emergency purposes will be possible with “unblinding envelopes”, stating the treatment number, investigational product identification, batch number and investigational product expiration date, as applicable."

If possible, the investigator should notify the sponsor before breaking the blind in order to discuss this decision with the sponsor. The investigator is required to document each case of emergency un-blinding on the appropriate form (provided by the Sponsor) and send the completed form to the sponsor immediately. 7. EFFICACY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT Clinical evaluations should be performed by the same evaluator (investigator or designee) throughout the clinical trial. If it is not possible to use the same evaluator to follow a subject, then evaluations should overlap for at least one visit in order to examine the subject together and discuss findings. This should be documented in medical source documents. 7.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS Inflammatory Lesion Count 7.1.1 The evaluator will perform inflammatory lesion count on facial papules and pustules of rosacea at baseline and then at each visit. Inflammatory lesions are defined as follows:  Papule – A small, solid elevation less than one centimeter in diameter  Pustule – A small, circumscribed elevation of the skin, which contains yellow white exudates. Papules and pustules will be counted separately on each of the five facial regions (forehead, chin, nose, right cheek and left cheek). Nodules (defined as a circumscribed, elevated, solid lesion more than 1.0 cm in diameter with palpable depth) will not be included in the count of inflammatory lesions , and subjects are not eligible if they have more than 2 nodules on the face at screening/baseline visit. Clinician’s Erythema Assessment (CEA) 7.1.2 The evaluator will assess the subject’s diffuse persistent facial erythema of rosacea by performing a static (“snap shot”) evaluation of erythema severity, at a socia l distance of approximately 50 cm, using CEA at each visit. The evaluator should make no reference to previous assessments when evaluating the subject’s erythema of rosacea and CEA must be evaluated after the inflammatory lesion count."

The safety parameters and AEs are to be recorded as specified in section 7.2.1 . Adverse Events 7.2.1 Adverse events (AEs) are to be monitored throughout the course of the clinical trial. All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent should be recorded on the AE form on the eCRF. All AEs are to be reported on an Adverse Event Form of the eCRF with complete information as required. If AEs occur, the main concern will be the safety of the subject. At the time of the ICF signature, each subject must be provided with the name and telephone number of clinical trial center personnel for reporting AEs and medical emergencies. All clinical medical events, whether observed by the investigator or reported by the subject and whether or not thought to be related to the study drug will be considered AEs. Assessment of seriousness, severity and causality will be based on specific definitions. If the subject discontinues due to an AE, both the AE Form and the Exit Form should be completed. Subjects reporting a worsening of rosacea (worsening of any signs and symptoms of rosacea including but not limited to inflammatory lesions, persistent erythema and flushing) will be evaluated in detail. This includes the onset, duration and outcomes of those events, as well as a complete history and potential triggers of the concerned signs and symptoms of rosacea. 7.3 PATIENT RELATED OUTCOMES Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire 7.3.1 At Baseline and at last visit, subjects will answer the 10-item DLQI questionnaire (see section 13.1), a validated quality- of-life questionnaire specific to dermatological conditions. The investigator or delegate will then check all questions of the questionnaire for completeness prior to the subject leaving the study visit. EQ-5D-5L questionnaire 7.3.2 Subjects will answer the quality of life questionnaire EQ-5D-5L at Baseline visit and at last visit. EQ-5D-5L is a 5-level, 5-dimensional format standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. EQ-5D was originally"
62,page_62,"GALDERMA RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Protocol N° RD.03.SPR.113322 version Final dated 10-FEB-2017 Page 62 of 106 CONFIDENTIAL designed to complement other instruments but is now increasingly used as a 'stand-alone' measure. EQ-5D-5L is designed for self-completion by respondents. It is cognitively simple; taking only a few minutes to complete (see section 13.2). The investigator or delegate will then check all questions of the questionnaire for completeness prior to the subject leaving the study visit. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health 7.3.3 Problem (WPAI:GH) modified for Rosacea. Subjects will answer the quality of life questionnaire WPAI: G H at Baseline visit and at last visit. The WPAI: G H questionnaire consists of six questions (see section 13.3). It is an instrument to measure impairments in both paid work and unpaid work. It measures absenteeism, presenteeism as well as the impairments in unpaid activity because of health problem during the past seven days. It has been validated to quantify work impairments for numerous diseases including dermatological diseases such as psoriasis1.16. In addition, the WPAI: G H questionnaire has been used to compare work impairments between treatment groups in clinical studies or between subjects with different disease severity levels. As per WPAI questionnaire adaptation guidelines, the questionnaire has been adapted for rosacea by replacing the term ‘your health problems’ by ‘your rosacea’. The investigator or delegate will then check all questions of the questionnaire for completeness prior to the subject leaving the study visit. Subject satisfaction questionnaire 7.3.4 At last visit, subjects will complete a questionnaire (see section 13.4). 7.4 OTHER ASSESSMENTS Photography 7.4.1 Standardized photographs on the face (1 front view and 2 profile views) will be taken at selected investigational sites at each study visit. Pictures will be used for illustrative purpose and will not be subject to analysis. Facial redness colorimetric measurements 7.4.2 Complementary facial redness colorimetric measurements will be performed using a Chromameter at selected investigational sites, depending on material availability."
63,page_63,"GALDERMA RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Protocol N° RD.03.SPR.113322 version Final dated 10-FEB-2017 Page 63 of 106 CONFIDENTIAL 7.5 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS The clinical efficacy assessments will be based on inflammatory lesion counts, evaluation of facial erythema, stinging/burning sensation and flushing. The methods are established in the evaluation of rosacea products and used in previous studies with the study products. Safety is documented by recording adverse events on an ongoing basis as a well-established process in clinical trials. In case of reporting of a worsening of rosacea, specific complementary data will be collected. Impact of study treatments on subjects’ quality of life will be measu red by using specific questionnaires. DLQI and EQ-5D-5L are two validated questionnaires for evaluating quality- of- life: While EQ- 5D-3L is more general and not disease-specific, the DLQI focuses on the impact of dermatological diseases on the quality- of-life. The WPAI: GH questionnaire is a validated instrument to quantify work impairments for numerous diseases including dermatological conditions. To collect specifically the patient satisfaction outcome, a subject satisfaction questionnaire will be used at the end of the study to collect the subjects’ feedback on the treatment regimen, the level of satisfaction and future usage."

ADVERSE EVENT 8.1 DEFINITIONS Adverse Events (AE) 8.1.1 According to ICH E2A, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. Thus any new sign, symptom or disease, or clinically significant increase in the intensity of an existing sign, symptom or disease since the first visit (including the disease being treated), should be considered as an adverse event. Lack of efficacy should not be considered as an AE. Each new episode of a chronic disease (e.g., hay fever, allergy, etc.) from the screening visit should be reported as a new AE. Notes:  Any new sign or symptom reported by the subject that appears after accidental or intentional overdose or misuse should also be reported as an AE.  There should be an attempt to report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory values associated with the report of an AE. However, a diagnosis should be reported only if, in the Investigator ’s judgment, it is relatively certain. Otherwise, symptoms, signs, or laboratory values should be used to describe the AE.  Pregnancy should not be considered as an adverse event but must be followed up as described in section 8.3  For an AE of irritation, the “date of onset ” should be the date that the first symptom occurred. Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 8.1.2"
65,page_65,"GALDERMA RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Protocol N° RD.03.SPR.113322 version Final dated 10-FEB-2017 Page 65 of 106 CONFIDENTIAL A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  results in death,  is life-threatening,  requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the safety of the subject, and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. Note:  The term “life-threatening ” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the subject has had to stay in hospital overnight. The criterion for the prolongation of hospitalization is also defined as an extra night at the hospital. Hospitalization may not constitute sufficient grounds to be considered as an hospitalization if it is solely for the purpose of diagnostic tests, (even if related to an AE), elective hospitalization for an intervention which was already planned before subject enrolment in the clinical trial, admission to a day-care facility, social admission (e.g., if the subject has no place to sleep), or administrative admission (e.g., for a yearly examination). Unexpected adverse drug reaction 8.1.3 According to ICH E6, an unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable study drug information. Adverse event reporting period 8.1.4 The clinical trial period during which AEs must be reported is the period from when the subject signs the Informed Consent Form to the end of the subject ’s participation. The sponsor should be informed if the investigator becomes aware of any unusual safety information or any safety information that appears to be drug-related involving a subject who has"
66,page_66,"GALDERMA RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Protocol N° RD.03.SPR.113322 version Final dated 10-FEB-2017 Page 66 of 106 CONFIDENTIAL participated in a clinical trial, even after a subject has completed the clinical trial. The investigator should be diligent in looking for possible latent safety effects that do not appear until a medication has been discontinued. Severity 8.1.5 Severity is a clinical determination of the intensity of an AE and not of a disease. The investigator will classify the intensity of AEs using the following definitions as a guideline for all AEs occurring during clinical trials conducted or sponsored by GALDERMA. For this classification, the investigator will take into account the possible range of the intensity of the event and report the grade of intensity which is the most appropriate according his medical judgment. Mild Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated Moderate Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity Severe Incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity Relationship to the study drug(s) and/or clinical trial 8.1.6 procedure The investigator is to determine whether there is a reasonable causal relationship between the occurrence of the AE and exposure to the study drug(s) and/or clinical trial procedure. Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, positive de-challenge or re-challenge, relevant medical history, and confounding factors such as co-medication or concurrent diseases. The expression “reasonable causal relationship ” is meant to convey in general that there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A, section IIIA 1). The relationship assessment for an AE is to be completed using the following definitions as a guideline for all adverse events occurring during clinical trials conducted or sponsored by GALDERMA: Reasonable possibility: According to the reporting investigator, there is a reasonable possibility (i.e. suggestive evidence or arguments) that there is a causal relationship irrespective of the dose administered between:  The study drug (investigational product, active comparator, or vehicle, etc.) and the AE,"
67,page_67,"GALDERMA RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Protocol N° RD.03.SPR.113322 version Final dated 10-FEB-2017 Page 67 of 106 CONFIDENTIAL  The clinical trial protocol procedure (e.g., UV-induction, biopsy, xylocaine injection, blood test or intraocular pressure measurement, ancillary products provided by the sponsor, such as moisturizers, etc. and the AE. The Investigator has to complete these 2 causality assessments on the AE form. No Reasonable Possibility: No suggestive evidence or arguments can be identified regarding a causal relationship between the investigational product or the clinical trial protocol procedure and the AE. 8.2 REPORTING PROCEDURES Procedures for reporting adverse events 8.2.1 The collection of AEs is from the time that a subject signs the ICF to their final trial visit. At each post-baseline visit, the investigator (or sub-investigator) will enquire about adverse events using an open question taking care not to influence the subject ’s answer (e.g., “Have you noticed any change in your health since the last visit? ”). Direct questioning and examination wil l then be performed as appropriate. Any AE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether it is related to the study drug or not, will be recorded immediately in the source document, and described in the Adverse Event Form with the date of onset, severity, relationship to the study drug ), and outcome, without omitting any requested and known information. Additional information will be requested under certain circumstances. Adverse Events (AEs) assessed as related to the treatment will be monitore d until they are completely or satisfactorily resolved. Other AEs will be monitored until the last visit if they are not resolved or satisfactorily resolved. Adverse events assessed as related to the treatment or study procedure will be monitored until they have resolved or reached a stable condition. Other AEs will be monitored until the last visit if they have not resolved or reached a stable condition. The investigator will obtain and maintain in the subject ’s files all pertinent medical records, information and medical judgment from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the subject. If necessary, the investigator will contact the subject ’s personal physician or hospital staff to obtain further details. For SAEs (see section 8.2.2 ) and pregnancies (see section 8.3), the Sponsor is to be informed"

The event must be reported by fax or sent by e-mail to the Sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of the information (contact details i n section 8 .2.2 ). Procedure for reporting a serious adverse event 8.2.2 For an SAE occurring during the period of the clinical trial, regardless of whether it is related to the treatment or not, and of whether it is expected or not, the investigator must do the following: 1. Take prompt and appropriate medical action, if necessary. The safety of subject is the first priority. 2. Ensure that the event is classified as an SAE. Immediately (no later than 24 hours) inform the Sponsor of the event by email/ fax/, and discuss further actions to be taken: GALDERMA R&D Name Title Address Tel. during office hours Tel. outside office hours Fax Email pharmacovigilance@galderma.com 3.

The demographics, medical history, drugs/therapies forms, and adverse event pages of the eCRF must be completed and available for review in the eCRF system at the time of the report. 4. Monitor and record the progress of the event until it resolves or reaches a clinically stable outcome, with or without sequelae. For all additional follow-up evaluations, fax or send by e-mail all additional follow-up information on the SAE to the sponsor (see contact details above) within 24 hours of receipt of the updated information. SAEs will be monitored until the Investigator and Sponsor agree that the event is satisfactorily resolved. 5. Obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the subject. If necessary, contact the subject ’s personal physician or hospital staff to obtain further details 6. Inform the sponsor of the final outcome of the event . Send a revised or updated SAE form and AE form, if appropriate. 7. Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to GALDERMA is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects are met. GALDERMA has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation. GALDERMA will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities, IRBs/IECs and investigators. Investigator safety reports are prepared for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) according to local regulatory requirements and GALDERMA policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE(s) or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from GALDERMA will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8. Comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to your IRB/EC. Procedure for suspected allergic contact reaction 8.2.3 This is a general procedure and further details can be discussed with the sponsor.  Stop the trial product  Take a picture of the affected area and the non-affected surrounding skin  Document the event and report it immediately to the sponsor by email/fax, within 24 hours of receipt of the information as described in section 8.2.2."

After all signs and symptoms have resolved and after a minimum of two weeks from last dose application, a re-challenge test with the assigned trial product will be performed. 2. Ensure the subject has not been under any treatment with corticosteroids or antihistamines, regardless of the route of administration, the week before testing. 3. Ensure that the skin on the back has not been exposed to the sun or artificial ultraviolet sources the week before testing. 4. Apply an appropriate quantity of the assigned trial product to fill the cupule of the test chamber on the skin of the upper back on either the right or left side of the center line (or the inner forearm if the back cannot be tested). If no test chamber is available on-site, patch test units will be provided. It may be preferable to perform the test under semi- occlusive conditions depending on the irritant potential of the trial product and the intensity of the reaction that was observed. The method to be used will be discussed with the sponsor. 5. Choose a skin site that was not previously involved in the inflammatory skin reaction. 6. Cover it for 48 hours with a hypoallergenic tape. 7. Subject should be informed about avoiding exercise, showers, application of toiletries products, etc. to keep the test system dry 8. After 48 hours, remove the tests and evaluate the site: - At approximately 30 minutes after patch test removal (1st reading) and, - 24 to 48 hours later (i.e. 72 or 96 hours after application) (2nd reading). - A facultative 3rd reading may be performed 96 to 120 hours later (i.e. 6 to 7 days after application of the patch) if the overall assessment so far equivocal or if asked by the sponsor. - Pictures of the tested areas will be taken systematically at each reading and properly documented.

Except specific situations, a new series of patch test will be initiated as directed by the sponsor (with individual ingredients at different concentrations if applicable, and possibly negative and positive controls) after a minimum of additional two weeks (but not later than 6 months) and after all signs and symptoms have resolved. The patch tests will be placed on the subject’s back (or the inner forearm if the back cannot be tested) distant from the site of the re-challenge test (e.g., the left upper back skin if the re-challenge test was done on the right side). Follow the same procedure for the patch test as for the re-challenge. 14. In case of suspicion of immediate contact skin reaction (such as urticaria) A case by case approach will be applied and the procedure to follow will be discussed with the sponsor. 8.3 PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING PREGNANCIES Any pregnancy occurring during clinical trials, where the fetus could have been exposed to the investigational product(s), must be followed-up until outcome in order to ensure the complete collection of safety data on GALDERMA product. If a subject becomes pregnant, the Investigator is to do the following: 1. Withdraw the subject from the clinical trial 2. Complete all appropriate visit evaluations and CRF pages. 3. Immediately (no later than 24 hours) contact the Sponsor to inform them of the pregnancy occurrence and discuss further steps to be taken. 4.

STATISTICAL METHODS PLANNED 9.1 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed as a separate document. The SAP will contain a more detailed and technical description of specific data conventions, calculations and of statistical procedures for executing the analyses that are specified in the sections of the clinical trial protocol below. The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock and unblinding . Any change made to the finalized SAP will be documented in the clinical trial report. The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of Ivermectin 1% topical cream associated with Doxycycline 40 mg Modified release (MR) capsules versus Ivermectin 1% topical cream associated with Placebo in the treatment of severe Rosacea. The Safety and Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) will be also evaluated. Variables to be statistically analysed 9.1.1 The following variables will be analysed: Primary efficacy variable 9.1.1.1 The primary endpoint is the percent change from Baseline in Inflammatory Lesion count at Week 12. Secondary efficacy variables 9.1.1.2 The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  Percent change from Baseline in Inflammatory Lesion count at each intermediate visit  CEA at each post-Baseline visit: % of subjects across scores  IGA at each post-Baseline visit: % of subjects across scores  Stinging/burning at each post-Baseline visit: % of subjects across scores  Percent change from Baseline (medical history) in terms of flushing count per week over 12 weeks  Change from Baseline (medical history) in terms of flushing severity score per week over 12 weeks  Global improvement in rosacea at the last visit: % of subjects across scores Exploratory efficacy variable 9.1.1.3 One exploratory endpoint is planned to be analyzed:"

Major deviations will be defined during a data review meeting after data entry and before unblinding the clinical trial treatment. Major protocol deviations will be considered as having a possible effect on the interpretation of primary efficacy results and may include: inclusion criteria not respected, non-available efficacy assessment, interfering therapy at inclusion, etc. The primary efficacy endpoint will be analysed based on this population. The Intent- to-Treat efficacy population (ITT) 9.1.2.2 This population will consist of the entire population enrolled and randomised (i.e. assigned a kit number). The ITT population will be used for all variables except the safety variables. The Safety population (All subject treated [APT]) 9.1.2.3 This population will consist of the Intent- to-Treat population, after exclusion of subjects who never used the treatment with certainty based on monitoring report. The APT population will be only used for the safety variables (AEs). Missing values 9.1.2.4 The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will be used to impute missing values of Inflammatory Lesion count, CEA, IGA and Stinging/burning sensation. If no post-baseline data"

Thus, the number of subjects will not vary at each visit. The other missing values will not be replaced (observed data). Data presentation and graphics 9.1.3 All continuous data will be summarized using usual statistics: number of values, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, and by frequency distribution (n, %) for qualitative data. For ordinal data, both frequency distribution and usual statistics will be presented. All tables will be presented by clinical trial treatment and by visit (when applicable). Therapies that have been stopped before the baseline visit will be presented as prior therapies. Those reported at screening or starting between screening and baseline visits and still continuing after baseline will be classified as concomitant therapies. The adverse events will be descriptively summarized (n, %) for the safety population (APT). The adverse events will be descriptively summarized (n, %) by relationship to clinical trial treatments within System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (MedDRA). Subjects will be descriptively summarized (n, %) by intensity ( i.e. mild, moderate and severe) of adverse events, SOC and preferred terms. Deaths and serious adverse events will be reported as well as withdrawals due to adverse events. A subject will be counted only once per System Organ Class (SOC) and only once per preferred term even if more than one occurrence of an event was reported within a SOC or preferred term. In the summary by categories of intensity, the adverse event with the highest intensity will be used. The subject will be counted only once per SOC (highest intensity whatever the AE within the SOC) and once per preferred term (highest intensity whatever the AE within the preferred term). Statistical analyses 9.1.4 Any changes of the statistical analyses decided after the database lock will be justified and documented. The definition of the populations will be finalized after a blind data review meeting, during which the distribution of subjects per site will be reviewed. In case of too small sites or in case of severe unbalance between the size of sites, some sites may be combined, e.g. per geographical area, to form analysis-center for purpose of stratification of the statistical analyses. The primary objective of this study will be to demonstrate the superiority of the Ivermectin 1% topical cream associated with Doxycycline 40 mg MR capsules compared to versus Ivermectin 1% topical cream associated with Placebo, in terms of Inflammatory Lesion count at week 12 .

PP analysis will also be performed to assess the robustness of the results obtained on ITT/LOCF population. The p-values will have to be inferior to 0.05 at week 12. The secondary efficacy variables, questionnaires will be analyzed similarly as primary analyses on appropriate population. The subject characteristics (disposition, previous and concomitant therapies, study treatments duration/ compliance, demographics, baseline characteristics, …), lesion counts and adverse event(s) will only be summarized descriptively, on appropriate population. 9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION Historical data and assumptions 9.2.1 No previous study exists associating Ivermectin 1% cream and Doxycycline MR. Therefore, this sample size was calculated using the results (% change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12) of previous studies on subjects treated with:  Ivermectin 1% cream alone, which showed a standard deviation (SD) between 25.4% to 39.9% (with a mean around 35%).  Doxycycline MR alone, which showed a minimum difference of 26% at Week 12, vs. Placebo Using this historical data, we can assume that the difference between the association (Ivermectin + Doxycycline MR) and Ivermectin will be at least of 15% with a SD of 35%. Sample size calculation 9.2.2 With the assumptions mentioned above, a total of 114 evaluable subjects per group will be required to demonstrate at least 15% difference at Week 12, with 90% power. To allow a 15% rate of subjects excluded from analysis (drop out, lost to foll ow-up, etc.) at Week 12, 135 subjects per group (270 in total) are to be enrolled."
