Indication This trial will enroll treatment-naive subjects with locally advanced, unresectable stage III non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study protocols BGB-A317-NSCL-001 and BGB-A317-NSCL-001C have a total combined enrollment target of 840 subjects. The data from both study protocols will be collected into one d atabase and the statistical analyses as described in Section 9will be performed on the combined total number of subjects randomized into either the main protocol or the companion protocol. A single independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and blinded independent central review will be utilized for these 2 study protocols. Objectives Primary Objective The primary objective is to compare the progression free survival (PFS) of tislelizumab in combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) followed by tislelizumab monotherapy (Arm 1) versus cCRT alone (Arm 3); in addition, tislelizumab given sequentially after cCRT (Arm 2) will be compared with cCRT alone (Arm 3) in newly diagnosed stage III subjects with locally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Secondary Objective(s) The secondary objectives are to: !Compare overall survival (OS) (key secondary objective) !Compare OS at 24 months (key secondary objective) !Compare centrally-assessed objective respons e rate (ORR) (key secondary objective) !Compare centrally-assessed duration of response (DOR) !Compare proportion of subjects alive and progression-free at 12 and 18 months (APF12, APF18) !Compare time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM) !Compare safety and tolerability of tis lelizumab in combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) followed by tislelizumab monotherapy versus cCRT alone, and tislelizumab given sequentially after cCRT versus cCRT alone&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)277--NSCLNSCL --00 0 subjects.

The choice of chemotherapy regimen to be used as part of study treatment w ill be at the Investigator’s discretion, consisting of either 2 cycles of cisplatin plus etoposide or weekly carboplatin plus paclitaxel given during radiation th erapy (RT) for 6 weeks. Radiation therapy should start concurrently with chemotherapy in Cycle 1 of tislelizumab or placebo. If local technical or logistical circumstances do not allow for the start of RT at the beginning of Cycle 1, a 3-day administrative window to start RT will be allowed. Tislelizumab or placebo will be given starting from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) in the cCRT phase, and continued in the monotherapy phase for a duration of 12 months following the completion of cCRT, or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or treatment discontinuation for another reason. Randomization will be stratified by age ), chemotherapy regimen ( ), and region ( ). Safety and efficacy will be monitored by an IDMC. For immune therapies such as tislelizumab, pseudoprogression may occur due to immune-cell infiltration and other mechanisms, leading to apparent increase of existing tumor masses or appearance of new tumor lesions. Thus, if radiographic progressive disease is suspected by the Investigator to reflect pseudoprogression, the subject may continue treatment until progressive disease is confirmed by repeated imaging at leas t 4 weeks later but not exceeding 6 to 8 weeks from the date of initial documentation of progressive disease, provided the following criteria are met: !Absence of clinical symptoms and signs of disease progression (including clinically significant worsening of laboratory values). !Stable ECOG performance status ( ≤ 1).CCICCI CCI CCICCI &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ven en phase hase on, n, rapypyregimeregim ).). pies such apies such a other mechother me of new tumof new tum tor to reflecto refle e is confirme is confirm m m ththeedate odate met:met:5 )21)2 <,15<,5<$5<7$5(7$,(75,(35,352352335235(351(325"

Investigators must obtain written informed consent for treatment beyond radiologic disease progression and inform subjects that this pract ice is not considered standard in the treatment of cancer. The decision to continue study drug(s ) beyond initial Investigator-assessed progression must be discussed with the Sponsor medical monitor and documented in the study records. The study conduct will be overseen by a Steering Committee (SC) composed of selected Investigators who are taking part in the study. The SC will remain blinded to the study data by arm. The study will be conducted in compliance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs). Study Population Adult subjects with newly diagnosed, histol ogically confirmed, locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC for whom chemoradiotherapy is appropriate w ill be randomized. Subjects with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sensitizing mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene translocations may be randomized up to approximately 10% of the total randomized population. Length of Study Enrollment is expected to take approximately 28 months to complete. To reach final PFS analysis, 580 PFS events are expected across the 3 arms in approximately 35 months following randomization of the first subject. The total study duration is estimated to be approximately 61 months from the rando mization of the first subject to the final analysis, conducted when approximately 572 overall survival (OS)events have occurred across the 3 arms. The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the posttreatment follow-up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for primary, secondary , as prespecified in the protocol, whichever is the later date. Study Treatments Anti-PD-1 therapy/PlaceboTislelizumab or placebo: Radiation therapy Thoracic RT will be given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, in once daily fractions, 2 Gy per fraction, to a target dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions.

The total duration of tislelizumab (Arm 1), placebo followed by ti slelizumab (Arm 2), or p lacebo alone (Arm 3) will be approximately 14 months, including the cCRT period. Subjects may remain on treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, initiation of a subsequent anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, subject refusal, lost to follow-up, physician decision, or death. Overview of Key Efficacy Assessments All subjects will be evaluated for tumor response and progression by Investigator assessment for therapeutic decisions according to Response Evalua tion Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 guidelines, at screening and every 6 weeks (± 7 days) from randomization for the first 36 weeks, and every 9 weeks (± 7 days) from Week 36 onwards un til documented disease progression, start of subsequent anticancer therap y, or withdrawal of consent. Response assessments will include computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary endpoint of PFS will be based on response assessments evaluated by blinded independent central review. In the follow-up phase, subsequent anticancer treatment administered following the last dose of investigational product (IP) and survival will be followed every 3 months (± 14 days) until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow-up, whichever occurs first, or the End of Trial. Overview of Key Safety Assessments All subjects will be monitored for adverse events starting from the time the subject signs the informed consent form (ICF) until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (tislelizumab/placebo, chemotherapy, or RT), as well as those SAEs made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to study tr eatment. Sub jects will also be monitored for immune related adverse events (s erious or nonserious) starting from the time the subject signs the ICF until 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab or placebo,regardless of whether or not the subject starts a new anticancer therapy. All AEs and SAEs considered related to RT will be collected at any time after the first dose of RT, including late radiation toxicities. A thorough evaluation of medical conditions, including analysis of pulmonary function, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), C-reactive protein, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HBV and HCV), will be conducted during screening. Documented physical examination (PE), vital signs, laboratory assessments (eg, serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, thyroid function), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), ophthalmologic examination, urinalysis, HBV and HCV (if positive at screening), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status will be monitored regularly.

The full schedule of assessments is described in Table 4 and Section 6. Statistical Methods The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of either one of the tislelizumab arms (Arm 1 or Arm 2) compared with the control arm ( Arm 3) in terms of PFS. There will be one interim and one final analysis for PFS, and one interim and one final analysis for OS, respectively. Efficacy Analyses The primary efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population. The primary and key secondary endpoints will also be analyzed using the per protocol population. The primary endpoint, PFS, is defined as the time from rando mization to the time of progression (based on blinded independent reviewer asse ssment using RECIST v1.1) or death, whichever is earlier. Subjects without progression or death will be censored according to censoring rules similar to those described by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the FDA Guidance for Industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics ( FDA, 2007 ). The distribution of PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The comparison of PFS between treatment arms (Arm 1 versus Arm 3 or Arm 2 versus Arm 3) will be conducted using a stratified log-rank test with age ), chemotherapy regimen ), and region ( as stratification factors. The hazard ratio (between Arm 1 or Arm 2 versus Arm 3) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will also be provided based on a stratified Cox proportional hazard model. The median PFS (w ith 95% confidence interval) and est imation of PFS rate (with 95% confidence intervals) for specific time points (eg, 3 months, 6 months etc.) will be provided for each treatment arm. The first key secondary endpoint, OS, is defined as the time fro m randomization to d eath due to any cause. Subjects without documented death at the time of analysis will be censored at the last- known-to-be-alive date. The distribution of OS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. A stratified log-rank test will be used to compare treatment groups in OS. The median OS (with 95% confidence interval) and est imation of OS r ate (with 95% confidence intervals) for different timepoints will be provided by treatment arm. The hazard ratio (between Arm 1 or Arm 2 versus Arm 3) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will also be provided based on a stratified Cox regression model. The second key secondary endpoint, OS at 24 months (OS 24), is defined as the proportion of subjects alive at 24 months. The point estimate and the corresponding 95% confidence interval for each treatment arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-M eier method. The treatment comparisons for OS 24 will be performed using an approach as described in Klein, 2007 .CCI CCI CCI CCI &(/*(1(3523o (between o (betwe erval will aerval will a median PFmedian PF nce intervalnce interval treatment atreatme ry endpory endpo in s without ds without d ve date.

The ORR for each treatment arm will be summarized using 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval. The difference in ORR between treatment arms and the associated 95% Wilson score confidence interval will be provided. A Cochran-Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test will be used to compare ORR between treatment arms. Safety Analyses Safety analyses will be performed based on the safety population. Safety and tolerability will be monitored through continuous reporting of AEs and SAEs, laboratory abnormalities, and incidence of subjects experiencing dose modifications, dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of IP. Descriptive statistics will be provided for summaries of adverse events, clinical laboratory data, and other safety assessments. Adverse events will be analyzed in terms of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as an AE that had an onset date or a worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) on or after the first dose of study treatment up to 30 days following study treatment discontinuation or initiation of new ant icancer therapy, whichever occurs firs t. Treatment-emerge nt AEs also include all immune-related AEs (irAEs) recorded up to 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab or placebo, rega rdless of whether or not the subject starts a new anticancer therapy. All events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment-emergent AEs will be su mmarized per treatment arms by MedDRA system organ class and preferred terms. Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, SAEs, TEAEs leading to dose reduction and dose interruption, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and TEAEs with an outcome of death will be summarized per treatment arms by MedDRA system organ class and preferred terms. A dditionally, adverse events of special interest for tislelizumab will be summarized in the same manner. .

Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide with approximately 1.8 million new diagnoses and 1.59 million deaths in 2012, which corresponds to the third highest incidence among cancers and the most commo n cancer-related mortality ( Globocan, 2012 ). Globally, across all cancer types, lung cancer is more common in men (16.8%) compared to women (8.8%). As lung cancer can be asymptomatic at early stages, most lung cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage which is not curable by surgery ( American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] Cancer Staging Manual, 2017 ), resulting in a poor prognosis. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common histological type of lung cancer, accoun ting for 80% to 85% of all lung cancers, and originates from the epithelial cells of the lung with the following major histological subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma (National Cancer Institute, 2018 ). About one third of subjects with NSCLC present with locally adva nced stage III disease, which includes subjects with involvement of locoregional mediastinal lymph nodes or mediastinal organs, with 5-year survival rates of 36% for stage IIIA, 26% for stage IIIB, and 13% for stage IIIC ( American Cancer Society, 2018 ). Some patients with stage IIIA disease can undergo resection, and have improved survival compared to those that are unresectable. 1.1.2. First-line Concurrent Chemotherapy/ Radiation Therapy for Locally Advanced NSCLC Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) has beco me the standard of care for subjects with lo cally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC ( National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2018 ) (European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO] guidelines [ Postmus, 2017 ]). Combined modality treatment with chemotherapy and radiation was shown to be superior to radiation therapy alone ( Rolland, 2007 ). The positive outcomes for cCRT have been shown in multiple studies. A meta-analysis from the mid-1990s usi ng updated data on individual subjects from 52 randomized clinical trials ( NSCLC Collaborative Group, 1995 ) and a subsequent meta-analysis of platinum-based chemotherapies from 1764 subjects ( Aupérin, 2006 ) demonstrated that adding sequential or concurrent chemotherapy to radiot herapy improved surviva l in locally advanced NSCLC. When concurrent versus sequential chem oradiotherapy was compared directly in data for 1205 subjects from 6 clinical trials, there was a significant benefit of cCRT on overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.95; P = 0.004), with an absolute benefit of 5.7% (from 18.1% to 23.8%) at 3 years and 4.5% at 5 years. For progression-free survival, the HR was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.01; P = 0.07). Concurrent treatment decreased locoregional progression (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95; P = 0 .01), although concurrent treatment was not different from sequential treatment on distant progression (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.25; P = 0.69). Concurrent chemoradiotherapy increased acute esophageal toxicity, but there was no significant difference regarding acute pulmonary toxicity ( Aupérin, 2010 ). In order to improve outcomes for subjects with unresectable stage III NSCLC, induction and consolidation chemotherapy have also been studied. There was more neutropenia observed with &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21osed at sed at cer cer ell lung canell lung can 0% to 850% to 85 %% owing majoowing majo ge cell carcie cell carci nced nced sstage Itag ymph nodeymph nod for for stage Itage h stage IIIAtage IIIA se that are use that are y/ Radiatioy/ Radiatio becobeco me thme t ((National Nation OncolOncol ogy rapy and rarapy and ra The positThe posit iviv m m ththe mide m -1 ((NSCLC CSCLC C motherapiemotherapie rent chement chem oncurrent voncurrent v ectts fros from m 66 azard ratizard rati oo benefit of benefit of urvival, theurvival, t coregicoregi onalonall treatmreatm ent went .86 to .86 to"

Number:Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) Protocol BGB-A317-NSCL-001 Celgene Corporation 23 BGB-A317-NSCL-001 Amendment 1 Final: 20 Sep 2018induction chemotherapy with no improvement in overall survival ( Vokes, 2007 ). Consolidation chemotherapy has also not been shown to have any impact on overall survival compared to cCRT alone ( Tsujino, 2013 ). Therefore, cCRT is considered the standard of care for patients with locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC. Of note, the standard of care for patients with stage III NSCLC remains cCRT regardless of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sensitizing mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene translocations ( NCCN, 2018 ; Postmus, 2017 ). Epidermal growth factor receptor and ALK targeted agents are not utilized as upfront therapy and are still being investig ated in trials such as the Radiation Thoracic Oncology Group (RTOG) 1306 study ( Berman, 2016 ). Multiple chemotherapy backbone regimens have also been found to be acceptable combination regimens in stage III NSCLC as part of the standard of care for cCRT. Most regimens are combinations of cisplatin with either pemetrexe d, etoposide, vinblastine, or vinorelbine. Few studies have been conducted comparing these chemotherapy regimens, and no chemotherapy regimen has been clearly demonstrated to be better than others. Of the chemotherapy doublets that have comparative evidence, cisplatin in combination with either pemetrexed or etoposide has been studied in this stage III NSCLC tr eatment population. The PROCLAIM multinational trial ( Senan, 2016 ) endeavored to establish whether ci splatin/pemetrexed is superior to cisplatin/et oposide wh en given concurrently with standard radiation therapy (RT) at 60-66 Gray (Gy), followed by a consolidation phase. Cisplatin/pemetrexed was not found to be superior in OS to cisplatin/etoposide (median overall survival [OS] 26.8 months versus 25.0 months; P = 0.831). Both arms had low incidences of Grades 3 or 4 pneumonitis (< 3%), with no significant differences between arms in treatment discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events (AEs)or drug-related deaths. The PROCLAIM study therefore establishes that outcomes with cisplatin with either pemetrexed or etoposide when used in cCRT with conventional radiation therapy are similar. Carboplatin with paclitaxel given weekly during radiation is another acceptable cCRT option as recommended by the NCCN guidelines, with th e 2 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel consolidation considered as optional ( NCCN, 2018 ). This regimen has been evaluated in several studies ( Belani, 2005 ; Vokes, 2007 ; Yamamoto, 2010 ; Bradley, 2015 ) and is commonly used as a first-line treatment for locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC in the US and other countries globally. Weekly carbopl atin/paclitaxel was used as part of the chemotherapy regimen backbone in the RTOG 0617 study that evaluated standard versus high doses of radiation to be given concurrently with chemotherapy ( Bradley, 2015 ). A Phase 3 trial of concurrent thoracic radiation in unresectable stage III NSCLC found that weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel was superior to second-generation chemotherapy regimens such as mitomycin/vindesine, weekly irinotecan/carboplatin, or cisplatin or carboplatin as a single agent with radiation therapy (Yamamoto, 2010 ). Of note, in the Phase 3 PACIFIC study, which evaluated the anti- programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor durvalumab compared to placebo after cCRT, carboplatin with paclitaxel was the most common chemotherapy regimen chosen by investigators, administered to 33.9% of subjects in the intent-to-tr eat (ITT ) population; consolidation chemotherapy after radiation was not permitted in this study ( Antonia, 2017 ). In an attempt to improve outcomes, higher doses of radiation have been studied in combination with chemotherapy. Approximately 60 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions has been previously established as the standard conventional radiation dose in stage III NSCLC in the RTOG 7301 study ( Bradley, 2015 ). Subsequently the RTOG 0617 study has shown that 74 Gy was not better &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21yy natatioion n s are are bine. Fewbine.

In fact, the median OS was 28.7 months for those subjects who received 60 Gy versus 20 months for those who received 74 Gy. Local relapse rates were also lower in the 60 Gy cohort. Thus, the accepted s tandard of care is approximately 60 Gy in 2 Gy fractions ( NCCN, 2018 ) (ESMO 2017 guidelines [ Postmus, 2017 ]). 1.1.3. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Therapy for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Lung Cancers Anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) therapy has emerged as an effective treatment for those expressing varying degrees of (PD-L1) ( Hanna, 2017 ). Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies target the programmed death receptor p athway of T lymphocytes, and this checkpoint has been found to be activated in cancer allowing tumors to evade the host immune system. In the US and other regions, multiple anti-PD-1 (eg, nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and anti-PD-L1 (eg atezolizumab) therapies have been approved in lung cancer in the second line setting (Table 1 ). In the first line setting, pembrolizumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as monotherapy in subjects with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express a high level of PD-L1 (Tumor Prognostic Score ≥50%). Pembrolizumab has also been granted accelerated approval by the FDA in the first-line s etting in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin in metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC ( Table 1 ). In the locally advanced, first-line NSCLC setting, the potential benefits of checkpoint blockade when given sequentially following completion of cCRT have been demonstrated by the PACIFIC trial ( Antonia, 2017 ). This is a global Phase 3 trial of the anti-PD-L1 therapy, durvalumab, compared to placebo as consolidatio n therapy following 2 or more cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy administered concurrently with RT without progression in subjects with unresectable stage III NSCLC. Subjects who were able to complete chemoradiotherapy, and who remained progression free at that time, were randomized within 1 to 42 days after completing at least 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (containing etoposide, vinblastine, vinorelbine, a taxane, or pemetrexed) administered concurrently with definitive radiation therapy of 54 to 66 Gy. The trial demonstrated that median progression free survival (PFS) was significantly longer with durvalumab compared to placebo (median PFS 16.8 months versus 5.6 months, stratified HR for disease progression or death = 0.52), with a similar safety profile in the 2 groups. Notably, enrollment was not restricted to any thresholds for the level of PD-L1 expression, and results showed that the PFS benefit was irrespective of baseline PD-L1 expression (HR 0.59 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.82] for a PD-L1 expression level of < 25% and 0.41 [95% CI, 0.26 to 0.65] for a PD-L1 expression level of ≥ 25%). In February 2018, based on the results of the PACIFIC study, durvalumab was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of subjects with unresectable stage III NSCLC whose cancer had not progressed after chemoradiation ( FDA News Release, 2018 ). This immunotherapy thus becomes the first treatment approved to reduce the risk of NSCLC progression in this setting, and may lead to a change in first line treatment for stage III subjects , with the potential recommendation that anti- PD-L1 consolidation therapy be offered after concurrent chemoradiation therapy ( NCCN, 2018 ). However, there are still some caveats to the PA CIFIC study. There is some uncertainty as to whether all subjects enrolled in this study underwent appropriate evaluations for optimal staging, and whether this trial included subjects with occult stage IV disease ( Copur, 2018 ). In addition, almost 30% of subjects enrolled did not proceed to randomization in the study, with the exact reasons for dropout not further specified beyond the majority of subjects not meeting eligibility criteria ( Antonia, 2017 ).

Furthermore, OS data is not yet available. If an OS benefit is eventually shown, cCRT followed by anti-PD-L1 therapy with durvalumab is anticipated to beco me an emerging standard of care for subjects with stage III NSCLC. There are multiple ongoing studies evaluating anti-PD -1 or PD-L1 therapies in combination with radiation or chemoradiotherapy. Based on the mechanism of action and biology of PD-1/PD-L1, it is not anticipated that the antibody will act as a direct radiation sensitizer for normal or malignant cells. Emerging retrospective and prospective data suggests that anti-PD-1 therapy (at the established monotherapy dosing) in combinatio n with radiation has similar toxicity to that anticipated with either treatment alone ( Nomura, 2018 ; Fiorica, 2018 ). This and other emerging data support that anti-PD-1 therapies can be safely added to standard of care chemotherapy regimens in NSCLC, with the potential for improved efficacy compared to chemotherapy alone. For example, the Phase 2 NICOLAS trial is evaluating the anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab, with cCRT in stage III NSCLC ( Jabbour, 2017 ), and several ongoing trials are testing concurrent anti- PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapies with cCRT in other solid tumor malignancies. In the metastatic NSCLC setting, prior to the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the mainstay of treatment was chemotherapy involving platinum-containing doublets. The 5-year survival rate for these subjects was low, ranging from 10% for stage IVA to less than 1% for stage IVB ( American Cancer Society, 2018 ). Additional treatment for some patients is based on tumor mutation status such as EGFR, ALK or proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS (ROS-1) mutations, where tyrosin e kinase inhibitors are pr imary treatment opt ions. In 2017, pembrolizumab in combination with p emetrexed and carboplatin was granted accelerated approval in the US in th e first-line setting for all nonsquamous stage IV subjects based on the results of the Keynote-021 Phase 2 randomized study ( Langer, 2016) . Pembrolizumab is also approved for and recommended by the NCCN as a si ngle-agent, first-line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC who have PD-L1 expre ssion levels of > 50% and EGFR mutation and ALK and ROS rearrangements negative or unknown based on the Keynote-024 study ( Reck, 2016 )(Table 1 ). Most recently, the KEYNOT E-189 Phase 3 study showed that in subjects with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy (pemetrexed with a platinum-based drug) resulted in a significantly longer rate of OS at 12 months (69.2% versus 49.4% [HR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64; P < 0.001]) and median PFS (8.8 months versus 4.9 months [HR 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64; P < 0.001]) than chemotherapy alone ( Gandhi, 2018 ). In addition, the median PFS was significantly prolonged among subjects with s tage IV or recurrent NSCLC who had high tumor mutational burden and were treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the first-line setting compared to chemotherapy alone (7.2 months versus 5.5 months [HR 0.58; 97.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.81; P < 0.001]) ( Hellmann, 2018 ). Targeted therapy is recommended for subjects with metastatic NSCLC with ALK or ROS1 rearrangements or EGFR mutations, and subsequent targeted therapy can be used in subjects with EGFR mutations or ALK translocations upon progression ( NCCN, 2018 ). For those subjects who do not have these genetic alterations, the NCCN recommends ICIs as preferred subsequent therapy based on improved OS, longer duration of response, and fewer AEs when compared to cytotoxic therapy. Nivolumab ha s been FDA approved as subsequent therapy for patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC (Checkmate-057) ( Borghaei, 2015 ) and metastatic squamous NSCLC (Checkmate-017) ( Brahmer, 2015 ) who have progressed on or after first-line &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21(at at at at merging erging erapy rapy herapyerap alalyyono vovolumab, wlumab, w ing concurring concur s.. point inhibpoint inhib ining doublining dou tage IVA totage IVA t mmentenfofor sr ene tyne ty rosinrosiyyy e primarye primary tryy d carboplaticarbopl nonsquamounonsquam d study (study ( LaLa CN as a singCN as a sing expressioexpressio n ve or unknove or unkno KEYNOTKEYNOT nonsquamononsquamo sstandard ctandard c onger rate nger rate 001]) and m001]) and 01]) than ch1]) than prolonged prolonged nalal bbllurden urden pared to chpared to ch .81; P; P<<0.00.0 eted therapeted thera arrangemearrangeme wiwithi EGFEGFh ubjectubject"

Pharmacology Tislelizumab (also known as BGB-A317) is a humanized, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-variant monoclonal antibody against PD-1 under clini cal development for the treatment of several human malignancies. Tislelizumab binds to the extracellular domain of human PD-1 with high specificity and affinity (KD= 0.15 nM). It competitively blocks the binding of both PD-L1 a nd programmed cell death ligand-2 (PD-L2), thus inhibiting PD-1-mediated negative signaling in T cells. In in vitro cell- based assays, tislelizumab was observed to c onsistently and dose-dependently enhance the functional activity of human T cells and preactivated, primary peripheral bl ood m ononuclear cells. In addition, tislelizumab has demonstrated antitumor activity in several human cancer allogeneic xenograft models, in which peripheral blood mononuclear cells were co-injected with human cancer cells (A431 [epidermoid carcinoma]) or tumor fragments (BCCO-028 [colon cancer]) into immunocompromised mice. Robust anti tumor activity of tislelizumab was also observed in human PD-1 transgenic mice transplanted with B16/F10 mouse melanoma cells overexpressing antimurine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulation factor. The IgG4 variant antibody has very low binding affinity to Fc γRIIIA and complement 1q, a subunit of complement 1, by in vitro assays, suggesting low or no antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxi city eff ects in humans ( Labrijn, 2009 ). Unlike native IgG4 antibody, tislelizumab has no observable fragment antigen-binding-arm exchange activity in an in vitro assay, predicting the antibody would be stable in vivo and unlikely to form bispecific antibodies.

Study Rationale and Purpose While cCRT has become the standard of care for the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC, as shown by the RTOG 9410 study which reported a significant improvement in overall survival with concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy compared to sequential chemoradiotherapy ( Curran, 2011 ), there has not been substantial improvement subsequently with cCRT alone despite exploration of different treatment options such as dose escalation of radiation, induction chemotherapy, and various regimens of consolidative chemotherapy following cCRT ( Postmus, 2017 ). There is strong evidence that not only can there be synergy of ICIs with chemotherapy, this can occur with concurrent chemoradiotherapy as well. It is now known that both chemotherapy and RT can up-regulate the expression of PD-L1 ( Zhang, 2008 ; Deng, 2014 ) due to the release of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules, which could make such tumors sensitive to a PD- 1/PD-L1 directed therapy. In this setting, chemotherapy and RT act as priming agents for immunotherapy; elimination of cancer cells by chemotherapy and/or RT triggers release of &(/*(1(3523le and P and u me the stanme the stan as shown bys shown by al wital wit h conh con herapy (herapy ( CurCur alalone ne despdes n, inductn, induct ioio winwing cCRTg cCR TThere is strhere is str occur ccur wiw c5,(7$5<,1)250$7,2150 )25,1)<,15<,$57$(7$5,(75,(35"

In addition, RT has an impact on the immune system by engaging both the innate and the adaptive arms, eliciting tumor-specific T-cells and establishing an immune memory against the tumor. This prolongs the effect of radiation,improving locoregional control, decreasing metastatic spread, and increasing overall survival (Formenti, 2013 ). It is also anticipated that while chemotherapy has been shown to sensitize tumors to radiation therapy, immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 therapies may be less directly interacting, and emerging data suggests that PD-1 /PD-L1 antibodies can be given at full doses with RT as they can be with chemotherapy ( Fiorica, 2018 ). As described earlier, the PD-L1 inhibitor, durvalumab, has demonstrated a PFS improvement in locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC patie nts who were fully recovered and had not progressed following a full course of combined modality therapy. A limitation of the PACIFIC study is that there was no requirement for fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans and/or brain imaging to rule out stage IV disease; this may have confounded the efficacy results in favor of the durvalumab arm and depressed the efficacy observed with combined modality alone in the control arm. Th is study will require all subjects to be staged with FDG-PET and brain imaging to better establish that all randomized subjects are stage III. As only approximately 70% of subjects in the PACIFIC study who were enrolled were randomized, this trial will seek to determine if improved efficacy can be achieved to allow a higher proportion of subjects to complete the cCRT phase and enter the monotherapy phase. In consideration of the limitations of the PACIFIC trial, this protocol will evaluate whether the addition of an anti-PD-1 therapy added to combin ed modality therapy can benefit subjects with definitive stage III unresectable NSCLC. In a ddition, the PACIFIC study subgroup analysis of PFS showed that subjects who started durvalumab closer to the last radiation therapy (last radiation to randomization < 14 days versus ≥ 14 days) seemed to trend towards greater PFS benefit with durvalumab. Thus, the earlier introduction of tislelizumab given simultaneously with cCRT (Arm 1) may lead to further enha ncement of immune med iated antitumor eff icacy. 1.3.2. Rationale for the Study Design All randomized subjects on this trial will receive standard of care combined modality cCRT. In order to minimize the heterogeneity of different ch emotherapy backbones, this study will allow Investigators the option of cisplatin-etoposide as established by the PROCLAIM study. This study will also allow weekly paclitaxel and carbop latin to give Investigators more than one chemotherapy option, as supported by the NCCN guidelines and the literature ( NCCN, 2018; Yamamoto, 2010 ). Radiotherapy will be given concurrently with chemotherapy for 5 days per week for 6 weeks, in once daily fractions, 2 Gy per fraction, to a target dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. As a pooled analysis of 41 Phase 2/3 trials did not show any evidence that consolidation after cCRT improves survival for stage III NSCLC and current guidelines continue to recommend cCRT alone ( Bayman, 2014 ; Postmus, 2017 ), no consolidation chemotherapy will be given.

Subjects will be required to have EGFR mutation and ALK gene translocation results available prior to rando mization; EGFR/ALK positive subjects will be allowed up to a maximum of 10% of the total number of subjects rando mized. The standard of care for patients with stage III NSCLC regardless of EGFR mutation or ALK gene translocation remains cCRT ( NCCN, 2018 ;Postmus, 2017 ). Targeted therapy is not utilized as upfront therapy for patients with EGFR mutations or ALK gene translocations and is st ill being investigated in trials such as RTOG 1306 ( Berman, 2016 ). A recent meta-analysis of 5 trials involving 3025 subjects with advanced second-line or later NSCLC randomized to receive a checkpoint inhibitor or docetaxel showed that there was prolonged survival in those who were EGFR wild type but not in those who were EGFR mutant ( Lee, 2018 ), suggesting that there is no clear benefit from checkpoint inhibitor monothe rapy for patients with EGFR mutations. In contrast, in the PACIFIC study, subjects with EGFR mutation comprised 6% of the study population and the results in the subgroup analyses were consistent with the ITT population with a demonstrated PFS benefit from durvalumab, though a significant number of subjects (26%) did have unknown EGFR mutation status ( Antonia, 2017 ). In the study IMpower150, where EGFR/ALK subjects represented 14% of the enro lled population, benefits have been observed (Reck, 2017 ). Thus, this study will include a limited number of subjects with EGFR mutation or ALK gene translocation, as this population warrants further investigation of anti-PD-1 therapy with cCRT in the first-line setting for stage III unresectable NSCLC. By requiring testing at screening, this study will better address the effect of anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with tumors expressing these gene alterations. In addition, this study will require all subjects be staged with FDG-PET CT and brain imaging to better establish that all randomized subjects are stage III. Prior studies of PD-1/PD-L1 therapy given conc urrently with chemotherapy or with or in close proximity to radiation suggests a manageable safety profile ( Samstein, 2017 ). Furthermore, the PACIFIC study did not show any new safety signals when durvalumab was given after cCRT, with the safety profile consistent with other immunotherapies and monotherapy, with pneumonitis mostly low grade, and clinically important Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were balanced between the 2 groups. However, the safety and tolerability of checkpoint inhibitors given concurrently with cCRT is still being evaluated. Preliminary data suggest that combining anti- PD1 therapy and RT is safe ( Liniker, 2016 ). Most recently, the early interim safety analysis of the NICOLAS study, a Phase 2 trial evaluating the addition of the anti-PD-1 therapy nivolumab to first-line cCRT in locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC showed that this approach was safe and tolerable in that study, with no unexpected AEs or increased safety risks identified. At the time of this early interim safety analysis, 49 subjects had been recruited with a median follow-up of 6.6 months. The most frequently observed AEs were fatigue and anemia. For the first 21 patients, no pneumonitis grade ≥3 was observed by the end of the 3-month post-RT follow-up period ( Peters, 2018 ). To address any potential toxicities of administering anti-PD-1 treatment, particularly when given simultaneously with cCRT, a rigorous safety assessment w ill be implemented, with independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) safety reviews to assess for early safety signals.

Rationale for Dose, Schedule and Regimen Selection1.3.3.1. Rationale for Selection of Tislelizumab Dose The PK, safety, and efficacy data obtained from first in human study BGB-A317_Study_001, as well as other clinical study data, were analyzed in aggregate to determine the recommended dose for pivotal studies of tislelizumab. The flat dose of was selected for further evaluation. Rates of treatment-related AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) observed in patients receiving were comparable, suggesting no clear dose-dependence across these regimens. Similarly, confirmed overall response rates (ORR) in subjects treated with tislelizumab ranged between 10% and 15%, compared to a range of 15% to 38% for patients treated at . According to PK data from BGB-A317_Study_001, Phase 1a, the clearance of tislelizumab was found to be independent of body weight, ethnicity, and gender, and the observed serum exposure of a fell between serum exposure observed after doses (dose range with comparable sa fety and efficacy rates). Additionally, no unexpected treatment related AEs occurred in the cohort (BGB-A317_Study_001, Phase 1a, Part 3) when compared to body-weight-based cohorts. Of the evaluable subjects treated (n = 13), 3 patients ( 23%) had a best overall response of PR, 4 subjects (31%) had a best overall response of stable di sease, and 6 subjects (46%) had a best overall response of progressive disease (PD). Therefore, clinical activity with a manageable and tolerable safety profile is expected to be maintained in subjects receiving tislelizumab . 1.3.3.2. Rationale for Selection of Chemotherapies Multiple chemotherapy backbone regimens, including combinations of cisplatin with either pemetrexed, etoposide, vinblastine, or vinorelbine, have been studied in stage III NSCLC and are acceptable combination regimens that can be utilized as standard of care in cCRT. Few studies have been conducted comparing these chemotherapy regimens, and no chemotherapy regimen has been clearly demonstrated to be better than others. Of these chemotherapy doublets that have comparative evidence, cisplatin in combination with either pemetrexed or etoposide has been studied in this treatment population. The PROCLA IM multinational trial endeavored to establish whether cisplatin-pemetrexed is superior to cisplatin-etoposide when given concurrently with standard radiotherapy at 60 to 66 Gy, followed by a consolidation phase; cisplatin-pemetrexed was not found to be superior in OS to cisplat in-etoposide (median OS 26.8 versus 25.0 months; P = 0.831). Both arms had low incidences of Grades 3 or 4 pneumonitis (< 3%) and there were no significant differences between arms in treatment discontinuations due to drug-related AEs or CCICCICCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI &(/*(1(3e for Selecfor Sele hherapyerapy bacbayy etoposioposi de, vde, combinatcombinat ioio en conducten conduc been clearlyeen clearl mmparatparatm ive ive studitued ined in whethewhethe35235,(7$5<a, the a, the clearea nder, and thnder, and t d after d after Es occurreEs occur hen compahen compa ents (23%) ents (23%) able diseasble disea ).

Carboplatin with paclitaxel given weekly during radiation is another acceptable cCRT option as recommended by the NCCN guidelines, with the 2 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel consolidat ion considered as optional ( NCCN, 2018 ). Weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel with RT has been evaluated in several studies ( Belani, 2005 ; Vokes, 2007 ; Yamamoto, 2010 ; Bradley, 2015 ) and is often used as a first-line treatment for locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC in the US and other countries globally. Weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel was used as part of the chemotherapy regimen backbone in the RTOG 0617 study that evaluated standard versus high doses of radiation to be given concurrently with chemotherapy ( Bradley, 2015 ). A Phase 3 trial of concurrent thoracic radiation in unresectable stage III NSCLC found that weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel was superior to second-generation chemotherapy regimens such as mitomycin/vindesine, weekly irinotecan/carboplatin, or cisplatin or carboplatin as a single agent with radiation therapy ( Yamamoto, 2010 ). For the chemotherapy backbone, this study will allow Investigators the cho ice of cisplatin/etoposide, given concurrently with RT based on the PROCLAIM study, or carboplatin/paclitaxel given weekly with RT; neither regimen will allow chemotherapy consolidation. 1.3.3.3. Rationale for Selection of Radiotherapy Dose The total dose of RT will be 60 Gy in 30 once-daily fractions of 2 Gy according to the standard dose recommended by the American Society of Radiation Oncology ( Rodrigues, 2015 ), based on the dose for locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSLC established in the RTOG 0617 study (Bradley, 2015 ). The dose of 60 Gy is endorsed by ASCO ( Bezjak, 2015 ), and is a dose supported by the NCCN and ESMO guidelines for cCRT ( NCCN, 2018 ;Postmus, 2017 ). Dose escalation beyond 60 Gy in the context of combined modality concurrent chemoradiation has not been found to be associated with any clinical benefits ( Rodrigues, 2015 ). Although other recent Phase 3 studies such as PROCLAIM had used a dose of 66 Gy (2 Gy per fraction), PROCLAIM was designed before the results of the RTOG 0617 study became available ( Senan, 2016 ). As the present trial will involve administration of a PD-1 inhibitor with cCRT, it is critical for the radiation dosing to be standardized across the entire study globally, with the target dose of 60 Gy chosen as it is a ppropriate to eradicate the primary tumor and the involved lymph nodes, while minimizing toxicities such as acute radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis as much as possible.

Rationale for Patient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life or Health Economics It will be important to assess treatment effectiveness both in terms of objective outcomes (eg, PFS or OS) and subjective, patient reported outcomes (PROs) to ensure that the addition of tislelizumab to cCRT followed by tislelizumab monotherapy in newly-diagnosed, unresectable locally advanced NSCLC subjects, does not result in a detrimental impact on subjects’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) when compar ed to cCRT alone. This detailed information can help both clinicians and subjects to make informed and comprehensive decisions regarding the best available treatments. Patient reported outcomes are any information self-reported by the subject regarding their functioning or symptoms in relation to their health condition or therapy. Patient-reported HRQoL falls under the umbrella of PROs and covers physical symptoms and functioning domains, and usually provides an ove rall subject evaluation of their health and quality of life.

Study Design This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter global study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in combination with cCRT followed by tislelizumab monotherapy versus cCRT alone, and tislelizumab given sequentially after cCRT versus cCRT alone, in newly diagnosed stage III subjects with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. The primary endpoint is centrally-assessed PFS in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Newly diagnosed stage III subjects with histologically c onfirmed, locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC are eligible. Approximately 840 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive tislelizumab or placebo in the following 3 arms: ! The choice of chemotherapy regimen to be used as part of study treatment w ill be at the Investigator’s discretion, consisting of 2 cycles of cisplatin plus etoposide or weekly carboplatin plus paclitaxel given during RT for 6 weeks. Rad iation therapy should star t concurrently with chemotherapy in Cycle 1 of tislelizumab or placebo. If local technical or logistical circumstances do not allow for the start of RT at the beginning of Cycle 1, a 3-day administrative window to start RT will be allowed. Tislelizumab or place bo will be given starting from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) in the cCRT phase, and continued in the monotherapy phase for a duration of 12 months following the completion of cCRT, or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or treatment discontinuation for another reason.

Thus, if radiographic progressive disease is suspected by the Investigator to reflect pseudoprogression, the subject may continue study treatment until progressive disease is confirmed by repeated imag ing at least 4 weeks later but not exceeding 6 to 8 weeks from the date of in itial documentation of progressive disease, provided the following criteria are met: !Absence of clinical symptoms and signs of disease progression (including clinically significant worsening of laboratory values). !Stable ECOG performance status ( ≤ 1). !Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) that requires urgent alternative medical intervention. Investigators must obtain written informed consent for treatment beyond radiologic disease progression and inform subjects that this pract ice is not considered standard in the tr eatment of cancer. The decision to continue study drug(s ) beyond initial Investigator-assessed progression must be discussed with the Sponsor medical monitor and documented in the study records. The decision to discontinue a subject, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor, remains the responsibility of the treating physic ian. However, prior to discontinuing a subject, the Investigator may contact the medical monitor and forward appropriate supporting documents for review and discussion. . The blind should be maintained for persons responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study through database lock and statistical analyses. Blinded persons may include but are not limited to: Clinical Research Physician, Clinical Research Scientist, Clinical Trial Manager, Study Statistician, Data Manager, Programmers, Clinical Research Associates.

Study Duration for Subjects Subjects may begin screening up to 28 days before randomization. Treatment must begin within 3 days of randomization. Subjects will be treated for a maximum of approximately up to 6 weeks by cCRT plus either tislelizumab or placebo, followed by tislelizumab or placebo monotherapy for a total of 12 months after completion of c CRT. Subjects will be followed in survival follow- up until death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or end of study. The total duration of tislelizumab (Arm 1), placebo followed by tislelizumab (Arm 2), or p lacebo alone (Arm 3) will be approximately 14 months, including the cCRT period. Enrollment is expected to take approximately 28 months to complete. The total study duration is estimated to be approximately 61 months from the randomization of the first subject to the final analysis, conducted when approximately 572 OS events have occurred across the 3 arms. 3.3. End of Trial The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the posttreatment follow-up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for primary, secondary analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, whichever is the later date.CCICCI CCI &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21) will) will dy durationdy duration bjectbject to the to the the 3 armsthe 3 arm last subjectlast subje oint from thint from th as prespecias prespec"

Number of Subjects Approximately 840 subjects with newly-diagnosed, locally advanced, stage III unresectable NSCLC will be randomized worldwide. 4.2. Inclusion Criteria Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: 1. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF). 2. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related assessments/procedures being conducted. 3. Subject has newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, locally advanced, stage III unresectable NSCLC. a. Staging will be confirmed at screening by PET/CT and brain imaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) with contrast. b. FDG-PET/CT will be performed whole body, or sufficient to rule out distant metastases (eg, from skull base to knees), to exclude distant disease and c onfirm that subjects are in stage III. If the CT scan portion is with contrast and is of sufficiently high quality, a separate CT scan at screening can be skipped. c. While centers are encouraged to obtain ti ssue confirmation of lymph node metastases in N2 or N3 disease, the tumor board/multidisciplinary team in individual cases may dispense with this procedure ( AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 2017 ). 4. Subject must have EGFR mutation and AL K gene translocation status av ailable (testing using tumor tissue only) prior to randomization: a. If EGFR mutation and ALK gene translocation results are not available, subjects will be tested for EGFR sensitizing mutation or ALK translo cation (using tumor tissue only). The test results verifying the presence or absence of both EGFR mutation and ALK gene translocation must be made available to the Sponsor for assessment before randomization. b. Subjects with EGFR mutation or ALK gene translocation will represent approximately 10% of the total rando mized population. Afte r this number is reached, subjects with EGFR mutation or ALK gene translocation will be excluded. 5. Subjects must be able to provide fresh or archival tumor tissues (formalin-fixed paraffin embedded [FFPE] blocks or at least 15 to 20 freshly cut unstained FFPE slides) with an associated pathological report (squamous or nonsquamous). In the absence of archival tumor tissues, a fresh biopsy (a minimum of 2 to 3 cores) of a tumor lesion at baseline is mandatory. Subjects may be permitted to be enrolled on a case-by-case basis after discussion with the Sponsor medical monitor if fewer than 15 unstained slides can be provided. 6. Subject has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1.

A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive mo nths (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) and must: a. Have 2 negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregna ncy testing during the course of the study, and after end of study therapy. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact. b. Agree to use 2 reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual contact during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study treatment; 2) while taking study treatment; 3) during dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 120 days after the subject’s last dose of tislelizumab or placebo and 180 days after the subject’s last dose of chemotherapy. The 2 methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method and one additional effective (barrier) method. The following are examples of highly effective and additional effective methods of contraception: !Examples of highly effective methods: ∀Intrauterine device ∀Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulat ion (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal) ∀Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, intrauterine, or implantable) ∀Tubal ligation ∀Vasectomized male partner, provided that the vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the study participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of surgical success.

However, if the Investigator learns of any AE related to radiation or any SAE, and he/she considers the SAE related to the study drug, the Investigator will notify the sponsor as described in Section 10. fVitals, weight, hematology and chemistry will be collected weekly during Cycles 1, 2, and 3. gEye exam, visual acuity test, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) (or equivalent diagnostic test for retinal examination) captu red as standard of care prior to obtaining written informed consent and within 28 days of randomization may be used rather than repeating tests. Eye exam, vi sual acuity test, and OCT (or equivalent diagnostic test) will be assessed at screening and then approximately ev ery 15 weeks (± 7 days) during study treatmen t. The ophthalmologic assessments including eye exam, visual acuity test, and OCT (or equivalent diagnostic test) should only be performed once at ei ther the EOT or during safety follow up, within 30 days of study treatment end. hHematology, serum chemistry, coagulation and thyroid function laboratory tests will be performed centrally. Local laboratory te sts can be used for enrollment and dosing day. If screening laboratory tests are performed within 3 days of C1D1, these tests do not need to be repeated on C1 D1. Before any administration of study treatment on each cycle, the results of CBC and serum chemistry should be available and reviewed by the Investigator. O f note, creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase – cardiac muscle isoenzyme (CK-MB) will be a ssessed as part of the serum chemistry panel (as per Section 6). In case CK-MB fractionation is not available, please assess troponin (troponin I and/or T) instead. iTesting will be performed by a central laboratory and/or the local laboratory at screening and will include at screening HBV/HCV s erology (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb, and HCV antibody) and viral load assessment (HBV DNA and HCV RNA). After screening, HBV/HCV serology (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb , and HCV antibody) and viral load assessment (HBV DNA and HCV RNA) may be performed if clinically indicated; for subjects who have detect able HBV DNA or HCV RNA at screening or upon repeat testing, respective viral load testing will be performed every 4 cycles (ie, Day 1 of Cycles 5, 9, 13, etc). jUrine pregnancy tests will be performed at each visit prior to dosing.

Subjects will also be monitored for immune related adverse events (serious or nonserious) starting from the time the subject signs the ICF until 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab or placebo, regardless of whether or not the subject starts a new anticancer therapy. All AEs and SAEs considered related to RT will be collected at any time after the first dose of RT, including late radiation toxicities. The 90-Day Follow-up Visit could be conducted at site or by telephone, and will also include collection of survival data and disease therapy since IP discontinuation. 6.3.2.

The first 6-week tumor assessment after randomization should take place prior to initiation of monotherapy treatment (Cycle 3 Day 1). To en sure sufficient ability to assess tumor response, the same imaging procedure should be used throughout the study for each subject, and these imaging studies must include all lesions assessed at baseline. Tumor assessments by CT scan or MRI should also be performed at any time if clinically indicated. Subjects with historical tumor scans evaluable per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 performed ≤ 28 days before randomization need not repeat scans for the purposes of screening, as use of historical tumor scans done within the 28-day screening window is permitted. Evaluation of response for therapeutic decis ions should be performed using RECIST v1.1 guidelines (Appendix I ) by Investigator assessment. Central imaging reviewers blinded to treatment will provide independent review for disease progression and responses for all subjects enrolled into the study. Prospective co llection of all on-study scans for all subjects enrolled in the study will be included as part of the review. Films or electronic copies should be collected by the site and sent to the central imaging reviewer(s) and a copy of the file will be kept on site. Complete details regarding image handling and submission can be found in the Imaging Manual. For immune therapies such as tislelizumab, pseudoprogression may occur due to immune-cell infiltration and other mechanisms leading to apparent increase of existing tumor masses or appearance of new tumor lesions. Thus, if radiographic progressive disease is suspected by the Investigator to reflect pseudoprogression, the subject may continue treatment with tislelizumab until progressive disease is confirmed by repeated imaging at least 4 weeks later but not exceeding 6 to 8 weeks from the date of initial documentation of progressive disease, provided the following criteria are met: !Absence of clinical symptoms and signs of disease progression (including clinically significant worsening of laboratory values). !Stable ECOG performance status ( ≤ 1). !Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) that requires urgent alternative medical intervention. Investigators must obtain written informed consent for treatment beyond radiologic disease progression and inform subjects that this pract ice is not considered standard in the treatment of cancer. The decision to continue study drug(s ) beyond initial Investigator-assessed progression must be discussed with the Sponsor medical monitor and documented in the study records.

This detailed information can help both clinicians and subjects to make informed and comprehensive decisions regarding the best available treatments. Patient reported outcomes are any information self-reported by the subject regarding their functioning or symptoms in r elation to their health condition or therapy. Patient-reported HRQoL falls under the umbrella of PROs and covers physical symptoms and functioning domains, and usually provides an overall subject evaluation of their health and quality of life. Patient reported outcomes will be assessed in all randomized subjects using 2 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Can cer (EORTC) Quality of Life instruments—the EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3 ( Aaronson, 1993 ) and the lung cancer specific module (EORTC QLQ-LC13) ( Bergman, 1994 ); The EORTC QLQ-C30 and its lung cancer-specific module EORTC QLQ-LC13 are the most frequently used instruments in lung cancer subjects ( Bouazza, 2017 ). The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) also recommends these instruments as PRO measures for moni toring lung cancer ( Mak, 2016 ). Patient-reported outcomes assessment will be performed electronically using a tablet at screening, on Day 1 of each treatment cycle, at the EOT visit and 30 days after EOT. 6.7.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 The EORTC QLQ-C30, is a 30-item, psychometrically robust, cross-culturally accepted and internationally validated questionnaire designed to be applicable to a broad spectrum of cancer subjects as a core questionnaire, assessing QoL, psychosocial burden and physical symptoms. It is classified into 15 domains including 5 functional subscales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functi oning, and social functioning); 3 multi-item symptom subscales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain); a global QoL subscale; and 6 single items addressing various symptoms and perceiv ed financial impact. All EORTC QLQ-C30 items use a 4-point Likert scale (ie, “not at all,” “a little,” “quite a bit,” and “very much”), except the 2 items assessing global QOL (item 29 and item 30), which use a 7-point scale. The EORTC QLQ- C30 uses a recall period of one week ( Aaronson, 1993 ; Hjermstad, 1995 ; King, 1996 ; Osoba, 1997 ; Osoba, 1998 ). Each item from the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires is measured on a 4- point response scale; (not at all, a little, quite a bit, very much), with the exception of the 2 items measuring global health and QoL, which are measured on a 7-point response scale. The scale scores are linearly transformed to 0 to 100 scores ( Aaronson, 1993 ). Scores vary from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) for the functional dimensions and GHS, and from 0 (best) to 100 (worst) for the CCI CCI &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<odule odule EEOROR ((BouazzaBouazza (ICHOM) a(ICHOM) a Mak, 2016ak, 2016 ).). ll be perforll be perfor cyycle, at thcle, at th 3030--ititemem,ps questiestionnaironnair1)250$7,21e erapyrapy. . oms and ms and altlth and h and 2 2 EuropeanEuropea Life instruLife in ecific moduecific mod tionnaire, aionnaire, a domains inomains in tional functtional funct cales (fatales (fat igi ssing variossing vario point Likertnt Like assessing gassessing 0 uses a reuses a re 1997997; OsobOsob point reoint re<,1<,15<"

A copy of the questionnaire is presented in Appendix B . 6.7.2. EORTC QLQ-LC13 Subjects’ disease-related symptoms will be assessed using the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13; referred to here as the LC13) which is a lung- cancer specific PRO and the first m odule to be used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ- C30 (Aaronson, 1993 ; Bergman, 1994 ). The LC13 covers 13 typical symptoms of lung cancer subjects, such as coughing, pain, dyspnea, sore mouth, peripheral neuropathy, and hair loss. Extensive field testing was conducted for validity, reliability, responsiveness ( Bergman, 1994 ) as well as field studies to prove the validity of these instruments ( Koller, 2015 ). In 2 international field studies, respectively, 883 and 735 lung cancer subjects (from Europe, North America, Australia, and Japan) completed the questionnaire pre- and on-treatment to assess the psychometric properties. The results demons trated good reliability of the multi-item dyspnea scale. Validity was evaluated with an analysis of variance by disease stage and by performance status ( Bergman, 1994 ). Overall, the EORTC QLQ-LC13 has undergone extensive testing and demonstrated good psychometric properties. A copy of the questionnaire is presented inAppendix C .

In this case Cycle 3 Day 1 may be delayed up to 7 days. If a subject is unable to start Cycle 3 dosing within 7 days, then Cycle 3 will be considered “missed”, and dosing will resume at the scheduled Cycle 4 Day 1. As monotherapy, tislelizumab or placebo will be administered for a duration of 12 months from the first dose of tislelizumab or placebo after completion of the cCRT period, or until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or treatment discontinuation for another reason. The total duration of tislelizumab (Arm 1), placebo and tis lelizumab (Arm 2), and placebo (Arm 3) will be approximately 14 months, including the cCRT period.

Tislelizumab or Placebo Tislelizumab or placebo will be administered on Day 1 .Tislelizumab or placebo will be administered, before chemotherapy, by IV infusion through an IV line containing a sterile, nonpyrogenic, low-protein-binding 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line or add- on filter. Specific instructions for product preparation and administration are provided in the Pharmacy Manual. As a routine precaution, after infusion of tislelizu mab or placebo on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, subjects must be monitored f or at least 1 hour (before chemother apy administration) in an area with resuscitation equipment and emergency agents. From Cycle 3 onward, at least a 30-minute monitoring period is required in an area with resuscitation equipment and emergency agents. The initial i nfusion (C1D1) will be d elivered over 60 minutes; if this is well tolerated, then the subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes, which is the shortest time period permissible for infusion. Tislelizumab or placebo must not be concurrently administered with any other drug (refer to Table 5 ).

Chemotherapy Chemotherapy regimens are administered after administration of tislelizumab or placebo. . In addition, all sub jects should receive the appropriate premedications as per the local approved label. Additional premedications should be administered as per standard practice. Due to their immunomodulatory effects, premedication with steroids should be limited when clinically feasible. In addition, in the event of chemotherapeutic agent-related skin rash, topical steroid use is recommended as front-line treatment whenever is clinically feasible. Needles or intravenous administration sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with carboplatin injection should not be used for the preparation and administration of the drug. Aluminum can react with carboplatin causing precipitate formation and loss of potency. Dosing of carboplatin will be based on the Calvert formula: carboplatin dose (mg) = (Target AUC) x (GFR + 25). For the purposes of this protocol, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is considered to be equivalent to the creatinine clearance (calculated by the method of Cockcroft, 1976 ); see Appendix G . Carboplatin dose should be calculated prior to each dose using actual weight if the subject’s body weight changes by more than 10% from baseline (or the newly referred body weight) and current serum creatinine level accordi ng to local prescribing information and local practice. Each drug in the regimen should be administered sequentially. Details of tislelizumab or placebo and chemotherapy dose administration, including order of dosing and times between doses, are summarized in Table 5 .

Management of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption and/or dose reduction of each therapy. 7.2.2. Radiation Therapy The chemotherapy should generally be delivered prior to the radiation therapy on the day of treatment. Chemotherapy doses that are missed during a weekly schedule concurrent with RT are not to be made up, but these should be documented. Every effort should be made to continue the RT during the concurrent phase in an uninterrup ted manner. Should a subject develop severe esophagitis necessitating interruption of chemoth erapy, the RT may continue, provided the Investigator believes supportive care will enable the subject to complete this part of the therapy without excess risk. Prior to inclusion of any subject on this study, the radiation oncol ogist will evaluate the thoracic CT scan or MRI to ensure that the treatment volumes are unlikely to significantly exceed the specified normal tissue constraints. A subject will be excluded if the subject’s radiation treatment plans are likely to encompass a volume of whole lung receiving ≥ 20 Gy in total (V20) of more than 38% of lung volume. All patients will receive RT using either a standardized 3-dimentional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) technique, or an intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on a linear accelerator delivering a beam energy of ≥ 6 MV. The total dose of RT will be 60 Gy in 30 once-daily fractions of 2 Gy ( Bradley, 2015 ), prescribed at the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) 50 reference point, and given according to the recommendations for radiotherapy delivery of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-Radiotherapy Group ( De Ruysscher, 2017 ) and the International Commission on Radiation Units & Measurements Report 50 ( ICRU Report 50, 1993 ). Weekly clinical assessments are required during the cCRT treatment. While 60 Gy in 30 fractions is the target dose of radiation, concern about patient tolerance discovered during treatment planning or delivery, for example, a V20 exceeding that recommended in the protocol, may dictate that a lower dose be administered. Definitive radiation therapy will be considered as receiving a minimum of 56 Gy to the PTV . 7.2.2.1. Radiation Dose Specifications Subjects will r eceive treatment 5 days per week, in once daily fractions, 2 Gy per fraction, to a target dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. Normalization of the treatment plan will cover 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) with the prescri ption dose. The minimum PTV dose should ideally not fall below 93% of the prescription dose. Al l radiation doses will be calculated with inhomogeneity corrections that take into account the density differences within the irradiated volume (that is, air in the lung and bone). The maximum and minimum point doses (within the PTV) will be reported. No field reductions will be permi tted and the entire PTV must be treated daily. Radiation therapy commences on Day 1 of chemotherapy, with a ± 3 days administrative window allowed. When both chemotherapy and RT are administered at the same center/location, it is recommended that RT s hould follow within 30 to 60 minutes of the completion of chemotherapy or post-cisplatin hydration. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21e e evere ver he e e therapy therapy uate the thouate the antly exceeantly exc ect’s ct’s radiradiatti Gyyiiyyn totaln total (l ttioional connal con (IMRT) on(IMRT) o T will be 6T will be 6 ernational Cernational given accorgiven acco oon n fofor ResrR e s r, 2017r, 2017 ) and) an 0((ICRU RICRU R ed during thd during on, concernn, conce or example,or example be administbe admini GyGyto the Pto the Dose Dose Specp ve treatmve treatm 60 Gy0 Gy iiyyn 30n rget volget vol umeumell eloww93% 93% oogeneigen tytyic uume (that ime (that i PTVPTV )wilwilllbb daildaily.yR nd"

On days where RT and/or chemotherapy are delayed for administrative reasons within the allowed protocol window of 3 days, this will not be considered a protocol violation, provided the full planned dose of RT is administered . 7.2.2.2. Variations of Dose Prescription The variations in dose prescription are described here, and summarized in Table 7 below. No deviation : ≥99% of the PTV receives at least 93% of the prescribed dose, and no volume >1 c m 3within the PTV receives > 110% of the prescribed dose, and no more than a contiguous volume of 1 cm3outside the PTV receives a maximum of 110% of the prescribed dose, and the volume of both lungs (%) receiving a dose of 5Gy or higher (V5) is ≤65%.

Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization Each subject will be positioned in an institutional specific immobilization device in the treatment position on a flat table. All planning CT scan s should be performed in the treatment position using the same immobilization device for setup as is used at the linear accelerator. Optimal immob ilization is crit ical for this protocol in order to ensure re producibility of the daily setup. Either a conventional (non-4D CT ) treatment planning CT study or a 4-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) will be performed. Conventional CT scans will be performed during quiet, uncoached respiration while the subject undertakes a normal respiration, using at least 5-mm slices through the entire target volume. The w hole thorax (cricoid to L2) should be covered using < 1 cm slices in order to generate dose-vol ume histograms to be calculated of the lungs, spinal cord, heart, and esophagus. A treatment planning FDG-PET/CT scan (or FDG-PET alone) with the subject in the treatment position can be used for treatment planning. Where a PET/CT is obtained in the treatment position, the CT from this study may be used as the planning CT scan. The gross tumor volume (GTV), Internal Target Volume (ITV) and PTV will be defined on all appropriate slices (see defi nitions in Section 7.2.2.4 ). Intravenous contrast during the planning CT is optional, provided that a recent diagnostic chest CT was done with contrast to delineate the major blood vessels. If not, intravenous contrast can be administered during the planning CT, if this is considered necessary in the view of the radiation oncologist. If contrast is used, the densities can be overridden or the contrast scan could be registered to a noncontrast scan for planning purposes. Acceptable methods of accounting for tumor motion include design of the PTV to cover the excursion of the lung primary cancer and nodes during breathing such as an ITV approach, breath-holds (eg, Eleckta ABC device) , or respiratory gating (for example, Varian RPM system). 7.2.2.4. Radiation Treatment Planning Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT) The PTV is to be treated with any combination of coplanar or noncoplanar 3D conformal fields shaped to deliver the specified dose while restricting the dose to the normal tissues. The treatment plan used for each subject w ill be based on an analysis of the volu metric dose, including dose-volume histogram analyses of the PTV and critical normal structures. Each field is to be treated daily. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy The use of intensity modulated radiation th erapy (IMRT) is permitted, provided that the institution has been using this technique for treating lung cancer for at least 6 months prior to study activations. As IMRT results in a greater proportion of out of target lung receiving radiation outside the PTV, it is recommended to maintain the total lung V5 level at 65% or less. 7.2.2.5.

On the first day of therapy, and periodically thereafter in accordance with standard department protocols, one of the following verification procedures will be performed: a cone-beam CT scan, portal image of each field of 3DCRT or orthogonal images that localize the isocenter placement. These images should be compared to localization films and discrepancies corrected. These images will not be submitted for central review. Dose volume histograms will be generated for PTV, both lungs, lungs minus PTV, spinal cord, esophagus, and heart. The following dose values should be recorded: !Prescription point dose !Minimum, maximum, and mean dose in PTV !Maximum dose to spinal cord !V20 and V5 7.2.2.6. Organs at Risk Contouring of normal tissues and organs for radiotherapy planning will be in accordance with published guidelines ( Kong, 2011 ). Normal tissue constraints shall be priorit ized in the following order for treatment planning: 1 = spinal cord, 2 = lungs, 3 = heart, 4 = esophagus, and 5 = brachial plexus Spinal cord: The spinal canal will be contoured and taken to represent the spinal cord. The maximum cord dose will be limited to 46 Gy, but subjects who receive up to 48 Gy in order to ensure adequate tumor dose will be considered to have as a minor deviation. Subjects who receive more than 48 Gy to the cord will be counted as a major deviation. Lungs: The dose-volume constraint to the lungs is the second highest priority and must be met, except if it conflicts with spinal cord dose constraints. The volume of both lungs (total lung volume minus PTV) that receive more than 20 Gy (V20) should not exceed 35%. All V20s up to 38% will be permitted and viewed as a minor deviation, provided the treating radiation oncologist believes this level of e xposure is within subject tolerance. Heart: The heart will be contoured on all slices and detailed guidance for contouring is Feng, 2011 . The cranial border will include the infundibulum of the right ventricle and the apex of both atria, and exclude the great vessels as much as possible. The caudal border is defined as the lowest part of the left ventricle that is distinguishable from the liver. The recommended dose limits are 60 Gy < 1/3; 45 Gy < 2/3; and 40 Gy < 100% of the heart. Esophagus: Esophagitis is an expected side effect of concurrent therapy and has a relationship to higher doses of radiation encompassing the entire esophageal circumference. The outer wall of the esophagus will be contoured completely throughout the length of esophagus that is encompassed by a dose of radiation ≥46 Gy. Brachial Plexus: For tumors in close proximity to th e brachial plexus, the plexus should be contoured to ensure that the maximal point dose to this structure is kept under 64 Gy.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21d, ing will be ng will be s shall be prs shall be nd 5 = bracnd 5 = brac and taken toand taken but ut subjectssubject red to havered to have be countedbe counted to the lungto the lu ord dose coord dose c ve more thae more tha viewed as iewed as levellev ofoflexeff will be contl be cont al border wl border w d exclude thexclude t of the left of the left re 60 Gyre 60 Gy < <yy phagus:phagus: EE highigher doseer dose thhe esophe esoph com"

Note, radiation toxicities can arise more than 90 days after the completion of radiation therapy. 7.2.2.7. Quality Assurance and Compliance with Protocol-defined Radiation Prescription (Quality Control) A formal radiotherapy quality assurance (QA) program will be a mandatory component of this study. Eligible radiotherapy facilities will complete a facility questionnaire in order to ensure that they are equipped to deliver radiation to the required quality. Prior to randomization of the first subject, sites w ill need to have undergone a “benchmarking” process where a 3-dimensional CT scan of an anonymized clinical case with stage III NSCLC will be electron ically transmitted to participating sites by the QA program, and the local radiation oncologists from the sites will be required to contour target volumes and organs-at- risk volumes, in acc ordance with the quality assurance criteria specified for thoracic radiation therapy as defined in the approved RT QA program. This process will serve to ensure protocol-compliant contouring and radiotherapy planning. The radiotherapy plans will be reviewed by physicists and a radiation oncologist at the QA program, who will provide appropriate feedback to sites participating in this benchmarking. Early-treatment Subject Dosimetry Review: An early-treatment sub ject dosimetry review of the treatment plan will be conducted for at least one case per center. The treatment plan feedback should be provided to the center by the time 5 fractions (10 Gy) have been delivered to the first study subject. The objective of the review is to gain additional assurance that subjects treated at the site will conform to the protocol radiation requirements. Additional QA dosimetry reviews may be done subsequently in a sample of cases during the course of the study. Subjects may have their radiation field altered based on information obtained from these QA reviews. This should be sufficient to ensure adherence to the radiation prescription defined in the protocol. Post-treatment Subject Dosimetry Review: All subjects treated by radiation in the study will have a retrospective radiation dosimetry review by the QA program, either during the course of the study or at the completion of the study, to correlate the degree of local cont rol and toxicity with adherence to the protocol radiation prescription. This will be a confirmation of the treatment delivered, and an overall assessment of compliance with protocol stipulations regarding radiation treatment. 7.2.2.8. Radiation Adverse Events and Interruption Investigators will be advised to suspend the use of chemotherapy given with radiation if they believe that continuing chemotherapy administration will compromise delivery of full-dose radiation in an uninterrupted manner. Reversible or permanent alopecia, bone marrow toxicity, esophagitis and skin pigmentation are expected side effects of radiation therapy. Radi ation-induced myocarditi s and spinal cord injury rarely occur at doses lower than 50 Gy. Radi ographic evidence of radiation-induced changes and subsequent fibrosis of the lung may occur within lung volumes receiving ≥20 Gy. It is essential to spare as much normal lung as possible in order to avoid symptomatic lung injury. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21t t st al CT CT tted to ed to tes will be es will be h the the qualitquali oved RT Qoved RT nd radiothend radioth diiatatioion oncn ing ing in this in this plplan will ban will proviprovi ded tded subjectubject .

Total number of fractions and elapsed days s hould be carefully reported. !During cCRT, esophagitis is managed according to Table 13 and Table 17 for the cisplatin/et oposide and carboplatin /paclitaxel regimens, respectively, and Table 9 and Table 10 in regard to RT. During this cCRT period, in case of Grade 3 esophagitis related to chemotherapies or tislelizumab or placebo, chemotherapies or tislelizumab or placebo should be held if the Investig ator believes continued use will jeopardize the delivery of full-dose RT, and radiation is to be continued. Retreatment with chemotherapies and/or tislelizumab or placebo is permitted if there is resolution of the esophagitis to ≤ Grade 2. If Grade 4 esophagitis related to RT, chemotherapies or tislelizumab or placebo occurs, RT, chemotherapies, and/or tislelizumab or placebo should be held until resolution of the esophagitis to ≤ Grade 2. !During cCRT, in case of Grade 3 or Grade 4 radiation pneumonitis/lung infiltrates related to RT, the recommendation is to hold RT, chemotherapies and tislelizumab or placebo. Retreatment with RT, chemothe rapies and tislelizumab or placebo is acceptable if symptoms resolve to ≤ Grade 1 or are controlled on prednisolone ≤10 mg/day (or equivalent corticosteroids). Discontinue study treatment if symptoms persist with corticosteroid treatment. Radiation toxicities will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE v5.0 criteria and reported per Section 10.1. Note, radiation toxicities can arise more than 90 days after the completion of radiation therapy. Esophagitis The first symptoms of acute esophagitis usually start in the second or third week of RT, commonly at the dose of 18.0 to 21.0 Gy of standard fractionated RT ( Wei, 2006 ), and include a sensation of difficult swallowing (dysphagia). This may progress to painful swallowing of food and saliva (odynophagia) and later to constant pain not necessarily related to swallowing. In severe cases, subjects may not be able to sw allow at all and may require intravenous hydration, feeding through a gastric tube and, in rare cases, parenteral nutrition. Symptomatic esophagitis is common with combined modality therapy ( Werner-Wasik, 2005 ) and it does not constitute a reason to interrupt or delay radiotherapy or chemotherapy, provided oral intake is sufficient to maintain hydration. Symptoms of acute esophagitis may persist for 1 to 3 weeks after completion of RT. If CTCAE Grade 4 esophagitis occurs and treatment is interrupted, every effort should be made to limit the interruption to 3 treatment days or less. Subjects requiring hospitalization, placement of a feeding tube in the stomach, or intravenous feedings because of esophagitis may have their treatment interrupted in order to allow for healing of the esophageal mucosa. Table 13 andTable 17 summarize the dose modifications of the chemotherapy regimens in cases of esophagitis Grade 3 or 4.

The details in this section are for reference: !Baseline body weight is used to calculate the required chemotherapy doses. Dose modifications are required if the subject’s body weight changes by more than 10% from baseline (or the newly referred body we ight). Chemotherapy doses should not be modified for any body weight change of less than 10%, unless there is an ongoing toxicity requiring dose modification. When se veral toxicities with different grades of severity occur at the same time, the dose modifications should be according to the highest grade observed. !If any component of chemotherapy is temporarily interrupted, both chemotherapeutic agents will be delayed until doublet chemotherapy can be given as planned. !In case of chemotherapy related toxicity, chemotherapy will be delayed until it has resolved to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 prior to administering the next dose of chemotherapy, with the exception of toxicities of alopecia, Grade 2 fatigue, or other AEs which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would not affect the safety evaluation of tislelizumab or placebo, in which case chemotherapy should con tinue as scheduled. Chemotherapy treatment may be delayed from a planned administration date up to 2 weeks for either chemotherapy regimen. !In case of tislelizumab or placebo related toxicity, tislelizumab or placebo will be delayed until it has resolved to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 prior to administering the next dose of tislelizumab or placebo, with the exception of alopecia, Grade 2 fatigue, or other AEs which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would not affect the safety evaluation of the study drugs. Chemotherapy s hould continue as scheduled. If the AE is resolved within 10 days, tislelizumab or placebo will be administered on the first available day. If the AE is not resolved within 10 days, tislelizumab or placebo will be omitted. If the AE is resolved within 21 days, tislelizumab or placebo and chemotherapy will be administered on Day 1 of the next planned cycle. !The tumor assessment schedule will not be altered if chemotherapy and/or tislelizumab or placebo are delayed or discontinued. !Every effort should be made to continue treatments in combination when the subject’s condition allows, also taking into consid eration the subject’s convenience for the treatment schedule. !Following either completion of or discontinuation from chemotherapy, tislelizumab or placebo should be continued as scheduled, if clinically appropriate. !If one component of chemotherapy is discontinued permanently during a cycle of treatment for reasons other than PD, the other component of chemotherapy could be continued per the study protocol or local practice. !If tislelizumab or placebo is discontinued permanently during a cy cle of chemotherapy concurrent with RT, the subject may continue the cCRT per the study protocol or local pract ice. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21of f he e otherapeutotherapeut ii nned.ned. layed untlayed un ilil xt dose of dose of Grade 2 fatGrade 2 fa i affect the sffect the s yshoulshoul d cd c anned admianned a xicitxicity,y, ti tislelsle r r ≤ Grade 1≤ Grad he excepthe except io he he IInvestnvest igi hemotheraphemotherap lelizumab olelizumab not resolveot resolve resoeslveved wd w e administee administe sment schement sch or plor acebo aceb ortrtshoulshoul d d on allows,on allows, tmtment scheent sch FoFollolowingwing or plor placeac !!If oIf o"

Dose Modification for Tislelizumab or Placebo There will be no dose reduction for tislelizumab or placebo in this study. Dose delays or interruptions of tislelizumab or placebo of less than 12 weeks will be permitted. Investigators should make every effort to maintain dose intensity in subjects. Subjects may temporarily suspend study drug (tislelizumab or placebo) if they experience toxicity that is considered related to tislelizumab or placebo and requires a dose to be withheld. If a dose of tislelizumab or placebo is delayed for ≤ 10 days for a planned dosing cycle (eg, Cycle 3 Day 1), tislelizumab or placebo should be administered and all assessments should be conducted on the first available day according to the original cycle (ie, Cycle 3). If the delay is more than 10 days, the subject should skip the tislelizumab or placebo dose, and tislelizumab or placebo will be administered on Day 1 of the next planned cy cle (ie, Cycle 4 Day 1, 42 days after the last dose given on Cycle 2 Day 1). The subjects should resume tislelizumab or placebo treatment as soon as possible after the AEs recover to baseline or Grade 1 (whichever is more severe) within 12 weeks after last dose of tislelizumab or placebo. If the subject is unable to resume tislelizumab or placebo within 12 weeks after the last dose of tislelizumab or placebo, then the subject should be discontinued from study treatment, un less approval to continue treatment is obtained from the Sponsor med ical monitor. If a scheduled dose coincides with a holiday that precludes dosing, dosing should commence on the nearest following date ( ≤ 3 days after scheduled dosing) and subsequent dosing can continue on a new 21-day schedule based on the infusion date. Subjects who discontinue treatment due to tislelizumab (or placebo) and/or chemotherapy toxicity in the absence of disease progressi on should continue with tumor assessments until disease progression. Guidelines for dose modification, treatment interruption, or discontinuation, and for the management of irAEs and infusion-related r eactions, are provided in detail in Section 7.2.5.2 , Section 8.3, and Appendix H . 7.2.5.3. Dose Modifications of Chemotherapy Toxicities related to chemotherapy must be resolved to baseline or ≤Grade 1 prior to administering the next dose of chemotherapy, with the exception of alopecia, Grade 2 fatigue, or other AEs which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would not affect the safety evaluation of the study drugs. A maximum of 2 dose reductions are permitted for cisplatin and etoposide. If additional reductions are required, that chemothe rapeutic agent must be discontinued. Dose reductions of one chemotherapeutic agent do not require the same dose reductions of the other chemotherapeutic agent within the combination, unless the toxicities can reasonably be attributed to both agents. Once the dose has been decreased, it should remain reduced for all subsequent administrations, or further reduced if necessary. There will be no dose escalations in this study.

Nonhematologic Toxicity In general, for nonhematologic toxicities greater than or equal to Grade 3, treatment should be delayed until resolution to less than or equal to the subject’s baseline value before resuming treatment at a reduced dose. However, exceptions may be made for Grade 3 neurotoxicity or esophagitis. In the case of neurotoxicity, the Investigator and subject may decide to continue treatment at a reduced dose, with no delay require d, as neurotoxicity may not resolve to baseline values.

Clinically Significant Effusions If a subject develops clinically signi ficant pleural or peritoneal effusions (on the basis of symptoms or clinical examination) and the Investigator determines that the effusion represents disease progression, it is recommended that the e ffusion be drained for cytologic evaluation for disease progression if clinically feasible. If the effusion represents disease progression, the subject should be discontinued from study treatment and tumor assessment by imaging must be performed prior to initiation of s ubsequent anti-cancer therapy. This imaging needs to be submitted for central review as for any other imaging for tumor assessment. 7.2.8. Creatinine Clearance Enrollment and dosing decisions should be based on calculated CrCl using the standard Cockcroft and Gault formula ( Cockcroft, 1976 ; see Appendix G ). Local laboratory values used for serum creatinine may be used to calculate CrCl for enrollment or dosing decisions; however, if local laboratories are used to calculate CrCl, the same local laboratory must be used throughout the study. In addition, a separate serum specimen must be collected before the initiation of treatment and whenever subsequent samples are collected for dosing decisions. These additional samples will be sent to a central laboratory and used for subsequent safety analyses. For subjects receiving cisplatin/etoposide, the CrCl should be ≥60 mL/min prior to the start of any cycle; if a subject’s CrCl has not returned to ≥60 mL/min within 42 days after the last study therapy administration, the s ubject must be discontinued from the study treatment unless continuation is approved by the Sponsor. For s ubjects receiving carboplatin/paclitaxel, the CrCl should be ≥ 45 mL/min prior to the start of any cycle; if a subject’s CrCl has not returned to ≥ 45 mL/min within 42 days after the last study therapy administration, the subject must be discontinued from the study treatment unless continuation is approved by the Sponsor. 7.2.9. Blinding This is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 study. Subjects will be randomized to receive tislelizumab or placebo in a double-blind fashion. At the start of the study, placebo may not be available for distribution. Until placebo becomes available, sites that randomize subjects will be required to have an unblinded pharmacist (or designated site personnel) prepare a placebo IV bag for subjects randomized to placebo identical in appearance to those provided to the infusion team for subjects randomized to tislelizumab. Once placebo becomes available, sites will use the Sponsor supplied placebo. All subjects, study site staff and Sponsor representatives, with the exception of designated individuals, will remain blinded to the subject’s randomized treatment arm. For sites that receive tislelizumab and placebo ex clusively from the Sponsor (meaning, the site does not use institution-supplied placebo at any point in the trial), the subject, all study site staff and Sponsor representatives, with the exception of designated unblinded individuals, will be blinded to the subject’s randomized treatment arm. !Emergency unblinding Emergency unblinding for AEs may be performed through the study IRT.rd rd Cllffllor enroor enroff l, the samel, the same rum specimm spe samples areamples are l laboratorylaborator be e ≥60≥60mLmL L/min wit/min wi h ed froed fro m mthth ects receivincts receivi cyclecycle ; ;iif a sf a erapyerapy admiadmyy ess contss cont inuinu nd, Phase 3nd, Phase oublouble-e-blindblin plpacebo ebo ma ndomize sudomize su onnel) prepnnel) prep those provthose prov becoecomemes as nd d SponsorSponsor to the subjto the subj sisites that rtes that riii oes not useoes not us and ndSponSpon nded"

Number:Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) Protocol BGB-A317-NSCL-001 Celgene Corporation 97 BGB-A317-NSCL-001 Amendment 1 Final: 20 Sep 2018In case of an emergency, the Investigator or designated site personnel, as documented in the delegation of authority log, has the sole re sponsibility for determining if unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment is warranted. Subject safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the Investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the Investigator should make every effort to contact the Sponsor medical monitor prior to unblinding a subject’s treatm ent assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the subject. If a subject’s tr eatment assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be notified immediately. !Inadvertent unblinding Every effort will be made to blind both the s ubject and the Investigator to the identity of tislelizumab or placebo, but the inadvertent unblinding of a subject may occur. If an Investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject is unblinded, the unblinding will not be sufficient cause (in and of itself) for that subject to be discontinued from study therapy or excluded from any safety or efficacy analyses. Additionally, there may be ethical reasons to have the subject remain on tislelizumab or placebo. For subjects to continue on tislelizumab or placebo in the event of unblinding, the Investigator must obtain specific approval from the Sponsor’s medical monitor. 7.3. Method of Treatment Assignment Subjects who enter screening will be assigned the next available subject number. All eligible subjects will be randomized by IRT via 1:1:1 ratio to either one of the following treatment groups: The permuted block randomization method will be used to generate the randomization codes and the randomization will be performed by IRT to ensure a 1:1:1 treatment assignment ratio. The randomization schedule w ill be generated by the Sponsor or its designee. The randomization will be stratified by age ), chemotherapy regimen ( ), and region ( ). If one of the tislelizumab arms (Arm 1 or Arm 2) is discontinued at study interim due to safety findings, and the Sponsor decides to continue the study with the remaining tislelizumab arm and the control arm (Arm 3), the newly recruited subjects w ill be randomized to the remaining 2 arms using a 1:1 randomization ratio, until the originally planned sample size of 560 in the remaining 2 arms is reached.

Additional information may be included on the label as applicable per local regulations. 7.5. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal Celgene (or designee) will review with the Investigator and relevant site personnel the process for investigational product receipt, return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus Celgene (or designee). Accountability for study drug that is administr ated during the course of the study is the responsibility of the Investigator or designee. Investigational clinical supplies must be received by a designated person at the clinical site and ke pt in a secure a nd temperature-controlled location. The investigational site must maintain accurate records demonstrating dates andamounts of study drug received, to whom it wa s administered (subject-by-subject accounting), and accounts of any tislelizumab or placebo accidentally or deliberately destroyed or returned. Accurate recording of all IP administration will be made in the appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF and source documents. Unless otherwise notified, all vials of study drug, both used and unused, must be saved for drug accountability. The investigational product should be disposed of in accordance with the institutional/regional requirements after drug accountability has been completed by the monitor. The Inves tigator must return all unused vials of study drug to the Sponsor at the end of the study, or the study drug may be destroyed at the clinical site with the permission of the Sponsor. For either scenario, the outcome must be documented on the drug accountability log. The Sponsor will provide directi on for the outcome of all unused vials. 7.6.

CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND PROCEDURES Over the course of this study, additional medications may be required to manage aspects of the disease state of the subjects, including side effects from study treatments or disease progression. Supportive care, including but not limited to antiemetic medications, may be administered at the discretion of the Investigator. For information regarding other drugs that may interact with IP and affect its metabolism, pharmacokinetics, or excretion, please see the Investigator’s Brochure and/or local package insert. 8.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures Most concomitant medications and therapies deemed necessary for supportive care (eg, antiemetics, antidiarrheal) and in a subject’s interest are allowed. All treatments that the Investigator considers necessary for a subject’s health and safety purpose may be administered at the discretion of the Investigator in keeping with the local standards of medical care. All concomitant medication including all prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids will be recorded on the eCRF. If changes (dose, stop, or start) in concomitant medication occur during the study, doc umentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, date, and reason for use will be recorded on the eCRF. All concomitant medications received within 28 days before randomization and 30 days after the last infusion or dose of study treatment should be recorded. Systemic corticosteroids required for the control of irAEs must be tapered over at least 1 month and be at nonimmunosuppressive doses ( ≤10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) before the next tislelizumab or placebo administration. The short-term use of steroids as prophylactic treatments (eg, sub jects with cont rast allergies to diagnostic imaging contrast dyes) is also permitted. Subject may continue to receive hormone replacement therapy or supportive care if initiated prior to enrollment. Premedications and postmedications per the chemoth erapy labels and per local guidelines are permitted. The use of bisphosphonates during the trial for a nonmalignant indication is permitted. Hematopoietic growth f actors such as growth-colony stimu lating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may be used according to institutional or other specific guidelines (eg, country, regiona l, or oncology organizations, such as Amer ican Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCO], etc.) to treat febrile neutropenia and Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, but should not be used as primary or secondary prophylaxis. The use of any growth factor support must be documented in the subject’s record and eCRF. Growth factors must be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to initiation of the next cycle of study drug. According to the NCCN 2018 guidelines ( NCCN, 2018 ), erythropoiesis-stimu lating agents (ESAs) may be considered for the treatmen t of cancer-related anemia in subjects undergoing &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ge e ve care (egve care (e tments thatments ose mose m ayay bebyy s of medicas of medi nterr,,herbalba ges (dose, sges (dose atiion ofon of drudrff ys before ys before rar e recorded.recorded. troltrol of i of illrArAiii ≤≤10 m10 m g/dag/dam ation.

Erythropoietic therapy may be considered for treatment of study drug- induced anemia in cases where hemoglobin is < 11 g/dL or a decrease of ≥2 g/dL from baseline, but only after the subject has been counseled about the risks and benefits of ESA use. 8.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures The following medications are prohibited or restricted at screening and during the study: !Immunosuppressive agents (except to treat a drug-related AE). !Systemic corticosteroids > 10 mg daily (prednisone or equivalent) within 14 days before rando mization and during the study, except to treat or control a drug-related AE or for short-term use as prophylact ic treatment (eg, antiemetic therapy for specific chemotherapy). !Any concurrent antineoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, or standard or inve stigational agents [including Chinese herbal medicine and Chinese patent medicines] for the treatment of cancer). !Extensive radiation therapy during monot herapy (except for local, palliative radiotherapy provided that it does not compromise tumor assessments of target lesions). !Live vaccines within 28 days before randomization and 60 days following the last dose of study drugs. (NOTE: seasonal vaccines for influenza are generally inactivated vaccines and are allowed. Intranasal vaccines are live vaccines and are not allowed.) !During cisplatin and carboplatin use, concurrent therapy with drugs having a potential ototoxic or nephrotoxic effect (eg, aminoglycosides, cefalotine, furosemide, amphotericin B) should be avoided or ade quately monitored since this may lead to increased or exacerbated toxicity due to platin-induced changes in renal clearance of these substances. !The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cytochrom e P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Therefore, in the absence of a PK drug-drug interaction study, caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (eg ketoconazole and other imidazole antifungals, erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, clopi dogrel, cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) because toxicity of paclitaxel may be increased due to higher paclitaxel exposure. Administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (eg, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine) is not recommended because efficacy may be compromised because of lower paclitaxel exposures. !Refer to the approved product labeling for complete information regarding drug-drug interactions. !The following are also excluded during the study: ∀Herbal remedies with immunostimulating properties (ie, mistletoe extract) or known to potentially interfere with major organ function (ie, hypericin) &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21lated ated for specificor specifi herapyherapy , horh ncluding Chncluding C ent of cancnt of c for local, paor local, p oor assessmr assessm ioonnand 60and 6 nes for influnes for inf nes arnes ar e live concurrentoncurrent aminoglycaminoglyc ded or ed or adeqade citcity due toy due aclitaxel is aclitaxel is P3A4.

The following guideline should be also followed during the study: !With the exception of diagnostic biopsy of tumor tissue or placement of a venous access device, the Investigator should discuss with the medical monitor any individual subject requiring surgery during the study. !Eligible subjects for this study must have locally advanced, stage III NSCLC that is considered to be unresectable. Any sub ject for whom the institutional practice would consider surgery to be a treatment option if disease downstaging is observed after completion of the chemoradiotherapy should have been considered ineligible for participation in the study. Thus, surgical resection of NSCLC due to subsequent downstaging of the stage III NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy prior to progression is prohibited during the course of the study. 8.3. Required Concomitant Medications and Procedures 8.3.1. Management of Immune-related Adverse Events Immune-related AEs are of special interest in this study. If the events listed below or similar events occur, the Investigator should exclude alternative explanations (eg, combination drugs, infectious disease, metabolic, toxin, disease progression or other neoplastic causes) with appropriate diagnostic tests, which may include but are not limited to serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data. If alternative causes have been ruled out and the AE required the use of systemic steroids, other immunosuppressants, or endocrine therapy and is consistent with an immune mediated mechanism of action, the irAE indicator in the eCRF AE page should be checked. A list of potential irAEs is shown below in Table 18 . All conditions similar to those listed should be evaluated in subjects receiving tislelizumab or placebo to determine whether they are immune-related. Recommendations for diagnostic evaluation and management of irAEs (see Appendix H) are based on a recent ESMO guideline ( Haanen, 2017 ). For any adverse events not included in Appendix H , please refer to the recent ESMO guideline for further guidance on diagnostic evaluation and management of immune-related toxicities.

If a toxicity does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, tislelizumab or placebo should be discontinued after consultation with the Sponsor. Subjects who experience a recurrence of any event at the same or higher severity grade with rechallenge should permanently discontinue treatment. 8.3.2. Management of Infusion Reactions The symptoms of infusion-related reactions include fever, chills/rigor, nausea, pruritus, angioedema, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness, or hypertension. Severe reactions may include acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiogenic shock. Subjects should be closely monitored for such reactions. Immediate access to an intensive care unit or equivalent environment and appropriate medical therapy (including epinephrine, corticosteroids, IV antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen) must be available to treat infusion-related reactions.

Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and Flu-Like Symptoms If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the subject must be treated according to the best available medical practice as described in the complete guideline for emergency treatment of anaphylactic reactions according to the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council (UK) ( Soar, 2008 ). Subjects should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to the Investigator immediately. In the event of a systemic anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction (typically manifested within minutes following administration of the drug/antigen and characterized by: respiratory distress; laryngeal edema; and/or intense bronchospasm; and of ten followed by vascular collapse or shock without antecedent respiratory difficulty; cutaneous manifestations such as pruritus and urticaria with/without edema; and gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain, and diarrhea), the infusio n must be immediately stopped and the subject discontinued from the study. The subjects will be administered epinephrine injection and dexamethasone infusion if hypersensitivity reaction is observed and then the subject should be placed on monitor immediately and ICU should be alerted for possible transfer if needed. For prophylaxis of flu-like symptoms, a dose of 25 mg indomethacin or a comparable dose of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ie, 600 mg i buprofen, 500 mg naproxen sodium) may be administered 2 hours before and 8 hours after the start of each dose of study drugs(s) infusion. Alternative treatments for fever (ie, paracetamol) may be given to subjects at the discretion of the Investigator. 8.3.4. Treatment of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Patients with active hepatitis B defined as either detectable HBsAg or HBV DNA at baseline must initiate treatment 2 weeks prior to randomizatio n or first dose, and continue until 6 months after the last dose. Patients should continue effective antiviral treatment during the study to decrease potential viral re-activation risk. Peg-IFN, tenofovir, and entecavir are recommended in the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guideline because they lack resistance with long-term use ( Terrault, 2016 ). The Investigator might use other antiviral agents, if appropriate, following local guidelines. Management of antiviral therapy is at the discretion of the Investigator. Patients with active hepatitis C should undergo treatment with antiviral therapy following the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guideline or the local guidelines as appropriate. However, interferon-based therapy for either HBV or HCV is not permitted on study. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21c c ely.ely within within toryorydistresdistresyy collapse orcollapse ruritus andruritus an oomitmiting, cring, cr ed and the ed and the xamethasonamethason ould be placould be pla fer if needefer if neede g indog indo metmethh buprofen, 5buprofen, he start of ee start of mmolol) may b) may b BBand Hepand H defined as edefined as e ks priks pri or to ror to s should coshould co rere--activatvatio atatioion n fofor thr t e (e (TerraulTerraul ttlll llowing loclowing l ator.ator withhi activactivhh rican rican AAssosso ppropriate. ppropriate. &studytu."

Overview The study protocols BGB-A317-NSCL-001 and BGB-A317-NSCL-001C have a total combined enrollment target of 840 subjects. The data from both study protocols will be collected into one database and the statistical analyses as described in Section 9will be performed on the combined total of subjects randomized into either the main protocol or the companion protocol. A single IDMC and blinded independent central review will be utilized for these 2 study protocols. This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to compare efficacy and safety in either tislelizumab concurrent with chemoradiotherapy followed by tislelizumab monotherapy (Arm 1), or placebo concurrent with chemoradiotherapy followed by tislelizumab (Arm 2), versus placebo concurrent with chemoradiotherapy followed by placebo (Arm 3), in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. The primary treatment comparisons are the pairwise comparis ons of either one of the tislelizumab arms (Arm 1 or Arm 2) versus the control Arm (Arm 3). The sections below provide an overview of the proposed statist ical considerations and analyses. The final statistical analysis methods will be documented in detail in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 9.2. Study Population Definition 9.2.1. Intent-to-treat Population The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects regardless of whether the subjects receive any IP or have any efficacy assessment conducted. 9.2.2. Safety Population The safety population will include any subjects who receive at least one dose of tislelizumab or placebo. In safety analyses, subjects will be included in treatment groups according to the actual treatment they receive, if the treatment receiv ed is different from the randomized treatment group. 9.2.3. Per Protocol Population The per protocol population will include all subjects in the safety population who have met all the eligibility criteria and have no major protocol violation. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21will be will be will be will be protocolprotocol orl ew will be w will be udyud designedesigny oradiotherapradiotherap th chemorath chemor moradiothemoradiothe e none non --smalsma oof feieithhier oer he proposedhe proposed be documebe docume DefinitioDefiniti Populationopulatio ) po) populatpulat ioi any IP or hany IP or h ety Populatty Populat populpopul atatioionn In safetsafet y y a ment theyent they rereyy oup. up. 9.2.3..2.3.$0$750"

Power and Sample Size Consideration 9.3.1. Multiplicity Control Strategy There are 2 primary hypotheses in this study: !  : PFS in Arm 1 ≤ Arm 3 versus PFS in Arm 1 > Arm 3 ! : PFS in Arm 2 ≤ Arm 3 versus PFS in Arm 2 > Arm 3 There will be one interim and one final analysis for PFS, and one interim and one final analysis for OS, respectively. The interim OS analysis will occur at the same as the final PFS analysis. Therefore, there will be 3 data cutoff time points in this study: Although PFS is the primary endpoint of this study and the final PFS analysis will be completed at the second data cutoff time point, the study may continue to follow up for overall survival until a prespecified total number of OS events accumulates, if either of the PFS hypotheses are rejected at the interim or the final PFS analysis. A group sequential design is implemented based on Lan-Demets spending function that approximates the O’Brien-Fleming boundary for each of the primary hypotheses for the PFS endpoint. The hypotheses associated with the key secondary endpoint OS !   : OS in Arm 1 ≤ Arm 3 versus OS in Arm 1 > Arm 3 !  : OS in Arm 2 ≤ Arm 3 versus OS in Arm 2 > Arm 3 will be tested only if either one of the primary hypotheses for PFS is rejected at the interim or the final PFS analysis. In addition, the other 2 key secondary endpoints, OS at 24 months (OS 24) and ORR, will also be tested if both the PFS and OS hypotheses in the same pairwise comparison of treatment groups are rejected. The overall type one error rate control strategy he re follows the graphic approach as described by Maurer and Bretz ( Maurer, 2013 ), and can be depicted by the following graph. The local alpha will be dynamically determined by given spending function of the group sequential design for each endpoint ( Glimm, 2010 ; Maurer, 2013 ).CCI &(/*(1(35235,(7$tudy and thudy and th dydymmyyayay con cony vents accumvents accu analysis. analys emented baemented b ming bounding bound ssociated wsociated rrm m 1 ≤ ArmAr n ArArm m 2 2 ≤≤ nly if eithenly if eit nalysis.

The edges in between the 2 OS hypotheses will be removed, and the weight for edges from the OS endpoint to the OS 24 and ORR endpoint will be updated to 1/2, but other edges and the alpha allocation for each hypothesis in the remaining half graph will stay the sa me as in the initial graph. Additionally, to control the type one error due to multiple looks of OS data at the interim and the final OS analysis, a group sequential design based on an alpha spending function that approximates the O’Brien-Fleming boundary will also be implemented for either one of the OS hypotheses. The actual boundaries will depend on the number of OS events, or information time, at the time of second interim analysis. Similar alpha control approach will be implemented for the other key secondary endpoints OS 24 and ORR. Notably, if one or mo re hypotheses are rejected at the interim or final analysis, the superiority boundaries for the remaining unrejected hypotheses will be updated based on the alpha propagation strategy as described by Maurer and Bretz ( Mauer, 2013 ) using the graph above.

Power and Sample Size Assuming a constant enrollment rate of 30 subjects per month, and a median PFS of 9 months in the placebo arm, it will take approximately 28 months to enroll 840 subjects, and 35 months to accumulate a total of 580 PFS events. The time for the final OS analysis when approximately 572 total OS events accumulates is projected to be 61 months. The median PFS in the control arm (Arm 3) is based on data from historical trials with similar subjects. Ahn (2015) and Belderbos (2007) reported that the median PFS for inoperable (unresectable) stage III NSLC treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy are 8.1 months and 8.5 months, respectively. Factoring in potential improvements in best supportive care, a conservative estimate for median PFS of 9 months for the control arm is used for the sample size and power calculation. For the target PFS treatment effect, a hazard ratio of 0.7 is considered as a clinically meaningful improvement of PFS and is used for the sample size and power calculation. This target is considered reasonable based on the cross-trial evaluation of historical data for cCRT described above, including that from the recently published PA CIFIC study results. T0 is considered as PFS from cCRT treatment and T1 as PFS from anti-PD-L1 consolidation (durvalumab) treatment for subjects who have stable disease or better following cCRT. Heuristically, the cCRT + anti-PD-1 PFS is approximated as T = T0(T0 ≤2) + (2 + T1)(T0 > 2) for first line treatment. Fitting historical medians of T0 and T1 and conducting simulations, the median PFS is close to 14.6 months, which corresponds to an approximately 38% improvement consistent with the target hazard ratio of 0.7. A similar assessment was performed for overall survival. The median OS in the control arm is estimated at 22 months from Ahn (2015). The target hazard ratio of 0.7 is considered a clinically meaningful improvement.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary endpoint of progression free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the time of progression based on blinded independent reviewer assessment using RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever is earlier. Subjects without progression or death will be censored according to censoring rules similar to those described in the FDA Guidance for Industry Clinical Tr ial Endpoints for Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics ( FDA, 2007 ). The distribution of PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The comparison of PFS between treatment arms (Arm 1 versus Arm 3 or Arm 2 versus Ar m 3) will be conducted using a stratified log-rank test with age ), chemotherapy regimen ), and region ( as stratification factors. The hazard ratio (between Arm 1 or Arm 2 versus Arm 3) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will also be provided based on a stratified Cox proportional h azard model.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 9.6.2.1. Overall Survival The key secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects without doc umented death at the time of analysis will be censored at the last-known-to-be-alive date. The distribution of OS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier met hod. A stratified log-rank test will be used to compare treatment groups in OS. The median OS (with 95% confidence interval) and estimation of OS rate (with 95% confidence intervals) for different timepoints will be provided by treatment arm. The hazard ratio (between Arm 1 or Arm 2 versus Arm 3) and the corre sponding 95% confidence interval will also be provided base d on a stratified Cox regression model. 9.6.2.2. OS at 24 Months The key secondary endpoint OS at 24 months is defined as the proportion of subjects alive at 24 months (OS 24). The point estimate and the corresponding 95% confidence interval for each treatment arm will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier method. The treatment comparisons for OS 24 will be performed using an approach as described in Klein, 2007 . 9.6.2.3. Objective Response Rate The key secondary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieve a CR or PR based on the independent reviewer assessment using RECIST v1.1 criteria. The ORR for each treatment arm will be su mmar ized using 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval. The difference in ORR between treatment arms and the associated 95% Wilson score confidence interval will be provided.

Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomi tant impairment of the subject’s health, including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria in Section 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse ch ange in the frequency or intensity of a pre- existing condition) should be cons idered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose eCRF. (See Section 7.2.4 for the definition of overdose.) Any sequela of an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an AE on the AE eCRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE eCRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be identified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and eCRF but should not be reported as an SAE itself. In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for tislelizumab, cisplatin, carboplatin, etoposide, or paclitaxel overdos e. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician. All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring of any or all of the following parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical findings , physical examination findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures. All subjects will be monitored for adverse events starting from the time the subject signs the ICF until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (tislelizumab/placebo, chemotherapy, or RT), as well as those SAEs made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to study treatment. Subjects will also be moni tored for immune related adverse events (serious or nonserious) starting from the time the subject signs the ICF until 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab or placebo, regardless of whether or not the subject starts a new anticancer therapy. All AEs and SAEs considered related to RT will be collected at any time after the first dose of RT, including late radiation toxicities. Adverse events and SAEs will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF and in the subject’s source documents. All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 10.2.

Seriousness An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that: !Results in death; !Is life-threatening (ie, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is at immediate risk of death from the AE); !Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admi ssion, regardless of length of stay); !Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions); !Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; !Constitutes an important medical event. Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious. Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for: !a standard procedure for protocol therapy administration. However, hospitalization or prolonge d hospitalization for a complication of therapy adminis tration will be reported as an SAE. !routine treatment or monitoring of the st udied indication not associated with any deterioration in condition. !the administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied indication.

However, hospitalization or prolonge d hospitalization for a complication of such procedures remains a reportable SAE. !hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social reasons, in absence of an AE. !a procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be documented in the source document and the eCRF. Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE. !an elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre-existing condition, unrelated to the studied indication, that has not worsened from baseline. !emergency outpatient tr eatment or observation that does not result in admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21n of the n of the e immediate immediat opardipardi ze theze th outcomes litcomes li whehether surs r:: administratadministrat atatioion of theof th of the studof the stud od or plod or pl ateat hosphosp ititalizaliz remains a remains a r protocol/drotocol/d r laboratoryr laborator d hospitalizhospitali ospiospitalizatitalizatiiii reasons, ireasons, i !!apropro dodo"

Number:Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) Protocol BGB-A317-NSCL-001 Celgene Corporation 117 BGB-A317-NSCL-001 Amendment 1 Final: 20 Sep 2018If an AE is considered serious, both the AE pa ge/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form must be completed. For each SAE, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, relationship to the IP, action taken regarding the IP, and outcome. 10.2.2. Severity/Intensity For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity/ intensity of the event. The severity/intensity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the current active minor version of the Common Termin ology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0. AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severity/intensity according to the following scale: !Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention/therapy required !Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required !Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization is possible !Grade 4 = Life-threatening – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable !Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death The term “severe” is often used to describe th e intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations. 10.2.3. Causality The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of the IP and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below: Not suspected: a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP administration is unlikely or remote , or other medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying c onditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21o the o the TCAE, TCAE, according toccording to ctctivitivity; y; nono vitity,y, som som ee equireduired somsome assiste assi izatioizatio n nis pis p ation in actation in ac n/therapyn/therapy ryy lts in deathlts in death ibe the inteibe the in event itselevent its ache).

Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available information. Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available. If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP that has not been manufactured or provided by Celgene, please provide the name of the manufacturer when reporting the event. 10.2.4. Duration For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the event. 10.2.5. Action Taken The Investigator will report the action taken with IP because of an AE or SAE, as applicable (eg, discontinuation, interruption, or dose reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or additional treatments were given for the event. 10.2.6. Outcome The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to the SAE). 10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality: !results in discontinuation from the study; !requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic intervention; or !is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing condition. Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion need to be documented as a serious adverse event. If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/s creen of the eCRF. If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an abnormal laboratory result (eg, record throm bocytopenia rather than decreased platelets). &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21dates of thdates of th or SAE, asor SAE, a e) and repoe) and rep or both AEor both AE oon of the sn of the s aseline), recaseline), r ValuesValues nsidered tosidered t uatatioion n fromfrom ent, mnt, m odifiodifi ; or; or d to be of sd to be of s ess and/or oess and/or ndidititiiiion.on. ss of severiof sever o be documo be docum a laboratora laborator or syndromor syndrom part opart o"

Pregnancy All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject of childbearing potential or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable events . Study participants receiving chemotherapy have a potential risk of irreversible infertility. Patients should be advised to speak to their physician for further information about their locally available options for fert ility preservation. 10.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential: Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated β-hCG or positive pregnancy test in a female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is on IP, or within 120 days after the subject’s last dose of tislelizumab or placebo and 180 days after the subject’s last dose of chemotherapy, are considered immediately reportable events. Investigational product is to be discontinue d immedi ately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by email, phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pr egnancy Initial Report Form, or approved equivalent form. The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form, or approved equivalent form. If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant d eath after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 10.4.2. Male Subjects If a female partner of a male subject taking IP becomes pregnant, the male subject taking IP should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider immediately. 10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF. All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method (eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.

This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study (from the time the subject signs in formed consent until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment; until 90 days after the last dose of tislelizumab or placebo for irSAEs regardless of whether or not the subject starts a new anticancer therapy) or any SAE made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that is suspected of being related to IP. All SAEs considered related to RT will be collected at any time after the first dose of RT, including late radiation toxicities. Serious adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured. Where required by local legislation, the Investigator is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-up information about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE information on file including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC. 10.5.1. Safety Queries Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via facsimile or electronic mail. The response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business days. Urgent queries (eg, missing causality assessment) may be handled by phone. 10.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to tislelizumab based on the Investigator’s Brochure. In the United States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32. For countries within the European Econo mic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory Authorities and Ethics Committees concerned, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collection, verification and presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from clinical trials on investigational products for human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country-specific requirements. For the purpose of regulatory reporting in the EEA, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to non-Celgene IMP study drugs (cisplatin, etoposide, carboplatin, and paclitaxel) based on the following Reference Safety Information documents: !Cisplatin- EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) !Etoposide- EU SmPC !Carboplatin- EU SmPC&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)25 forming theorming them witthem wit hh must keep must kee the IRB/ECthe IRB/EC m m Celgene DCelgene xpected to xpected to ssment) msment) m aa dverse Evdverse E , CelCelgene Dgene tiislelizumaslelizum ed unexpeced unexpec nner in acconer in acco EuroEu pean Epea port in an export in an rned, susperned, suspe 001/20/EC001/20/EC of adverse rof adverse e (ENTR/C(ENTR/C e purpose purpos e o pectedness ectedness etoposide, toposide, documdocum e0$7,210$75050250)2"

Emergency Contact In emergency situations, the Investigator should contact the responsible Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor or designee by telephone at the number(s) listed on the Emergency Contact Information page of the protocol (after title page). In the unlikely event that the Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor or designee cannot be reached, please contact the global Emergency Call Center by telephone at the number listed on the Emergency Contact Information page of the protocol (after title page). This global Emergency Call Center is available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. The representatives are responsible for obtaining your call-back information and contacting the on- call Spons or Medical Monitor, who will then contact you promptly. Note: The back-up 24-hour global emergency contact call center should only be used if you are not able to reach the Clinical Research Physician(s) or Medical Monitor or designee for emergency calls. 12.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products The blind must not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opinion of the Investigator, it is absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject. If it is medically imperative to know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discontinued if, in the opinion of the Investigator, continuing IP can negatively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment. The decision to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibility of the treating physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor. However, the Investigator may contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the interest of the subject. The Investigator should ensure that the code is broken only in accordance with the protocol. The Investigator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the reason for breaking the blind, which should be clearly documented by the Investigator in the subject’s source documentation. Emergency unblinding should only be perform ed by the Investigator through the IRT. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21be e n ves are ves are nsornsor MediMedi ca bbe used if ye used if desidesignee fgnee f ProductsProduct nlessnless in thin t ubject.

Good Clinical Practice The procedures set out in this study protocol pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and documentation of this study are designed to ens ure that Celgene, its authorized representative, and Investigator abide by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an IRB/EC prior to commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities. 13.2. Investigator Responsibilities Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations. Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all Investigators who in turn will select their staff. The Investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study are adequately informed about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions, including obligations of confidentiality of Celgene information. The Investigator should maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study-related duties. The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an ICF and are screened for entry into the study. Subjects who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents. The Investigator, or a designated member of th e Investigator’s staff, must be available during monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study-related charts) for source data verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of eCRFs and queries. At the time results of this study are made available to the public, Celgene will provide Investigators with a summary of the results that is written for the lay person. The Investigator is responsible for sharing these results with the subject and/or their caregiver as agreed by the subject. &(/ the time re the time r Investnvest igatigat esponsespon5235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21Practice anPractice luate and aluate and a dyy are adeqare adeqyy y--related drelated d .

Subject Information and Informed Consent The Investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative prior to any study related procedures. Documentation that informed consen t occurred prior to the study subject’s entry into the study and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents including the date. The original ICF, signed a nd dated by the study subject and by the person consenting the study subject prior to the study subject’s entry into the study, must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject. In addition, if a protocol is amended and it impacts on the content of the informed consent, the ICF must be revised. Study subjects participating in the study when the amended protocol is implemented must be re- consented with the revised version of the ICF. The revised ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person consenting the study su bject must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject. 13.4. Confidentiality Celgene affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in compliance with ICH and other local regulations (w hichever is most stringent). Celgene requires the Investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws. Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the subject’s signed ICF, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the appropriate i ndividual. 13.5. Protocol Amendments Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by the Celgene Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor. Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval. Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs. The written signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically reference the Investigator name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC for information purposes. 13.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review and Approval Before the start of the study, the study protoc ol, ICF, and any other appropriate documents will be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance with local legal requirements.

If the IRB/EC will not disclose the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. Formal approval by the IRB/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number (if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be officially signed by a commi ttee membe r. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all ethical and legal requirements must be met. The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the ICF should also be revised. The Investigator must keep a record of all communication with the IRB/EC and, if applicable, between a c oordinating Inve stigator and the IRB/EC. This statement also applies to any communication between the Investigator (or Coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and regulatory authorities. Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed by Celgene and the IRB/EC prior to use. 13.7. Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board/ Ethics Committee If required by legislation or the IRB/EC, the Investigator must submit to the IRB/EC: !Information on serious or unexpected adverse events as soon as possible; !Periodic reports on the progress of the study; !Deviations from the protocol or anything th at may involve added risk to subjects. 13.8. Termination of the Study Celgene reserves the right to terminate this st udy prematurely at any time for reasonable medical or administrative reasons. Any premature discontinuation will be appropriately documented according to local requirements (eg, IRB/EC, regulatory authorities, etc). In addition, the Investigator or Celgene has th e right to discontinue a single site at any time during the study for medical or administrative reasons such as: !Unsatisfactory enrollment; !GCP noncompliance; !Inaccurate or incomplete data collection; !Falsification of records; !Failure to adhere to the study protocol.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21otocol ocol aluated to aluated to also be revalso be rev and, if appand, if app applies to applies r, if applicar, if applic be reviewee revi onal Revienal Revie vestigator mestigator pected advepected adv gress of thegress of the otocolotoco or aorl ofofthe Stuthe S ht to terminht to term ons. ons.

Data/Documents The Investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the study and the distribution of the investigat ional product are complete, accurate, filed and retained. Examples of source documents include: hospital records; clinic and office charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; subject’s diaries or evaluation checklists; dispensing records; recorded data from automated instruments; copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies; microfiche; x-ray film and re ports; and records kept at the pharmacy, and the laboratories, as well as copies of eCRFs or CD-ROM. 14.2. Data Management Data will be collected via eCRF and entered into the clinical database per Celgene Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). This data will be electronically verified through use of programmed edit checks specified by the clinical team. Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary. Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database. An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data. 14.3. Record Retention Essential documents must be retained by the Investigator according to the period of time outlined in the clinical trial agreement. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21s s , and and gene Sene S tandatand ugh use of ugh use of n the data wthe da , if necessa, if necessa in the systein the sys ator accordiator accord (7$,(75,( 235235(31((1(*(1/*((/(/*&(/(/&("

QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE All aspects of the study will be carefully mo nitored by Celgene or its authorized representative for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current GCP and SOPs. 15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after the study. All aspects of the study are reviewed with the Investigator and the staff at a study initiation visit and/or at an Investigators’ Meeting. Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a Celgene representative will review the protocol , eCRFs, procedures for obtaining informed consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator. Monitoring will include on-site visits with the Investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone. During monitoring visits, the facilities, investigational product storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study documentation will be insp ected/reviewed by the Celgene repre sentative in accordance with the Study Monitoring Plan. Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation. Any resulting discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff. Any necessary corrections will be made directly to the eCR Fs or via queries by the Investigator and/or his/her staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified. Additional monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan. 15.2. Audits and Inspections In addition to the routine monitoring procedur es, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance unit exists within Celgene. Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Pract ice guidelines and regulations. The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for audits and inspections by IRB/ECs, regulatory authorities (eg, FDA, European Medicines Agency, Health Canada) and company authorized representatives. The Investigator should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or inspections. If the Investigator is contacted by any regulatory authority regarding an inspection, he/she should contact Celgene immediately. 15.3. Product Quality Complaint A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, qualit y, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, purity, or performance of any drug product manufactured by or on behalf of Celgene Corporation after it is released for distribution. PQCs may reduce the usability of the product for its intended function or affect performance of the product and therefore pose a significant risk to the subjects. Examples of PQCs include (but are not limited to): mixed product, mislabeling, lack of effect, seal/packaging breach, product missing/short/overage, contamination, suspected falsified,a d d will will e e facilitcilities, ies, all other stul other s accordanceaccordanc t iis a dis a di recrecii ocumentatioumentati /her staff. /her sta s by the Invs by the In nts, adherents, adhe ecording beecording b ecific mecific m onion ceducedu res, resa GG atives of thatives of th ne SOPs toe SOPs to to permit dto permi s and applis and ap by IRB/by IRB ECC nada) nada) and cand c e available e available yyauthoriauthoriy tytyii ProduProdu Product Quaroduct Qua alleges defilleges defi puripuritytyi, o, er i"

IMMUNE-RELATED ADVERSE EVENT EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT The recommendations below for the diagnosis and management of any irAE are intended as guidance. This document should be used in conjunction with expert clinical judgment (by specialist physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer using immunological agents), and individual institutional guidelines or policies. Criteria used to diagnose irAEs include bl ood tests, diagnostic imaging, histopathology, and microbiology assessments to exclude alternative causes such as infection, disease progression, and adverse effects of concomitant drugs. In addition to the results of these tests, the following factors should be considered when making an irAE diagnosis: !What was the temporal relationship betw een init iation of tislelizumab/placebo and the adverse event? !How did the subject respond to withdrawal of tislelizumab/placebo? !Did the event recur when tislelizumab/placebo was reintroduced? !Was there a clinical response to corticosteroids? !Is the event an autoimmune endocrinopathy? !Is disease progression or an alternative diagnosis a more likely explanation? When alternative explanations to autoimmune toxicity have been excluded, the irAE field, associated with the AE in the eCRF should be checked. Table 22: Recommended Diagnostic Tests in the Management of Possible Immune related Adverse Events Immune-related Toxicity Diagnostic Evaluation Guideline Thyroid Disorders Scheduled and repeat thyroid function tests (TSH and T4). Hypophysitis Check visual fields and consider pituitary endocrine axis blood profile. Perform pituitary and whole brain MRI in subjects with headache, visual disturbance, unexplained fatigue, asthenia, weight loss, and unexplained constitutional symptoms. Consider consultation with an endocrinologist if an abnormality is detected. Pneumonitis All subjects presenting with new or worsened pulmonary symptoms or signs, such as an upper respiratory infection, new cough, shortness of breath, or hypoxia should be assessed by high-resolution CT. Consider pulmonary function test including DLCO. Radiographic appearance is often nonspecific. Depending on the location of the abnormality, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy may be considered. Consult with a respiratory medicine physician for cases of uncertain cause. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ssion, sion, follollowing wing abb/placebo/placeb placeboplacebo ?? troduced?troduced? gnosis a mognosis a m icitcity y have bave checked. hecked.

Conduct a diabetic screen, and assess blood B12/folate, HIV status, TFTs, and consider autoimmune serology. Consider the need for brain/spine MRI/MRA and nerve conduction study for peripheral neuropathy. Consult with a neurologist if there are abnormal findings. Colitis Review dietary intake and exclude steatorrhea. Consider comprehensive testing, including the following: FBC, UEC, LFTs, CRP, TFTs, stool microscopy and culture, viral PCR, Clostridium difficile toxin, cryptosporidia (drug-resistant organism). In case of abdominal discomfort, consider imaging, eg, X-ray, CT scan. If a subject experiences bleeding, pain or distension, consider colonoscopy with biopsy and surgical intervention, as appropriate. Eye Disorders If subjects experience acute, new onset, or worsening of eye inflammation, blurred vision, or other visual disturbances, refer the subject urgently to an ophthalmologist for evaluation and management. Hepatitis Check ALT/AST/total bilirubin, INR/albumin; the frequency will depend on severity of the AE (eg, daily if Grade 3-4; every 2 to 3 days if Grade 2, until recovering). Review medications (eg, statins, antibiotics) and alcohol history. Perform liver screen including Hepatitis A/B/C serology, Hepatitis E PCR and assess anti-ANA/SMA/LKM/SLA/LP/LCI, iron studies. Consider imaging, eg, ultrasound scan, for metastases or thromboembolism. Consult with a hepatologist and consider liver biopsy. Renal Toxicity Review hydration status and medication history. Test and culture urine. Consider renal ultrasound scan, protein assessment (dipstick/24-hour urine collection), or phase-contrast microscopy. Refer to nephrology for further management assistance. Dermatology Consider other causes by conducting a physical examination, consider dermatology referral for skin biopsy. Joint or muscle inflammationConduct musculoskeletal history and perform complete musculoskeletal examination. Consider joint X-ray and other imaging as required to exclude metastatic disease. Perform autoimmune serology and refer to rheumatology for further management assistance. For suspected myositis/rhabdomyolysis/myasthenia include: creatine kinase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP, troponin and consider a muscle biopsy.

THE RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS (RECIST) GUIDELINES, VERSION 1.1 The text below was obtained from Eisenhauer, 2009 . DEFINITIONS Response and progression will be evaluated in this trial using the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee (v1.1). Changes in only the largest diameter (uni-dimensional measuremen t) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria. Note: Lesions are either measurable or non-meas urable using the criteria provided below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy. Measurable Disease Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: !10 mm by CT scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the slice thickness and a minimum of 10 mm) !10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (when superficial) !20 mm by chest X-ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung) Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis w ill be measured and followed. Nonmeasurable Disease All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter ≥ 10 to < 15 mm with conventional techniques or < 10 mm using spiral CT scan), are considered nonmeasurable disease. Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural, or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques are all non- measurable. Bone lesions: !Bone scan, PET scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, thes e techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. !Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic le sions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above !Blastic bone lesions are nonmeasurable&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21w.

Number:Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) Protocol BGB-A317-NSCL-001 Celgene Corporation 168 BGB-A317-NSCL-001 Amendment 1 Final: 20 Sep 2018Cystic lesions: !Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neithe r measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts !Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. Lesions with prior local treatment: !Tumor lesions situated in a previously irrad iated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. Tria l protocols should detail the conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable. Target Lesions All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organ, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. Lymph nodes merit special mention since they ar e normal anatomical structures which may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesion s must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as 2 dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan, this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm × 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered nontarget lesio ns. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered nonpathological and s hould not be recorded or followed. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesi ons, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. Nontarget Lesions All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should als o be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as “presen t”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal &&(hh&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21cted to othected to othe ererehas beehas bee l the condithe conll 5lesiolesions inns i e.

In addition, it is possible to rec ord multiple nontarget lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph node” or “multiple liver metastases”). GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF MEASURABLE DISEASE All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and duri ng follow-up. Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are accessible by clinical examination. Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and P10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical examination and imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the trial. !Chest X-ray: Chest CT is preferred over ches t X-ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly de fined and surrounded by aerated lung. !CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (eg, for body scans). !Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances. !Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. !Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If markers are in itially above the upper normal limit, however, they must norm alize for a patient to be considered in CR. Because tumor markers are disease &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21n shoulshoul d d nnot be nnot be are superfiare supe case of skincase of sk of the lesiof the lesi nical examiical exam objectjective anive an ray, partray, p icuic ive than Xive than X on chest Xon chest X nd surroundd surroun vailable andailable an ssment.

Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and prostate-specific antigen response (in recurrent prostate cancer), have been published. In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first-line trials in ovarian cancer. !Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by protocol (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be a potential adve rse effect of treatment (eg, with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive disease. RESPONSE CRITERIA Evaluation of Target Lesions !Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. !Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters !Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute incr ease of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). !Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study !Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the “sum” of lesions may not be zero even if CR criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm. Case report recorded in a separate section where, in order to qualify for CR, each node must achieve a short axis <10 mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions. !Target lesions that become “too small to measure”. While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ess hen en tain ain n of the of the nt can be nt can be table diseastable diseas gressive digressive di t lesiot lesi ns.

If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be a ssigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be us ed for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default v alue of 5 mm s hould be a ssigned in this circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. !Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: When non-nodal lesions “fragment”, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion”. Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions While some nontarget lesions may actually be meas urable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. !CR: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be nonpathological in size (<10 mm short axis). !PD: Unequivocal progression (as detailed below) of existing nontarget lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.) !Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits !When the patient also has measurable disease: In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal progression” on the basis of the nontarget disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in nontarget disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest “increase” in the size of one or more nontarget lesions is usually not sufficient to qua lify for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in nontarget disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. !When the patient has only non-measurable disease: This circumstance arises in some phase 3 trials when it is not a criterion of trial entry to have measurable disease.

Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: if all lesions are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in “volume” (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). !Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to “large”, an increase in lymphangitic dis ease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols as “sufficient to require a change in therapy”. If “unequivocal progression” is seen, the patient should be considered to have had over all PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have objective criter ia to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore the increase must be substantial. New Lesions The appearance of new malignant lesions de notes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion s hould be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some “new” bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or CR. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identified on a follow-up trial in an anatomical lo cation that was not scanned at bas eline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on trial has a CT or MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents trul y new disease. If rep eat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the init ial scan. While fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible “new” disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow- up, is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. !No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.

If the positi ve FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. Evaluation of Best Overall Response The BOR is the best response recorded from th e start of the study drug treatment until the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation. On occasion a response may not be documented until after the end of therapy so protocols should be clear if post-treatment assessments are to be considered in determination of BOR. Protocols must specify how any new therapy introduced before progression will affect best response designation. The patient’s BOR assignment will depend on the findings of both target and nontarget disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the trial and the protocol requirements, it may als o require confirmatory measurement. Specifically, in non-randomized trials where response is th e primary endpoint, confirmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the “best overall response”. The BOR is determined once all the data for the patient is known. Best response determination in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS NOT required: Best response in these trials is defined as the best response across all time points (for example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment has a BOR of PR). When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet the protocol specified minimum t ime from baseline. If the minimum t ime is not met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient’s best response depends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PD at second and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD. The same patient lost to follow-up after the first SD assessment would be considered inevaluable.

When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to “normal” size (< 10 mm), they may st ill have a measurement reported on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be eded1(352n--CR/nonCR/non -5235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21nnot ot any new any new ient’s BORient’s BOR will also takll also tak he nature ohe nature ement.

As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of “zero.” In trials where confirmation of response is required, repeated ""NE"" time point assessments may complicate best response determination. The analysis plan for the trial must address how missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and progression. For example, in most trials it is reasonable to consider a patient with time point responses of PR-NE-PR as a confirmed response. Patients with a global deterioration of heal th status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stopping trial therapy. Conditions that define “early progression, early d eath, and inevaluability” are trial specific and should be clearly described in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, treatment periodicity). In some circumstances it may be difficult to dis tinguish residual diseas e from normal tissue. When the evaluation of CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before assigning a status of CR. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance s hould be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positiv e CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/ sensitivity. For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes, or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected. CONFIRMATORY MEASUREMENT/DURATION OF RESPONSE Confirmation In nonrandomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and CR is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error. This will also permit appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data where response has traditionally required confirmation in such trials . However, in all other circumstances, ie, in randomized trials (phase 2 or 3) or trials where stable disease or progression are the primary endpoints, confirmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the interpretation of trial results. However, elimination of the requirement for response confirmation may increase the importance of central review to protect against bias, in particular in trials which are not blinded. In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after trial entry at a minimum interval (in general not less than 6 weeks).&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ession ession rrofofan an ff trial speciftrial speci ion, treatmon, treatm ease frose fro m s recommenecomme igning a stagning a milar to a bilar to a b t fibrosis ot fibrosis ly describely describe ation.

The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. Duration of Stable Disease Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomized trials, from date of randomization) until the cr iteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD). The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease varies in different studies and diseases. If the proportion of patients achieving stable disease for a minimum period of time is an endpoint of importance in a particular trial, the protocol should specify the minimal t ime interval required between 2 measurements for determination of stable disease. Note: The duration of response and stable disease as well as the progression-free survival are influenced by the frequency of follow-up after baseline evaluation. It is not in the scope of this guideline to define a standard follow-up frequency. The frequency should take into account many parameters including disease types and stages, treatment periodicity, and standard practice. However, these limitations of the precision of the measured endpoint should be taken into account if comparisons between trials are to be made. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21e of of est sum onst sum on D).). es and dises and dis f time is an f time is an al t time ime int progressionogression tioion.

JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below. This includes the following revisions: !Additional Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) Assessment of the Safety and Tolerability of the Cisplatin Plus Etoposide Chemotherapy Regimen An additional IDMC safety analysis with a minimum of 10 subjects who have completed 2 cycles of tislelizumab, cisplatin/etoposide and radiation therapy and have been on study for at least 60 days will be conducted to provide a dditional safety information about this specific chemotherapy combination. had concerns regarding the tolerability of cisplatin/etoposide administered in combination with tislelizumab and radiation th erapy, since this regimen is known to have increased morbidity when compared to the regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel (Santana-Davila, 2014). Protocol Section 1.2.2.4 provides early data from Study BGB-A317-206, in which tislelizumab is administered in combination with 4 different platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy regimens (pemetrexed, paclitaxel, gemcitabine or etoposide combined with either cisplatin or carboplatin) in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC). While there are no safety data for tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy and radiation, data presented at ASCO 2018 regarding the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy and radiation in subjects wi th NSCLC have not identified any new safety concerns. The NICOLAS Phase 2 trial (Peters, 20 18) is exploring the safety and feasibility of combined chemotherapy (which included cisplatin in combination with etoposide, vinorelbine or pemetrexed) and radiation with nivolumab in stage III NSCLC. At the time of an early interim analysis, 49 subjects were recruited with a med ian follow-up of 6.6 months . The most frequently observed AEs were fatigue and anemia. No unexpected AEs or increased safety risk were observed. For the first 21 subjects, no pneumonitis grade ≥3 was observed by the end of the 3- month post radiotherapy (RT) follow-up period. Th e majority of these subjects (18 subjects) were on a concurrent chemotherapy and radiation schedule. This early interim safety analysis provides ev idence that the addition of nivolumab to concurrent chemotherapy and radiation is safe and tolerable. An early safety assessment across all the treatmen t arms in the current study would provide a meaningful basis for comparison of the relative safety of tislelizumab given concomitantly with chemotherapy and radiation. In the original protocol, . Therefore, the amendment includes an additional IDMC safety analysis with a minimum of 10 subjects who have completed CCI CCI CCI(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21en ted 2 ed 2 tudytudy ffyyor ator atfff is specific is specific ministeredministered nnis knownis know and paclitaxand paclitax StudyudBGBGy latatinuminum --co ine or etopoe or etop lung cancerlung canc combinatcombinat ii se of immuse of immu s wiwiththii NSC NShh Peters, 20Peters, 20 1 uded cisplauded cis volulumab inmab in ited with aited with a and anemiaand anem subjecsubjec ts, nt pyy(RT) fol(RT) folyy nt chemothchemoth e that the ae that the a ableble.. affetefffy yassesasses ngful basis ngful basis motherapy motherapy &(/&(&"

The current amendment thus revises the required calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) to ≥ 60 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula) for subjects receiving cisp latin/etoposide. Since carboplatin dosing is based on area under the curve (AUC), which takes into consideration drug elimination through renal clearance, the requirement remains CrCl ≥ 45 mL/min for subjects receiving carboplatin/paclitaxel. In addition, Table 14 (Dose Modifications for Ci splatin Based on Renal Toxicity) is amended to reflect that resumption of cisplatin dosing following a delay due to renal toxicity, and the degree of dose reduction (if needed), depend upon the return of the subject’s CrCl to ≥ 60 mL/min rather than ≥ 45 mL/min. Revised sections: Section 4.2 (Inclusion Criteria), Table 14 (Dose Modif ications for Cisplatin Based on Renal Toxicity), Section 7.2.8 (Creatin ine Clearance) !Clarification Regarding the East Asia Versus Other Stratification Factor As described in the protocol, this Phase 3 study will be conducted under 2 protocols.
