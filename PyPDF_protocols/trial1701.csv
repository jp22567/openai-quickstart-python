INTRODUCTION 1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease of the exocrine glands, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems andcharacterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and abnormally high sweat electroly tes. CF is a life -threatening disease affecting approximately 30,000 children and adults in the United State s and more than 70,000 worldwide .CF is an inherited autosomal recessive trait (i.e., an individual must inherit two defective CF genes –one from each parent – to have CF). The gene resp onsible for the disease encodes a membrane- associated protein called the cy stic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and is located on the long arm of chromosome 7 [R15-5856]. The gene defect causes the body to pr oduce abnormally thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and leads to life -threatening lung infec tions. In addition, evidence suggests a role for the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the pathogenesis of CF that exacerbates the dehy dration of mucus, w hich becomes thickened, tenacious and adherent, and leads to collapsed cilia and poor mucus clearance [ R15-4955]. Standard therap y for CF patients, adult and paediatric, include s various CFTR modulators alone or in combination , antibiotics, airway clearance techniques and devices, pancreatic enzy mes and nutritional supplements, and drugs such as dornase alfa (Pulmozy me®), ibuprofen and, most often, inhaled bronchodilators. In CF, inhibition of ENaC is anticipated to modify the abnormal electrol ytic exchange across the cell membrane, b y specificall y reduc ingsodium uptake and water absorption in the airway s, thus counteracting deh ydration of the mucus. This should translate to improved mucociliary clearance and pulmonary functi on(especiall y FEV 1). A decrease in static mucus would be expected to reduce bacterial colonisation of the lower airway s, which could cause fewer exacerbations and hospitalisations. As a result, the patient would experience a relief of clinical sy mptoms an d a better quality of life. 1.2 DRUG PROFILE 1.2.1 The Respimat ® Inhaler BI 1265162 is administered with the Respimat®inhaler from an aqueous solution in a cartridge, which is inserted into the inhaler prior to first use. Several solutions with different drug substance concentrations have been developed for use in clinical studies , including a placebo solution . The Respimat®Inhaler generates a soft mist (without the use of propellants) which is released over a period of approximately 1.5 seconds. The drug formulation contains disodium edetate as a stabilizer andas a multi- dose inhaler and solution; it contains the antimicrobial preservative benzalkonium chloride. Both excipients have been reported to induce bronchospasms in some patients.

Even though new disease modify ing therapies have been approved, there is still a need for s ymptomatic treatment that works in conjunction with existing medications to reduce the risk of CF -related exacerbations, improve the quality of life and prolong pati ent survival. One particular unmet medical need in CF is for a safe and effective muco -active medication. In comparison to marketed mucolytic therapies, an ENaC inhibitor would be expected to have additional effects as a result of its direct influence on mucus hy dration. Indeed ,an ENaC inhibitor does not act directly on mucus butby inhibiting the ENaC which is highly upregulated in CF, it modifies the abnormal electrol ytic exchange across the cell"

ENaC represent sa new target in CF and is part of a ph ysiological pathway that complements CFTR in the regulation of the fluid volume and composition of the airway surface lay er (ASL), a key factor in determining the potential of mucociliary clearance. This could result in potential synergy between CF treatments targeting the two mechanisms. Historically , CF has been considered a paediatric disease, becoming s ymptomatic at a y oung age. However, newer treatments and improved disease management allow patients to live into adulthood. The underl ying aetio logy, a genetic defect in the CFTR gene, remains the same irrespective of the age. The clinical manifestations of the disease are similar in children and adults, while the main cause of death in both populations is pulmonary insufficiency . This trial will evaluate the efficacy andsafet y of several doses of BI 1265162 in adolescents (12-17 years of age) and adults with CF . This trial aims to determine the optimal dose to be evaluated in the phase III program. Rationale for the N 2Multiple Breath Washout (N 2MBW) test Lung Clearance Index (LCI ) based on N2MBW test is a valuable endpoint to explore the small airway function and the distribution of ventilation among lung region s, aspects of lung function which are not captured by spirometry . N2MBW test is a very sensitive test which requires experienced site staff and can onl y be performed in patients with less impaired lung function. 1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT The nature of the target and the mechanism o f action of BI 1265162 are well understood and ENaC inhibition is a well -established target for s ystemic potassium sparing diuretics such as amiloride. The mechanism has been studied in multiple animal species as well as in clinical trials of up to 6 month s duration via the inhaled route. The mechanism is not pleiotropic, does not have an y amplification properties and will not by pass normal phy siological control mechanisms. The tissue distribution of the target is well characterized and the adverse effect profile of the on target effect of inhibition is well known. The established functions of ENaC fit to its involvement in the pathogenesis of Cy stic Fibrosis and effects demonstrated in rats and sheep are expected to translate into effects in man."

However, BI 1265162 will be assessed on top of standard CF therapies. Therefore, the patients randomised in the placebo group will still be treated as per the standard clinical practice. The severit y of CF is determined b y a combination of factors including the CFTR mutation, so the underl ying cause of disease does not alter with age. In addition, the expression and function of ENaC is not considered to differ between the age groups. There fore, the mechanism of action and the dose of BI 1265162 are anticipated to be the same in adults and paediatrics. It is expected that BI1265162 will have a similar effect on mucociliary clearance and pulmonary function in all age groups , this is why adolescent patients aged 12 or older will be included in this phase II trial. However, patient recruitment will start with adult patients only . The enrolment of adolescents will be allowed by an independent Data and Monitoring Committee (DMC), based on per iodic safet y adult data reviews (please refer to the DMC charter for further details).

DESCRIPTION OF DESIG N AND TRIAL POPULATION 3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN This is a multi -center, multinational, randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group dose-ranging trial of BI 1265162 inhaled from the Respimat®inhaler in patients with CF. The study consists of a 2 -week screening period , a 4-week, randomised treatment period, and a 7-day follow -up period. Patients will be enrolled (screened) in the trial once the appropriate informed consent and assent (if applicable) have been given. Patients who successfull y complete the screening visit and still meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at Visit 2 will be randomised. After the completion of the treatment period or in case of early discontinuation, p atient s will be evaluated for an additional 7 day s. Overall, e ach patient’s participation in the trial is estimated to last a total of approximately 7 weeks. The patient’s participation is concluded when they have undergone the last planned visit (i.e. Follow -upVisit). As described in the Figure 3.1.1 below, p atient randomisation in the trial will start to either 200µg bid of BI 1265162 or placebo. Once 28 patients are allocated to these two arms (14 patients in each arm) , the remain ing patients will be randomised to the additional doses of BI 1265162 (20, 50 and 100µg bid) as well as 200µg bid and placebo with 14 patients per treatment arm. As a result, patients will be distributed in a 2:1:1:1:2 ratio to receive twice daily via the Respimat®inhaler either: -Placebo, or -2x10µg (i.e. 20µg bid) of BI 1265162, or -2x25µg (i.e. 50µg bid) of BI 1265162, or -2x50µg (i.e. 100µg bid) of BI 1265162 , or - 2x100µg (i.e. 200µg bid) of BI 1265162. Furthermore, patient recruitment in the trial will start with adult patients only. Enrolment of adolescent patients will be based on periodic review sof adult patient safety data. Those safet y data review sallowing the recruitment of adolescent patients will be performed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The independent DMC will decide when adolescent patients can be enrolled and inform the Sponsor accordingl y. Randomisation will be stratified b y age (<18 years old and ≥ 18 y earsoldat day of randomisation ) in order to ensure that approximately 20% of adolescent patients are randomised per treatment group (i.e., at least 3adolescent s in the 20µg, 50µg and 100µg bid of BI 1265162 groups and at least 6 adolescents in the 200µg bid of BI 1265162 and placebo groups)."

Figure 3.1.1 Trial Design In addition, in order to prevent the exposure of further patients in case of insufficient efficacy , an efficacy interim analy sis will be conducted on the first 28 patients exposed to placebo or BI 1265162 200µg bid. Please refer to Section 7.4 for further details. Patient recruitment will not be stopped during the conduct of the interim analy sis and this efficacy interim analy sis is not correlated with the periodic safety data review sthat will be performed b y the independent DMC. 3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF CONTROL GROUP(S) Since the initial pulmonary defect in CF is airway obstruction , FEV 1is the recommended primary endpoint for assessing the efficacy of a new drug in patients with CF [ R12-2800]. Due to its mechanism of action, a 4- week treatment period is considered sufficient to evaluate the indirect effects of BI 1265162 on trough FEV 1. A parallel group, randomized, double -blind and placebo controlled trial is considered the most appropriate design toassess efficacy and safety of four doses of BI 1265162. The rationale for the BI 1265162 dose selection is de scribed in S ection 4.1.2 . In order to prevent the exposure of further patients in case of insufficient efficacy , patients will be first randomised to either the highest dose of BI 1265162 or placebo. An interim efficacy anal ysis will be conducted on the first 28 patients exposed to either placebo or the highest dose of BI 1265162. As described in Section 3.1 and 7.4, depending on the results of the interim anal ysis, the trial may be stopped."

As described in Section 8.7, a data monitoring committee (DMC ), which is independent of the sponsor, will be established to assess the progress of the clinical trial, including safety review sat specified intervals, and to recommend to the sponsor whether to continue, modify , or stop the trial. The DMC will also be in charge of allowing enrolment of adolescent patients in the trial .Further details are provided in the DMC charter. 3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION Screening of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e. screening for the trialwill stop at all sites at the same time once a sufficient number of patient s has been screened. Investigators will be notified about screening completion and will then not be allowed to screen additional patient s for this trial . A sufficient number of patients with cy stic fibr osis will be screened from approximately 40 trialsites to ensure the randomisation of 98 patients including 21 adolescents (12 to 17 y ears of age ). It is expected that 2 to 3patients will be randomised at each trial site. If enrolment is delay ed, additio nal sites may be recruited. The number of adolescent patients to be included in each treatment arm should be as follows: -Placebo: at least 6 adolescents - 2x10µg (i.e. 20µg bid) of BI 1265162: at least 3 adolescents -2x25µg (i.e. 50µg bid) of BI 1265162: at l east 3 adolescents -2x50µg (i.e. 100µg bid) of BI 1265162: at least 3 adolescents - 2x100µg (i.e. 200µg bid) of BI 1265162: at least 6 adolescents Reasons for screening failures will be collected in the eCRF. The re -screening of patients will be permitted in circumstances where safet y is not compromised and in which the patient becomes eligible. In such case , the patient should be declared as a screening failure in the eCRF and IRT with their original patient number. Upon re -screening, a new patient number will be assigned b y the IRT. The old patient number, with which the patient failed screening, will be recorded in the eCRF. The current approved version of the information sheet and consent form should be signed again . In case of pulmonary exacerbation requiring use of i.v./oral/inhaled antibiotics or oral corticosteroids prior to the randomisation visit, the patient should be declared as a screening failure and a re -screening may be considered when the patient becomes eligible aga in. Re-testing for eligibility criteria is onl y to be performed for a laboratory test that has been cancelled b y the central laboratory (e.g. for specimen not received or received beyond stability ) or for a laboratory result thought to be a spurious resul t based on previously available laboratory results. The re -test should be carried out as soon as possible so the laboratory test results will be received within the next planned visit windows in order to avoid protocol window violations."

The medication will be inhaled twice dail y during four weeks, using the Respimat®inhaler. Each dose will consist of two inhalations; therefore the 20 µgdose will consist of two inhalations of 10 µg, the 50 µgdose will consist of two inhalations of 25 µg, the 100 µgdose will consist of two inhalations of 50 µg and the 200 µg dose will consist of two inhalations of 100µg. The doses selected were ba sed on the previous SRD and MRDstudies in healthy volunteers (please refer to the Investigator Brochure for further details). The doses were selected in order to cover the expected therapeutic range (50 µg to 200 µg) anda sub -therapeutic dose (20 µg) whic h is required for a proper modeli ng of the dose response shape. With these selected doses, sufficient information should be gathered to select a safe and effective dose to be assesse d in Phase III pivotal studies. 4.1.3 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups As described in Section 3.1 , patient randomisation will start with only adult patients to either 200 µg bid of BI 1265162 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. As soon as 28 patients are allocated to these two treatment arms, the remaining patients will be allocated to the other doses of BI 1265162 as well as the highest dose and placebo in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio (14 patients per treatment arm). The assignment will occur in a blinded fashion viaInteractive Response Technology (IRT). The IRT will assign the appropriate medication number based on the treatment sequence. The randomisation code will be controlled and documented. All instructions for use of the IRT system will be described in a user guide/manual which will be available in t he ISF. 4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient 4.1.4.1 Drug assignment and Dispensing of medication Patients who qualify for randomisation will be randomly assigned b y the IRT to one of the treatment groups listed below.

The patient will receive one Respimat®medication kits and one reserve Respimat®inhaler .Medication swill be dispensed by the investigator, study coordinator or pha rmacist, depending on the site structure . The reserve kit allows the patient the flexibility of not having to return to the clinic immediately to replace a lost or malfunctioning Respimat®inhaler. In the event that the patient may need additional extra Re spimat®inhalers and cartridges due to rescheduled visits, inhaler loss or malfunction, these will be supplied on an ‘on demand’ basis. Dispensing of these extra Respimat®inhalers will also be managed via the IRT. 4.1.4.2 Training and Priming of the Respimat®inhaler Patients will receive training on the use of the Respimat®inhaler at Visit 1 to familiarize them selves with assembling, priming and using the inhaler . Training will be repeated at V isit 2and3 where observance of the inhalation procedure will occur . Each newl y assembled Respimat®inhaler needs to be primed prior to first time use. The inhaler should be primed by actuating it until an aerosol is visible, plus three additional actuations. All priming actuations s hould be directed to the ground and priming should NOT take place in the same room where the patient is inhaling trial medication or in the room where PK blood samples are taken or being processed. On the PK sampling day s, should priming of a new Respimat® inhaler be required, it should be perf ormed by site personnel, and not by the patient. Gloves must be worn and discarded immediatel y after the priming to avoid contamination of the PK samples to be taken and processed subsequently (see also Section 5.3.2). 4.1.4.3 Study medication administration At Visit 2, the first dose of study medication will be self -administered in the clinic. The clock time of the end of second inhalation will be captured on the source documents and in the eCRF. At all subsequent visits, medication will also be self -administered in the clinic and the clock time of the end of inhalation will be captured. The utmost care should be taken to ensure that during the treatment period, the study medication is not taken prior to coming to the site for a visi t. In case the patient would take the study medication in the morning of the clinic visit, the trial visit should be re -scheduled the day after. Study Medication administration at home: Twice a day ,each morning (other than clinic visit day s) and each evening, medication will be self-administered b y the patient. The patient will inhale two puffs of stud y medication from the assigned Respimat®inhaler. Patients should be encouraged to take their study medication at approximately the same time each morning and each evening after all other (inhaled) CF treatments . If adose is missed for more than 4 hours, the next dose should be taken as planned. If the evening dose is missed on the day prior to a clinic visit, the visit should be rescheduled the day after . A glass of water can be taken after the trial drug inhalation , if needed ."

The randomisation code will be kept secret by Clinical Trial Support up to database lock. The randomisation codes will be provided to B ioanaly tics prior or during the study to allow for the exclusion from the anal yses of pharmacokinet ic (PK) samples taken from placebo patients and to anal yse the PK data on an ongoing basis. The project pharmacometrician and trial pharmacokineticist will also be given access to the randomisation code, along with preliminary BI 1265162 concentration data during the study to allow the PK , PK/PD modelling to be started from at least 53 evaluable patients. This will also allow minimizing the time from database lock to obtaining the final PK modelling results. If required, and draft PK data is available, this can be supplied to the DMC upon request. This data, including the randomisation codes, will be kept separate and securely in a manner not to unblind any members of the medical team or team personnel interacting with the stud y sites or investigators. The interim anal ysis to be performed on the primary efficacy endpoint once 28 patients have completed 4 weeks of treatment will be conducted by a Sponsor team independent from the trial team. The randomisation codes will be provided to this team who will keep those separate and securel y in a ma n ner not to unblind any members of the medical team or team personnel interacting with the study sites or investigators. The randomisation codes will also be provided to the independent DMC in case unblinded data review is required by any of the DMC members.

ASSESSMENT S 5.1 A SSESSMENT OF EFFICAC Y 5.1.1 Pulmonary Function Testing (FEV 1 FEV 1 will be assessed using standardised spirometry equipment which will be supplied to all participating sites at trial initiati on. Only these spirometers are to be used for this trial. Spirometry performance will be centrall y reviewed. Spirometry equipment will be provided centrally with supplies of pre -calibrated disposable flow sensors. These sensors demonstrate variability within the required standards of +/ -3% determined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) [ P05-12782]. As such there is no need to conduct daily calibration prior to use. For each patient, pulmonary function testing will alway s start at approximately the same time of day . Spirometry will be conducted while the patient is in a seated position. It is preferable that the same trained individual performs the PFTs for a given patient. The best of three efforts will be defined as the highest FEV 1 each obtained on any of three blows meeting the ATS /ERS criteria (with a maximum of eight attempts). FEV 1 will be measured at the timepoints indicated in Flow Chart . Spirometry results captured by spirometers provided b y the sponsor will be electronically transmitted and confirmed b y central reading. Spirometry predicted values will be based on the Global L ung Initiative (GLI) 2012 lung function reference equations [ R15-0845]. 5.1.2 Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised (CFQ -R) The CFQ -R is a disease specific instrument that measures health related quality of life . For adolescents and adults (patients 14 yearsold and older), t he questionnaire consists of 50 items in four sections . For children ages 12 and 13 there is a self -report format consisting of 35 items as well as a version for parents/caregivers consisting of 44 items. In case a patient would turn 14 y ears old during the trial participation, the same version of the questionnaire should be used at Visit 2 and for the subsequent visits to ensure an appropriate comparison of the results. The CFQ -R will be completed at the time points indicated in the Flow Chart. The CFQ -R should be administered at the start of the clinic visit, prior to any other tests or procedures. The CFQ -R will be paper -based and available in the local language (provided in the ISF)."

The followin g should also be recorded as an AE in the eCRF andBI SAE form (if applicable): Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory test results, if they are judged clinically relevant by the investigator . If such abnormalities already exist prior t o trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only."

Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic br onchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse. 5.2.6.1.3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious” Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as described in Section 5.2.6.2 , subsection s“AE Collection ”and“AE r eporting to sponsor and timelines”. In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by their nature, can alway s be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the crite ria of an SAE as defined above. The latest lis t of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system . These events should alway s be reported as SAEs as described above . 5.2.6.1.4 Adverse events of special interest The term adverse events of special inte rest ( AESI )relates to an y specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the sa me class. AESI sneed to be reported to the sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAE s, please see Section 5.2.6.2.2. The following are considered as AESIs: 1. A confirmed elevation of serum potassium >upper limit of normal (ULN) in non- haemolysed blood (see definition in Section 3.3.4)"

These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patient s showing these lab abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the eDC system . In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplain ed encephalopathy , unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. S hould the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed . 5.2.6.1.5 Intensit y (severit y) of AEs The intensity (severit y) of the AE should be judged based on the following: Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated . Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity . Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities . 5.2.6.1.6 Causal relationship of AEs Medical judg ement should be used to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the adverse event and the given stud y treatment , considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re- challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history . Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship could be : The event is consistent with the known pharm acology of the drug . The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class. A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure. Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced. No medicall y sou nd alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre - existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications). The event is t ypicall y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome). An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller effect size if dose is reduced)."

Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despite removing the orig inal trigger. Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned). Disappearanc e of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains unchanged. 5.2.6.2 Adverse event collection and reporting 5.2.6.2.1 AE Collection The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files. The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by the investigator : •From signing the in formed consent onwards until the individual patient ’send of trial: all AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESIs. •After the individual patient’s end of trial: the investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for new AEs but should only report any occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see Section 5.2.6.2.2 ), but not in the CRF . 5.2.6.2.2 AE reporting to the sponsor and timelines The investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately (within 24 hours ) t o the s ponsor’s unique entry point (country specific reporting process will be provided in the I SF). The same timeline applies if follow- up inform ation becomes available. In specific occasions, the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form. With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient ’s end of trialmust be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or no further information can be obtained."

Once a patient has been enrolled in the clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report any drug exposure during pregnancy in a trial participant immediately (within 24 hours) by means of Part A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry point. The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure du ring pregnancy must be followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part B). The I SF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B). As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE and/or AESI, onl y the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy an SAE form must be completed in addition. 5.3 DRUG CONCENTRATION M EASUREMENTS AND PHARMACOKINETICS 5.3.1 Assessment of p harmacokinetic s Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analy sis will be collected at the time points indicated in the Flow Chart for PK blood sampling . The date and exact clock time of drug administration and of sampling times have to be recorded and documented in the eCRF by the investigator or designated site -personnel. The actual sampling times will be used for determination of pharmacokine tic parameters. These samples may also be used for metabolite determination or for further methodological investigation if required. The study samples will be discarded after completion of the additional investigations but not later than 5 years upon the f inal study report has been signed. 5.3.2 Methods of sample collection The planned PK analy ses will require blood sampling at the time points indicated in the Flowchart . Correct, complete and legible documentation of drug administrations and blood sampling times as well as adequate handling and identification of PK samples are mandatory to obtain data of adequate quality for the PK analy sis. In order to allow the sample identification, the sample tube labels should list at a minimum the following information: BI trial number, patient number, visit and planned sampling time or planned sampling time interval.

During the whole trial, a maximum of 40mL of blood per person will be drawn for PK purposes.Plasma samples w ill be obtained by centrifugation. Sample aliquots will be stored at the trial site and at the logistics CRO until shipment and at the anal ytical laboratory until analysis. First and second sample aliquots are to be shipped separately . For further details please refer to lab oratory manual. 5.3.3 Analytical determinations BI 1265162 concentrations in plasma will be determined by validated a LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatograph y tandem mass spectrometry ) assays. All details of the anal ytical methods will be available prior to the star t of sample analy sis. 5.3.4 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacokinetic – pharmacodynamic relationship The following PK parameters will be determined if feasible through a population PK approach: Ct,N (concentration of the anal yte in plasma at time t following dose N) Cpre,N (predose concentration measured for dose N) AUC 0-t,N (area under the concentration -time curve of the anal yte in plasma until t hours after dose N) A non-compartmental (NCA) PK analy sis may be undertaken on Day 8 if the data allows. The following parameters may be calculated; Ct,N (concentration of the anal yte in plasma at time t following dose N) Cpre,N (predose concentration measured for dose N) AUC 0-t,N (area under the concentration -time curve of the anal yte in plasma until t hours after dose N) For both methods of PK analysis, additional PK parameters may be generated if warranted by the data. Using appropriate population methodology , the relationship between BI 1265162 dose, systemic exposures and outcome (e.g. clinical outcomes such as FEV 1, LCI, AEs and/or safet y labs) will be investigated using a population PK/PD approach .

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN For inve stigational sites where patients below 18 y ears of age will be enrolled, trial v isits should take place at a location within the clinical site that has a child -friendly infrastructure (e.g. an environment that is familiar to the patients, the setting is ph ysically appropriate, if desired b y the patient, parent(s)/legal guardian are allowed to stay with them during the trial procedures). Furthermore, site -personnel should be knowledgeable and skilled in dealing with the paediatric population and its age -appropriate needs. 6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE Patients should make every attempt to complete the visits as specified in the Flow Char t(FC) and within the applicable visit windows. I nvestigators should encourage patient treatment compliance and adher ence to protocol specific activities. Patients who discontinue study medication prematurely will undergo the procedures for an early treatment discontinuation and a follow up visit as outlined in the FC. Rescheduling visits: A visit may be rescheduled within the acceptable visit window, due to: lack of bronchodilator(s) washout compliance, or no intake of study medication on the evening preceding the visit, or intake of study medication at home in the morning of the visit. All deviations from the planned visit schedule will be documented. If any visit has to be re - scheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit schedule (calculated from Visit 2). If bronchodilator(s) washout restrictions are not adhered to, th e visit will be rescheduled once. The importance of adherence to washout requirements should be discussed and documented. If a dose of study medication is missed on the day prior to a clinic visit with PK , the patient should contact the site for instruct ions and to determine if the visit should be rescheduled . If a patient mistakenl y takes trial medication in the morning of a visit where blood samples are drawn for PK assessment, the visit should be re- scheduled to the next day reminding the patient abo ut the expected conditions. 6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECT ED VISITS Study procedures to be performed at each visit are listed in the Flow Chart. During trial visit, the sequence in which specific assessments are performed is important. The sequence of procedures at each visit (where applicable) should be as follows: 1.CFQ -R questionnaire 2.CASA -Q questionnaire"

Randomisation Visit (Visit 2) Eligible patients will be randomised by using the IRT sy stem; all visit assessments should have been completed prior to this, and before the first intake of study medication. Patients will be tr ained on correct use of the Respimat®inhaler . First dose of trial drugs will be administered in the clinic (Day 1). For patients who are on a stable regimen of inhaled cy cling antibiotics, the Visit 2 should occur on the Day 1 of an “On- cycle” (+/ -1 or 2 day s); whatever the antibiotic is. For patients cycling different antibiotics, the Visit 2 should occur on the Day 1 of a new antibiotic cy cle. A patient diary will be dispensed at Visit 2. Patients should be instructed to use the diary to record the da te and time of administration of study medication for the 3 day s preceding the clinic visits. Time of administration means the end of the second inhalation. Next clinic visits will be scheduled after 1 and 4 weeks of treatment (Visit 3 and 4). For detail ed description of the trial procedures at each visit and dispensing schedule, please refer to the Flow Chart. In between clinic visits, serum potassium will be measured for safet y monitoring . A laboratory kit to perform blood sampling by local laboratory /doctor/heatlh care provider will be provided to the patient at Visit 3 for measurement by central laboratory .The patient should be instructed to use the patient diary to record the date and time of the blood drawing.

STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL This is a Phase II, randomi sed, double -blind, placebo -controlled and parallel group trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of twice dail y inhaled doses of BI 1265162 delivered by Respimat®inhaler as add -on therap y to standard of care over 4 weeks in patients with cy stic fibrosis . The primary objectives of this trial is to assess the efficacy , safet y and pharmacokinetics of twice dail y inhaled doses of 20 µg, 50 µg, 100µg and 200 µg of BI 1265162 delivered b y Respimat®inhaler versus placebo in adolescents and adult patients with cy stic fibrosis. The primary trial objective includes demonstration of proof of concept (PoC) with respect to a non -flat dose response curve based on percent predicted trough FEV 1, characteri zation of the dose -response relationship within the therapeutic range, and selection of the optimal dose for phase III development. For this purpose, the primary anal ysis uses methodology for dose finding emplo ying both multiple comparison procedures and m odelling techniques (MCPMod). 7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES The null hy pothesis is that there is a flat dose response curve comparing change from baseline in trough FEV 1percent predicted at 4 weeks in the placebo and the BI 1265162 dose groups. The alt ernative hy pothesis is that there is a non -flat dose response curve indicating a benefit of BI 1265162 over placebo. The MCPMod procedure allows for simultaneous evaluation of different potential dose response patterns, whilst protecting the overall probab ility ofType I error (one sided α of 5%). The pre -specified models and their parameters used for this test are outlined in Section 7.3.1 . 7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES The statistical anal ysis will be based on the following analy sis sets. Enrolled set (ES): This subject set includes subjects that signed informed consent and underwent screening procedures. Randomized set (RS): This subject set includes all randomised subjects, whether treated or not. Treated set (TS): The treated set include s all subjects who were randomized and treated with at least one dose of study drug. The treatment assignment will be determined based on the first treatment the subjects received."

Excluded subjects will be listed with their individual plasma concentrations and individual pharmacokinetic parameters, however, will not be included in descriptive statistics for plasma concentrations, pharmacokinetic parameters or other statistical assessment. All individual data will be listed. Adherence to the protocol (such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, times of measurement, compliance with intake of trial medication, treatment dispensing errors, prohibited concomitant medication, completeness and consistency of data) will be checked. Important protocol deviations (I PDs) will be identified no later than in the Blinded Report Planning Meeting (BRPM) and pre -defined in the TSAP. 7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses The anal yses for PoC and dose -finding will be performed using multiple comparison and modelling techniques (MCPMod ) [R10-1424 ] whereb y several possible dose response models (patterns) will be evaluated , while keeping full control of the ty pe I error at 5%, one - sided) to identify the best -fitting model or subset of models. To account for the repeated nature of the data and the covariates in the n ature, a restricted maximum likelihood (REML ) based approach using a mixed model with repeated measurements (MMRM) will be carried out comparing the change from baseline in trough FEV 1percent predicted at 4 weeks of treatment . The primary anal ysis will be performed on the Treated Set. The anal ysis will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment at each visit, age (adolescents vs. adults) and the fixed continuous effects of baseline at each visit.

Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the REP, a perio d of 7daysafter the last dose of trialmedication ,willbe assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation. All treated patient s will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hy pothesis testing is planned. Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment- emergent’. Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) at database lock . Laboratory data will be analy sedboth quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will be done via comparison of labo ratory data to their reference ranges.

Paramet ers such as age, weight, BMI may be used as covariates to investigate the pharmacokinetics fully in the current adult and patient population. The results from the population analy sis will be reported separatel y outside of the current Clinical Trial Report (CTR) . A non-compartmental (NCA) PK analy sis may be undertaken on Day 8 if the data allows. The following parameters may be calculated; Ct,N (concentration of the anal yte in plasma at time t following dose N) Cpre,N (predose concentration measured for dose N) AUC 0-t,N (area under the concentration -time curve of the anal yte in plasma until t hours after dose N) The results from a NCA anal ysis, if undertaken, along with listings of the plasma concentration -time data will be included in the study report. 7.4 INTERIM ANALYSES An interim futility analysis will be conducted on the primary efficacy endpoint once 28 patients in the placebo and BI 1265162 200µg bid arms have completed the 4 -week treatment period. Additional details of the interim anal ysis will be specified in the TSAP . 7.5 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA No imputation will be applied while the MMRM will use all available data. The mixed effect model will handle missing data based on a likelihood method under the ""missing at random ” assumption. 7.6 RANDOMISATION Patient randomisation will start with only adult patients to either 200 µg bid of BI 1265162 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. As soon as 28 patients are allocated to these two treatment arms, the remaining patients will be allocated to the other doses of BI 1265162 as well as the highest dose and placebo in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio (14 patients per treatment arm). As a result, patients will be distributed to one of the five treatment groups in a 2:1:1:1:2 ratio. Randomisation will be stratified b y age (< 18 years old and ≥ 18 y ears old). BI will arrange for the randomi sation and the packaging and labelling of trialmedication. The randomi sation list will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a pseudo - random number gene rator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non - predictable.

Table 7.7.1 shows the probability of Continue the trial after interim anal ysis in case of no treatment effect and overall t ype I error rate (probability of Continue after interim anal ysis and Succeed at final analy sis in case of no treatment effect) for different cut -offs. Probability of Continue is 32.3% at cut -off 1.5% in case of no treatment effect, and overall Type I error rate is controlled under 5% for all cut -offs. Table 7.7.2 shows probability of Continue the trial after interim analy sis in case of true treatment effect and overall power (probability of Continue and Succeed in case of true treatment effect) for different cut- offs and assumed true models. Probability of Continue is > 91% and overall power is ≥80% for cut -off ≤ 1.5% for all true candidate monotone shapes. With a cut -off value ranging from 1% to 2% to continue the trial after the interim anal ysis, a sample size of 12evaluable patients in each of the placebo arm and the highest dose arm at interim analy sis, and additional 12 evaluable patients in each of five arms for final anal ysis will guarantee ov erall power >79.8 % for all true candidate monotone shapes; and overall t ype I error is also controlled below 5%."
