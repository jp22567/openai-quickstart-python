DeZern, M.D., M.H.S. and Michael A. Pulsipher, M .D. Primary Objective: Assess overall survival (OS) at 1 year post -hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a haploidentical marrow donor in patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Secondary Objectives: Assess the proportion of patients alive and engrafted; neutrophil and platelet recovery ; graft failure (primary and se condary); grade s II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD ; immune reconstitution; incidence of CMV viremia/ disease and EBV viremia/ post- transplant lymphopr oliferative disease (PTLD) . Correlative Studies : ATG pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in transplant recipients ; pre- HSCT telomere length in all consenting patients and consenting haplo donors . Study Design: This study is a prospective, multicenter phase II study with patients receiving haploidentical transplantation for SAA. Accrual Objective: The goal is to transplant 30 patients on the protocol. Additional patients may be screened, consented, and registe red in order to reach accrual goals. Accrual Period: The estimated accrual period is 3 years. Eligibility Criteria: Diagnosis of SAA, without a fully matched related sibling donor available, but with a haplo marrow donor available. Exclusions include i nherited bone marrow failure syndrome, previous hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant, uncontrolled infection, inadequate organ function, and performance score < 60. Treatment Description: Patients will be treated with a preparative regimen of fludarabine (150 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (29 mg/ kg, low dose TBI (200 cGy), and Thymoglobulin ® (4.5 mg/kg). GVHD prophy laxis will be with post -HSCT cyclophosphamide (100 mg/ kg), tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) . Study Duration: Patients will be followed for 1 year post -transplant. Interim Analysis: No formal interim analyses for efficacy or futility will be used."

Secondary endpoints include assessment of overall survival, rejection free survival, neutrophil and platelet engraftment, graft fail ure, grade II -IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, immune reconstitution, and infectious complications. Additional biological correlative studies include measurement of antithymocyte globulin ( ATG) pharmacokinetics (PK) for correlation with engraftment, GVHD, imm une reconstitution, and survival as well as measurement of telomere length for correlation with disease phenotype, engraftment, and survival . 1.2 Background 1.2.1 The Current Role of HSCT in SAA Acquired SAA is a rare bone marrow failure disorder with an estimated annual incidence of 2 cases per million and with over 600 new cases in the United States each year.1, 2 The majority of cases are thought to be related to autoimmune destruction of marrow microenvironment or hematopoietic stem cells; accordingly , the disease can be treated and often cured by either immune suppression or marrow replacement through transplantation. 3 HSCT from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor (MSD) has become the standard of care for younger, newly diagnosed patients 3, 4 with long- term survival rates close to 90% in patients under 20,5, 6 and around 76% for patients older than 20.6 However, if the patient has siblings, each of them only has a 25% chance of being a match based on HLA inheritance patterns. Horse ATG and cyclosporine (CSA) immunosuppressive therapy (IST) is generally front -line treatment for SAA patients who lack matched sibling donors or are not good candidates for HSCT.7 The hematopoietic response rate is 60 -70%.2 However, up to 40% of patients eventually relapse8 and an additional 10- 40% develop a secondary clonal diseas e.9 For those whose disease is primary refractory or who relapse within 4 -6 months after IST , most groups recommend unrelated donor HSCT if an appropriately matched unrelated donor is available.10 Up to half of patients who initially respond to IST subsequently recur and either require long - term immune suppression or are refract ory to subsequent courses of IST. Unrelated donor HSCT can be considered as a reasonable alternative for SAA patients in these clinical scenarios. Recent imp rovements in survival after unrelated donor transplant for SAA have been noted using reduced doses of total body irradiation (TBI) ,11 the substitution of a portion of the cyclophosphamide dosing with fludarabine ,12 and selecting donors who are better HLA -matched to patients. These approaches have helped to lower graft failure , overall mortality , and graft versus host disease (GVHD). Some studies suggest that outcomes using HSCT with a fully matched unrelated donor (MUD) are similar to HSCT using a MSD. 13-17 Results of the BMT"

Unpublished data from the CIBMTR for transplants performed between 2009 and 2013 in the US are summarized in Table 1 and show overall survival for each type of alternative donor transplant utilized for patients with SAA. The following sections will show more promising data associated with specific approaches to haplo HSCT that inform our proposal.

In small case series, rejection has been between 6% and 25%, acute GVHD between 12% and 30%, chronic GVHD between 20% and 40%, and overall survival between 62.5% and 84.6%. 24-26 We pooled newer, unpublished data from Brazil, Johns Hopkins, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center using a reduced intensity regimen with post -transplant cyclophosphamide in 29 patients . Results are promising and are shown below . All patients received a uniform conditioning regimen of TBI 200, fludarabine 150 mg/ m 2 and Cy 29 mg/kg. Ten patients received ATG .

The eight patients had documented acquired disease and received grafts from 5/10 HLA- A, B, C, DR, DQ matched related donors. Six had failed ATG -containing regimens previously and two had relapsed after high dose cyclophosphamide as IST. Two additional pa tients had inherited syndromes: one with Diamond Blackfan who received a graft from a 5/10 related donor and one with telomeres less than the first percentile in length with a presumed familial syndrome who received a 9/10 unrelated graft. Median follow -up time is 17.5 months (range 5- 49). The median age was 34 years (range 17 -54) with 6 patients greater than age 30 years and 50% were males. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 18 days (range 16 -24). Median time to red cell engraftment was 25 days (r ange 16 -48). Median time to platelet engraftment was 27.5 days (range 22 -108). At the time of BMT, six patients had PNH clones and all were eliminated. All patients are alive and well, fully engrafted with 100% donor chimerism in blood and marrow. Two pat ients had grade I-II skin acute GVHD. These two patients also had mild chronic GVHD of the skin/mouth requiring systemic steroids. One patient was able to come off all immunosuppression by 15 months and the other by 17 months. Based on these results, ear ly low dose ATG will be used in this protocol. 2 1.2.3 Evolving Role of ATG Exposure in HSCT ATG is commonly used in HSCT regimens to prevent graft failure and GVHD, especially for nonmalignant diseases. 27-30 There are data to suggest that the rabbit preparation of ATG (rATG – Thymoglobulin®) results in improved outcomes compared to the horse preparation (hATG – Atgam®) when used in HSCT for SAA. In a C IBMTR study presented in abstract form, grades II-IV acute GVHD at Day 100 were lower with rATG compared to hATG for unrelated donor"

This advantage was not seen for hematopoietic recovery, chronic GVHD, or overall survival.31 We know a great deal about pharmacokinetics (PK) of medications in HSCT , such as busulfan, where doses are individualized based on levels. 32 Less is know n about the PK and pharmacodynamic interactions of ATG in the HSCT setting, which can be even more variable in children and adolescents.33 Some reports show that prolonged exposure may lea d to delayed immune reconstitution and more infections, while short exposure m ay lead to limited protection against GVHD.34, 35 Recently , a population PK mode l has been created for the Thymoglobulin® preparation of ATG. This model allows for individualized dosing that can achieve target area under the curve (AUC) ATG exposures pre - and post -HSCT. Dosing is based upon body weight and absolute lymphocyte count measured just prior to starting the HSCT preparative regimen . 33 Recent publications have demonstrated a link between pre -HSCT and post -HSCT AUC of ATG and outcomes. Admiraal and colleagues in the Netherlands demonstrated in 251 patients ( mostly children, n = 116 malignant disease, n = 69 benign disease, n = 15 marrow failure , and n = 51 immune deficiency ) that when the post -HSCT AUC was < 20 AU*day/mL there was improv ed immune reconstitution as shown by recovery of CD4 counts (p < 0.0001 on logistic regression fitting).36 One hundred and eighteen patients received bone marrow grafts , 36 received peripheral blood, and 96 received cord blood. Successful immune reconstitution was in turn associated with improved overall survival compared to unsuccessful immune reconstitution (56% vs. 75%, p < 0.001). A low ATG post -HSCT AUC (< 20 AU*day/mL in UCB or < 50 AU*day/mL in marrow) was itself associated with improved o verall survival for patients with benign diseases receiving a cord blood graft (91% vs. 57%, p = 0.013) and for all patients that received matched bone marrow or PBSC graft (93% vs. 76%, p = 0.014) as seen in F igure 1. Figure 1: Overall Survival According to Post -HSCT Thymoglobulin ® AUC With all stem cell sources included, the ATG post -HSCT AUC did not have an influence on GVHD. When looking at cord blood transplants alone, with lower ATG post -HSCT AUC there was a higher rate of grades II -IV acute GVHD, but no difference in grades III -IV acute GVHD"
10,page_10,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NCT02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 1-6 and no difference in extensive chronic GVHD. This increase in only grade II acute GVHD is balanced with the benefits of high ATG pre -HSCT exposure , which reduced grades II -IV acute GVHD (10% vs. 23% , p < 0.01), chronic GVHD (4% vs. 12%, p = 0.02), and graft failure (8% vs. 18%, p < 0.05) as shown in F igure 2.36 Figure 2: GV HD and Graft Failure According to Pre- HSCT Thymoglobulin® AUC These results suggest that early and targete d ATG could improve outcomes in HSCT as depicted in Figure 3, al though these data are primarily in children and with a limited population of SAA patients. Given that haplo donors have been a very small part of the data set to date and with the encouraging outcomes to date using a fixed ATG dose level of 4.5mg/kg in the Johns Hopkins single center experience, we will use a fixed ATG dosi ng in this haplo cohort study. However, we will perform ATG PK testing on the haplo cohort as well to assess whether the pre- and post - AUC levels achieved with fixed dosing correlate with outcome s."

HSCT is the only curative option for these patients but many are ineligible because they lack a suitable donor. Here we seek to increase options for these patients by using novel therapeutic strategies of GVHD prophylaxis with PTCY to expand the donor pool to include haploidentical donors . We hypothesize that this approach will result in improved survival through r eduction of transplant complications including graft failure and GVHD. 1.2.5 Protocol History Version 1.0 of the protocol included a cord blood cohort in addition to the haploidentical cohort, and sites chose which cohort they would enroll their patients on. The intent was for these two cohorts to accrue in parallel and be evaluated separately. Six months after accrual had begun, only a few sites expressed interest in the cord blood cohort and no cord blood patients had been enrolled. As a result, the cord blood cohort was removed from the protocol for Version 2.0, which was released on June 19, 2018."

In cases where there is more than one donor with the l east degree of mismatch, donors will be selected based on the most favorable combination of HLA compatibility in cross -match testing and ABO compatibility. Prioritization is given to the lowest number of mismatches in the host -versus -graft (HVG) direction to minimize the risk of graft failure . 38 3. If there is more than one donor with the least amount of HVG allele mismatches, the suggested prioritization in order of importance includes ABO compatibility, CMV status (use a sero -negative donor for a sero- negative recipient or use a sero -positive donor for a sero-positive recipient), younger age and lighter weight (this rule applies down to the age of 18, however, children may also be used as donors if appropriate), and sex of the donor (if all else is equal, males are preferred over nulliparous females over multiparous females)."

Fludarabine will be dosed on body surface area based upon the recipient’s actual body weight if the patient is < 125% of ideal body weight (IBW). For patients > 125% of IBW, fludarabine will be dosed on body surface area based upon the recipient’s adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) . For patients who have a n estimated or measured creatinine clearance < 70 mL/min/1 .73 m2, or prior brain radiation, or prior intrathecal chemotherapy, the fludarabine dose should be reduced by 20%. Fludarabine dosing is based on the last creatinine clearance prior to the start of conditioning. F ludarabine dose should be the same on Day s -6 to - 2, even if the patient’s creatinine changes. 2.5.1.1.2 Pre-HSCT Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide dose will be 14.5 mg/kg IV daily for 2 days from Day -6 to Day -5 and administered as a 1 -2 hour infusion (total dose received 29 mg/kg). Cyclophosphamide dosing should be based on recipient’s total body weight (TBW) i n all patients < 125% of IBW, and adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) in all patients ≥ 125% of IBW as per Appendix E . Hydration, as well as doses and schedule for uroprotective agents (i.e., mesna), may be administered per institutional practice. Mesna has generally been utilized for the Day +3 and Day +4 post -HSCT cyclophosphamide doses but not for the lower pre -HSCT doses. 2.5.1.1.3 Total B ody I rradiation TBI is to be delivered in a single dose of 200 cGy on Day -1.

The dose wi ll be 0.5 mg/kg IV on Day -9 over 6 hours and 2 mg/kg IV on Day s -8 and -7 over 4 hours. Premedication should follow local institutional practice with suggested minimum of 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone in children and up to 100 mg in adults prior to the infus ion (equivalent steroid allowed), preferably repeated in 3 -4 hours during the infusion. Note: Thymogl obulin® is the required preparation of ATG for this study . Patients will not be eligible if the treating center plans to use other preparations of ATG. Pharmacokinetic corollary labs should be drawn as outlined in Appendix C. 2.5.1.2 Haplo Marrow Product Handling & Infusion Patients will receive unprocessed marrow unless there is a major ABO incompatibility, in which case red blood cells will be depleted from the donor marrow using institutional practices. Institutional practices will determine if there will be processing for minor ABO incompatibilities. Donor bone marr ow will be harvested with a target yield of 4 x10 8 nucleated cells per kilogram of recipient IBW, and a recommended minimum yield of 2.5 x108 nucleated cells per kilogram of recipient IBW. It is recommended that no more than 10 mL per aspirate be taken . In addition to calculating the total nucleated cell dose per kilogram, a sample of the product to be infused will be sent for flow cytometry to determine the content of CD34+ cells. The use of cryopreserved marrow is not permitted. Please refer to Appendi x G for additional bone marrow harvesting guidelines. The protocol team will begin implementing a review process in regards to bone marrow harvesting at participating sites. As a requirement for site activation, a copy of the site’s SOP for bone marrow harves t will be collected along with total nucleated cell dose /kilogram patient weight and product volume for the last 2 harvests performed at the site. This is to ensure that participating sites are experienced in bone marrow harvesting and the rec ommended TNC can be attained for all patients enrolled on 1502. Note: The patient is not to receive steroids as an antiemetic or any other immunosuppressive agent from Day 0 until at least 24 hours after completion of Day +4 cyclophosphamide dose unless us ed for adrenal support or during medical emergency (e.g., treatment of anaphylaxis) . In the event that a patient requires steroids , please notify the Emmes Protocol Coordinator. 2.5.1.3 GVHD Prophylaxis for Haplo Recipients 2.5.1.3.1 Post-HSCT Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV daily will be given for 2 days , Days +3 to +4 (total dose received 100 mg/kg) after transplantation . Cyclophosphamide and mesna given post transplant will be dosed based on IBW , unless actual body weight is less than IBW , in which case use actual body weight. If the patient weighs > 125% of IBW, cyclophosphamide will be dose d according to the adjusted IBW. Hydration, as well as doses and schedule for uroprotective agents (i.e. , mesna) , should follow local institutional practice.

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis will be administered according to institutional practices. Recommendations include starting approximately one month post -HSCT (or later if WBC not recovering) and continuing until at lea st three months off of all immunosuppressive medications. Viral prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) will be administered according to institutional practices. Recommendations include continuation for at least one year post -HSCT and while on immunosuppressive medications. Prophylactic and empiric antibiotics as well as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) will be administered according to institutional practices.

Patients who are viremic or show evidence of end organ CMV disease may be treated according to institutional practices. EBV viremia as tested by DNA PCR will be monitored at minimum weekly after transplant until Day +100. If the patient becomes viremic with a DNA PCR level of 1000 copies/mL or higher on two consecutive occasions, the recommendation is to use Rituximab (375 mg/m 2 IV x1) or treat according to institutional practice . If the patient develops persistent EBV viremia or signs/symptoms of EBV -related post -transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) despite rituximab administration, treatment is recommended according to institutional practice. HHV- 6 viremia as tested by DNA PCR is recommended to be monitored weekly until Day +60. If the patient becomes viremic they are treated according to institutional practices. In addition, all Grade 2 and 3 infections will be reported according to the BMT CTN MOP . 2.5.3.3 Management of graft failure Patients experiencing primary or secondary graft failure are managed according to institutional practices. For this protocol, lineage -specific, myeloid and T cell chimer isms are required. Myeloid engraftment m ight not proceed at the same rate as T cell engraftment.

In addition, there are many expected toxicities of allogeneic HSCT. The following are examples of toxicities that are serious but not une xpected: Grade 4 cytopenias; neutropenic fever and sepsis ; bacterial, fungal, or viral (including CMV, BK virus) infection; severe mucositis; severe GVHD; hepatic veno -occlusive disease; pulmonary toxicities; hemorrhagic cystitis; bleeding without hemodyna mic compromise. 2.5.4.2 Drug Information 2.5.4.2.1 Fludarabine Fludarabine is a purine analog antimetabolite. Side effects of fludarabine include: 1) Neurotoxicity: Agitation or confusion, blurred vision, loss of hearing, peripheral neuropathy, or weakness have been reported. Severe neurologic effects, including blindness, coma, and death may occur; severe CNS toxicity is rarely seen with doses in the recommended range for non- transplant therapy. The dose used in this study is approximately 1.5 times the usual one -course dose given in non- transplant settings. Doses and schedules similar to those used in this study have been used in adult and pediatric patients witho ut observed increase in neurotoxicity. 2) Anemia: Life -threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been reported after one or more cycles of therapy in patients with or without a previous history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia or a positiv e Coombs’ test and who may or may not be in remission. Corticosteroids may or may not be effective in controlling these episodes. The majority of patients re -challenged developed a recurrence of the hemolytic process. 3) Cardiovascular: Deep venous thrombos is, phlebitis, transient ischemic attack, and aneurysm (1%) are reported. 4) Fever: 60% develop fever. 5) Rash: 15% develop a rash, which may be pruritic. 6) Digestive: Gastrointestinal side effects include: nausea/vomiting (36%), diarrhea (15%), stomatitis (9% ), anorexia (7%), GI bleeding and esophagitis (3%), mucositis (2%), liver failure, abnormal liver function test, constipation, dysphagia (1%) and mouth sores. 7) Some other side effects include: Chills (11%), peripheral edema (8%), myalgias (4%), osteoporosi s (2%), pancytopenia, arthralgias (1%), dysuria (4%), urinary tract infection and hematuria (2%); renal failure, abnormal renal function test, and proteinuria (1%); and, very rarely, hemorrhagic cystitis and pulmonary toxicity."

Cyclophosphamide side effects include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, hemorrhagic cystitis, fluid weight gain/edema, SIADH, transaminitis, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, rash, mucositis, alopecia, cytopenias, sterility, and, rarely, seco ndary myelodysplastic syndrome and anaphylaxis. Dose adjustments for cyclophosphamide will not be made. Mesna (sodium -2-mercapto ethane sulphonate) is a prophylactic agent used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis induced by the oxasophosphorines (cyclophosphamide and ifos famide). It has no intrinsic cytotoxicity and no antagonistic effects on chemotherapy. Mesna bi nds with acrolein, the urotoxic metabolite produced by the oxasophosphorines, to produce a non- toxic thioether and slows the rate of acrolein formation by combining with 4- hydroxy metabolites of oxasophosphorines. The total daily dose of mesna is equal to 80% of the total daily dose of cyclophosphamide. At the doses used for uroprotection, mesna is virtually non- toxic. However, potential adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, altered taste, rash, urticaria, headache, joint or limb pain, hypotension, and fatigue. 2.5.4.4 Thymoglobulin® Thymoglobulin® is a rabbit preparation of anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG) . Common side effects include nausea, fever, chills, diarrhea, rash, dizziness, headache , and tiredness. More serious side effect s can include severe allergic reaction, serum sickness, easy bleeding/bruising, fast/irregular heartbeat, joint/muscle pain, stomach/abdominal pain, and weakness. Because this drug works by weakening the immune system, it lowers the ability to fight infec tions , including some viral infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) E pstein Barr virus (EBV), and Human Herpes Virus 6 (HHV -6). No dose adjustments are required. 2.5.4.5 Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) MMF is an ester prodrug of the active immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MPA). Side effects include: pancytopenia, infection (including sepsis, CMV, HSV, VZV, and Candida), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, hypertension, headache, dizziness, insomnia, hyperglycemia, electrolyt e imbalances, rash, and leg cramps/bone pain. Drug interactions: MMF activity is decreased with oral antacids and cholestyramine. There are no pharmacokinetic interactions with cotrimoxazole, oral contraceptives, or cyclosporine. Acyclovir or ganciclovir blood levels may increase due to competition for tubular secretion. High doses of salicylates or other highly protein- bound drugs may increase the free fraction of MPA and exaggerate the potential for myelosuppression. Dose adjustments: No dose adjustments are required for liver dysfunction. For renal insufficiency, MMF dosing should not be modified unless dialysis is needed, in which case MMF can be reduced to 25 -50% of the starting dose. If toxicity is suspected, a trough mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) level should be checked. If the level is greater than 2, it will require a"

Administration may cause nephrotoxicity, seizures, tremor s, headaches, abdominal pain or indigestion, edema, confusion, muscle cramps, dizziness, hemolytic anemia, hypertension, hirsutism, thrombotic microangiopathy, electrolyte imbalances, paresthesia/neuropathy, gingival hyperplasia, hypertriglyceridemia , diar rhea, transient blindness, renal dysfunction, and hepatic dysfunction. Drug interactions & Dose adjustments : CSA is adjusted to maintain a serum trough level of 200- 400 ng/ mL by HPLC method or 250- 500 ng/mL by TDX method. Patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency should receive doses at the lower end of therapeutic concentrations. No dose adjustments are required in patients undergoing hemodialysis. There are interactions between the azole antifungal medications and CSA such that the dose of C SA should be empirically lowered when an azole medication is initiated and levels of CSA should be checked to ensure it remains in the proper therapeutic window. 2.5.4.7 Tacrolimus Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant that inhibits lymphocytes through calci neurin inhibition. Toxicities : There is a spectrum of well -described toxicities of tacrolimus. Toxicities include renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, nausea, diarrhea, headache, neurologic toxicity including tre mor and leukoencephalopathy, infection, and rarely thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Drug interactions : Tacrolimus is well- absorbed orally. Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P -450 (CYP3A4) system and metabolized products are excreted in the urine. Drugs that may increase tacrolimus levels include tri-azole drugs (especially voriconazole , isavuconazonium sulfate , and posaconazole ), nephrotoxic drugs, calcium channel blockers, cimetidine and omeprazole, metoclopramide , macrolide antibiotics, quinupristin/dalfopristin, danazol, ethinyl estradiol, methylprednisolone , and HIV protease inhibitors. Drugs that may decrease tacrolimus levels include some anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine), caspofungin, rifamycins, and St. John’s wort. Dose adjustments : The tacrolimus dose is adjusted to maintain a serum trough level of 5- 15 ng/mL, with a target of 10- 15 ng/mL. Pa tients with hepatic or renal insufficiency should receive doses at the lower end of concentrations (5-10ng/mL) . No dose adjustments are required in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Due to extreme interactions with voriconazole and posaconazole, the tacro limus dose should be empirically lowered when these azoles are initiated at steady state levels of tacrolimus. Guidelines are provided in the table below. Dose adjustments for therapy with other azoles may be indicated. However, the initial tacrolimus dose (on Day 5) remains fixed. Dosing considerations with concurrent azole therapy: Triazole antifungal medications are expected to increase serum CNI levels; therefore, dosages of CNIs should be adjusted accordingly. Guidelines are provided in the table below. Of note, reversal of azole -mediated inhibition of CYP3A4 (and others) and P -glycoprotein is gradual when azoles are stopped. Therefore, immediate significant dose increases in tacrolimus are not advised when azoles are"

Late effects include: cataracts (10-20%), hypothyroidism, nephropathy, interstitial pneumonitis, veno- occlusive disease, carcinogenesis, and sterility. 2.5.4.10 Toxicity Grading Toxicities are graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adve rse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 2.5.5 Health Related Quality of Life (HR -QoL) Assessments 2.5.5.1 Instruments MOS SF -36: The Medical Outco mes Study Short Form 36 is a 36- item general assessment of HR-QoL with eight components: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Pain Index, General Health Perceptions, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health Index. Each domain is positively scored, indicating that higher scores are associated with positive outcome. Thi s scale has been widely applied in a variety of outcome studies and is being used in this protocol as a generic measure of HR-QoL. To facilitate comparison of the results with published norms, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summ ary (MCS) will be used as the outcome measures in summarizing the SF -36 data. These summary scores are derived by multiplying the z -score for each scale by its respective physical or mental factor score coefficient and summing the products. Resulting scores are then transformed into T - scores (mean = 50; standard deviation = 10). The SF -36 takes 6 minutes to complete."

OS is defined as the time interval from date of transplant to death or to last follow -up, whichever occur s first . 3.2 Secondary Endpoints 3.2.1 Neutrophil Recovery Neutrophil recovery is achieving an ANC > 0.5 x109/L for t hree consecutive measurements on different days, with the first of the three days being defined as the day of neutrophil engraftment. 3.2.2 Platelet Recovery Platelet recovery is defined by achieving a platelet count > 20 x 109/L with no platelet transfusions in the preceding seven days. The first day of the sustained platelet count will be defined as the day of platelet engraftment. 3.2.3 Alive with S ustained Engraftment Being alive and engrafted is defined as not having experienced death, primary graf t failure, or secondary graft failure. Donor cell engraftment is defined as donor chimerism greater than or equal to 5% on or after Day 56 after transplantation. Chimerism may be evaluated in whole blood or blood cell fractions, including CD3 and CD33 or CD15 fractions. For this protocol, lineage- specific, myeloid , and T cell chimerisms are required. 3.2.3.1 Primary Graft Failure Primary graft failure is defined by the lack of neutrophil engraftment by D ay +56 post -HSCT or failure to achieve at least 5% donor chimerism (whole blood or marrow) on any measurement up to and including D ay +56. For this protocol, lineage -specific, myeloid , and T cell chimerism s are required. Myeloid engraftment might not proceed at the same rate as T cell engraftment. If myeloid has greater than or equal to 5% donor, even if T cell compartment does not, this is not considered primary graft failure. 3.2.3.2 Secondary Graft Failure Secondary graft failure is defined as any one of the following: 1. Initial neutrophil engraftment (ANC greater than or equal to 0.5 x109/L measured for three consecutive measurements on different days) followed by sustained subsequent"

Initial whole blood or marrow donor chimerism greater than or equal to 5%, but then declining to less than 5% on subsequent measurements ; 3. Second infusion/transplant given for graft failure . 3.2.3.3 Alive with Autologous Recovery Autologous recovery is defined as ANC > 0.5 x 109/L and transfusion independen ce but with < 5% donor chimerism (whole blood or marrow) . 3.2.4 GVHD Acute and chronic GVHD are graded according to the BMT CTN Manual of Procedures (MOP). 3.2.5 Immune Reconstitution Quantitative assessments of peripheral blood CD4, CD19, and CD56 positive lymphocytes will be done through flow cytometric analysis at baseline, Day 100, Day 180, and Day 365 post - transplant. 3.2.6 Infection All Grade 2 and 3 infections will be reported according to the BMT CTN MOP. CMV viremia and disease, EBV viremia, HHV- 6, and PTLD will be collected as per section 2.5.4.2. 3.2.7 Health Related Quality of Life (HR -QoL) HR-QoL will be measured at Baseline and then at Day 100, Day 180, and Day 365 post - transplant using two instruments: the MOS SF -36 for adult patient s (> 18 years), and the PedsQLTM Stem Cell Transplant Module for pediatric patients (8 years through 18 years). The instruments will be scored accordi ng to the recommendations of the developers. See S ection 2.5.6 for detailed descriptions of the instruments. The SF -36 will be summarized by the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). HR -QoL will be described for each treat ment arm over time. Only adult patients able to read and speak in English or Spanish and pediatric patients able to read and speak in English are eligible to participate in the HR -QoL component of this trial."

The following procedures should be followed: 1. Prior to initiation of the conditioning regimen, an authorized use r at the transplant center completes the Demographics Form and Segment 0 Enrollment Form in AdvantageEDC , at which point a study number will be generated. After patient is enrolled on Segment 0, the authorized user should complete the HLA Forms to verify a n eligible HLA match score. This eligibility screening includes a question confirming that the patient (or legally authorized representative) signed informed consent. T he eligibility screening also includes a question confirming that the donor (or legal guardian) signed informed consent, agrees to provide marrow, and weighs at least 20 kg. 2. After filling out the HLA Forms, the authorized user will be able to enroll the patient on Segment A using the Segment A Enrollment Form. The patient is not offic ially enrolled on study and may not begin study treatment until they are enrolled on Segment A. 3. A visit schedule based on transplant date is displayed for printing and is refe rred to as “Segment A Follow -up”. 4.2 Study Monitoring 4.2.1 Follow -up Schedule The follow -up schedule for study visits is outlined in Table 4.2.1.

Forms that are not entered into AdvantageEDCTM within the specified time will be considered delinquent. A missing form will continue to be requested either until the form is entered into AdvantageEDC TM and integrated into the Data Coordinating Center’s (DCC) master database, or until an exception is granted and entered into the Missing Form Exception File, as detailed in the Forms Guide . Reporting Patient Deaths: Recipient death information must be entered into AdvantageEDC TM within 24 business hours of knowledge of the patient’s death. If the cause of death is unknown at that time, it does not need to be recorded at that time. However, once the cause of death is determined, the Death F orm mus t be updated in AdvantageEDC TM. CIBMTR Data Reporting: Centers participating in BMT CTN trials must register pre - and post-transplant outcomes on all consecutive hematopoietic stem cell transplants done at their institution during their time of participation to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). Registration is done using procedures and forms of the Stem Cell Transplant Outcomes Database (SCTOD). (Note: Federal legislation requires submission of these fo rms for all US allotransplant recipients.) Enrollment on BMT CTN #1502 must be indicated on the SCTOD pre -transplant registration form. Additionally, CIBMTR pre - and post - transplant Report Forms must also be submitted for all patients enrolled on this tr ial. CIBMTR forms will be submitted directly to the CIBMTR at the times specified on the Form Submission Schedule. Patients not undergoing HCT are not required to have their information reported to the CIBMTR. Weekly GVHD Monitoring : GVHD should be monitored in accordance with BMT CTN guidelines as specified in the Manual of Procedures. Patients should be assessed weekly until Day + 100 post -transplant for GVHD. After Day +100, patients will be assessed at each follow - up visit through 12 months for the presence of GVHD. For scheduling, a target day range has been provided in Table 4.2.1. 4.2.3 Adverse Event Reporting 4.2.3.1 Definitions Adverse Event : An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. Expectedness : An adverse event can be Expected or Unexpected • Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered"
29,page_29,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NCT02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 4-3 expected when it appears in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. • Unexpected adverse events are those that vary in nature, intensity or frequency from information in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert, or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. Serious Adverse Event: A serious adverse event (SAE), as defined by per 21 CFR 312.32, is any adverse event that results in one of the following outcom es, regardless of causality and expectedness: • Results in death • Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. • Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (i.e., the event required at least a 24 - hour hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the expected length of stay). Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. • Is a congeni tal anomaly or birth defect; or • Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medica l events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientif ic judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expected reporting is also appropriate in situations other than those listed above. For example, important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product is considered a Serious Adverse Event). Any event is considered a Serious Adverse Event if it is associated with clinical signs or symptoms judged by the investigator to have a significant clinical impact. 4.2.3.2 Required Adverse Event Reporting Adverse event reporting will be consistent with BMT CTN procedures (BMT CTN Admin istrative Manual of Procedures, Chapter 6). It is BMT CTN policy that AEs must be reported even if the investigator is unsure whether a relationship exists between the adverse event and the use of study treatment. Unexpected, serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported through an expedited AE reporting system via AdvantageEDC. Unexpected, life -"
30,page_30,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NCT02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 4-4 threatening and fatal SAEs must be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. All other unexpected SAEs must be reported within three business days of knowledge of the event. Events entered in AdvantageEDC will be reported using NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. Expected AEs will be reported using NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Versi on 4.0 at regular intervals as defined on the Form Submission Schedule. Any expected life -threatening SAE not collected on another study form must be reported through the expedited AE reporting system via AdvantageEDC. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will receive summary reports of all unexpected SAEs on a semi -annual basis. 4.2.4 Patient Evaluations Table 4.2.4 summarizes patient clinical assessments over the course of the study. 4.2.4.1 Pre-transplant evaluations The following observations must be performed within 30 days prior to enrollment (unless noted otherwise): 1.

The target enrollment is to get 30 transplanted patients . 5.1.1 Accrual It is estimated that 36 months of accrual will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size. 5.1.2 Primary Endpoint The primary objective is to assess overall survival probability at one year post -transplant . Death from any cause is the event for this endpoint. The time to eve nt is time from transplant to death or last follow -up, whichever occurs first. 5.2 Sample Size Calculations The sample size for this study is 30 patients. Overall survival probability will be estimated. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals were calculated for varying probabilities based on a sample size of 30. Table 5.2 provides confidence intervals for a variety of underlying proportions. Of particular interest is where the OS probability is 75%, which is our targeted one - year survival probability. For this setting, the confidence interval length is 31% with the lower limit of 59.5%, which is above previ ous estimates . As presented in the background, CIBMTR one year survival of patients using haplo was 63%, very close to the 59.5% 95% confidence interval if the OS probability is 75% . If we achieve survival > 75%, we will have high confidence (p = 0.05 ) that outcomes have improved compared to this historical control. The percentages above and below 75% are meant to represent other plausible survival rates.

Patients will be monitored for key safety endpoints including graft failure and mortality. Graft failure will be monitored including both primary graft failure and secondary graft failure. Primary g raft failure will be determined by D ay 56 post -transplant in all patients receiving a transplant. Secondary graft failure will be determined by Day 56 post -transplant in all patients achieving the initial engraftment. Mortality will be monitored up to 115 days from the first day of preparative regimen ( Day - 9) in all patients re ceiving the first dose of ATG. The rationale for monitoring mortality from the first day of ATG preparation in all patients receiving the first dose of ATG is to guard against excessive early mortality including death due to the intervention in patients who never proceed to transplant , although this event is expected to be extremely uncommon. The monitoring period for mortality is set to 115 days from the first day of ATG preparation to ensure that thi s time point aligns with the Day- 100 post -transplant evaluation for patients receiving a transplant. Graft failure and mortality will be monitored so that if rates significantly exceed pre -set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can be advised. Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures. The pausing guidelines serve as a trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review and are not formal “stopping rules” that would manda te automatic closure of study enrollment. A truncated Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) based on a binomial test of proportions will be used to monitor each safety endpoint as described below. This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error across all of the monitoring looks for e ach endpoint, but not across endpoints. The SPRT can be represented graphically. At each interim analysis, the number of patients evaluable for the endpoint is plotted against the total number of patients who have experienced the event. The continuation region of the SPRT is defined by two parallel lines. Only the upper boundary will be used for monitoring to protect against excessive graft failure or mortality. If the graph falls above the upper boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that graft failure or mortality is higher than predicted by the number of patients on study. Otherwise, the SPRT continues until enrollment re aches the target goal. The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities α and β of rejecting H 0 when θ = θ 0 and of accepting H 1 when θ = θ 1, respectively, and the expected sample size E(N|θi). Note that since the test uses only the upper boundary, and is truncated by a finite sample size, the size of the test will be slightly lower than the nominal level. 5.3.1 Graft Failure by Day 56 Post Transplant Graft failure will be monitored up to D ay 56 post -transplant in all patients who proceed to transplant. Events for this safety endpoint include both primary graft failure and secondary graft failure. The safety boundary for graft failure was developed from an SPRT contrasting 15% versus 35% graft fa ilure by Day 56 post -transplant, with nominal type I and II errors of 10% and 14%, respectively. The slope of the line for monitoring excessive graft failure is 0.240 and the intercept is 1.929. The stopping rule is summarized in Table 5.3.1A."

The SPRT rejects the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative 7% of the time when the true Day -56 rejection rate is 15%, and 80% of the time when the true Day -56 rejection rate is 35%. This corresponds to a type I error rate α = 0.07 and a type II error rate β = 0.20. When the true Day- 56 rejection rate is 35%, on average, the DSMB will be consulted 21 months after opening, when 6 events have been observed in 17 patients . Note that the SPRT procedure is adequately powered to distinguish between a rejection rate of 15% and 35%. 5.3.2 Mortality by Day 115 Post ATG Preparation Mortality will be monitored up to 115 days from the first day of ATG preparation (~100 days post-transplant for patients receiving a transplant). Mortality will be monitored in all patients receiving the first dose of ATG. The safety boundary for mortality was developed from an SPRT contrasting 10% versus 30% mortality rate , with nominal type I and type II errors of 8 % and 15%, respectively. The slope of the line for monitoring excessive mortality is 0.186 and the intercept is 1.751. The stopping rule is summarized in Table 5.3.2A.

Introduction We invite you to join this clinical trial, also known as a research study. You’re being asked to join because you:  Have a diagnosis of s evere a plastic anemia (SAA) , and  Your SAA can be treated with an allogeneic transplant. You don’t have a completely matched related or unrelated donor , but you do have a half-matched family (haploidentical ) bone marrow donor"
43,page_43,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NTC02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 B-2 This study will take at least 3 years and will include 30 participants. Your participation will last for 1 year after your transplant. This Consent Form will tell you about the purpose of the study, the possible risks and benefits, other options available to you, and your rights as a participant in the study. Everyone who takes part in research at [insert facility name] should know that:  Being in any research study is voluntary.  You may or may not benefit from being in the study. Knowledge we gain from this study may benefit others.  If you join the study, you can quit the study at any time.  If you decide to quit the study, it will not a ffect your care at [ insert name of facility or institution ].  Please ask the study staff questions about anything that you do not understand, or if you would like to have more information.  You can ask questions now or any time during the study.  Please take the time you need to talk about the study with your doctor, study staff, and your family and friends. It is your decision to be in the study. If you decide to join, please sign and date the end of the Consent Form. You and your doctor will discuss other tr eatment choices if you do not want to participate in this study. 2. Study Background The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN), is providing staff support and money for this re search study. The BMT CTN and the NIH will make decisions together about how to manage the study. An allogeneic transplant uses blood- making cells from a related donor (family member) or an unrelated donor (not a family member) to replace your diseased bl ood cells. Before your transplant, you will get chemotherapy with radiation to destroy the diseased cells. After chemotherapy, the healthy cells from your donor are given to you. The new cells go into your bloodstream through an intravenous (IV) catheter (or tube). It’s just like getting blood or medicine through an IV. The donor cells find their way into your marrow where most often they grow and start to make healthy new red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. For this study, the cells used for your transplant will come from b one marrow (related donor) , which is soft, spongy tissue inside of bones. The bone marrow will come from a half -matched (haploidentical) family member such as a sister, brother, child or parent. This means that you and"
44,page_44,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NTC02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 B-3 the donor have one set of genes (out of two possible) that are the same, or are half -matched. This is called a haploidentical transplant . ‘Haplo’ means half. 3. Study Purpose We invite you to take part in this study because you have s evere aplastic a nemia (SAA) and an allogeneic transplant is a treatment option for you. We’re doing this study to learn how well SAA patients do with transplants that use haploidentical bone marrow. 4. Rights to Ask Questions and/or Withdraw You have the right to ask questions about the study at any time. If you have questions about your rights as a participant or if you want to leave the study, please contact: [insert contact info] Being in this study is voluntary. You can choose not to be in this study or leave this study at any time. If you choose not to take part or leave this study, it will not affect your regular medical care in any way. Your study doctor and study staff will be available to answer any questions that you may have about taking part in or leaving this study. 5. Study Treatment and Tests If you join the s tudy, we will check your health before you start treatment, while you receive treatment, and for 1 year after your transplant. Before Your Treatment You will need to have several check -ups and tests to see if you can be in the study. These check - ups and tests are part of your regular care. They would be done even if you were not part of this study. These tests include:  Medical history  Physical exam, height, and weight  Blood and urine tests  Heart function tests  Lung (pulmonary) function tests; for children, pulse oximetry test to measure how much oxygen is in your blood.  Bone marrow tests. These tests are called aspirates or biopsies. Samples of your marrow will be taken from your hip bone with a large needle.  A pregnancy test if you are a woman and able to have children (if you are pregnant, you will not be able to join this study)."
45,page_45,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NCT02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 B-4 During Your Treatment If the check -ups and tests show that you can be in the study, you’ll get a bone marrow transplant from a h alf-matched (haplo -identical) family member. Before Your Transplant : The conditioning regimen is the combination of chemotherapy drugs (chemo) and radiation you’ll receive before you get your donor cells. This helps the donor cells start to grow and make new cells in your bone marrow (engraft). A common side effect of allogeneic transplant is Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD). It’s a medical condition that can be very serious (see Risks and Toxicities Related to Transplant under Section 6: Risks and Discomf ort). GVHD happens because of differences in your immune cells (host) and your donor’s immune cells (graft). The donor cells might see your cells as foreign and attack them, causing GVHD to happen. Your doctor will give you drugs to help prevent GVHD fro m happening. Your doctor will use the following drugs and radiation to prepare your body for transplant:  Thymoglobulin ®, also known as anti -thymocyte globulin, rabbit ATG and rATG (helps the donor cells engraft in your body and is also a GVHD prevention drug)  Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide (chemotherapy drugs)  Total body irradiation, TBI (radiation therapy given to the whole body to help weaken your immune system and prevent rejection of transplanted stem cells) The schedule of drugs you will receive to prepare your body for transplant is as follows:  We’ll give you Thymoglobulin® each day for 3 days, starting 9 days before your transplant (Day - 9 through Day - 7).  Then we’ll give you Fludarabine each day for 5 days, starting 6 days before your transplant (Day - 6 through Day - 2).  You’ll also get Cyclophosphamide for 2 days, starting 6 days before your transplant (Day -6 and Day -5).  Last, you’ll get a low dose of TBI the day before your transplant (Day - 1). After your transplant, you’ll also get drugs to help prevent GVHD:  You’ll get Cyclophosphamide for 2 days, sta rting 3 days after your transplant (Day +3 and Day +4). Your doctor will give you this drug in your vein (IV).  We’ll give you Tacrolimus daily starting 5 days after your transplant (Day +5). Your doctor will either give you this drug in your vein (IV) or you will take a pill."
46,page_46,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NCT02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 B-5  Then we’ll give you Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) daily starting 5 days after your transplant (Day +5). Your doctor will either give you this drug in your vein (IV) or you will take a pill.  You will continue to take Tacrolimus (or a s imilar drug called Cyclosporine) for about 6 to 12 months, and MMF for about 5 weeks after your transplant or until there are no signs of GVHD. After your transplant, you will also get drugs to help speed up the recovery of white blood cells.  We’ll give y ou Filgrastim (G-CSF) through your catheter or by injection under your skin 5 days after your transplant (Day +5). You’ll get Filgrastim every day until your blood counts are at a safe level and then continue for three additional days before stopping. See Table 1 below for a schedul e of when you’ll get these drugs . Table 1: Schedule of Drugs Drugs Days -9 to -7 Days -6 to - 2 Days -6 & - 5 Day -1 Day 0 (Transplant day) Days +3 & +4 Days +5 to +180 Days +5 to +35 Days +5 to +7 or more Thymoglobulin (ATG) X Fludarabine X Cyclophosphamide X Total body irradiation (TBI) X Transplant day (infusion of bone marrow) X Cyclophosphamide X Tacrolimus or cyclosporine X Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) X"
47,page_47,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NCT02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 B-6 Filgrastim X Your Transplant: On your transplant day (Day 0), the donor cells from your haploidentical family member will be given to you through your catheter just like a blood transfusion. The cells will travel to your bone marrow where they will start to make new, healthy blood cell s. Health Evaluations: We will test (evaluate) your health during the study. These tests and how often they are scheduled are standard care for patients receiving an allogeneic transplant. They would be done even if you were not part of this study. You wil l be watched closely for any signs and symptoms of GVHD. After Your Treatment Health Evaluations after Transplant:  Routine blood tests (cell counts and liver and kidney function) two or three times per week until Day 28, then weekly until Day 100, and then at Days 180 and 365.  One of s ix protocol -required 5 mL (~1 teaspoon) blood samples from a vein in your arm on Day 7 ( 4 of the other protocol -required samples will be taken pre -transplant on the days you receive ATG and 1 will be taken on the day of your transplant ).  Blood tests to see how well your immune system is working at Day 100, 180, and 365.  Blood tests to find the amount of donor cells in your body on Days 28, 56, 100, 180, and 365. This is called chimerism .  Blood tests to find out if you have any infections weekly until Day 100.  Physical exam to look for toxicities on Days 28, 56, 100, 180, and 365.  Physical exam to look for GVHD weekly until Day 100 and then at Days 180 and 365.  Health -Related Quality of Life Questionnaires: If you speak English and are 8 years of age or older or if you speak Spanish and are 19 years of age or older , you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your quality of life before your transplant and then at Day 100, Day 180, and Day 365. 6. Risks and Discomfo rts You will have side effects while on the study. Side effects can range from mild to very serious. The risks listed in this section might happen from transplant. These risks might happen if you have a transplant as part of this study or as standard care. Your doctor will give you drugs to help lower the side effects, such as feeling sick to your stomach (nausea). In some cases, side effects"
48,page_48,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NCT02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 B-7 can be long lasting or may never go away. The chemotherapy drugs can cause leukemia years later, but this is rare. These “s econdary cancers” are often very hard to treat and can cause death. Risks and Toxicities Related to Transplant : The following problems may happen because of your transplant. These risks may happen if a transplant was done as part of the study or not. The risks are: Death due to infection or transplant complications: Patients undergoing transplant for severe aplastic anemia are at risk of fatal complications due to several complications listed below (infection, organ damage, graft versus host disease, etc.). Although approaches to haploidentical transplant included in this study may improve outcomes, in past studies, as many as 20- 40% of patients have had fatal complications using th is stem cell source. Slow recovery of blood counts: The red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets can be slow to recover after a bone marrow transplant. Until your blood counts recover, you will need blood and platelet transfusions and you will be at risk for bleeding and infections. You’ll receive Filgrastim to speed the recovery of the white cells as much as possible. Graft failure: The stem cells (the “graft”) may fail to grow inside your body. Past experience suggests that there can be up to a 10 - 15% chance of graft failure. If graft failure occurs, you could have low blood counts for a long period of time. If your counts don’t recover, you may need to receive a second transplant. Graft failure can be fatal. Graft -Versus -Host Disease (GVHD): GVHD happens when the donor cells recognize your body as foreign and attack it. In most cases, GVHD can be successfully treated. Sometimes GVHD is severe or difficult to treat and may lead to death. You will be watched closely for this complication and given drugs to prevent and/or treat it. Acute GVHD, which can happen 0 – 3 months after transplant, may produce skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormalities of liver function, and an increased risk of infection. Chronic GVHD, which ca n happen 3 months or later after transplant, may produce skin rashes, hair loss, thickened dry skin, dry eyes, dry mouth, liver disease, weight loss, diarrhea, and an increased risk of infection. To confirm the diagnosis of acute or chronic GVHD, you may be asked to have a biopsy (a small sample of your tissue to look at under the microscope) of your skin, gut, or, rarely, your liver. Damage to the vital organs in your body: The transplant could cause problems in any body organ such as the heart, lungs, l iver, gut, kidneys , bladder, or brain. The kidneys and the liver are most likely to be damaged. Some patients will experience serious lung problems from infections or the chemotherapy and radiation. Serious infections: Full and complete recovery of your i mmune system may take many months. During this time, there is an increased risk of infections. You will be prescribed certain drugs to reduce the chance of those infections. However, these treatments do not always work. If you have an infection, you may ha ve to stay in the hospital longer or be re -hospitalized after transplant."
49,page_49,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NCT02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 B-8 Although most infections can be successfully treated, some infections may result in death. Recurrence of disease or a new blood cancer: Your severe aplastic anemia may come back even if the transplant is successful at first. In rare cases, a new blood cancer may develop from the donor cells. Cyclophosphamide can cause damage to blood cells, which may result in a blood cancer such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The se blood cancer s usually develop 2 - 10 years after treatment, or 6 years on average. The risk of developing a new blood cancer after allogeneic transplant is probably less than 2%. If cancer develops in your blood cells, you may require additional treatment with chemotherapy or another blood or marrow transplant. Risk to the unborn: The treatments in this study have not been proven to be safe at any stage of pregnancy. Therefore, if you are pregnant or nursing, you are not eligible for this study. Women who can become pregnant must use effective birth control while receiving chemotherapy, TBI, and drugs to prevent GVHD, and for 1 year after transplant. Effective birth control is defined as the following: 1. Refraining from all acts of vaginal sex (abstinence) 2. Consistent use of birth control pills 3. Injectable birth control methods (Depo- Provera, Norplant) 4. Tubal sterilization or male partner who has undergone a vasectomy 5. Placement of an IUD (intrauterine device) 6. Use of a d iaphragm with contraceptive jelly and/or condoms with contraceptive foam every time you have sex. Reproductive Risks: The drugs used in thi s research study may damage your reproductive organs, affect your ability to have children, or possibly cause birth defects if you take them while you are pregnant. It is important that a woman is not pregnant or breast -feeding and does not become pregnant during the course of the study. Women may also want to talk to their doctors about freezing eggs prior to tra nsplant.  If you are a woman and can become pregnant : You will need to take a pregnancy test before you start the study. You should discuss ways to prevent pregnancy while you are in the study. Women who have gone through puberty may find that their menstr ual cycle becomes irregular or stops permanently. This does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. You must still use an effective method of birth control during your transplant and continue until 1 year after transplant . Additional Information about M MF: o MMF could be damaging to an unborn baby if you are pregnant or become pregnant"
50,page_50,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NCT02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 B-9 while receiving the drug. o MMF can make birth control pills less effective and increase your chances of becoming pregnant while you are taking it. o If you can become pregnant , you must use 2 effective forms of birth control for 4 weeks before starting MMF, during treatment, and for 6 weeks after stopping MMF. o In this study, you will be assigned to receive MMF for about 5 weeks, so you should not become pregnant during that tim e. If you think you might become pregnant or could become pregnant during the upcoming 5 weeks, you should not join the study.  If you are a man : Your body may not be able to produce sperm (become sterile). You should talk with your doctor about banking your sperm before having a transplant. You must still use an effective method of birth control during your transplant and continue until 1 year after transplant . Please check with your doctor to understand more about these risks. Unforeseen Risks : New risks might appear at any time during the study. These risks might be different from what is listed in this Consent Form. We will promptly tell you about new information that may affect your decision to take part in the study. We may learn new things about these types of transplants that might make you want to stop being in the study. We will let you know if this happens and you can decide if you want to continue in the study. Other Treatments or Medications : Some medicines react with each other, and i t is important that you tell the study doctor or staff about any other drugs, treatments, or medicines you are taking. This includes over -the-counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal treatments. It is also important that you tell the study staff about any cha nges to these medications during your participation in the study. For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor."

OPTIONAL Blood Samples for Trial -Related and Future Research Studies This section of the Consent Form is about collection of optional blood samples for trial - specific and future research studies from people who are taking part in the study. You can choose to give blood samples for optional trial- specific and future research studies if you want to. You can still be a part of the main study even if you say “no” to giving optional blood samples for these studies. Please mark your choice at the end of this section. Researchers are trying to learn more about how the human body processes the drugs used for transplant and how the body recovers after transplant. This research is meant to gain knowledge that may help people in the future and make transplants even more successful. If you agree to provide optional blood samples, here is what will happen:  We’ll take 24 mL (about 5 teaspoons) from your catheter or by a vein in your arm if you are an adult , or 12 mL (about 2.5 teaspoons) if you’re a child (< 20kg). We’ll collect this sample when you have your 1 st check -up, before treatment starts. o This blood sample will be shipped on the day of collection to a qualified research laboratory that is partnering with the clinical trial team physicians for an important study related to this trial. This study wants to look at your telomeres, which are caps at the end of DNA strands to protect them. DNA is in your blood, so we can study telomeres using blood samples.  At the same time, we will collect one additional 3 mL (about ⅔ teaspoon) blood sample. o This blood sample will be sent to the BMT CTN Bioreposi tory for processing and storage for future genomic research studies. A repository is a place that protects, stores, and sends out samples for approved research studies. All research samples will be given a bar code that cannot be linked to you by future re searchers testing your samples. A link to this code does exist. The link is stored at the Data and Coordinating Center for the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN DCC). The staff at the Repository where your sample is being stored does not have a link to this code. Your research samples will continue to be stored at the BMT CTN Repository until they are used up for approved research. o These samples will be kept and may be used in research to learn more about immune recovery, GVHD, s evere aplastic anemia, cancer, and other diseases. When the samples are given to investigators for research, no information about your name, address, phone number, or other information that will let the researchers know who you are will be provided. o DNA fr om your stored blood samples and your health information might be used in genome -wide association (GWA) studies for a future project either done or supported"
61,page_61,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NCT02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 B-20 by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Genome -wide association studies are a way for scientis ts to find genes that have a role in human disease or treatment. Each study can look at hundreds of thousands of genetic changes at the same time. o If your coded samples are used in such a study, the researchers are required to add your test results and sam ple information into a public research database. This public database is called the NIH Genotype and Phenotype Database and it is managed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The NCBI will never have any information that would identify you, or link you to your information or research samples. However, the results of genetic studies could, in theory, include identifying information about you. Your name and other information that could directly identify you (such as address or social security number) will not be placed into any scientific database. However, because your genetic information is unique to you, there is a small chance that someone could trace it back to you. The risk of this happening is small, but may grow in the future. Researchers have a duty to protect your privacy and to keep your information confidential . Benefits The research that may be done with your blood samples is not designed specifically to help you. The benefits of research using blood samples include learning more about what causes GVHD, severe aplastic anemia, cancer, and other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them. Risks There is a small risk of an infection or fainting from the blood draw. A possible risk is the loss of confidentiality about your medical information. We will do our best to make sure that your personal information is kept private. The chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small. Some general thin gs to think about when letting us store your blood samples for research are:  The choice to let us collect and/or store blood samples for future research is up to you. No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care.  If you decide now that your blood samples can be collected and stored for research, you can change your mind at any time. Just contact your study doctor in writing and let him or her know that you do not want us to continue storing your blood samples. His/her mailing address is on the first page of this form. Then any unused blood samples that remain will no longer be stored for research. However, samples and information that have already been shared with researchers cannot be taken back or destroyed.  In the future, people who do research on these blood samples may need to know more about your health. While the study doctor or others involved in running this study may give the"

Sometimes blood is used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families). Even if your blood is used for this kind of research, you will not be told of the results and the results will not be put in your health records.  Your blood will be used only for research and will not be sold. The research done with your blood may help to develop new products in the future. You will not get paid for any samples or for any products that may be developed from current or future research.  Reports about research done with your blood will not be given to you or your doctor. These reports will not be put in your health record. The research will not have an effect on your care. Genetic Info rmation Nondiscrimination Act A new federal law (2009) called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we get from this research. This means that they must not use your genetic information when making decisions about your insurance. Be aware that this new federal law will not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long- term care insurance. Making Your Choice Please read each sentence below and think about your choice. After reading each sentence, please indicate your choice below. If you have any questions, please talk to your doctor or nurse, or call our research review board at [telephone number] . No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care . You can change your mind at any time about allowing us to use your samples and health information for research. However, samples and information that have already been shared with researchers cannot be taken back or destroyed."

We invite you to join this research study because you need a transplant to treat your severe aplastic anemia. We will replace your unhealth y blood cells with blood cells from one of your family members. The new cells will travel to your bones and start making healthy cells in your body. For this study, we will ask you for information about your health (health information) and for extra blood samples.  Why are you doing this study? We’re doing this study to learn how well patients with severe aplastic anemia do with transplants that use haploidentical bone marrow.  What will happen to me if I join the study? If you say you want to be in the study, we will:  Before your transplant: o Give you drugs to help your body get ready for the transplant. The drugs might make you feel sick. Your doctor will watch your health closely. o We will collect extra blood (about 1 teaspoon) 4 times before your transplant and 1 time on the day of your transplant . We will use a small needle to collect the blood from a vein in your arm, unless you have a central line in which case the samples will be collected through that central line. We will try to collect the extra samples at the same time as you have oth er blood tests done.  After your transplant: o We will collect extra blood (about 1 teaspoon) one week after your transplant. o We will also give you drugs to help your body adjust to the new cells. The drugs might make you feel sick. Your doctor will keep wa tching your health after your transplant. You will be in the study for 1 year after your transplant. About 30 people will be in the study."

Your study doctor and study staff will be available to answer any questions that you may have. 4. Study Treatments and Tests If you agr ee to give blood samples , here is what will happen: a.) We will collect an extra blood sample at the same time you have routine blood tests done. For adults and children who weigh 44 pounds (20kg) or more :  We will collect 4 extra blood sample s at one time prior to your donation to look at your telomeres. The amount of blood collected from you will be about 24 mL (about 5 teaspoons ). For children who weigh less than 44 pounds (20 kg) :  We will collect 2 extra blood sample s at one time prior to your donation to look at your telomeres. The amount of blood collected from you will be 12 mL ( about 2.5 teaspoons ). b.) The blood samples will be sent to the Johns Hopkins l aborator y for processing and storage. All samples will be given a unique bar code that cannot be linked to you by researchers testing your samples. 5. Risks and Discomforts There are no major risks to having your blood drawn. It can be uncomfortable to have your blood taken and it can sometimes leave a bruise. You might faint, but this is unlikely to happen. Only trained people will take your blood. Information about the bo ne marrow donation process for this study can be found in a separate consent form. The transplant doctor or study coordinator will give you a copy of the donation consent form."

Study patients and consenting haplo- donors will also be provided the opportunity to participate in an optional correlative study. And finally, an optional opportunity will be offered to study patients to provide a single sample to be stored and used for future research. 1) REQUIRED: Thymoglobulin® Pharmacokinetics (PK) The objective of the first lab correlate to the clinical trial will be to collect PK samples for Thymoglobulin ® and to determine pre - and post -HSCT exposure levels (area under the curve, AUC) in all patient s. These exposure levels will then be correlated with clinically relevant metrics, including engraftment, rejection, GVHD, immune reconstitution, and survival. The PK assessment of Thymoglobulin ® will be performed at UMC Utrecht in the laboratory of Jaap Jan Boelens and Rick Admiraal. Thymoglobulin® concentrations will be determined from plasma samples. 5 mL of blood for PK samples will be collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube at 6 time points: 1.) Upon completion of first dose infusion (within 60 minutes) With this draw, the start and end of the first Thymoglobulin ® infusion (d- m-y hh:mm) and the timing of the sample (d-m-y hh:mm) must be documented 2.) Prior to infusion of second dose (within 60 minutes) With this draw, the timing of the sample (d -m-y hh:mm) must be documented 3.) Upon completion of second dose infusion (within 60 minutes) With this draw, the start and end of the second Thymoglobulin® infusion (d -m-y hh:mm) and the timing of the sample (d -m-y hh:mm) must be documented 4.) Upon completion of thi rd dose infusion (within 60 minutes) With this draw, the start and end of the second Thymoglobulin infusion (d- m-y hh:mm) and the timing of the sample (d -m-y hh:mm) must be documented 5.) On day 0 (any time prior to stem cell infusion) CBC including absolute lymphocyte count should be collected on Day 0 (if possible) along with the PK sample and results documented in AdvantageEDC ; the timing of the sample (d -m-y hh:mm) should also be documented 6.) On day 7 (no time restrictions) With this draw, the timing of the sample (d -m-y hh:mm) must be documented All blood samples should be placed on ice after collection and promptly taken for processing into"

Samples should be maintained cold while handling and final samples should be frozen. Please see the protocol -specific Research Sample Information Guide for detailed processing, aliquot labeling, and frozen sample shipping procedures. Frozen samples will be batch -shipped on a biannual basis to the BMT CTN Bior epository managed by the NMDP. Once the trial is complete and all PK samples obtained, they will then be transported together to UMC Utrecht for laboratory analysis. 2) OPTIONAL: Telomere Length Analysis The objective of the seco nd lab correlate to the clinical trial will be to collect whole blood samples from consenting patient s and each available consenting donor to measure leukocyte telomere length. The telomere lengths will then be correlated with clinically relevant metrics, including disease phenotype, engraftment , and survival for research purposes. The telomere length will be measured by a CLIA -certified flow cytometry and FISH assay (Baerlocher Nature Protocols 2006) that is operated within the Johns Hopkins Pathology Laboratories (Armanios). Subpopulations of leukocytes will include granulocytes and lymphocytes. The blood required from the patient (pre -HSCT conditioning) and donor (pre -donation) at a single time point will include: Adults: 4 EDTA purple tops (6cc mL, 24cc total) This will ensure yields for leukopenic patien ts esp ecially if it will be shipped on Fridays. Children less than 20kg: 2 EDTA purple tops (6cc mL , 12cc total) Please see the protocol -specific Research Sample Infor mation Guide for detailed sample labeling and same- day sample shipping procedures . The blood tubes will be shipped on the day of collection to the Johns Hopkins project laboratory by Priority Overnight FedEx courier . No additional information will be provided to the patients or their treating physicians during the trial. Clinical correlations will be made in a retrospective fashion. 3) OPTIONAL : Research Sample to Support Future Genomic Studies The objective of the optional research sample banking is to collect 3 mL of whole blood from all consenting patients pre -conditioning to support future genomic research. Blood samples will be collected and processed at the clinical sites into three 1 mL cryovial aliquots and frozen. Please see the pr otocol -specific Research Sample Information Guide for detailed processing, aliquot labeling, and frozen sample shipping procedures. Frozen whole blood samples will be batch - shipped on a biannual basis, along with the Thymoglobulin ® PK samples, to the BMT C TN Biorepository managed by the NMDP."

Two individuals, usuall y a physician and a nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant, perform the harvest, one on each posterior iliac crest. The bone marrow cavity is entered through a skin puncture, after sterile prepping and draping. The posterior superior iliac spine is us ed as a starting anatomic landmark for the procedure. Larg e bore needles attached to 50 mL syringes rinsed with a heparinized solution are used for aspirating the marrow using a quick, vigorous suctioning technique. No more than 3- 5 mL of a blood- bone marr ow mixture should be withdraw n from a single aspirate, since aspirating more will dilute the marrow cells with peripheral blood. After 3- 5 mL are aspirated, additional aspirates can by withdrawn from the same marrow puncture as long as the needle position is repositioned, i.e., withdrawing the needle 0.5 cm while changing the position of the bevel by 90 o. Generally, 10- 30 punctures into the marrow are made through a single skin puncture. Limiting any one skin puncture to 10- 30 marrow punctures will also limit blood contamination as a result of local area bleeding. Thereafter, 2 -3 additional skin punctures are made on each side of the iliac crest, each one several centimeters lateral to the previous, proceeding as far as necessary toward the anterior superior iliac spine to acquire sufficient marrow. The usual marrow harvest target for transplantation is 4 x 10 8 nucleated marrow cells per kg of the transplant recipient’s ideal weight, so that the volume collected (generally between 500 and 1500 m L) will vary o n the size of the recipient and the marrow cell concentration ( see below). The aspirated marrow is collected into semi- closed or closed system of filters and a bag containing anticoagulant (Fenwall, BioAcess). The collection is based on the target number of cells specified for the recipient. The nucleated cell/mL should be assessed during the procedure with a cell count that is called back to the operating room. Calculation of the total volume needed to achieve the target dose should then be used to clinically determine the final harvest volumes. Erring on the high end is pref erred to underestimating doses. Equations used to calculate are as follows: 1. Prior to the procedure, determine the weight of the collection bag or tare the scale. The weight of the product (total weight minus bag or weight above the tared wei ght) is then divided by 1.058, the specific gravity of marrow. This result (A) is the volume of the marrow. 2. The marrow nucleated cell count (B) is determined by the nucleated cel l count from the lab in cells/mL corrected by subtracting the number of perip heral blood white cells/mL presumed to be contaminating the marrow, and is then multiplied by the volume (A) to calculate the total nucleated cells: A x B = TNC. (Example: if marrow count is 27 and peripheral white cell count is 6, then the marrow mononuclear cell counts would be 21 = B) 3. TNC should then be divided by ideal body weight to determine TNC/kg achieved (target 4 x 10 8 nucleated cells/kg recipient ideal body weight)."

100,page_100,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK NCT02918292 Optimizing Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502 Version 4.0 – January 13, 2020 APPENDIX H : GUIDANCE FOR MIXED CHIMERISM Chimerism measurements should be assessed as per protocol requirements (Table 4.2.4). Primary and secondary graft failure are also defined (Section 3.2.3 and 4.2.4.2). There will be patients who meet cr iteria for mixed chimerism post- transplant who require special attention. Any donor chimerism below 99% in the myeloid or the T cell compartment should be considered mixed chimerism. Less than 50% donor CD3 chimerism in the early post -transplant period has correlated in malignant diseases with increased risk of graft loss or rejection. In aplastic anemia, a graft is considered functional if it results in correction of the underlying marrow failure with increase neutrophils and/or transfusion independence from baseline, even in the setting of mixed chimerism. Low early T -cell chimerism could be a harbinger of rejectio n or may improve spontaneously over time. Recommendations to avoid, and if it occurs , treat mixed chimer ism: 1. Optimize all possible cell counts in the donor harvest to achieve at lea st a goal of 3 x 10 8 mononuclear cells/kg recipient weight. 2. Ensure optimal compliance with all post- transplant immunosuppression. a. Mycophenolate mofetil should be given intravenously in patients in whom the oral preparation is not well tolerated b. Monitor levels of tacrolimus (as often as daily) to ensure therapeutic troughs of 10-15ng/mL. 3. If post -Day 28, Day 56, or Day 100 chimerism is low, increase frequency of monitoring per protocol (table 4.2.4) , with monthly chimerisms until stable or resolved. 4. Do not stop immunosuppression. Consider increasing levels to upper end of goa l range for tacrolimus or CSP. 5. Do not give DLI for chimerism. For patients with poor graft function and established donor chimerism, CD34+ selected cell boosts can be considered. 6. Rule out additional immune phenomenon such a s large granular lymphocytosis. 7. Rule out contribution of infections or their treatments ( e.g. valganciclovir for CMV, other treatments for EBV, HHV6, etc.). 8. Continue close clinical follow up. 9. Notify protocol chairs or medical monitor with questions or concerns."
