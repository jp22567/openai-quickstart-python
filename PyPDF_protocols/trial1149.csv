For all subjects in the Treatment Phase, sparse PK blood sample s will be collected at all visits while on treatment .The PK of SOF, its primary metabolite GS-331007 , and VEL will be assessed. Statistical Methods: For the PK Lead -in, the primary plasma PK parameters are AUC tau, for SOF, GS -331007, and VEL . All PK parameters will be summarized by cohort. The effect of age and SOF/VEL FDC dose on PK will be explored. For the Treatment Phase, the p rimary safet y endpoint is review of any AEs with a focus on AEs that lead to discontinuation of study drug. The key efficacy endpoint is SVR12 in all enrolled and treated subjects . The p oint estimate of the SVR12 rate and the 2- sided 95% exact confidence i nterval based on the Clopper -Pearson method will be provided. The s econdary efficacy endpoints include SVR4 and SVR24. Clinically relevant subgroup anal yses on SVR12 may be conducted as appropriate (ie, assuming that adequate numbers of patients in these subsets are available for anal ysis)."

Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is responsible for a large proportion of chronic liver disease worldwide and accounts for 70% of cases of chronic hepatitis in industrialized countries. The global prevalence of chronic hepatitis C is estimated to average 3% {Esteban 2008 }. The estimated prevalence of HCV infection in children is up to 0.4% in Europe and the United States (US) and up to 6% in resource -limited countries {El -Shabrawi 2013 , Khaderi 2014}. In addition, in an internal anal ysis using administrative claims data and data from an epidemiology database, Gilead Sciences, Inc .(Gilead) estimated that there are app roximately 7000 cases of HCV infection in the US among those 16 years of age or y ounger. Globall y, there are estimated to be 6.6 million viremic infections in those 15 y ears of age or younger {El-Sayed 2015 }. Thenatural history of chronic HCV -infection in children differ s from that in adults since HCV -infection in children is relatively benign. M ost children chronically infected with HCV are asymptomatic or have mild nonspecific s ymptoms. Clinical sy mptoms are present in approximately 20% of children in the first 4 y ears of life, with hepatomegaly being the most frequent sign (10%). Many , but not all, perinatally infected children will have intermittently or persistently abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, particularl y in the first 2 years of life . In children with vertical HCV -infection who have unde rgone liver biops y, the histological spectrum is usually mild, although severe liver disease is encountered {Mohan 2010 }. Despite the overall more favorable prognosis compared to adults, approximately 4% to 6% of chi ldren with chr onic HCV -infection have evidence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and some children eventually require liver transplantation for end -stage liver disease as a consequence of HCV -infection {Hu 2010}. The goal of HCV treatment in both pediatric and adult populations is eradication of the virus, thereb y preventing hepatic inflammation, hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure resulting in either death or need for liver transplantation. This goal, however, is limited by the nature of the disease and the fact that not all patients are suitable candidates for currently approved treatments. In addition, pediatric treatment is controversial as the current treatment options are limited and severe side effects and tolerability can significantly limit or preclude their use. Despite well-established gu idelines for the treatment of HCV in adults, there is no universal consensus on when or if to treat chronic HCV -infection in children. In 2010, the European Societ y for Paediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology , and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) issued guidance for clinical trial development for chronic HCV -infection in children and in 2012, the North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology , and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) issued a practice guideline {Mack 2012, Wirth 2010 }.In the guideline, the ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN suggested that the primary goal of treatment in children is to eradicate the infection to prevent late complications. Hence , the goal is not the treatment of an ongoing liver disease, but rather the prevention of a future one."

Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 15June 2018Pegy lated -interferon ( Peg-IFN)and weight -based ribavirin ( RBV )is currently considered the standard of care for the treatment of HCV -infection in child ren. Current recommendations are that patients with GT- 2 or GT-3 be treated with Peg-IFN+RBV for 24 weeks and those with GT-1 or GT -4 should receive 48 weeks of therap y. Successful treatment of GT -1, however, has proved very difficult to achieve in spite o f additional therap y or increased duration of treatment. A number of pediatric studies have reported that despite 48 weeks of treatment, sustained virologic response (SVR24) was observed in only 36% to 53% of subjects with GT -1, while response rates were > 80% in subjects with GT -2 or GT -3 {Wirth 2012 }.Safet y and efficacy data in pediatric patients with GT- 5 or GT- 6 are limited . Most children treated with Peg- IFN+RBV experience at least 1 adverse event due to treatment {Wirth 2012 }. Although most of these events are mild to moderate in severity , man y of them result in dose reductions of 1 or both of the drugs. The most c ommon adverse events have consisted of influenza-like illness (91%), headache (62%), and injection site reactions (45%), often leading to poor compliance and/or discontinuation from treatment. Additionally , the concern for growth and development in this age group and the role that both Peg-IFNand RBV po tentially play in reducing growth rates has initiated significant debate among pediatric hepatologists as to whether these treatments should even be considered in the pediatric population {Serranti 2011}. Man y pediatricians currentl y advocate delay of treatment past adolescence or even into adulthood when options with DAAs are possible {Serranti 2011 }. Unfortunatel y, in the 25% of pediatric patients who do meet the criteria for treatment (elevated transaminases and viral loads), the option of Peg-IFN+RBV therapy remains inadequate in regard to both efficacy and safet y due to the many risks associated with this treatment. Recently , the first direct -acting antivirals have been approved for treatment of HCV in children. Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir are indicated for use in adolescents {Harvoni 2017 , HARVONI®2017, SOVALDI®2017 }and were highl y effective and well - tolerated regimens in clinical trials {Balistreri 2017 , Wirth 2017 }. 1.2. Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir Fixed -Dose Combination Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir FDC is a coformulation of SOF 400 mg and VEL 100 mg into a single tablet for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. This fixe d-dose combination combines twounique mechanisms of action into a single tablet: Sofosbuvir, a nucleotide analog HCV NS5B pol ymerase inhibitor. Velpatasvir, an HCV NS5A inhibitor that has potent in vitro anti -HCV activity across all genot ypes. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir FDC is currentl y app roved in the US, EU and other regions for the treatment of HCV."

Study GS-US- 342-1553 This open -label, multicenter study assessed the antiviral efficacy , safet y, and tolerability of SOF/VEL FDC + RBV for 24 weeks in subjects with chronic HCV infection who have participated in prior Gilead sponsored HCV treatment studies. This study wasconducted in the US, New Zealand, and Australia. Study Design and Subject Population A total of 69 subjects were enrolled and treated. The majority of subjects were male ( 76.8%), 26.1% had cirrhosis and most subjects ( 78.3%) had baseline HCV RNA ≥ 800,000 IU/mL . Of the 69 subjects who received SOF/VEL FDC +RBV , a total of 32 subjects (46.4%) had HCV genot ype 1a, 5 subjects (7.2%) had HCV genoty pe 1b, 14 su bjects (20.3%) had HCV genot ype2, and 18 subjects (26.1%) had HCV gen otype 3. All of the subjects had been treated with a DAA regimen in a Gilead -sponsored study :40.6% (28subjects) had been treated with SOF/VEL FDC +VOX, 39.1% ( 28 subjects) had been treated with SOF/VEL FDC , and 20.3% (14 subjects) had been treated with SOF/VEL FDC +RBV. Overall, 66 subjects (95.7%) completed stud y treatment. Three subjects prematurel y discontinued study treatment: 1 subject due to an AE of irrita bility , 1 subject due to lack of efficacy , and 1 subject due to a protocol violation. Conclusions The conclusions from this study were as follows: Treatment with SOF/VEL FDC +RBV for 24 weeks in subjects who had failed prior treatment with SOF+VEL ±VOX ± R BV resulted in a high SVR12 rate (91.3%) Among subjects with genoty pe 1 HCV infection, the SVR rate was 97.3 % Among subjects with genoty pe 2 HCV infection , the SVR rate was 92.9% Among subjects with genoty pe 3 HCV infection , the SVR12 rate was 77.8%"

Vi rologic relapse in subjects with genoty pe 3 was associated with enrichment or emergence of NS5A RAVs. Treatment with SOF/VEL FDC +RBV for 24 weeks was safe and well tolerated. There was a low incidence of Grade 3 or 4 AEs, SAEs, and discontinu ations due to AEs. Most Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the known effects of RBV. 1.2.2.2.

This study wasconducted in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Study Design and Population A total of 111 subj ects were enrolled and treated. The majo rity of subjects were male (58.6%), 17.1% had c irrhosis and m ost subjects (73.0 %) had baseline HCV RNA ≥ 800,000 IU/mL .Of the 111 subjects who received SOF/VEL FDC , a total of 63 subjects (56.8%) had HCV genoty pe 1; 20 subjects (18.0%) had HCV genoty pe 2; 19 subjects (17.1%) had HCV genot ype4; 9subjects (8.1%) had HCV genot ype 6. The majority of subjects (99. 1%) completed study treatment; 1 subject (0.9%) prematurel y discontinued study treatment due to an AE. Conclusions The conclusions from this study were as follows: Treatment with SOF/VEL FDC for 12 weeks in treatment-naive and treatment - experienced subjects resulted in a high SVR12 rate (97.3%). High SVR12 rates were achieved across all HCV genoty pes and subgroups, and the overall SVR12 rate was similar to that observed in subjects who receive d SOF/VEL FDC for 12 w eeks in the parent study (Study GS-US-342- 1138 [99.0%; 618 of 624 subjects]). All subjects with pretreatment NS5A or NS5B NI RAVs achieved SVR12. Virologic relapse in a single subject with genoty pe 1a infection was associated with eme rgence of the NS5A RAV Y93H. No NS5B NI RAVs emerged at relapse . SOF/VEL FDC was generally well tolerated with low rates of Grade 3 and 4 AEs, SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs and Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities."

Mean SOF exposures were higher in adolescents as compared with adults; however, the SOF exposures in adolescents were within the range of SOF exposures shown to be safe in the adult Phase 2/3 SOF/VEL clinical program (Table 1-1). Based on preliminary safety data in 74 adolescent subjects, t reatment with SOF/VEL FDC 400/100 mg for 12 weeks was generall y safe and well tolerated. Fifty one subjects ( 69%) had an AE, and m ost AEs were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) in severit y. One subject, with a medical history of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder , had a Grade 3 SAE of exacerbated post -traumatic stress disorder , a Grade 3 SAE of suicidal ideation ,and a Grade 4 SAE of suicidal attempt; all SAEs were assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator. No subject discontinued study drug because of an AE. The most common AEs (≥ 10% ) were headache ( 18, 24 %),nausea (13, 18%) and fatigu e (9, 12%). Most of the lab abnormalities were Grade 1 or Grade 2. Six subjects had Grade 3 lab abnormalities (hemoglobin [1 subject] , hypergly cemia [1 subject], low neutrophils levels [ 2subject s], and urinaly sis positive for red blood cells [2 subjects, both females of child bearing potential with menses at the time of urinaly sis]),and no subject had Grade 4 laboratory abnorm alities.

As such, theadult dose of SOF/VEL FDC 400/100 mg is considered appropriate for use in the adolescent population (12 to <18 y ears of age), and the reduced dose of SOF/VEL FDC 200/50 mg is considered appropriate for children 6 to <12 years of age. 1.2.3. Rationale for This Study This clinical study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of treatment with SOF/VEL FDC for adolescents and children with chronic HCV infection. The population of the study will be subjects with chronic HCV infection, with 20 to 40 having fai led prior treatment. Currently Peg-IFNand weight -based RBV is considered the SOC for the treatment of HCV - infection in children. Therefore, there is a need for new treatments for HCV in the pediatric population that combine potent and sustained efficacy with improved tolerability and safet y. The primary aim for new treatments of pediatric patients with HCV is to eliminate the need to use Peg -IFNand RBV . In this way , pediatric patients would be able to avoid the necessit y of weekl y injections, which can be traumatic and burdensome, and significantl y reduce the serious adverse events seen with Peg-IFNadministration and the adverse events seen with its administratio n within HCV infected subjects. A single regimen of SOF/VEL FDC for 12 weeks resulted in SVR r ates >95% in subjects with all HCV genoty pes and was well tolerated in the phase 3 clinical program. The availability of a single, pangenoty pic regimen is anticipated to be especially beneficial in areas where genot ype diversity is high and genoty ping may not be readily available or routinel y done. Access to treatment for patients with HCV infection would be expanded as a result. 1.3. Rationale for Dose Selection of SOF/VEL FDC Sofosbuvir is an approved pan- genot ypic nucleotide analog HCV NS5B poly merase inhibit or, which, when combined with VEL , a second genera tion NS5A inhibitor, in a fixed -dose combination was well -tolerated and resulted in high SVR rates in a broad range of HCV genot ypes after 12 weeks of treatment in Phase 3 studies. Sofosbuvir 400 mg, once d aily, when dosed in combinati on with RBV with or without Peg- IFN has demonstrated broad genot ypic efficacy and favorable safet y profile in over 1700 HCV -infected subjects across multiple patient populations in Phase 2 and 3 trials. This dose is the approve d marketed dose of sofosbuvir for the treatment of HCV -infection and, as such, was selected for co -formulation with VEL into a fixed- dose combination tablet. Velpatasvir 100 mg was administered in combination with SOF 400 mg for 12 weeks to 237HCV -infected subjects in Phase 2 studies. VEL 100 mg was selected for co- formulation with SOF based on the Phase 2 safet y, PK and antiviral activity (studies GS-US- 342-0102, GS-US-342-0109, and GS -US-337-0122 [Cohort 4])."
24,page_24,"SOF/VEL FDC Protocol GS -US-342-1143 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL Page 25 15June 2018Sofosbuvir 400 mg and VEL 100 mg are the doses evaluated in the Phase 3 ASTRAL program and in the commercially available FDC tablet. Sofosbuvir is a substrate for efflux drug transporters P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). SOF is extensively metabolized to the pharmacologicall y active nucleoside analog phosphate. The activation pathway involves hy drolysis by intestinal and hepaticall y expressed carbox ylesterase (CES1) and Cathepsin A (CatA) enzy mes {Yang 2009 , Zhu 2009 }. SOF is also converted to GS - 331007, an inactive circulating metabolite, which is eliminated renall y by active tubular secre tion and glomerular filtration. Velpatasvir is also a substrate for P -gp and BCRP. VEL has low s ystemic clearance in nonclinical species and low metabolic turnover by CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. I t is eliminated through biliary excretion as unchanged parent drug and metabolites (76.6% of the administered dose is recovered as VEL in feces). Selection of doses of SOF/VEL FDC for adolescents and y ounger age groups will target systemic exposures similar to those observed in adults at the proposed marketed dose, and will take into account bo dy weight/body surface area, the potential ontogenic changes in transporters and metabolic enz ymes that govern the disposition of SOF and VE L, and the results obtained in older age groups. Available data suggest comparable hepatic expression of CYP2B6 and CES1 in adolescents and adults with modestly decreased expression in children, and comparable levels of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 to adults from a y oung age (~3- 6 years of age ) {Johnson 2006 }; however, little is known about the developmental re gulation of Pgp, CES, and CatA. In thiscurrent study , the adult clinical dose of SOF/VEL FDC 400/100 mg isbeing evaluated in adolescents (12 to <18 years old) , while a lower dose SOF/VEL FDC 200/50 mg is being evaluated in children (6 to <12 y ears old) . As described in S ection 1.2.2.3, t he appropriateness of these doses is supported by data from the Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 PK Lead - in subjects, respectivel y, which demonstrated SOF, GS- 331007 and VEL exposure to be within the range of adult exp osures associated with safet y and efficacy in the Phase 2/3 SOF/VEL adult population (Table 1-1and Table 1 -2). In Cohort 3 (3 to <6 years old), a dose of SOF/VEL FDC 200/50 mg is proposed for eval uation in children weighing ≥17 kg, whereas a dose ofSOF/VEL FDC 150/37.5 mg is proposed for evaluation in children weighing < 17 kg. These proposed doses are supported by scaling of adult exposures based on correlations between bod y weight and clearance capacity (liver volume/size for VEL and SOF, and renal capacity for GS -331007) for the expected body weight range in children ( 3 to < 6 years of age) as demonstrated in Figure 1-1.Based on this scaling approach, these doses of SOF/VEL FDC are expected to achieve mean s ystemic exposures of SOF, GS-331007, and VEL within the range of those observed in the Phase 2/3 adult population. Safety and PK data in children who enroll in the PK Lead -in Cohort 3 will be evaluated to confirm the appropriateness of the dose for this age group."

Studies suggest that 3 major catego ries of disease can occur within 10 years after putat ive HCV exposure: (1) undetectable viremia and no nnal ALT, (2) persiste nt yet uncomplicated mild liver disease , and (3) prog ressio n to end-stage liver disease {Bortolotti 2008 }. It is the last two groups of childre n in whom therap y may be indicated to prevent end-stage disease , eithe r during childhood/adolesce nce or in early adulthood. Give n that the cmTent SOC for the ti·eatme nt of children infected with HCV is Peg-IFN and RBV and the regime ns are long in duratio n, relati vely toxic , and not well tolerated , there continu es to be a need for new ti·eatment s for HCV that combine potent and su stained efficacy with impro ved tolerability and safety. The comb ination of SOF plus VEL is anticipated to offer greater antiviral efficacy which could result in a shorter ti·eatment duration and/or lead to a regime n without RBV or interferon. These in tum could result in reduction in adverse events. SOFNE L FDC could also potentiall y be of benefit in patients who h ave failed prior ti·eatme nt with SOF+/-RBV+/- Peg-IFN.

Definition sof Adverse Events , Adverse Reactions, and Serious Adverse Events 7.1.1. Adverse Events An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal product ,which does not necessarily have a causal relati onship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and/or unintended sign, sy mptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered re lated to the medicinal product. AEs may also include pre - or posttreatment complications that occur as a result of protocol specified procedures, overdose ,drug abuse/misuse reports , or occupational exposure .Preexisting events that increase in severity or change in nature during or as a consequence of participation in the clinical study will also be considered AEs. An AE does not include the following: Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery , endoscopy ,tooth extraction, andtransfusion. The condition that ledto the procedure may be an adverse e vent and must be reported. Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before the screening visit that donot worsen Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g. ,hospitalization for elective surgery , social and/or convenience admissions) Overdose without clinical sequelae (see Section 7.6.1 ) Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol -associated procedure is not an AE. I t is considered to be pre -existing and should be documented on the medical history eCRF. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Events A serious adve rse event (SAE) is defined as an event that, at any dose, results in the following: Death Life-threatening (Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the eve nt; it does not refer to an event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death if it were more severe.) In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization"
62,page_62,"SOF/VEL FDC Protocol GS -US-342-1143 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL Page 63 15June 2018Persistent or significant disability /incapacit y A congenital anomal y/birth defect A medicall y important event or reaction: such events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes constituting SAEs. Medical an d scientific judgment must be exercised to determine whether such an event is a reportable under expedited reporting rules. Examples of m edically important e vents include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; anddevelopment of drug dependency or drug abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections resulting from contaminated medicinal product will be considered a medicall y important e vent and subje ct to expedited reporting requirements. 7.1.3. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance are not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities (eg, clinical chemistry , hematology , and urinaly sis) that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to IMP interruption, modification, or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. I n addition, labora tory or other abnormal assessments (eg, electrocardiogram, x- rays, vital signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described in Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a sy ndrome, record the s yndrome or diagnosis (eg, anemia), not the laboratory result (ie, decreased hemoglobin). 7.2. Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The i nvestigator or qualified sub-investigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for causality and severity , and for final review and confirmation of accuracy of event information and assessments. 7.2.1. Assessment of Causality for Study Drugs and Procedures The investigator or qualified sub -investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship to IMP therap y using clinica l judgment and the following considerations: No:Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the IMP. For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (eg, pre -existing condition, underl ying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication). Yes: There is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational medicinal product."
63,page_63,"SOF/VEL FDC Protocol GS -US-342-1143 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 15June 2018It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causall y related in the cont ext of adverse event reporting. The relationship to study procedures (eg, invasive procedures such as venipuncture or biops y) should be assessed using the following considerations: No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study procedure. Yes: The adverse event occurred as a result of protocol procedures, (eg,venipun cture ) 7.2.2. Assessment of Severity The severit y grading of AEs will be assessed as Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4 using the GSI Grading Scale for Severit y of Adverse Events and Laboratory Abnormalities ( Appendix 3). For AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of the clinical severity in the context of the un derly ing conditions; this may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality . 7.3. Investigator Requirements and Instructions for Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events to Gilead Requirements for collection prior to study drug initiation After obtaining informed consent, but prior to initiation of study medication, the following t ypes of events should be reported on the case report form (CRF/eCRF): all SAEs and adverse events related to protocol -mandated procedures. Advers e Events Following initiation of study medication, collect a ll AEs, regardless of cause or relationship, until 30 day safter last administration of study IMP and report to the CRF/eCRF database as instructed. All AEs should be followed up until resolution or until the adverse event is stable, if possible. Gilead Sciences may request that certain AEs be followed bey ond the protocol -defined follow - up period. Serious Adverse Events All SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, that occur after the subject first consents to participate in the stud y (ie, signing the informed consent) and throughout the duration of the study , including the protocol -required posttreatment follow -up period, must be reported to the eCRF database and Gilead Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology (PVE) as instructed. This also includes an y SAEs resulting from protocol- associated procedures performed after informed consent is signed."

Data Handling Conventions Missing data can have an impact upon the interpretation of the trial data. Other than the endpoints discussed below, i n general, values for missing data will not be imputed. For the anal yses of categorical HCV RNA data, missing posttreatment HCV RNA data will have the missing data imputed. Missing on- treatment HCV RNA will have the missing data imputed up to the time of the last dose. If a data point is missing and is preceded and followe d in time by values that are “< LLOQ target not detected (TND),” then the missing data point will be set to “< LLOQ TND.” If a data point is missing and preceded and followed b y values that are “< LLOQ detected,” or preceded b y “<LLOQ detected” and followed by “< LLOQ TND,” or preceded by “< LLOQ TND” and followed b y “< LLOQ detected,” then the missing value will be set to “< LLOQ detected.” In these situations the data point will be termed a bracketed success; otherwise, the data point will be termed a bracketed failure (i.e., ≥ LLOQ detected). If a data point is missing and is not bracketed, the missing data point will also be termed a failure (i.e., ≥ LLOQ detected) except for SVR24, which will be imputed according to the SVR12 status. Success for SVR12 who have no further HCV RNA measurements collected will be counted as a success for SVR24 due to the high correlation between these 2 endpoints . Where appropriate, safety data for subjects that did not complete the study will be included in summary statistics. For example: If a subject received at least 1 dose of study drug, the subject will be included in a summary of adverse events according to the treatment received; otherwise, if the subject is not dosed then they will be excluded from the summary . If safety laboratory results for a subject are missing for any reason at a time point, the subject will be excluded from the calculation of summary statistics for that time point. I f the subject is missing a predose value, then the subject will be excluded from the calculation of summary statistics for the predos e value and the change from p redose values. Values for missing safety laboratory data will not be imputed; however, a missing Day 1result will be replaced with a screening result, if available. If no pretreatment laboratory value is available, the Day 1value will be assumed to be normal (i.e., nograde [Grade 0]) for the summary of graded laboratory abnormalities. Values for missing vital signs data will not be imputed; however, a missing Day 1result will be replaced with a screening result, if available. HCV RNA values below the LLOQ for the assay will be set to the lower limit minus 1 for calculation of summary statistics for the actual HCV RNA values and the change from baseline values by study visit. The reported values will be provided in the HCV RNA listing."

Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL Page 73 15June 2018For selected anal yses of earl y time point data, HCV RNA data (IU/mL) may be transformed to the logarithmic (base 10) scale (log 10IU/mL). For PK plasma concentrations and analy sis of PK parameters natural logarithmic transformation will be used. Plasma concentration values that are below the lower limit of quantitation (BLQ) will be presented as “BLQ” in the concentration data listing. Values that are BLQ will be treated as 0 at predose time points, and one-half the value of the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) at post baseline time points, where LLOQ is corrected for the dilution factor (i.e., reported LLOQ/dilution factor) for determination of summary and order statistics. For the presentation of summary and order statistics, if at least 1 subject has a concentration value of BLQ for the time point, then the minimum value will be display ed as “BLQ.” If more than 25% of the subjects have a concentration data value of BLQ for a given time point, then the minimum and Q1 values will be display ed as “BLQ.” If more than 50% of the subjects have a concentration data value of BLQ for a given time point, then the minimum, Q1, and median values will be display ed as “BLQ.” If more than 75% of the subjects have a concentration data value of BLQ for a given time point, then the minimum, Q1, median, and Q3 values will be display ed as “BLQ.” If all subjects have concentration data values of BLQ for a given time point, then all order statistics (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum) and summary statistics will be display ed as “BLQ.” 8.3.

Details on efficacy anal yses will be described in the statistical anal ysis plan. 8.5. Safety Analysis Safety will be evaluated by assessment of clinical laboratory tests, phy sical examinations, vital signs measurements at var ious time points during the study , and by the documentation of AEs. All safet y data collected on or after the first dose of the study drug administration up t o 30 days after the last dose of the study drug will be summarized . 8.5.1. Extent of Exposure A subject’s extent of exposure to the study drug will be generated from the study drug administration page of eCRF . Exposure data will be summarized. 8.5.2. Adverse Events Clinical and laboratory adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Sy stem Organ Class (SOC), High -Level Group Term (HLGT), High -Level Term (HL T), Preferred Term (PT), and Lower -Level Term (LLT) will be attached to the clinical database. Events will be summarized on the basis of the date of onset for t he event. A treatment -emergent adverse event will be defined as an y adverse event with an onset date on or after the stud y drug start date and no later than 30 day s after permanent discontinuation of the study drug or any adverse event leading to premature discontinuation of the study drug .

Acceptability Acceptability of the study treatments will be evaluated b y assessing swallowability of the solid dosage tablet formulations (if subject is able to swallow the tablet) , evaluation of palatability of all formulations, anda questionnaire administered to subjects and their parent/legal guardian on Day 1, Week 12, and Early Termination (as applicable). 8.6. Pharmacokinetic Analysis PK analy sis will be performed for PK Lead- in using the i ntensive PK Lead -in anal ysis set. The concentration data of VEL, SOF and metabolites (GS -566500 and GS -331007) over sampling time will be listed and summarized by nominal time and cohort. Pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., AUC tau, Cmax, Tmax, Clast, Tlast, Ctau, and t ½) will be listed and summarized by cohort using descriptive statistics (eg, sample size, arithmetic mean, geometric mean, % coefficient of variation, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). Plasma concentrations of the analytes over time will be plotted in semi logarit hmic and linear formats as mean ±standard deviation. To evaluate if the exposures of SOF, GS -331007 and VEL achieved in pediatric subjects of this study are similar to the exposures observed in adult subjects, SOF, GS -331007 and VEL exposure data from this study will be compared to the integrated adult data. The primary endpoint of this analy sis will be evaluated by carry ing out an anal ysis of variance (ANOVA) for log-transformed SOF, GS -331007 and VEL AUC tau. The secondary endpoints of this analy sis will be the C maxof SOF, VEL and GS -331007 and C tauof VEL . The 90% confidence intervals will be constructed for the ratio of geometric means of each PK parameters. The equivalence boundary is set as 70% to 200%. Dose ranging studies for SOF established that a dose of 200 mg results i n suboptimal exposure compared to the 400 mg dose, and no clinicall y significant exposure -safet y relationships were observed across a broad range of GS -331007 exposure. The Phase 1 dose ranging study GS-US-281- 0102 established the anti -HCV activity of VE L and the E maxmodels indicated that subjects will experience near maximal antiviral response (99.5% of E max) at a VEL dose of 100mg. In the Phase 2/3 population treated with SOF/VEL FDC 400/100 mg, virologi c response rates were high across all HCV genoty pes and quartiles of exposure for VEL, SOF and GS- 331007, including for subjects with cirrhosis, with no consistent trends i n exposure -efficacy or exposure -safety relationships. Given the observed safet y and efficacy profile and the lack of exposure -response across all quartiles of SOF/VEL exposure, the bounds of 70- 200% support identification of a clinically relevant difference in SOF, GS -331007 or VEL exposure in the pediatric population. In all pediatric ag e groups, the targeted exposures for SOF, GS-331007 and VEL are the adult equivalent for which safety and efficacy has been established. A ssuming similar variability for SOF, GS -331007 or VEL AUC tau in the pediatric population compar ed to adults, the predi cted 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratio (GMR) will be contained wi thin the bounds of 70% to 200%."

Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL Page 77 15June 2018In the event more than one subject in each cohort exhibits VEL , SOF, or GS -331007 AUC tau exposures less than the 2.5thpercentile of adult values, a dose adjustment may be require dfor the cohort as appropriate. 8.7. Data Monitoring Committee An external multidisciplinary data monitoring committee (DMC) will review the progress of the study and perform interim reviews of safet y data at intervals of approximately every 6months from the first subject enrolled in order to protect subject welfare and preserve study integrit y. The DMC is to provide recommendation to the sponsor whether the nature, frequency , and severit y of adverse effects associated with study treatment warrant the earl y termination of the study in the best interests of the participants, whether the stud y should continue as planned, or the study should continue with modifications. The DMC may also provide recommend ations as needed regarding stud y design, conduct, and the need for additional meetings or an alternative meeting schedule. The DMC’s specific activities will be defined b y a mutually agreed upon charter, which will define the DMC’s membership, conduct, and meeting schedule. While the DMC will be asked to advise Gilead regarding future conduct of the study , including possible earl y study termination, Gilead retains final decision -making authority on all aspects of the study . 8.8. Sample Size With approximately 100 subjects enrolled into the 12 to < 18 y ears of age group and approximately 100 subjects enrolled into the 3 to < 12 y ears of age group, a 2 -sided 95% exact confidence interval of the SVR 12rate in each age group will extend at most 20%."

Case Report Forms For each subject consented, an eCRF will be completed by an authorized study staff member whose training for this function is documented according to study procedures. The eCRF should be completed on the day of the subject visit to enable the sponsor to perform cent ral monitoring of safet y data. TheEligibility Criteria eCRF should be completed onl y after all data related to eligibility have been received. Subsequent to data entry , a study monitor will perform source data verif ication within the EDC sy stem. Original entries as well as an y changes to data fields will be stored in the audit trail of the sy stem. Prior to database lock (or an y interim time points as described in the clinical data management plan), the investigator will use his/her log in credentials to confirm that the forms have been rev iewed, and that the entries accuratel y reflect the inform ation in the source documents. The eCRF capture the data required per the protocol schedule of events and procedures. System -generated or manual queries will be issued to the investigative site staff as data discrepancies are identified by the monitor or internal Gilead staff, who routinely review the data for completeness, correctness, and consistency . The site coordinator is responsible for responding to the queries in a timel y manner, within the sy stem, either b y confirming the data as correct or updating the original entry, and providing the reason for the update (e.g. data entry error). At the conclusion of the trial, Gilead will provide the site with a read -only archive copy ofthe data entered b y that site. This archive must be stored in accordance with the records retention requirements outlined in Section 9.1.5 . 9.1.7. Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability and Return Gilead recommends that used and unused IMP supplies be returned to the shipping facility from which it came for eventual destruction. The stud y monitor will provide instructions for return. If return is not possible, the study monitor will evaluate each study center’s IMP disposal procedures and provide appropriate instruction for destruction of unused IMP supplies. I f the site has an appropriate standard operating procedure (SOP) for drug destruction as determined b y Gilead , the site may destroy used (empt yor partially empt y) and unused IMPsupplies in accordance with th atsite’s approved SOP. A cop y of the site’s approved SOP will be obtained for central files. If IMP is destro yed on site, the investigator must maintain accurate records for all IMP destroy ed. Records must show the identification and quantity of each unit destroy ed, the method of destruction, and the person who disposed of the IMP. Upon study completion, copies of the IMP accountability records must be filed at th e site. Another cop y will be returned to Gilead.

Pregnancy Precautions, Definition for Female of Childbearing Potential, and Contraceptive Requirements 1)Definitions a)Definition of Childbearing Potential For the purposes of this study , a female born subject is considered of childbearing potential following menarche until becoming post -menopausal, unless permanentl y sterile or with medical ly documented ovarian failure. Women of any age with amenorrhea of > 12 months may be considered post -menopausal if their follicle stimulating hormone (FS) level is in the p ost-menopausal range and they are not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therap y.Permanent sterilization includes hysterectom y, bilateral oophorectom y, or bilateral salpingectomy in a female subject of an y age. b)Definition of Male Fertili ty For the purposes of this study , a male born subject is considered fertile after the initiation of puberty unless permanently sterile b y bilateral orchidectomy or medical documentation. 2)Study Drug Effects on Pregnancy and Hormonal Contraception Data from clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies of SOF have demonstrated that there is no reduction in the clinical efficacy of hormonal contraception. Non -clinical toxicity studies of SOF have demonstrated no adverse effect on fertility or embry o-fetal deve lopment Data from clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies of VEL have demonstrated that there is no reduction in the clinical efficacy of hormonal contraception. Non -clinical toxicity studies of GS-5816 have demonstrated no adverse effect on fertili tyor embry o-fetal development. However, the risks of treatment with SOF/VEL FDC during pregnancy in humans have not been evaluated. Please refer to the latest version of the investigator’s brochure for additional information. 3) Contraception Requirements for Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential The inclusion of female subjects of childbearing potential requires using at least an acceptable effective contraceptive measure. They must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and a negative pregnancy test on the Day 1 visit prior to enrollment . A pregnancy test will be performed at the Post treatment Week 4 visit. They must also agree to one of the following from Screening until 30 day s of the last dose of SOF/ VEL FDC . Complete abstinence from intercourse of reproductive potential.
