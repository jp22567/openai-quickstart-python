Patients will be administered olaparib orally twice daily (bd) at 300 mg. The planned dose of 300 mg twice daily will be made up o f two 150 mg tablets twice daily ,with 100 mg tablets used to manage dose reduct ions which may be requi red in pati ents experi encing toxi cities related to olaparib treatm ent, or because of concomitant medication. Guidance on dose reductions are outlined in Sect ions6.8and 7.7 Olaparib tablets shoul d be taken at the same times each morning and evening of each day, approximately 12 hours apart wi th aglassof water. The ol aparib tablets shoul d be swall owed whole and not chewed, crushed, dissolved or divided. Olaparib tablets can be taken with or without a m eal. Statistical methods The primary endpo int is invest igator assessed PFS using modified RECIST criteria versio n 1.1. A sample size of approximately 250 patients is proposed for this study in order to provide an adequate l evel of precisi on around the primary endpoint in the whol e popul ation. The primar y analysis is planned to be undertaken after approximately 30 months with an interim analysis after approximately 18 months. Assessments for survival will continue to be perform ed every 12 weeks following the primary analys is for PFS, until 135OS events (~54% maturity) have been recorded, estima ted to be approximately 36 m onths after the first subject is enrolled. In two randomiz ed pl acebo controlled studies (Study 19, Nova) where non -gBRCA mpatients were treated with a Poly (ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (PARPi), the median PFS for pati ents treated with a PARPi ran ged from 8 to 9 m onths com pared to 4 –5.5 months for those treated with placebo. Clinical trial simulat ions were performed assuming 250 patients enrolled over a 12 month period with 50% of patients enro lled after 8 months, a median PFS of 8.5 m onths and a piecewise exponent ial model for PFS. Across 500 simulat ions it is estimated that the mean number of PFS events is approximately 135 at 18 months (54% maturit y) and 180 at 30 m onths (72% m aturity), with corresponding mean 95% confidence interval (CI) wi dths of 3.87 and 3.27 months respectively. All efficacy analyses will be based on the full analysis set (all enrolled pat ients assigned to olaparib) wit h safet y data summarised from the safety -analyses set (all enrolled patients who have received at least one dose of olap arib). Kaplan -Meier (KM) pl ots of PFS will be presented for all non -gBRCA mpatients and for subgroups determined by the tum our HRD status. Summaries of the number and percentage of pat ients experi encing a PFS event, and the type of event (progression or death) will be provided along with median PFS and 95% CIs. Other time -to-events endpo ints will be summarised in a similar manner. Data from patients treated with o laparib in the current study may be compared withhistori cal data f rom publi shed studi es in a com parable pati ent popul ation treated wi th placebo having adjusted for the prevalence o f known prognostic factors."

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background and Rationale for Conducting This Study Research Hypothesis Maintenance monotherapy with the potent polyadenosine 5’diphosphoribose [Poly (ADP- ribose) ]polymer isation(PARP) inhibitor (PARPi) olaparib will significant ly prolong progression -free survival (PFS) in platinum sensi tive relapsed non-g ermline breast cancer suscept ibilit y gene (BRCA )mutatedovarian cancer patients who are in complete or partia l response fo llowing pl atinum based chemotherapy Olaparib Mechanism of Action Invest igators should be familiar with the current olaparib (AZD2281, KU-0059436) Invest igator brochure (IB). Olaparib is a potent PARP i(PARP -1, -2 and - 3) that is being developed as an oral therapy, both as a monotherapy (including maintenance) and for combinat ion with chemotherapy and other anticancer agents. PARP inhibit ion is a novel approach to targeting tumours with deficiencies in DNA repai r mechanisms . PARP enzymes are essential for repairing DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) . Inhibit ing PARP enzymes leads to the persi stence of SSBs, which are then converted to the more serious DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during the process of DNA replicat ion. During the process of cell divisi on, DSBs can be efficiently repaired in normal cells by ho molo gous recombinat ion (HR) repair . Tum ours wi th HR deficiencies (HRDs), such as ovarian cancers in patients with BRCA 1/2 mutations, cannot accurately repai r the DNA damage, which may beco me lethal to cells as it accumulates . In such tum our ty pes, olaparib may o ffer a potentially efficacious and less toxic cancer treatm ent compared with currently available chemotherap y regimens. BRCA 1and BRCA 2defect ive tumours are intrinsically sensit ive to PARP inhibitors, both in tumour m odels in vivo (Rottenberg et al 2008 ;Hay et al 2009 )and in the clinic ( Rottenberg et al2008 ). The mechanism o f action for olaparib results fro m the trapping of inactive PARP onto the SSBs prevent ing their repair ( Helleday 2011 ; Murai et al 2012 ). Persistence o f SSBs during DNA replicat ion resul ts in their conversio n into the more serious DNA DSBs that woul d norm ally be repai red by HR repai r. Olaparib has been shown to inhibit selected tumour cell lines in vit ro and in xenograft and primary explant models as well as in genet ic BRCA knock - out models, either as a stand -alone treatment or in combination with established chemotherapies. AstraZeneca considers that the relapsed ovarian cancer patientpopulat ion invo lved in this study falls under the advanced cancer, limited life expectancy definit ion outlined in Internati onal Confere nce on Harm onisat ion (ICH) S9 guideline ""Non -clinical Evaluat ion for Anticancer Pharmaceut icals"" and meets the requirements outlined in the guideline. 1.2 Rationale for Study Design, Doses and Control Groups In patients with platinum sensi tive relapsed (PSR) disease, platinum based chemotherapy is recommended for 6 cy cles wi th no clear benefi t of extending the chem otherapy cycles bey ond 6 and risk of accumulat ing unacceptable toxici ty (NCCN Clinical Pract ice Guidelines in Onco logy 2016). There is therefore a window of opportunit y to introduce a maintenance"

Platinum sensit ivity and response to platinum -containing therapy are clinical select ion factors that can be used to i dentify patients that are likely to benefit from olaparib treatm ent. Ol aparib is a highly specific PARP ithat is generally well tolerated, and as maintenance therapy can fulfil a high unmet medical need and provi de patients with PSR ovarian cance r an opportuni ty for prolonged disease control , meaningfully extended PFS and a longer chem otherapy -free interval. Clinical evidence to support ol aparib as a maintenance treatm ent was first shown in a Phase II rando mized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, multicentre study (D0810C00019 [Study 19]) in patients with PSR ovari an cancer. A second study , a Phase III rando mized, doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled, multicentre study, D0816C00002 (SOLO2), invest igated olaparib 300 mg bd (2 x 150 mg bd) tablet formulation as a maint enance treatm ent in gBRCA mPSR ovarian cancer patients. In both SOLO2 and Study 19, patients with plat inum -sensit ive relapsed disease who were in response (complete or partial ) to their final platinum regimen and who had received at least two previous lines of plat inum -based therapy were randomized to receive either olaparib or placebo. The primary endpoint in both SOLO2 and Study 19 was PFS. The SOLO2 data confirm that maintenance treatm ent with olaparib 300 mg bd (tablet formulation) offers a substant ial efficacy improvement by prolonging PFS by 13.6 months compared to placebo and delaying the requi rement for further anticancer treatm ent in patients with gBRCA mPSR ovari an cancer who are in response to platinum -based chemotherapy. Safet y data from SOLO2 confirm that olaparib tablets are suitable for l ong-term use in a maintenance setting. The clinical benefit observed in SOLO2, along with the acceptable safet y and tolerabilit y profile and the convenience of an oral administrati on are critical factors in the consideration of an optimal maintenance regimen. Data from Study 19 provide evidence for the clinical activi ty of olaparib in the broader PSR ovarian cancer patients irrespective of their gBRCA status in the maintenance treatm ent setting, together with an acceptable safet y and tolerabilit y profile. The totalit y of the data from SOLO2 and Study 19 demonstrates that olaparib maintenance therapy has a posi tive benefit -risk profile in the treatment of PSR ovarian cancer. Clinical experience wit holaparib is fully described in the current version of the olaparib IB. Rationale for non -gBRCA m patient selection While mult iple rando mized controlled trials (RCTs) have demo nstrated that plat inum -sensi tive BRCA m patients have profound response to maintenance treatm ent with PARP inhibitors, PARP inhibitors target cells with homologous recombinat ion deficiency (HRD), of which BRCA mutation is only one t ype. Consisten t with the mechanism o f action of PARP inhibit ion, response has also been seen in mult iple RCTs in patients who are plat inum -sensit ive but whose tumours do not harbor BRCA mutations (Study 19 and NOVA). Presumably these responders have defects in other components of HRR pathways, though currently available diagnostic techno logy is not adequat e to reliably identify the full spectrum of HRR deficiencies. Instead, these data support the hypothesis that plat inum sensi tivity itself is a clinical selection factor for HRD."

Study D0 810C00019 (NCT no. NCT00753545; EudraCT no. 2008 -003439 -18) This was a Phase II study (D0810C00019/Study 19) in PSR ovari an cancer patients . The study compared the efficacy of olaparib maintenance treatm ent of a capsule formulation [400 m g (8 x 50 m g cap sules) twi ce daily ] taken to progressi on wi th no maintenance treatm ent in 265 (136 olaparib and 129 placebo) PSR patients who were in response ( complete or partial ) following completion of platinum containing chem otherapy . The primary endpo int was PFS based on invest igator assessment using RECIST 1.0. Secondary efficacy endpo ints included overall survival ( OS), disease control rate (DCR), Health Related Qualit y of Life (HRQoL ), and disease related symptom s. Exploratory analyses of Time to first subsequent therapy or death (TFST )andTime to second subsequent therapy or death (TSST )were also performed. The study met its primary object ive of demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in PFS for olaparib compared with placebo : Hazard Ratio (HR)0.35; 95% confidence interval ( CI)0.25-0.49; p<0.00001; median 8.4 months o laparib vs 4.8 months placebo. Final OS(data cut off [DCO] 09 May 2016; 79% maturit y) with a median duration o f follow-up for OS of 6.5 years, showed favourable prolongat ion of OS for olaparib treated patients co mpared to placebo -treated pati ents. The reduced risk o f death in the o laparib treated patients is reflected by a clinically meaningful although not statist ically significant HR of 0.73 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.95, nominal p=0.02138) with a 2.0 month longer median OS for olaparib treated patients compared to placebo treated patients (29.8 months vs 27.8 months, respectively ). Similar OS HRs favouring olaparib were observed irrespect ive of patients’ gBRCA mutation status. Prepl anned subgroup analysis ident ified patients wi th BRCA m ovari an cancer (n=136, 51.3%) as the subgroup that derived the greatest clinical benefit from olaparib maintenance monotherapy . In BRCA m patients the median PFS improvement was 6.9months over placebo (HR 0.18; 95% CI 0. 10 -0.31; p<0.00001; median 11.2 months o laparib vs 4.3 months placebo). However, clinical benefit was also observed in the BRCA wild type ( wt)patient populat ion (7·4 months [95% CI 5·5-10·3] median PFS in the olaparib group vs 5·5 m onths [ 95% CI 3·7-5·6] in the placebo group ; HR 0·54 [ 95% CI 0·34-0·85]; p=0·0075) . Long term benefit has been observed in PSR ovarian cancer patients, with olaparib maintenance therapy provi ding unprecedented periods of remissio n in so mepatients: • In the overall populati on, substant ially more patients received olaparib vs placebo for ≥2 years (24% vs 4%, respectively) and ≥6 years (11% vs 1%, respecti vely). Wi th the caveat of small numbers of patients, at least a third of the patients deriving long term (≥6 years) benefit fro m olaparib did not carry a gBRCA mutation. • In the overall popul ation at the 09 May 2016 DCO analysis, 14 patients (including 5 patients without a g BRCA mutation) were still receiving olaparib therapy compared to"

NCT01847274; EudraCT no. 2013 -000685-11) Study PR-30-5011 -C was a randomized, double -blind, phase 3 tri al to eval uate the efficacy of niraparib versus placebo as maintenance treatment for patients with platinum -sensi tive, recurrent ovari an cance r (niraparib 300 mg or placebo once daily). Of 553 enrolled patients, 203 were in the g BRCA cohort (niraparib [n=138 ], placebo [n=65 ]) and 350 patients were in the non-g BRCA cohort (niraparib [n=234 ], placebo [n=116 ]). All the patients had shown sensit ivity to platinum -based treatm ent and had received at least two such regimens. For the penult imate platinum -based chem otherapy before study enrolment, a patient must have had platinum - sensit ive disease after this treatment which was defined as having a comple te or partial response and disease progressi on more than 6 months after completion of the last round of platinum therapy . Patients in the niraparib group had a significant ly longer median durat ion of PFS (primary endpoint) than did those in the placebo group, including 21.0 vs. 5.5 months in the gBRCA cohort as compared with 12.9 months vs. 3.8 months in the non-g BRCA cohort for patients who had tumours with ho molo gous recombinat ion deficiency and 9.3 months vs. 3.9 months in the overall non-g BRCA cohort. Among patients with platinum -sensit ive, recurrent ovari an cancer, the median durati on of PFS was significant ly longer among those receiving niraparib than amo ng those receiving placebo, regardless of the presence or absence of g BRCA mutati ons or HRD status, with mo derate bone marrow toxicity. Grade 3 or 4 treatm ent-emergent events in the niraparib group (74.1%) were managed with dose modificat ions. (Mirza et al 2016 ). 1.3 Benefit /Risk and Ethical Assessment Olaparib has been well tolerated across various cancer entities. The proposed study will be limited to patient s with advanced ovarian cancer who arerelapsed, non-g BRCA mutated, for whom clinical activi ty can be expected based on the resul ts of the studi esdiscussed in section 1.2. Therefore, a posit ive benefit/risk profile is expected and no ethical issues are identified from exposing patientto olaparib wit hin the planned clinical study . Please see the current edit ion of the IB for the most recent summary of the risks of olaparib. 1.4 Study Design A Phase IIIb, single- arm, open -label multicentre study .to assess the efficacy and safety of single- agent olaparib as a maintenance treatm ent in patients with relapsed HGSOC (including patients with primary peritoneal and/or fallopian tube cancer) or high grade endo metrioid ovari an cancer who do not have known deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutati ons (non -gBRCA m) and who had responded fo llowing plat inum based chemotherapy . Olaparib will be administered to all patients in this single -arm study (see Figure 1). Tumour assessments will be conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months, and thereafter every 12 weeks up to disease progression . 1.5 Study Governance and Oversight Not applicable CCI"

PATIENT SELECTION, ENROLMENT, RESTRICTIONS, DISCONTINUATION AND WITHDRAWAL Each patient should meet all o f the inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusio n criteria for this study . Und er no ci rcumstances can there be exceptions to this rule. 3.1 Inclusion Criteria Patients withoutdeleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA mutations will be included . The gBRCA status of enrolled patients will be confirmed retrospectively using a central laboratory gBRCA test(Myriad BRCAnalysis CDx) . Testing of gBRCA status should norm ally have been perform ed as part of national or institutional pract ice guidelines for the mana gement of ovarian cancer, such as in t he assessment of treatment options after chemotherapy. Under except ional circumstances, gBRCA testing of potenti ally eligible patients whose gBRCA status is not yet known can be considered (by agreem ent with the Sponso r). In these cases the gBRCA test must be completed prior to other screening procedures .To ensure this, p atients may be consented from the end of cycle 3 of their current chemotherapy if,in the opinio n of the investigator ,they are responding to treatm ent, and if it appears that the patient is likely to meet other eligibilit y requirements. The 28-day screening period will be considered to have started only after the availabilit y of the gBRCA status report at the site, at the start of the screening procedures listed in Table 1, column 2. Please refer to Appendix F for further details about the procedure and to the Laboratory Manua l for further details of the test. Study sites should also offer access to a genetic counsellor (given that this is a gen etic test which may have familial implicat ions in the case of a posit ive result). For inclusio n in the study patients shoul d fulfil all of the fo llowing cri teria: 1. Provisio n of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures 2. Patients m ust be ≥18 years of age 3.

Procedures for discontinuation of a patient from investigational product At any time, patients are free to discont inue IPor withdraw from the study (i.e., IP and assessments; see Section 3.10), without prej udice to further treatment. If pos sible, they will be seen and assessed by an Investigator(s). A patient who discont inues will always be asked about the reason(s) for discont inuat ion and the presence of any adverse events. The Principal Invest igator/Invest igator will perform the best poss ible observat ion(s), test(s) and evaluat ion(s) as well as give appropri ate medication and all possible measures for the safet y of the patient. They will also immediately inform AstraZeneca of the wi thdrawal. Adverse events (AEs) will be followed up (See Secti on 6); all unused study drug shoul d be returned by the patient.

Patients shoul d continue to be followed for progression (if discont inuat ion in the absence of progres sion), TFST and OS fo llowing treatm ent discontinuation as per the protocol schedule . Any patientdiscont inuing IP should be seen at 30 days post discont inuat ion for the evaluat ions outlined in the study schedule . The patient’s tumour status should be as sessed clinically and, if appropriate, di sease progressi on shoul d be confirmed by radiological assessment . In addi tion, they will record on the electroni c case report form (eCRF) the date of discont inuat ion, the reasons, manifestation and treatment at the time of discont inuat ion. Pati ents will be required to attend the treatment discont inuat ion visit. After discont inuat ion of the study medication at any po int in the study, all ongo ing AEs or SAEs must be fo llowed unt il resolution unless, in the Investigato r’s opinio n the condi tion is unlikely to resolve due to the patient underlying disease, or the patient is lost to f ollowup (see Secti on 6.3.2 ). All new AEs and SAEs occurring during the 30 calendar days after the last dose of study medicat ion must be reported (if SAEs, they must be reported to the AstraZeneca representative within 24 hours as described in Section 6.4) and followed to resolut ion as a bove . Patients shoul d be seen at least 30 days after discont inuing study medicat ion to collect and / or complete AE inform ation. For guidance on reporting AEs after the 30-day follow-up period, see Sectio n 6.3.1.1 .

Screen failures Screening failures are patients who do not fulfil the eligibilit y criteria for the study , and therefore must not be enrolled . These patients shoul d have the reason for study withdrawal recorded as ‘Screen failure’ (the potential patient who does not meet one or more criteria requi red for parti cipati on in thetrial; this reason for study withdrawal is only valid for patient s who were not enrolled ). Withdrawal of the informed consent Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time ( IPand assessments), without prejudice to further treatment. A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AE s. The Invest igator will fo llow up AEs outside of the clinical study . If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study , then his/her enro lment code cannot be reused . Wit hdrawn patient swill not be replaced. If a patient withdraws consent, they will be specifically asked if they are withdrawing consent to: further participat ion in the study including any further foll ow up (e.g., survival calls) the use of their study generated data the use of any samples The status of ongoin g, wi thdrawn (fro m the study ) and “l ost to f ollowup” patients at the time of an OS analysis should be obtained by the si te personnel by checking the patient notes, hospi tal records, contacting the patient’s general practit ioner and checking publicly avail able death registries.

RECIST a ssessment should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of study treatment, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment. Note: MRI/ CT scan more than 28 days prior to Day 1 may beacceptable, please consult with AstraZeneca . fThese measurement s may be repeated within the screening period if abnormalities are found which are the only reason for screen failing the patient and which can reasonably be expected to have return to the acceptable range gAll patients ar e required to submit either an archival tumour sample , or a fresh biopsy if an archival sample is not available ,for retrospective testing of their genetic status. If archival tissue, the presence of adequate tissue needs to be confirmed prior to screening , but it will not be shipped to the ce ntral lab before Day1. If fresh, the biopsy should be taken after the baseline scan has been performed . Samples should be submitted as paraffin blocks, alternatively, sections mounted on glass slides prepared from the block can be provided.

If results are posi tive the patientis ineligib le/must be discontinued fro m study treatm ent immediately . 5.3 Other Assessments Patient Reported Outcomes ( PRO : FACT -O) The FACT -O (versio n 4) is a valid and reliable assessment of the qualit y of life (QoL) of wo men with ovarian cancer (Basen- Engquist et al. 2001). The FACT -O will be self-reported through patient questi onnaires according to the study plan. No proxy reporti ng will be permi tted as the equivalence of pat ient-completed versus proxy FACT -O reports has not been established. The questionnaire covers a 7 -day recall period. All pat ients will be asked to complete the FACT -O. The FACT -O questi onnaire will be administered pri or to dosing at baseline, at Day 29, Visit 4 (week 8),and then at every tumour assessment visit until progressi on.Inaddit ion, QoL questionnaires will be collected at the discont inuation of study treatment visit, and at 30 days post last dose. The timing of assessments coincide with other clinical assessments (when the patient will be attending clinic) in order to minimise patient burden while maximizing both compliance and the associ ation of the PRO with the clinical outcom es. The reason for any missing assessment will be co llected in the CRF. Subscales will be derived fro m the FACT -O according to the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Administration and Scoring Guidelines . The endpo int for HRQoL analysis will be the FACT -O Trial Outcome Index (TOI). Other subscales will be considered as exploratory endpoints EQ-5D-5L EuroQol five dimensio ns quest ionnaire (EQ -5D-5L) is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status . The EQ -5D questionnaire is made up of two components; healt h state descript ion and evaluation. In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensio ns (5D); mobilit y, self-care, usual activities, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on.Patients will self-rate thei r level of severi ty for each dimension using a five- level scale (5L). In the evaluat ion part, the respond ents evaluate their overall healt h status using the visual analogue scale (EQ -VAS).

The fo llowing outcome m easure swill be explored: - PFS by molecular m easures of HRR and genomic instabili ty including: oMSI (posit ive vs negat ive) oHRR deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation (y es vs no) oTP53 del eterious or suspected deleterious mutation (y es vs no) oTumour m utation load score oLoss of heterozy gosity (yes vs no) for pati ents wi th a HRR muta tion OS by TP53 m utation status (y es vs no) . 5.7 Biomarker Analysis Samples (about 20mL who le blood to provide plasma )will be taken at Visit 2 and at treatm ent discont inuat ionto explore the feasibilit y of reliably identifying mutations in homolo gous recombination genes from circulat ing tumour DNA (ctDNA) by matching wit h resul ts from tumour testing, and to enable future diagnostic development. 6. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT The Principal Invest igator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar wit h the content of this sect ion. Medical management of patient according to local practice is acceptable for AEs that are not SAEs and not adverse events of special interest (AESI), and that are grade 1 or 2 in severit y. 6.1 Definition of Adverse Events An AEis the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patientadministered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can the refore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (e.g. ,an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom ( e.g., nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related to the m edicinal product."

An AE may occur at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. Olapar ib adverse events of special interest Adverse events of special interest [AESI] are events of scient ific and medical interest specific to the further understanding of olaparib’s safet y profile and require close monitoring and rapid communicat ion by the inv estigators to AstraZeneca. AESIs for olaparib are the important potenti al risks of MDS/AML, new primary malignancy (other than MDS/AML) and pneumo nitis. AZ Safet y will send a quest ionnaire to any invest igator reporting an AESI, as an aid to provi de further detailed information on the event. This information is separate from the eCRF. During the study there m ay be other events ident ified as AESIs that require the use of a questionnaire to help characterise the event and gain a better understanding regardi ng the relationship between the event and study treatm ent. 6.2 Definitions of Serious Adverse Event A SAEis an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run -in, treatment, washout, fo llow- up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:  Results in death  Is immediately life -threatening  Requi res in -patienthospi talisat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talisat ion  Results in persistent or significant disabilit yor incapacit y  Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect  Is an important medical event t hat may jeopardise the patientor may requi re medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. For further guidance on the definit ion of a SAE, see Appendix Ato the Clinical Study Protocol . 6.3 Recording of Adverse Events Time period for collection of adverse events AEs/SAEs will be collected from time of signature of informed consent, throughout the treatm ent peri od and including the fo llow-up peri od(30 day s after di scont inuing IP except for AEs described in Sect ion 6.3.1.1 ). After any interim analysis, any o ngoing AEs/SAEs need to be unlocked and fo llowed f or resol ution."

Investigators will ask ,during the regular fo llow up for overall survival ,if the patient has developed MDS/AML or a new pr imary malignancy and must report any such cases. At any time after a patient has co mpleted the study, if an Invest igator learns o f any SAE including sudden death of unknown cause, and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibilit y that the ev ent is causally related to the investigational product, the invest igator shoul d notify AstraZeneca, Patient Safet y. If pat ients who are gaining clinical benefit are allo wed to continue study treatment post data cut off and/or post study com pletion then all SAEs m ust continue to be collected and reported to Pati ent Safety within the usual t imeframe. Otherwi se, after study treatm ent com pletion (i.e. after any scheduled post treatment follow -up period has ended) there is no obligation to actively report information on new AEs or SAEs occurring in former study patients. Thi s includes new AEs/SAEs in pat ients still being followed up for survival but who have co mpleted the post treatment fo llow up peri od (30 days). Follow up of unresolved adverse events Any SAE or non -SAE that is ongoing a t the time of the 30- dayfollowup m ust be followed up to resolut ion unless the event is considered by the Invest igator to be unlikely to resolve, or the patientis lost to fo llowup. AstraZeneca retains the right to reque st addit ional informat ion for any patientwith ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary . Variables The fo llowing variab les will be collect for each AE:  AE (verbat im)  The date when the AE started and stopped  Maximum intensit y / intensi ty /changes in intensity will all be recorded for the following AE: nausea, vo miting, fat igue and anaemia. For all other AE, only intensity is requi red  CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade  Whether the AE is serious or not  Invest igator causalit y rating against the IP (y es or no)  Action taken with regard to IP"

It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by the criteria in Sect ion 6.2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limit ed degree of disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2. The grading scales found in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE versio n 4.0 will be utilised for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading . For those events without as signed CTCAE grades ,the recommendation is that the CTCAE criteria that convert mild, moderate and severe events into CTCAE grades should be used. A copy of the CTCAE versio n can be downloaded fro m the Cancer Therapy Evaluat ion program web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov )."

Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’. A gu ide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix Ato the Clinical Study Protocol . Adverse events based on signs and symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the patientor reported in response to the open question from the study site staff: e.g., ‘Have y ou had any heal th probl ems since the previous visit/y ou were l ast asked?’, or revealed by observat ion will be co llected and recorded in the CRF . When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately . Adverse events based on examinations an d tests The results from the Clinical Study Protocol -mandated l aboratory tests and vi tal signs will be summarised in the clinical study report. Deteri oration as com pared to baseline in protocol - mandated l aboratory values, vital signs and ECG abnormalit iesshoul d therefore only be reported as AEs if one of the fo llowing i s met: Any criterion for an SAE is fulfilled Causes study treatm ent discont inuation Causes study treatm ent interruption Causes study treatm ent dose reduction The Investi gator believes that the abnorm ality shoul d be reported as an AE If deteri oration in a laboratory value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory resul t/vital sign will be considered a s addi tional informat ion. Wherever possible the reporting Invest igator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anaemia versus low haemoglobin value) . In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in no n- mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deteri oration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion as compared wit h the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE."

Disease progression Disease progressi on can be considered as a worsening of a patient’scondi tion attributable to the disease for which the IP is being studied. It may be an increase in the severit y of the disease under study and/or increases in the signs and symptoms of the cancer. The development of new, or progression of exist ing metastasi s to the primary cancer under study shoul d be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events which are unequivoc ally due to disease progressi onshoul d not b e reported as an AE during the study .

Events, which are unequivocal ly due to di sease under study ,shoul d not be reported as an AE during the study unless they meet SAE cri teria or l ead to di scont inuation of the IP. New cancers The development of a new primary cancer should be reported as an AE (see Section 6.1.1 Olaparib Adverse Events of Special Interest) and would in most cases meet seriousness criteria (wi th the except ion of so me non-melanoma skin cancers). New primary malignancies are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after the inclusio n of the patient into the study . They do not include metastases of the original cancer. Symptoms o f metastasi s or the metastasi s itself shoul d not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are consi dered to be di sease progressi on. Lack of efficacy When there is deterioration in the cancer, for which the study treatment(s) is being used, there may be uncertaint y as to whether this is lack o f efficacy or an AE. In such cases, unless the Sponsor or the reporting physi cian consi ders that the study treatm ent contributed to the deteri oration of the condi tion, or l ocal regul ations state to the contrary , the deteri oration shoul d be considered to be a lack of efficacy and not an AE. Deaths All deaths that occur during the study , or wi thin the protocol -defined 30 -dayfollow-up peri od after the administration o f the last dose of study treatm ent, m ust be reported as fo llows:  Death cl early the resul t of disease progressi on shoul d be reported to the study monitor at the next mon itoring visit and should be documented in the DEATH eCRF but should not be reported as an SAE."

The report should con tain a comment regarding the co -involvement of progression of disease, if appropriate, and shoul d assi gn main and contributory causes of death. This informat ion can be captured i n the ‘death eCRF’.  Deaths with an unknown cause should alway s be reported as a SAE. A post- mortem may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if per formed a copy of the post-mortem resul ts shoul d be forwarded to AstraZeneca within the usual t imeframes. 6.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the study procedure(s) . All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF. If any SAE occurs in the course of the study , then Investi gators or other si te personnel inform the appropri ate AstraZeneca representati ves within 1day,i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she b ecomes aware of it . The designated AstraZeneca representati ve works with the Invest igator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca PatientSafety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active followup is undertaken immediately. Invest igators or other site personnel i nform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up informat ion on a previously reported SAE within 1calendar day,i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it . Once the Invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system , an autom ated e -mail alert i s sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investi gator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representa tive by SAE paper form. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator/study site staff on how to proceed. Invest igators or other site personnel send relevant CRF modules by fax to the designated AstraZeneca representative. The reference docum ent for defini tion of expectedness/listedness is the IB f or the AstraZeneca drug. 6.5 Overdose There i s currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose with olaparib and possible symptoms of overdose are not established. Olaparib must only be used in accordance wit h the dosing recommendat ions in this protocol . Any dose or frequency of dosing that exceeds the dosing regimen specified in this protocol shoul d be reported as an overdose. Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be treated sympt omatically and should be managed appropriately."

If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca PatientSafet y data entry site. For overdoses associated with a SAE, the stan dard reporting t imeline s apply (see Secti on 6.4). For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 day s. 6.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to the AstraZeneca representative except iif the pregnancy is discovered before the study patienthas received any study drug Maternal exposure If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study , IP shou ld be discont inued immediately . The outcomes of any concepti on occurring from the date of the first dose of study medicati on until 1 month after the last dose of study medicat ion must be followed up and documented. Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AEunless there is a suspicio n that the IPunder s tudy may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion. Congenital abnorm alities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. El ective abortions without complications should not be handled as A Es. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormalit y) shoul d be fo llowed up and documented even if the patient was discont inued from the study. If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day,i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours ofwhen he or she beco mes aware of it . The designated AstraZeneca repr esentative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca PatientSafet y data entry site wi thin 1 or 5 calendar day s for SAEs (see Secti on 6.4) and wi thin 30 days for all other pregnancies. The same timelines apply when outcome informat ion is available. 6.7 Medi cation Error For the purposes of this clinical study a medicat ion error i s an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that ei ther causes harm to the patient or has the potential to cause harm to the patien t. A medicat ion error i s not l ack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or patient ."

Subsequent occurrences: If Hb < 10 but ≥ 9 g/dl investigato r judgement to continue olaparib with supportive treatment (eg transfusion) or dose interrupt (for max of 4 weeks) and upon recovery dose reduction may be considered (to 250 mg twice daily a s a first step and to 200 mg twice daily as a second step). If Hb < 9 but ≥ 8 g/dl, dose interrupt (for max of 4 weeks) until Hb ≥ 9 g/dl and upon recovery dose reduction may be considered (to 250 mg twice daily as a first step and to 200 mg twice daily a s a second step). Hb < 8 g/dL (CTCAE grade 3)Give appropriate supportive treatment (e.g. ,transfusion) and investigate causality. Interrupt olaparib for a maximum of 4 weeks until improved to Hb ≥ 9 g/dL. Upon recovery dose reduce to 250 m g twice daily as a first step and to 200 m g twice daily as a second step in the case of repeat Hb decrease. Commo n treatable causes of anaemia (e.g., iron, vitamin B12 or fo late deficiencies and hypothy roidism ) shoul d be invest igated and appropriately managed . In so me cases management of anaemia may require blood transfusions . For cases where patients develop prolonged haematol ogical toxicity (≥2-week interrupti on/delay in study treatment due to CTC grade 3 or worse anaemia and/or development of blood transfusio n dependence), refer to Secti on 6.8.1.3 for the management of this."

Study treatm ent can be dose reduced to 250 mg twice daily as a fi rst step and to 200 mg twice daily as a second step. Treatment must be interrupted if any NCI-CTCAE grade 3 or 4 AE occurs whi ch the Invest igator considers to be related to administration of study treatm ent. 6.8.2.1 Management of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms If new or worsening pulmo nary symptoms (e.g., dyspnoea) or radio logical abnorm alities occur i n the absence of a clear diagnosis, an interruption in study treatment dosing is recommended and further di agnosti c workup (including a HRCT scan) should be performed to exclude pneumo nitis. Following investigation, if no evidence o f abnormalit y is observed on computed tom ography (CT) imaging and symptoms reso lve, then study treatment can be resta rted, if deemed appropriate by the Invest igator . If significant pulmo nary abnorm alities are i dentified, these need to be discussed with the Study Physician. 6.8.2.2 Management of nausea and vomiting Events of nausea and vo miting are known to be associated with o laparib treatment . In SOLO - 2, nausea was reported in 78 % of the ol aparib treated patients and 3 3% ofthe placebo treated patients and vo miting was reported in 3 7% of the olaparib treated patient s and 1 9% ofthe placebo treated patients. These events are generally mild to moderate (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) severi ty, intermi ttent and m anageable on continued treatment . The first onset of nausea and vomiting was reported in the first 3 months for 71 and 25% of patients respectively. No routine prophylactic ant iemetic treatment is required at the start of study treatm ent; however, patients shoul d receive appropri ate ant iemet ic treatment at the first onset of nausea or vomit ing and as required thereafter, in accordance with local treatment practice guidelines. Alternat ively, o laparib tablets can be taken with a light meal/snack (i .e.,twopieces of toast or a coupl e of biscui ts). As per internat ional guidance on ant iemet ic use in cancer patients (European Societ y for Medical Oncology [ESMO], Nati onal Com prehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] ), generally a single agent ant iemetic should be considered , e.g.,dopamine receptor antagonist, antihistamines or dexamethasone. 6.8.2.3 Interruptions for intercurrent non -toxicity related events Study treatm ent dose interrupti on for condi tions other than toxicit y resolution shoul d be kept as short as possible .

Manufacturer will also be included in the Quality section of the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier. 7.2 Dose and Treatment Regimens For all centres, olaparib tablets will be packed in high -densit y polyethylene bottl es wi th child - resistant closures. Each dosing container will contain sufficient medicat ion for at least 28 days pl us overage. Ol aparib will be dispensed to patients as detailed in Table 2 unt il the patient com pletes the study , withdraws fro m the study or cl osure of the study . Study treatm ent is avail able as film -coated tabl ets containing 100 mg or 150 mg of olaparib. Patients will be administered olaparib orally twice daily (300 mg twice daily ) continually . Two x 150 mg olaparib tablets should be taken at the same t imes each day, approximately 12 hours apart with one glass of water. The tablets should be swallowed who le and not chewed, crushed, disso lved or divided . Olaparib tablets can be taken with or without food. Dose reduction may be necessary to manage toxicity (doses down to 200mg twice dail y, see Secti on 6.8) , or because of the requirement to co -admini ster wi th CYP3A4 inhibitors (doses down to 100mg twice daily, see Secti on 7.7). Dose reductions can be managed in 50mg increments by combinat ion of 150mg and 100mg tablets If vomiting occurs shortly after the olaparib tablets are swallowed, the dose should only be replaced if all o f the intact tabl ets can be seen and counted.

If greater than 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, the missed dose is not to be taken and the patient shoul d take thei r allotted dose at the next scheduled t ime. Patients will cont inue with olaparib unt il documented disease progression as assessed by the Invest igator or unacceptable toxicit y or for as l ong as they do not m eet any other discontinuat ion criteria. Patients m ay cont inue to receive treatment beyo nd progression as long as in the invest igator’s opinio n they are benefit ing from treatment and they do not m eet any other discont inuat ion criteria as outlined in Section 3.9. Once patients have been discont inued fro m study treatm ent, other treatm ent opti ons will be at the discret ion of the Invest igator . Dose reductions For gui dance on dose reductions for management of AEs refer to Section 6.8. For gui dance on dose reductions when concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avo ided see Section 7.7. Renal impairment If subsequent to study entry and while still on study therapy , a patient’s est imated creatinine clearance ( CrCl )falls below the thresho ld for study inclusi on (≥51 m L/min), retesting should be perform ed prom ptly. A dose reduction is recommended for patient s who develop moderate renal impairment (calculated CrCl by Cockcroft- Gaul t equati on of between 31 and 50 m L/min) for any reason during the course of the study : the dose of ol aparib shoul d be reduced to 200 mg twice daily . Because t he CrCl determinat ion is only an est imate of renal funct ion, in instances where the CrCl falls to between 31 and 50 mL/min, the Investi gator should use his or her discretion in determining whether a dose change or discont inuatio n of therapy is warranted. Olaparib has not been studied in patientswith severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 30 m L/min) or end-stage renal disease; if patients develop severe impairment or end -stage disease ,it is recommended that olaparib be discontinued. 7.3 Labelling Labels will be prepa red in accordance wit h Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local regul atory guidelines. The l abels will fulfil GMP Annex 13 requirements for labelling. Label text will be translated into local language. Each bottle/pack of investigational medicinal product (IMP) will have an IP label permanent ly affixed to the outside stating that the material is for clinical study/invest igational use only and shoul d be kept out of reach of children . The l abel will include a space for the enrolment code (E-code) to be completed at the time of dispensing. Specific dosing instructions will not be included on the label; the site must complete the ‘Patient Dispensing Card’ wit h the details of the dosing instructions at the time of dispensing. The patient’semergency contac t details will not be on the label, but can be found in the inform ed consent and the ‘ PatientDispensing Card’ .

At the end of the study , it must be possible to reconcile delivery records wi th records of usage and destroy ed/returned stock . Records of usage should include the ident ificat ion of the person to whom the study treatm ent was dispensed, the quant ity and date of dispensing and unused study treatm ent returned to the Invest igator . This record is in addit ion to any drug accountabilit y inform ation recorded on the eCRF. Any discrepancies must be accounted for on the appropriate forms. Certificates of delivery and return must be signed, preferably by the Investi gator or a pharmacist, and copies retained in the Investi gator site file. Dispensing and accountabilit y records will continue to be collected for as long as patients continue to receive study treatment, although they will not be entered on the database after the database has cl osed. Study site staff, if applicable, or the Clinical Research Organization (CRO )Moni tor will account for all study drugs received at the site, unused study drugs and for appropriate destruct ion.

Medications that m ay NOT be administered No other anti cancer therapy (chemotherapy , immunotherapy , horm onal therapy [horm one replacement therapy is acceptable ], radi otherapy , biological therapy or other novel agent) i s to be permi tted while the patientis receiving study medication. Live virus and live bacterial vaccines should not be administered whilst the patientis receiving study medicati on and during the 30- day follow -up peri od. An increased risk of infect ion by the administ ration of live virus and bacterial vaccines has been observed wit h convent ional chemother apy drugs and the effects wi th olaparib are unknown. Restricted concomitant medications Strong or Moderate CYP3A inhibitors Known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itrac onazole, telit hromyc in, clarithro mycin, boosted protease inhibitors, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (ciproflo xacin, ery thromycin, dilt iazem, fluconazo le, verapamil) should not be taken with study treatment. If there is no suitable alternative conco mitant medicati on,then the dose of study treatm ent shoul d be reduced for the period of concomitant administration. The dose reduction of study treatm ent shoul d be recorded in the CRF with the reason docume nted as conco mitant CYP3A inhibitor use.  Strong CYP3A inhibitors –reduce the dose of olaparib to 100 m g twice daily for the duration of conco mitant therapy with the strong inhibitor and for 5 half -lives afterwards  Moderate CYP3A inhibitors –reduce the dose of olaparib to 150 m g twice daily for the duration of conco mitant therapy with the m oderate inhibitor and for 3 half -lives afterwards  After the washout of the inhibitor is co mplete, the olaparib dose ca n be re -escalated. Strong or moderate CYP3A inducers Strong (e.g., phenobarbital, pheny toin, rifampicin, rifabut in, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine, enzalutamide and St John’s Wort) and moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, m odafinil) shoul d not be taken with study treatm ent. If the use of any strong or m oderate CYP3A inducers are considered necessary for the patient’s safet y and welfare this could dim inish the clinical efficacy of o laparib. If a patient requires use of a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer ,then they must bemonitored carefully forany obvious change in the efficacy o f study treatm ent. P-glycoprotein inhibitors It is possible that co -administration of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, azithromycin) may increase exposure to o laparib. Caution shoul d therefore be observed."

Examples of substrates include:  CYP3A4 –horm onal contracepti ve, simvastati n, cisapride, cyclosporine, ergot alkaloids, fentanyl, pimozide, siro limus, tacrolimus and quet iapine  CYP2B6 –bupropion, efavirenz  OATP1B1 –bosentan, glibenclamide, repaglinide, statins and valsartan  OCT1, MATE1, MATE2K –metformin  OCT2 – serum creat inine  OAT3 –furosemide, methotrexate The efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced if co -administered with o laparib. Antico agulant therapy Patients who are taking warfarin may participate in this trial; however, it is recommended that prothrombin t ime, INR be monitored carefully at least once per week for the first month, then monthly if the INR is stable. Subcutaneous hepari n and l ow m olecular weight heparin are permitted. Antiemetic /anti-diarrhoeal drugs From screening onwards, should a patientdevelop nausea, vo miting, and/or diarrhoea, then these symptoms should be reported as AEs (see Section 6.3) and appropriate treatment of the event given. Palliative radiotherapy Palliat ive radiotherapy may be used for the treatment of pain at the site of bony metastases that were present at bas eline, provided the Invest igator does not feel that these are indicat ive of clinical disease progression during the study period. Study treatm ent shoul d be discontinued for a minimum o f 3 days before a patien tundergoes therapeutic palliat ive radiation treatment. Study treatment should be restarted within 4 weeks as lo ng as any bone marrow toxicit y has recovered.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY ASTRAZENECA 8.1 Statistical Considerations A co mprehensive statist ical analys is plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalised prior to the first analysis. All analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives. 8.2 Sample Size Estimate The primary endpo int is invest igator assessed PFS using modified RECIST criteria versio n 1.1. A sample size of approximately 250 patients is proposed for this study in order to provide an adequate level o f precisi on around the primary endpoint in the whol e popul ation. The primar y analysis is planned at approximately 30 mo nths aft er the first patient is enrolled, with an interim analysis after approximately 18 months.A supplem entary analysis of OS will be performed when 135 OS events (~54% maturity) have been recorded, estimated to be approximately 36 months after the first subject is enrolle d. From published data (Study 19, Nova study ) on non -gBRCA patients treated with a PARPi the median PFS ranges from 8 to 9 months compared to 4–5.5 months for those treated with placebo. Clinical trial simulat ions were performed assuming 250 patients enrolled over a 12 month period wi th 50% of patients enrolled after 8 m onths, a median PFS of 8.5 m onths and a piecewise exponent ial model for PFS. Across 500 simulat ions it is estimated that the mean number of PFS events is approximately 135 at 18 mo nths (54% maturity) and 180 at 30 months (72% maturit y), with corresponding mean 95% confidence interval (CI) widths of 3.87 and 3.27 months respect ively. 8.3 Definitions of Analysis Sets All efficacy analyses will be based on the full analysis set (all enrolled patients assigned to olaparib) wit h safet y data summarised from the safety -analysis set (all enrolled pat ients who have received at least one dose of olaparib). The PRO analysis set will consist of the FAS"

At each visit, patients will be programmat ically assigned a RECIST 1.1 visit response of CR, PR, SD or PD depending on the status o f their disease co mpared with baseline and previous assessments. If a patient has had a tumour assessment which cannot be evaluated, then the patientwill be assigned a visit response o f not evaluable (NE) (unless there is evidence of progression in which case the response will be assigned as PD). A visit response of PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum o f the diameters of the target lesio ns (compared to previous minimum sum) or an overall non -target l esion assessment of progression or a ne w lesion. For patients who are in complete response following chemotherapy or are enrolled with no evidence o f disease, progressi on will be based on the presence of a new lesion. The earliest visit response of PD will be used to determine the date of dis ease progressi on. Please refer to Appendix I for the definit ions of Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease and Progressive Disease by m odified RECIST 1.1. Progression -free survival (PFS) PFS i s defined as the time from the date of first dose until the earliest date of disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patientwithdraws from therapy , receives another ant icancer therapy prior to progression or has notable increases in CA- 125. Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment fro m their last evaluable progression assessment. However, if the patient progresses or di es after two or m ore missed visits, the patientwill be censored at the time of the latest evaluable progression assessment prior to the two missed visits. If the patienthas no evaluable visits they will be censored at 1 day unless they die wi thintwo vi sits (17 weeks allowing for vi sit window) from baseline. The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates not visit dates. Assessments/scans contribut ing towards a particular visit may be performed on different dates. The fo llowing rul es will be applied:  Date of p rogression will be determined based on the earliest of the dates of the component that tri ggered the progression  When censoring a patient for PFS the patient will be censored at the latest of the dates contribut ing to a particular overall visit assessment"

Time to first subsequent treatment or death (TFST) TFST is defined as the time fro m the date of the first dose of olaparib to the earliest of the date of death or commencement of f irst subsequent ant icancer treatment . Patients who are alive and have not been recor ded as taking a subsequent anticancer treatm ent will be censored at the last date their treatment status was recorded. Time to study treatment discontinuation or death (TDT) TDT i s defined as the time fro m the date of the first dose olaparib to the earliest of the date of death or discont inuat ion of o laparib. Pati ents who are alive and are st ill receiving olaparib will be censored at the last date the y are known to be alive . Chemotherapy Free Interval (CT -FI) CT-FI is defined as the time fro m the date of the last dose of plat inum chem otherapy in the course immediately prior to enrolment in the study until the date of commencement of the first subsequent ant icancer treatment (whether or not this is chemotherapy). Patients who are alive and have not been recorded as taking a subsequ ent ant icancer treatment will be censored at the last date their treatment status was recorded. Patients who have died prior to the start of a subsequent ant icancer treatment will be censored at their date of death. Calculation or derivation of safety var iables Safety and tol erabilit y will be assessed in terms of AEs, deaths and laboratory data . These will be co llected for all patients. Adverse events AEs (both in terms of the Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] preferred terms and CTCAE grade) will be listed individually by patient. Any AE occurring before treatment with olaparib will be included in the data list ings but will not be included in the summary tables of AEs. Any AE occurring wit hin 30 days of discont inuat ion of o laparib will be included in the AE summaries . Any events in this period that occur after a patient has received further therapy for cancer (fo llowing discont inuation o f olaparib) will be flagged in the data list ings. Other significant adverse events During the evaluat ion of the AE data, an AstraZeneca medically qualified expert will review the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs and AEs leading to discont inuat ion. Based on the expert’s judgement, significant AEs of particular clinical importance may, aft er consultation wit h the Gl obal Patient Safety Physician, be considered other significant adverse events (OAEs) and reported as such in the clinical study report .

Examples of these could be marked haematological and other laboratory abnorm alities, and certain events that lead to intervent ion (other than those already classified as serious), dose reducti on or si gnificant addi tional treatm ent. Calculation or derivation of patient reported outcome variables Health -Related Quality of Life Patient-reported health -related quali ty of life (HRQoL) will be assessed using the FACT -O questionnaire (Basen -Enquist K et al 2001). The FACT -O is com posed of the fo llowing subscales: physical, social/family, emot ional, and funct ional well -being as well as the additional concerns scales consist ing of specific ovarian cancer symptoms. The endpo int for healt h-related qualit y of life analysis will be the Tri al Outcom e Index (TOI), (Cella D et al 1993). Pati ents will be asked to report their healt h-related qualit y of life over the course of the previous 7 day s. The Tri al Outcom e Index (TOI) score will be derived fro m the sum of the scores of the 25 items in cluded in the physical well -being (7 i tems), functional well -being (7 items), and ovari an cancer subscale (11 items) of the FACT -O questi onnaire versi on 4. The total FACT - O score will also be calculated which is made up of the sum of the individual subsca le scores: physical well -being (PWB), social well -being (SWB), emotional well being (EWB) and funct ional well -being (FWB). The scores will be derived in accordance wit h the FACT -O Scoring Manual. A number of items are negatively stated and need to be reve rsed by subtracting the response from “4”. The scoring manual ident ifies that the following items need to be reversed prior to summarizing: GP1-7, GE1, GE3 -6, O1 -3, C2, and B5. After reversing proper items, scores are mult iplied by the number of items in the dom ain. For each subscale, if less than 50% of the subscale items are missing, the subscale score will be divided by the number of non -missing items and multiplied by the total number of items on the subscale. If at least 50% of the items are missin g, that subscale also will be treated as missing. The TOI score ranges fro m 0-100 and the FACT -O fro m 0-152. A higher score indicates a higher HRQoL. The change from baseline in TOI score will be derived for each visit where there is available data. A change of at least 10 points in TOI score isconsidered as a clinically relevant or a minimally important difference (Osoba et al 2005). In this study the 10 -point minimum clinically important difference will be applied only to deterioration . EQ-5D-5L TheEQ-5D-5L index co mprises five dimensio ns of health (mobilit y, self-care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort and anxiet y/depressi on). For each dimensio n, respondents select which statement best describes their healt h on that day from a possible five opti onsof increasing levels o f severi ty (no probl ems, slight probl ems, m oderate probl ems, severe probl ems and unable to/extreme problems). A uni que EQ -5D health state is referred to by a five di git code all owing f or a total of 3125 healt h states. For example, s tate 11111 i ndicates no problems on any of the five dimensions. This data will be converted into a weighted healt h state index by applying scores from EQ5D value sets elicited fro m general popul ation samples (the base case will be the UK valuation"

Where values sets are not available, the EQ -5D-5L to EQ -5D- 3L crosswalk will be applied. In addit ion to the descri ptive system, respondents also assess their health today on a visual analogue scal e (VAS) , ranging fro m 0 (worst imaginable healt h) to 100 (best imaginable health). This score is reported separately . The change from baseline in EQ -5D-5L index score and VAS score will be calculated at each visit. 8.5 Methods for Statistical Analyses The precisi on of all est imates will be presented using a 95% CI noting that the coverage of these intervals assume the pati ents recrui ted are a rando m sample of pat ients with the di sease . Analysis of the primary variable PFS will be summarised using the Kapl an-Meier (KM) method, whi ch will include a graph depicting the proporti on of patients alive and without progression and est imates of median PFS and associ ated 95% CI. In addit ion, progression rates and 95% CIs at clinically important l andmarks (such as 1 year and 18 m onths ) will be est imated using the KM method . The standard error of the natural log of survival t ime will be used to calculate CIs. The CI for the median will be calculated by determining the earliest and latest survival t imes whose 95% CIscontain 0.5. If the 95% CI for survival at the largest event time contains 0.5 then the upper confidence limit will be described as Not Calculated . Sensitivity analyses A sensit ivity analysis may be performed on PFS excluding any patients who di d not have a negat ive gBRCA mutation status confirmed by the central Myriad test. Further details on any sensit ivity analyses will be provi ded in the SAP. Comparison to historical controls In apost-hocexploratory analysis, outcomes fro m this trial may be co mpared to historical data from published studi es in a com parable pat ient popul ation treated with placebo . Such an analysis does not form part of the formal study objectives . Subgroup analysis The primary endpoint will be summarised by HRD status in the fo llowing subgroups: HRD scar positive and so matic BRCA mutated HRD scar positive,non-BRCA mutated HRD scar negat ive, non -BRCA mutated In exploratory analysis, PFS will also be summarised according to a range of mo lecular sub - groups i ncluding mutati ons in ho mologous recombinat ion repair (HRR) genes, microsatellite instabilit y (MSI) status, and tumour mutation load score (see Section 5.6) . In addi tion, PFS will be summarised according to important clinical characterist ics, which will include:  Best response to the last plat inum regimen (CR or PR)"

Analysis of the secondary/exploratory variable s Overall Survival OS will be summarised using a KM plot to estimate the median and proporti on of patients alive at clinically relevant time points such as 12, 24 and 30 months Other Time -to-event endpoints TFST, TDT and CT -FI will be summarised using a KM plot to estimate the median and event rates from clinically important l andmarks such as 1 and 2 y ears. FACT -O Descript ive summary statist ics and g raphs will be reported for the TOI by visit as well as the change in TOI score from baseline. The proporti on of patients wi th any improvement from baseline in TOI score and the proporti on of patients wi th at least a 10 point deteriorat ion from baseline in TOI score will be estimated together with the exact 95% CI. Addit ional analyses may be performed and will be described in the SAP. EQ-5D-5L Descript ive statistics will be calculated for each scheduled visit/t ime point in the study. Addit ionally summary statistics will be reported for the EQ -5D index score and the EQ- VAS score, and the change fro m baseline for the EQ -5D index score and the EQ -VAS score. Graphical plots of the mean EQ -5D index score and EQ -VAS score, including change from baseline, and ass ociated 95% CI by scheduled visit s/time po ints in the study will be produced. Addit ional analyses may be performed and will be described in the SAP. 8.5.3 Interim Analysis An interim analysis o f PFS will be performed approximately 18 m onths after the fir st pati ent is enro lled into the study , for internal planning purposes, and to provide ongoing data to external bodies . Based upon simulat ions (see Section 8.2) it is est imated that approximately 135 events will have occurred at the time of the interim anal ysis, equating to approximately 54% data maturit y. Further details on the interim analysis will be provided in the SAP."

STUDY AND DATA MANAGEMENT 9.1 Training of Study Site Staff Before the first patient is entered into the study, the CRO will review and discuss the requi rements of the Clinical Study Protocol and related documents with the invest igational staff and train them in any study -specific procedures and any system (s) utilised. The Principal Invest igator will ensure that appropriat e training relevant to the study is given to all of these staff, and that any new informati on relevant to the performance of this study is forwarded to the staff invo lved. The Principal Invest igator will maintain a record of all individuals invo lved in the study (medical , nursing and other staff). 9.2 Monitoring of the Study During the study , the CRO will have regular contacts with the study site, including visits to:  Provi de inform ation and support to the Invest igator(s)  Confirm that facilit ies remain acceptable  Confirm that the invest igational team is adhering to the Clinical Study Protocol , that data are being accurately and timely recorded in the CRFs , that bi ological samples are handled in accordance wit h the Laboratory Manual and that study drug ac countabilit y checks are being performed  Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the CRFs wit h the patient’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study ) including verificat ion of informed conse nt of participat ing patients. This will require direct access to all original records for each patient(e.g., clinic charts )  Ensure withdrawal of informed consent to the use of the patient’ s bio logical samples is reported and bio logical samples are i dentified and disposed of/destroy ed accordingly, and the action is documented, and reported to the patient . The CRO will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff at the centre needs information and advice about the study conduct. Source data Refer to the Clinical Study Agreemen t for locati on of source data. Study agreements The Principal Invest igator at each centre should comply with all the terms, conditions, and obligat ions of the Study Agreement with the Principal Invest igator, or equivalent, for this study .In the event of any inconsistency between this clinical study protocol (CSP)and the Study Agreement with Principal Invest igator, the terms of CSP shall prevail wit h respect to the conduct of the study and the treatment of patients and in all other respects, not relating to study"

Agreements between AstraZeneca and the Principal Invest igator should be in place before any study -related procedures can take place, or any patients are enrolled. Agreements between AstraZeneca and the Principal Investigator should be in place before any study -related procedures can take place, or patients are enrolled. Archiving of study documents Study files. AstraZeneca will provide the Principal Invest igator with a file in which to organise and retain all study-related documents. All study docum ents (including letters from AstraZeneca) shoul d be retained in this file by the Principal Investi gator. The monitor will regul arly check the file to ensure that all relevant docum ents are retained. The contents of the file may be audited/inspected by AstraZeneca’s auditor, regulatory authori ties, or IRB. Period of record retention . The study site (and the Principal Investi gator) will retain the essent ial docum ents specified in the ICH GCP (e.g., source document such as medical records, contract, si gned consent form ). Essenti al documents shoul d be retained at the study site for at least 15 years following completion of the study , or per regulatory obligat ions if longer, and thereafter destroyed only after agreem ent with AstraZeneca. However ,this is not always applied to those that are not preservable such as blood samples. In the event of any inconsistency between the above -ment ioned contents and the contract with the study site, the contr act shall prevail. These docum ents shoul d be retained for a longer period however if needed by AstraZeneca, and the specific period and method of retenti on will be separately discussed between t he study site and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca should notify the head of the study site in writing when the study related records are no longer needed. The records shoul d be managed by a responsible person appo inted by the head of the study site.The Invest igator follows the principles outlined in the Clinical Study Agreement or the equivalent (e.g.,site contract with CRO) . Deviation from the clinical study protocol The Investigator(s) must not deviate from or make any changes to the protocol without docum ented agreem ent between the Principal Investigator and AstraZene ca or the IRB approval based on i ts deliberat ions.However, this shall not apply to cases where the deviat ion or change is necessary to avoi d an immediate hazard to the patients or for other compelling medical reasons, or where the changes invo lve only lo gistical or administrative aspects of the clinical study (e.g., changes to the organisat ion/structure of AstraZeneca, the name/department name of the study site, the address or phone number of the study siteor AstraZeneca, the job tit le of the Invest igator, and mo nitors). The Investigator(s) should document any deviation fro m the protocol regardless o f their reasons. Only when the protocol was not fo llowed in order to avoid an immediate hazard to the pati ents or for other medically com pelling reason, the Invest igator should prepare and submit the records explaining the reasons thereof to AstraZeneca and the head of study site, and retain a copy of the records. The Investigator(s) may deviate fro m or make a change to the protocol without documented agreement between the Principal Investigator and AstraZeneca or the IRB approval, only in the event of a medical emergency, e.g., it is only way to avoid an immediate hazard to the patients.

Discontinuation or suspension o f the who le study programme If AstraZeneca decides to prematurely terminate or suspend the study , the Principal Invest igator/Invest igator, the head o f the study site, and regulatory authori ties shoul d receive written notificat ion of the reasons for the premature terminat ion or suspensio n. The Principal Invest igator/Invest igator will immediately notify the decisio n to the patients, give appropriate medical treatment; take necessary measures, and record treatment o r measures provided on the source documents. Completion of the study Upon terminat ing the study , the Principal Invest igator/Invest igator will report in writing the completion of the study as well as the summary of the resul ts to th e head of the study site in accordance with the study site’s rules. The head of the study site, who is informed of the termination by the Investigator, will provide a written notificat ion of the results to the IRB and AstraZeneca. The end o f the study is defined as ‘the l ast vi sit of the last patientundergoing the study ’. Thedata cut -off for the primary analysis will be when all patient s receiving olaparib have been followed for aminimum period of 18 months since the start of treatment. New data will be added to the clinical d atabase after this time po intto provide addit ional data maturit y for the OS analysis . Patientsarepermitted to continue to receive study treatment beyo nd the closure of the database if, in the opini on of the Investi gator, they are continuing to receive benefit from treatm ent wi th olaparib . For patient s who do continue to receive treatm ent bey ond the t ime of this data cut-off, Invest igators will continue to report all SAEs to the AstraZeneca representati ve until 30 days after study treatment is discontinued, in accordance with Section 6.4(Reporting of Serious Adverse Events) . If an Invest igator learns o f any SAEs, including death, at any t ime after a patient has completed the study , and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibilit y that the event is causally related to the IP, the Investigator shoul d notify the AstraZeneca representative . Addit ionally as stated in Section 6.3(Recordin g of Adverse Events), any SAE or non-SAE that is ongoing at the time of this data cut-off, must be followed up to res olution unless the event is considered by the Invest igator to be unlikely to resolve, or the patientis lost to fo llow up. The study is expected to start in Q1 201 8and to end by Q1 202 1 The study may be terminated at individual centres if the study procedures are not being perform ed according to Good Clinical Pract ice (GCP) , or if recruit ment is slow. AstraZeneca may also te rminate the entire study prem aturely if concerns for safet y arise wi thin this study or in any other study with olaparib."

Introduction This appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately report cases of Hy’s Law (HL). It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the manag ement of el evated liver biochemistries . Specific guidance on managing liver abnorm alities can be found in Sect ion 6.3.7 of the Clinical Study Protocol . During the course of the study the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry . The Invest igator is responsible for determining whether a patientmeets potenti al Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study . The Investigator partic ipates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met. HL cri teria are m et if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver biochem istry other than drug -induced liver injury (DILI) caused by the invest igational medicinal product (IMP). The Investi gator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes . 2. Definitions Potential Hy’s Law Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3 x upper limit of norm al (ULN) together with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2 x ULN at any po int during the study following the start of study medicat ion irrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) . Hy’s Law AST or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 x ULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the co mbinat ion of increases, e.g., elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug. For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e. , on the sam e day) the el evation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur . 3. Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases In order to i dentify cases of PHL ,it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any patientwho meets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in isolation or in combinat ion:  ALT ≥ 3xULN  AST ≥ 3xULN  TBL ≥ 2xULN"

Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all cases where PHL cri teria are m et. No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP. The AstraZeneca Glo bal Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safety Physician will also be involved in this review together with other patientmatter experts as appropriate. According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the instructi ons bel ow. If there is an agreed alternat ive explanat ion for the ALT or AST and TBL el evations, a determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE :  If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the appropriate CRF  If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, record the AE/SAE in the CRF accordingly and fo llow the AstraZeneca standard processes If it is agreed that there is noexplanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations other than the IMP :  Report a SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard processes. The ‘Medically Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious criteria apply As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned. If, there i s an unavo idable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made :  Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and causalit y assessment as per above"

Once the necessary supplementary informat ion is obt ained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are met. Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the review amending the reported term if an alternative explanat ion for the liver biochemistry elevat ions is determined . 6.Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Are Met Before and After Starting Study Treatment This sect ion is applicable to patient s with liver m etastases who m eet PHL cri teria on study treatm ent having previously met PHL cri teria at a study visit prior to starti ng study treatm ent. At the first on study treatm ent occurrence of PHL criteria being met the Invest igator will :  Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’ condit ion# co mpared with the l ast visit where PHL criteria were met# If there is no significant change ,no action is required If there is a significant change ,notify the AstraZeneca representative, who will inform the central Study Team , then foll ow the subsequent process described i n Secti on 4.2of this a ppendix # A ‘significant’ change in the patient ’s condit ion refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in iso lation or in combinat ion, or a clinically relevant change in asso ciated symptoms.

Definition of Measurable, Non -measurable, Target and Non -target Lesions Patients wi th at least one lesio n (measurable and/or non -measurable) that can be accurately assessed at baseline by com puteri sed tom ography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) , or wi th no m easureable disease, maybe included in this study . Measurable lesions A lesio n, not previously irradiated, that can be measured accurately at baseline as ≥ 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have a short axis ≥ 15 mm wi th CT or MRI )and which is suitable for accurate repeated meas urements. CT slice thickness should be no greater than 5mm . Non-measurable lesions  All other lesio ns, including small lesio ns (lo ngest di ameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 mm to < 15 mm short axis at baseline ). Nodes wi th < 10 mm short a xis are considered non -patho logical and shoul d not be recorded as non - target lesio ns (NTLs)  Truly non -measurable lesio ns include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural / pericardial effusio n, inflammatory breast di sease, lymp hangit ic involvement of skin or lung, abdo minal masses/abdo minal organom egaly identified by physical examinat ion that are not measurable by CT or MRI  Previously irradiated l esions as l ocalised post -radiation changes, which affect lesio n sizes, m ay occur. Therefore, lesio ns that have been previously irradiated will not be considered measurable and should be selected as NTLs at baseline and fo llowed up as part of the NTL assessment  Skin l esions assessed by clinical examinat ion  Brain metastas es Special cases  Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic–blast ic lesio ns, with ident ifiable so ft tissue components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definit ion of measurabilit y. Bl astic lesio ns are considered non -measurable.  Cystic met astases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for measurabilit y from a radi ological point of view, but if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these non -cystic lesions shoul d be selected as the target lesio ns (TLs)."

Non-target lesions All other lesio ns (or sites o f disease) not recorded as TLs should be ident ified as NTLs at baseline. Methods of Measurement The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterise each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. The methods to be used for RECIST assessment are summarised in Table 7and those excluded for tumour assessments in this study are di scussed below, with the rationale provi ded. Table 7 Summary of Methods of Assessment Target Lesions Non target lesions New Lesions CT (preferred) MRICT (preferred) MRI Plain X -ray (includes chest X - ray) Clinical examination CT (preferred) MRI Plain X -ray (includes chest X - ray) Clinical examination Ultrasound FDG -PET CT and MRI CT and MRI are generally considered to be the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure TLs selected for response assessment and to assess NTLs and ident ificat ion of new lesio ns. In thi s study it is recommended that CT examinat ions will be used to assess tumour burden at baseline and fo llow-up visi ts. CT examinat ion with intravenous contrast media administration is the preferred method. MRI should be used where CT is not feasible or it is medically contra -indicated. For assessment of brain lesio ns MRI i s the preferred method. Clinical examination Clinical examinat ion will not be used for assessment of TLs. Clinically detected l esions can be selected as TLs if they are then assessed by CT or MRI scans. Clinical examinat ion can be used to assess NTLs in pat ients that also have other lesio ns assessable by CT, MRI and to identify the presence o f new lesio ns."

Chest X -ray Chest X -rays will not be used for assessment of TLs as they will be assessed by CT or MRI examinat ion. Chest X -rays can, however, be used to assess NTLs and to ident ify the presence of new lesio ns. Ultrasound Ultrasound examinat ion will not be used for assessment of TLs and NTLs as it is not a reproducible method, does n ot provi de an accurate assessment of tumour size and it is subjective and operator dependent. Ultrasound examinat ion can, however, be used to ident ify the presence o f new lesio ns. If new clinical symptoms occur and an ultrasound is performed then new lesi ons shoul d be confirmed by CT or MRI examinat ion. Endoscopy and laparoscopy Endoscopy and l aparoscopy will not be used for tumour assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumour measurements. Tumour markers Tumour markers will not be used f or tum our response assessments per RECIST 1.1. Cytology and histology Histology will not be used as part of the tumour response assessment per RECIST 1.1. Cytological confirmat ion of the neoplast ic origin of any effusio n that appears or worsens during tr eatment is required when the measurable tumour has met criteria for response or stable disease. In such circumstances, the cy tology is necessary to different iate between response / stable disease (an effusio n may be a side effect of the treatment) and pro gressive disease (if the neoplast ic origin o f the fluid is confirm ed). Where cy tology findings are not available, any effusi on that si gnificant ly worsens (fro m trace to l arge) or the appearance of a clinically significant effusio n (requi ring change in dru g therapy ) during the study treatm ent will be considered to be progression of NTLs or disease progression due to new lesio ns. FDG -PET scan FDG -PET (fl uorodeoxy glucose posi tron emissio n tomography ) scans may be used as a method for ident ifying new lesio ns,according with the fo llowing algori thm: New lesi ons will be recorded where there is posit ive FDG uptake (defined as when an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue is observed) not present on baseline FDG -PET scan or in a location corresponding to a new lesio n on CT/MRI at the same fo llow-up visi t. If there is no baseline FDG -PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesio ns on CT/MRI scans then follow-up CT/MRI assessments should be cont inued, scheduled as per protocol or clinical indic ated, in order to confirm new lesio ns."

Any other sites at which new disease is suspected shoul d also be adequately imaged at follow-up. Target lesions Documentation of target lesions A maximum of 5 measurable lesio ns, wi th a maximum o f 2 lesions per organ (including lymph nodes), representative of all lesions invo lved, should be identified as TLs at baseline. Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non -nodal lesions or shor t axis for nodal lesio ns) but in addit ion should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesio n does not l end i tself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected. The site and locat ion of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes). All measurements should be recorded in millimetres. At baseline, the sum o f the diameters for all TLs will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. At fo llow-up visits the sum o f diameters for all TLs will be calculated and reported as the follow -up sum of diam eters. Specia l cases:  For TLs m easurable in 2 or 3 dimensio ns, always report the longest diameter. For pathol ogical lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis.  If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is > 5mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan.  If a lesio n has co mpletely disappeared, the longest diameter should be recorded as 0mm.  If a TL split s into two or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts  If two or more TLs merge then the sum o f the diameters of the combined lesio n shoul d be recorded for one of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesio n(s)  If a TL i s believed to be present and is faint ly seen but too sm all to measure, a defaul t value of 5 mm should be assigned. If an accurate measure can be given, this shoul d be recorded, even if it is below 5mm.  If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an est imate of the si ze of the l esion  When a TL has had any int ervent ion eg, radi otherapy , embo lisation, surgery etc, during the study , the si ze of the TL should st ill be provi ded where possible"

In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the TLs were not assessed or not evaluable or had a lesion interventi on at this visit.

Note: For patients without TLs at baseline, this is relevant if any of the NTLs were not assessed at this visit and the progression criteria have not been met. To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of NTLs, there must be an overall level o f substant ial worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in TLs, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficient ly to merit discont inuat ion of therapy . A modest ‘increase’ in the size o f one or m ore NTLs is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. New Lesions Details o f any new lesio ns will also be recorded with the date of assessment. The presence of one or m ore new l esions is assessed as progression. A lesion identified at a follow up assessment in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progression. The finding of a new lesio n shoul d be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modalit y or findings thought to represent something other than tumour. If a new lesio n is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumour assessments should be cont inued unt il the new lesion has been confirmed. If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesio n, then the progression date should be declared using the date of the init ial scan. Symptomatic deterioration Symptom atic deteri oration is not a descriptor of an object ive response: it is a r eason for stopping study therapy . Patients wi th ‘symptom atic deterioration’ requiring discont inuat ion of study treatm ent wi thout objective evidence of disease progression at that time will undergo no further tumour assessments in this study .

The use of standardised protocol s for CT and MRI allows comparabilit y both within and between different studies, irrespect ive of where the examinat ion has been undertaken. CT Scan CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be cont iguous throughout all the anatomical regio ns of interest. The m ost cri tical CT image acquisit ion parameters for optimal tumour evaluat ion using RECIST 1.1 are anatomic coverage, contrast administration, slice thickness, and reconstruction interval. Anatomic coverage Optimal anatomic coverage for most solid tumours is the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Coverage should enco mpass all areas of known predilect ion for metastases in the disease under evaluat ion and shoul d addi tionally invest igate areas that may be invo lved based on signs and sy mptoms of individual patients. Because a lesio n later i dentified in a body part not scanned at baseline would be considered as a new lesio n represent ing disease progression, careful considerat ion should be given to the extent of imaging coverage at baseli ne and at subsequent fo llow-up time points. This will enable better consistency not only of tumour measurements but also ident ification o f new disease. Intravenous contrast administration Optimal visualisat ion and m easurement of m etastases in so lid tumour s requi res consistent administration (dose and rate) of intravenous contrast as well as t iming o f scanning. Typically , most abdominal imaging is performed during the portal venous phase and (optimally) about the sam e time frame after inject ion on each exa minat ion. An adequate volume of a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are demonstrated to best effect and a consistent method is used on subsequent examinat ions for any given pat ient."
105,page_105,"Clinical Study Protocol Appendix I Drug Substance Olaparib, AZD2281, KU 0059436 Study Code D0816C00020 Version 3.0 Date 26October 2018 106 (111 )It is very important that the sam e techni que be used at baseline and on fo llow- up examinat ions for a gi ven pati ent. F or pati ents who develop contraindicat ions to con trast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decisio n as to whether non -contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non-enhanced) shoul d be per formed shoul d also be based on the tumour ty pe, anatomic location of the disease and should be optimised to allow for comparison to the prior studies if possible. Each case should be discussed wit h the radi ologist to determine if subst itution of these oth er approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward. Care must be taken in measurement of TLs on a different modalit y and interpretation of non -target di sease or new lesions, since the same lesio n may appear to have a different size using a new modalit y. Oral contrast i s recommended to help visualise and different iate structures in the abdo men. If iodine contrast m edia is medically contraindicated at baseline or at any time during the course of the study then the recommended methods are: CT thoracic examinat ion without contrast and abdominal and pelvic MRI with contrast. If MRI cannot be performed then CT without intravenous contrast is an option for the thorax, abdomen and pelvic examinat ions. Slice thickness and reconstruction material It is recommended that CT scans be performed at 5mm cont iguous slice thickness and this guideline presumes a minimum 5 mm thickness in recommendat ions for the m easurable l esion definit ion. Except ionally, parti cular insti tutions may perform medically acceptable scans at slice thi cknesses greater than 5 mm. If this occurs, the minimum size of measurable lesio ns at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scans. All window settings should be included in the assessment, particularly in the thorax where lung and soft tissue windows should be considered. When measuring lesio ns, the TLs should be measured on the same window setting for repeated examinat ions throughout the study . All images from each examinat ion shoul d be included in the assessment and not “selected” images of the apparent lesio n. MRI Scan MRI has excellent contrast, spatial and temporal resolut ion; however, there are many image acquisit ion variables invo lved in MRI, which greatly imp act image qualit y, lesion conspicuit y and measurement. Furthermore, the availabilit y of MRI is variable glo bally . The m odali ty used at follow -up shoul d be the same as was used at baseline and the lesio ns should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequ ence. Generally , axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis wit h T1 and T2 weighted imaging along wit h gado linium -enhanced imaging should be perform ed. The field of view, matrix, number of excitat ions, phase encode steps, use of fat suppressio n and fast sequences should be optimised for the specific body part being imaged as well as the scanner utilised. It is beyo nd the scope of this appendix to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts and diseases. Ideally, the same t ype of scanner should be used and the image acquisit ion protocol shoul d be f ollowed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans shoul d be perform ed wi th breath -hold scanning techniques if possible. For these reasons, CT is the imaging modalit y of choice."

If FDG -PET scans are included in a protocol, an FDG uptake period of 60 min prior to imaging has been decided as the most appr opriate for imaging of patients with malignancy. Who le-body acquisit ion is important since this allows for sampling of all areas of interest and can assess if new lesio ns have appeared thus determining the possibilit y of interval progressi on of disease. Images fro m the base of the skull to the level o f the mid -thigh shoul d be obtained 60 min post inject ion. PET camera specificat ions are variable and manufacturer specific, so every attem pt shoul d be made to use the same scanner, or the same model scanner , for seri al scans on the same pat ient. Who le-body acquisit ions can be perform ed in eit her 2 -or 3-dimensio nal mode wi th attenuati on correcti on, but the m ethod chosen should be consistent across all pat ients and seri al scans in the clinical trial. PET/CT scans At present, low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined PET –CT are of limited use in anatomically based efficacy assessments and it i s therefore suggested that they shoul d not be subst ituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast enhanced CT scans for tum our measurements by RECIST 1.1. In except ional situations, if a site can document that the CT perform ed as part of a PET –CT is o f ident ical diagnostic qualit y to a diagnost ic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CT portion of the PET–C T can be used for RECIST measurements. However, this is not recommended because the PET portion of the CT introduces addit ional data that may bias an invest igator if it is not routinely or serially performed.
