In this document, the term investigator refers to the individual responsible for the overall conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. 3.1 Background information 3.1.1 Type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism. The pathogenesis is not fully understood but seems to be heterogeneous, involving environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors leading to chronic hyperglycaemia caused by peripheral tissue insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion due to abnormal β-cell function and abnormal glucose metabolism in the liver3. Optimal glycaemic control is the treatment goal in subjects with T2D in order to prevent long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia 4. Despite the availability of several antidiabetic drugs, a significant proportion of subjects with T2D do not achieve the recommended blood glucose (BG) target levels 5, 6. 3.1.2 Glucagon-like peptide-1 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incre tin hormone with a glucose-dependent stimulatory effect on insulin and inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets7, 8. Subjects with T2D have a decreased incretin effect9-12. However, the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 and thus, the ability to lower BG levels, is preserved when GLP-1 is administered at supraphysiological levels13. In addition, supraphysiological levels of GLP-1 induce reduction in body weight14. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation 15, 16. Physiologically, GLP-1 also has a pronounced inhibitory effect on gastric emptying; however this effect seems to diminish upon chronic exposure 14-16. These mechanisms of action make glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) an attractive pharmacological treatment for T2D17-19. 3.1.3 Semaglutide Semaglutide is a potent human GLP-1 analogue with a pharmacokinetics (PK) profile suitable for once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. It is structurally similar to liraglutide (Victoza®), a once-daily GLP-1 RA developed by Novo Nordisk and approved worldwide for the treatment of CONFIDENTIAL"

The extended half-life of the semaglutide molecule is primarily obtained due to binding to albumin, which is facilitated by a large fatty acid derived chemical moiety attached to the lysine in position 26. The specific modifications in the molecule are: 1) a modification in position 8 (alanine to 2-aminoisobutyric acid) of the peptide backbone to increase stability against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), and a change in position 34 from a lysine to an arginine to limit the options for acylation to the one remaining lysine in the sequence; 2) a large hydrophilic spacer between the lysine in position 26 and the gamma glutamate whereto the fatty acid is attached; 3) a C18 fatty di- acid with a terminal acidic group20, 21. The spacer and the fatty acid both contribute to increased albumin binding, which results in decreased renal clearance resulting in a prolonged half-life of approximately 1 week, making semaglutide suitable for once-weekly s.c. administration. 3.1.4 Nonclinical data 3.1.4.1 Semaglutide The nonclinical programme for semaglutide was designed according to the ICH M3 22guideline to support the clinical development. The standard nonclinical data package required to support phase 3 clinical trials has been completed. In addition, 2-year carcinogenicity studies and a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study have been completed. Semaglutide is generally well tolerated with expected GLP-1 effects on food intake and body weight being dose limiting in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Two potential safety issues have been identified and are detailed below. Thyroid C-cell tumours in rodents Thyroid C-cell neoplasia was seen in mice and rat 2-year carcinogenicity studies. Proliferative C- cell changes in rodents are a known effect following GLP-1 receptor activation by GLP-1 receptor agonists. The finding in rodents is caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. Recently published data have shown that the GLP-1 receptor is not expressed in the normal human thyroid, and accordingly, the risk of GLP-1 receptor mediated C-cell changes in humans is considered to be low23. Embryo−foetal development toxicity Semaglutide adversely affected embryo −foetal development in the rat by a GLP-1 receptor- mediated impaired function of the inverted yolk sac placenta during a period of gestation when the rat embryo is entirely dependent on the inverted yolk sac placenta for its nutrient supply. In primates, the yolk sac does not invert to fully enclose the embryo, and it does not come in direct contact with the uterine wall to form a placenta as in rodents. Accordingly, the mechanism by which semaglutide adversely affects embryo-foetal development in the rat, is not likely to be of relevance to humans. Studies in cynomolgus monkeys confirmed that maternal dosing of semaglutide does not affect embryo −foetal development in this species. However, the initial CONFIDENTIAL"

In cynomolgus monkeys, the overall developmental no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) was determined to be 0.015 mg/kg/3 days, which provides an exposure equivalent to the human exposure at 1.0 mg/week based on area under the curve (AUC). A comprehensive review of results from the nonclinical studies can be found in the current edition of semaglutide (NN9535) investigator’s brochure (IB)24, or any updates hereof. 3.1.5 Clinical data – semaglutide As of 1 August 2016, 16 clinical pharmacology trials (trials NN9535-1820, 3679, 3633, 3616, 3819, 4010, 3789, 3652, 3685, 3634, 3687, 3817,3818, 3684, 3651 and 3635), 1 phase 2 trial (NN9535- 1821) and 8 phase 3a trials (NN9535-3623, 3624, 3625,3626, 3627, 3744, 4091, 4092) have been completed with semaglutide s.c. once-weekly. Clinical pharmacology trials were conducted in healthy subjects, in subjects with T2D, in subjects with obesity and in subjects with renal- and hepatic impairment. Semaglutide phase 3a programme evaluated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in a broad T2D population and covered the continuum of T2D care. The programme evaluated mono- and combination therapy with antiglycaemic therapies and compared semaglutide with the most important comparators at the time of initiating the phase 3a programme. In addition, the phase 3a programme included a long-term (104-week) cardiovascular outcomes trial (trial 3744) in a T2D population at high risk of cardiovascular events. 3.1.5.1 Pharmacokinetics The results from the completed clinical pharmacology trials confirm that semaglutide has PK properties compatible with once-weekly administration, having a flat concentration profile over time, with a median time to maximum concentration (t max) of 1−3 days post-dosing and an elimination half-life (t ½) of approximately 1 week. The PK properties of semaglutide appear comparable between healthy subjects, subjects with T2D and subjects with renal failure. Results from drug-interaction studies with warfarin, metformin, atorvastatin and digoxin indicate that no dose adjustment of the co-administered drugs is warranted when administered together with semaglutide. In addition, semaglutide does not decrease the exposure of oral contraceptives and hence, is not anticipated to decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. 3.1.5.2 Efficacy Based on results from the clinical pharmacology trials, semaglutide treatment reduced both fasting and postprandial glucose compared to placebo, by improving multiple aspects of β-cell function and by reducing both fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations, all in a glucose dependent CONFIDENTIAL"

The weight loss observed with semaglutide was primarily from fat tissue and was considered to be explained by lowered appetite, both in the fasting and postprandial state, and lowered energy intake. In addition, semaglutide improved control of eating and reduced food cravings. Similar to other GLP-1 receptor agonists, semaglutide caused a minor delay of early postprandial gastric emptying. Both as monotherapy and as combination therapy, semaglutide significantly reduced HbA 1cand body weight in all phase 3a trials when compared with the trial-specific comparator, including the active comparators sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin glargine. In the 5 global phase 3a trials (3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627), reductions in HbA 1cand body weight of up to 1.85 %-point and 6.42 kg, respectively, were obtained with semaglutide 1.0 mg. Significantly more subjects with semaglutide versus comparators reached the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)-defined treatment target of an HbA 1c <7% and ≤6.5%, respectively, and weight loss responses of ≥5% and ≥10%. The superior and clinically relevant beneficial effects of semaglutide on glycaemic control as estimated by HbA 1c were substantiated by improvements in secondary glycaemia-related supportive endpoints25-28. 3.1.5.3 Safety Data from the 5 global phase 3a clinical trials (NN9535-3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627) showed that the safety and tolerability of semaglutide at doses up to 1.0 mg per week and administered for up to 56 weeks of treatment were consistent with other GLP-1RAs. Commonly AEs included nausea and vomiting, most of which were mild to moderate in severity. The escalation regimen utilized was associated with good tolerability and low numbers of discontinuation due to AEs. Accordingly, the most frequently reported AEs in subjects with T2D were gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea and vomiting), as were the most frequent AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation. Hypoglycaemia occurred infrequently in subjects receiving semaglutide and the events were mainly non-severe. Hypoglycaemic episodes have mainly been observed when semaglutide is combined with sulphonylurea (SU) or insulin. In line with findings for other GLP-1 RAs, an increase in heart rate and serum levels of lipase and amylase has also been observed in subjects exposed to semaglutide. As with all protein based pharmaceuticals, subjects treated with semaglutide may develop immunogenic and allergic reactions. However, only few subjects administered semaglutide experienced allergic reactions and injection site reactions. These have mainly been mild and transient of nature; however, more generalised reactions may occur. The effect of semaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was evaluated in a T2D population at high risk for CV events, in the cardiovascular outcome trial, SUSTAIN 6 (NN9535- 3744) 29. SUSTAIN 6 trial achieved its primary objective by showing non-inferiority of once-weekly s.c. semaglutide versus placebo on cardiovascular outcomes; moreover, s.c. semaglutide statisticallysignificantly reduced cardiovascular risk versus placebo 29. In addition, results from the recently CONFIDENTIAL"

In fact, treatment with liraglutide reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome consisting of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke by 13% versus placebo30. The overall safety profile of semaglutide in the SUSTAIN 6 trial (NN9535-3744) was consistent with previous semaglutide clinical studies. However, in this trial, the diabetic retinopathy complications were reported more frequently in the semaglutide-treated subjects compared with placebo. Please see Section 18for more details.

Subjects with T2D inadequately controlled on an SGLT-2 inhibitor monotherapy or in combination with either metformin or SU will be randomised in a 1:1 manner to receive either semaglutide 1.0 mg once-weekly or placebo once-weekly. The randomisation will be stratified based on anti- diabetic background medication at screening (subject using SU or not using SU) and country (Japan/other) to ensure a 1:1 distribution of the two treatment arms within each stratum. Subjects continue participation in the trial regardless the occurrence of premature discontinuation of trial product or the initiation of rescue medication. After the treatment period of approximately 30 weeks in total, all subjects enter a follow-up period of 5 weeks, ending by a follow-up phone contact (visit 10). Total trial duration for the individual subjects is approximately 37 weeks. The trial design is summarised schematically in Figure 5–1 : Figure 5–1 Trial design CONFIDENTIAL"

Furthermore, the trial is designed to address and compare tolerability, patient well-being and treatment satisfaction. Subjects will be randomised to one of the two treatment arms and the trial will be double-blinded to minimise bias. The treatment duration will be 30 weeks, which is considered adequate for assessment of effect, safety, tolerability and patient satisfaction. The follow-up period is 5 weeks to allow for wash-out of semaglutide. 5.3 Treatment of subjects Semaglutide/placebo Both semaglutide and placebo will be administered once-weekly as s.c. injections. Treatment with semaglutide/placebo once-weekly must follow a fixed dose escalation. The maintenance dose of semaglutide 1.0 mg is reached after 4 doses (4 weeks) of 0.25 mg, followed by 4 doses (4 weeks) of 0.5 mg. The same fixed dose escalation scheme is followed for placebo, with respective dose-matching volume. During the maintenance period (V4-V9, doses must not be changed. Background medication After signing the informed consent, subjects should continue their anti-diabetic background medication (SGLT-2 inhibitor monotherapy or in combination (including fixed-dose drug combination) with either metformin or SU) throughout the entire trial. The background medication should be maintained at the same dose level as given at trial entry and with the same frequency during the entire treatment period unless rescue criteria are met (see Section 6.4) or in case a safety concern related to acute renal impairment (see Section 18.1.3 ) or hospitalization for major surgical procedures or acute serious medical illnesses occurs. In addition, all background medication: !is considered to be non-investigational medicinal product (NIMP). !will not be provided by Novo Nordisk A/S, except if required by local regulations and not in contradiction to local regulations. !should be used in accordance with standard of care and current approved label in the individual country. !should not exceed the maximum approved dose in the individual country.CONFIDENTIAL"

Metformin Metformin should be used in accordance with standard of care in the individual country at the discretion of the investigator. However, the maximum approved dose in the individual country must not be exceeded. 5.4 Injection site Injections should be administered in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm, at any time of the day irrespective of meals. Injections should be administered on the same day of the week during the trial. Injections should not be administered intravenously or intramuscular. 5.5 Missed dose If a semaglutide dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as noticed, provided the time to the next scheduled dose is at least 2 days (48 hours). If a dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days (48 hours) away, the subject should not administer the missed dose. A missed dose should not affect the scheduled dosing day of the week. 5.6 Treatment after discontinuation of trial product When discontinuing trial products, either at the scheduled end of treatment visit or if trial product is discontinued prematurely, the subject should be switched to a suitable marketed product at the discretion of the investigator, while taking into consideration the long half-life of semaglutide. 5.7 Rationale for treatment Semaglutide has been developed for s.c. administration. In this trial, semaglutide will be dose- escalated to the highest maintenance dose of 1.0 mg once-weekly, to investigate and compare the effect and safety of semaglutide versus placebo when added to SGLT-2 inhibitor monotherapy or in combination with either metformin or SU. Placebo has been chosen as comparator to investigate the effect as add-on to SGLT-2 inhibitor monotherapy or in combination with either metformin or SU, accounting for the placebo effect. The duration of randomised treatments is considered adequate to collect sufficient data on effect and safety in accordance with the trial objectives.CONFIDENTIAL"

Basal and squamous cell skin cancer and any carcinoma in-situ is allowed. 6.4 Rescue criteria Subjects with persistent and unacceptable hyperglycaemia should be offered treatment intensification and the conclusion of the consideration to be documented in the medical records. If any of the FPG values (including protocol scheduled fasting SMPG) exceed the limits outlined below and no intercurrent cause of the hyperglycaemia can be identified, a confirmatory FPG (at central laboratory) should be obtained by calling the subject for a re-test. If the confirmatory FPG also exceeds the value described below, the subject should be offered rescue medication (i.e. intensification of anti-diabetic background medication and/or initiation of new anti-diabetic medication): !13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dl) from week 8 to end of week 13 !11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dl) from week 14 to end of treatment It is important for trial integrity that only subjects actually needing treatment intensification (as defined above) are started on rescue medication. Subjects that are started on rescue medication should continue to follow the protocol-specified visit schedule. Rescue medication should be prescribed at the investigator’s discretion as add-on to randomised treatment and according to ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes guidelines33, 34(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP- 4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). Rescue medication and any changes hereto should be captured on the concomitant medication form in the electronic case report form (eCRF), see Section 8.2.5 . Rescue medication is considered to be NIMP and will not be provided by Novo Nordisk. 6.5 Criteria for premature discontinuation of trial product All efforts should be made to keep the subject on trial product. However, the subject may be prematurely discontinued from trial product at the discretion of the investigator due to a safety concern. The subject must be prematurely discontinued from trial product, if the following applies: 1. Safety concern related to trial product or unacceptable intolerabilityCONFIDENTIAL"

Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial of an approved or non-approved investigational medicinal product 6. Calcitonin ≥ 100 ng/L (see appendix A ) If a criterion for premature discontinuation of trial product is met, trial product should not be re- initiated but subjects should continue with the scheduled site contacts. See Section 8.1.6 for procedures to be performed for subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely. 6.6 Withdrawal from trial The subject may withdraw consent at will at any time. The subject’s request to withdraw from the trial must always be respected. Only subjects who withdraw consent should be considered as withdrawn from trial. See Section 8.1.7 for procedures to be performed for subjects withdrawing consent. 6.7 Subject replacement Subjects who discontinue trial product prematurely will not be replaced. 6.8 Rationale for trial population The trial population will include subjects with T2D treated with stable doses of SGLT-2 inhibitor only or SGLT-2 inhibitor in combination with metformin or SU for at least 90 days prior to screening as changes in the background medication shortly before trial participation may potentially impact data interpretation. The HbA 1climits 7.0– 10.0% (53–86 mmol/mol) have been chosen to include subjects needing intensification of their anti-diabetic medication. The upper limit will secure that subjects with severely dysregulated T2D are not enrolled in this placebo-controlled trial. In addition, FPG and HbA 1cwill be monitored throughout the trial and rescue medication should be initiated in subjects with persistent, unacceptable hyperglycaemia. No body mass index or blood pressure restrictions will be applied. Subjects with liver test abnormalities (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2.5 × (upper normal level (UNL)) will be excluded to avoid potential confounding of liver safety assessments. In addition, subjects with mild, moderate, severe or end-stage renal impairment will be excluded due to restrictions in the labels of the allowed background medication. As SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis, subjects with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis will also be excluded from this trial. Overall, the eligibility criteria allow for enrolment of a broad trial population resembling the target population in common practice. CONFIDENTIAL"

These are also included in the flow chart (see Section 2) as well as visit numbers, timing of site and phone visits and visit windows during the trial period. Informed consent must be obtained before any trial related activity, see Section 18.3. A completion session must be performed in IWRS after completion of V9. 8.1.1 Investigator site log The investigator must keep a subject screening log, a subject identification code list and a subject enrolment log. Only subjects who have signed the informed consent form should be included on the logs. The subject screening log and subject enrolment log may be combined in one log. In addition, the investigator must keep a log of staff and a delegation of task(s) list at the trial site. Investigator must sign the log of staff and the delegation of task(s) at the trial site prior to the delegation of tasks. 8.1.2 Screening, visit 1 At screening, subjects will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a trial and giving contact address(es) and telephone number(s) of relevant trial site staff. Subjects should be instructed to return the card to the investigator at the last trial visit or to destroy the card after the last visit. Each subject will be assigned a unique 6-digit subject number which will remain the same throughout the trial. 8.1.3 Screening failures For screening failures the screening failure form in the eCRF must be completed with the reason for not continuing in the trial. Serious adverse events (SAEs) from screening failures must be transcribed by the investigator into the eCRF. Follow-up on SAEs must be carried out according to Section 12. A screening failure session must be made in the IWRS. The case book must be signed in the eCRF.CONFIDENTIAL"

Fasting is defined as having consumed only water within the last 6 hours prior to the visit. If the subject does not attend the visit in a fasting state, the subject should be asked to attend a re- scheduled visit within the visit window to have the fasting assessments performed. Glucose lowering agents and trial product should not be taken until after blood sampling has been performed but other prescribed medication should be taken according to prescription. 8.1.6 Premature discontinuation of trial product If a subject prematurely discontinues trial product, the investigator must undertake procedures similar to those for visit 9A scheduled to take place as soon as possible after discontinuation of trial product. Phone visit P10A should be scheduled at least 5 weeks after the last date on trial product. If premature discontinuation of trial product is decided during a scheduled visit, the visit will be converted into a visit 9A and trial procedures must be performed accordingly. Subjects should continue with the originally scheduled site contacts after V9A and up to and including P10. If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after visit P10A, however all attempts should be made to ensure that V9 is performed as a site visit and includes all planned assessments. In summary, subjects should stay in the trial irrespective of lack of adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule, missing assessments or trial product discontinuation for any reason. Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial should be considered as withdrawn from the trial (for withdrawal procedures see Section 8.1.7 ). The primary reason for premature discontinuation of trial product must be specified in the end-of- treatment form in the eCRF, and final drug accountability must be performed. A treatment discontinuation session must be made in the IWRS. 8.1.7 Withdrawal from trial If a subject considers to withdraw informed consent from the trial, the investigator must aim to undertake procedures similar to those for visit 9A (end of treatment premature discontinuation) as CONFIDENTIAL"

For withdrawn subjects the end-of-trial form and end-of-treatment form, including the primary reason for premature discontinuation of trial product, must be completed, and final drug accountability must be performed even if the subject is not able to come to the trial site. A treatment discontinuation session must be made in the IWRS, however if a subject has already prematurely discontinued from trial product and a treatment discontinuation session in IWRS has been done, no IWRS session should be completed. The case book must be signed. Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing consent, the investigator must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject’s rights. Where the reasons are obtained, the primary reason for withdrawing consent must be specified in the end-of-trial form in the eCRF. 8.1.8 Investigator assessment Review of diaries, ePROs, laboratory reports, ECGs, dilated fundoscopy/fundus photography, physical examination etc. must be documented on the documents or in subject's medical record. The signed documents must be retained at the trial site as source documentation. For ECGs, physical examinations and dilated fundoscopy/fundus photography the evaluations must follow the categories: !Normal !Abnormal – Was the result clinically significant? (No/Yes) The evaluation should be based on investigator’s or delegate’s judgment. For laboratory report values outside the reference range, the investigator must specify whether the value is clinically significant or clinically non-significant. All laboratory printouts must be signed and dated by the investigator or delegate on the day of evaluation. The signed laboratory report is retained at the trial site as source documentation. In case of abnormal clinical significant findings found as a result of screening procedures conducted at visit 1 or assessments revealing baseline conditions at visit 2, the investigator or delegate must state a comment in the subject’s medical record and record this in the concomitant illness form in the eCRF.

Procedures and assessments performed at visit 1 and/or visit 2 (prior to randomization) are considered as screening procedures. The information collected for concomitant illness and medical history should include diagnosis, date of onset and date of resolution or continuation, as applicable. Any change to a concomitant illness should be recorded during the trial. A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness must be reported as an AE. It must be possible to verify the subject’s medical history in source documents such as subject’s medical record. If a subject is not from the investigators own practice; the investigator must make reasonable effort to obtain a copy of subject’s medical record from relevant party e.g. primary physician. The investigator must document any attempt to obtain external medical information by noting the date(s) when information was requested and who has been contacted. 8.2.5 Concomitant medication A concomitant medication is any medication, other than the trial product, which is taken during the trial, including the screening and follow-up periods. Details of any concomitant medication must be recorded at visit 1. Changes in concomitant medication, including antidiabetic treatment and rescue treatment, must be recorded at each visit as they occur. The eCRF should be updated accordingly. The information collected for each concomitant medication includes trade name or generic name, indication, start date (only start year is applicable if more than one year) and stop date or continuation. Total daily dose only applicable for antidiabetic medication. If a change is due to an AE, then this must be reported according to Section 12. If the change influences the subject’s eligibility to continue in the trial, the monitor must be informed. 8.2.6 Childbearing potential It must be recorded in the eCRF whether female subjects are of childbearing potential. Pregnancy testing must be performed on female subjects of childbearing potential as described in Section 8.5.2 .

The measurement of waist circumference should be performed and recorded in the eCRF. The waist circumference will be measured using a non- stretchable measuring tape. It should be recorded to the nearest ½ cm or ¼ inch using the same measuring tape throughout the trial. The waist circumference should be measured in a standing position with an empty bladder and wearing light clothing with accessible waist. The subject should be standing with arms down their side and feet together. The tape should touch the skin but not compress soft tissue. The subject should be asked to breathe normally and the measurement should be taken when the subject is breathing out gently. 8.3.3 Blood pressure Systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be measured in a sitting position after the subject has been resting for at least 5 minutes and by using standard clinical practice at the trial site. 8.3.4 Self-measured plasma glucose At the screening visit, subjects will be provided with a BG meter including lancets, plasma- calibrated test strips and control solutions as well as instructions for use. The BG meters use test strips calibrated to plasma values. Therefore, all measurements performed with capillary blood are automatically calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose values, which will be shown on the display.

It is allowed to perform the baseline ECG between the screening visit and the randomisation visit. The results should be available prior to randomisation. An ECG performed for any reason unrelated to this trial within 7 days prior to the screening visit is acceptable provided no clinical symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease have occurred in the meantime. If the ECG was performed as a part of routine clinical practice on/before the date when the subject has signed the informed consent, it must be documented in the medical records that the reason for performing the procedure is not related to this trial. 8.4.4 Dilated fundoscopy/fundus photography The eye examination will be performed as per flowchart (see Section 2). It is allowed to perform the baseline fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy between the screening visit and the randomisation visit. Results of the baseline fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy must be available and evaluated by the investigator before randomisation. If the subject had a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed within 90 days prior to randomisation, the investigator may base their evaluation upon the results of that examination. However, the examination must be repeated before randomisation if the subject experienced worsening of visual function since the last examination. If the subject did not have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed within 90 days prior to randomisation, such examination must be performed by the investigator or other qualified health care professional prior to randomisation.

For some of the samples drawn during the trial, subjects will be asked to attend the relevant site visits fasting (see Section 8.1.5 ). Laboratory results will be sent by the central laboratory to the investigator on an on-going basis and the investigator must review all laboratory results for signs of concomitant illness and AEs and report these according to this protocol (see Section 12). The laboratory provides results to the trial sites in the units preferred by the trial sites while the results that are transferred to the trial database will always be in SI units. The laboratory equipment may provide analyses not requested in the protocol but produced automatically in connection with the requested analyses according to specifications in the laboratory standard operating procedures. Such data will not be transferred to the trial database, but abnormal values will be reported to the investigator. The investigator must review all laboratory results for concomitant illnesses and AEs and report these according to Section 8.2.4 and Section 12. Only laboratory samples specified in the protocol must be sent to the central laboratory for analysis; if additional laboratory sampling is needed, e.g. to follow up on AEs, this must be done at a local laboratory.

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. An AE includes: !A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. !A CLAE: a clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. The following should not be reported as AEs: !Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product (pre-existing conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). !Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. !Non-serious hypoglycaemia is an AE, but is reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form instead of on an AE form, see Section 8.4.6 . The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE: !Severity –Mild – no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Moderate – marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Severe – considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities; unacceptable. !Causality Relationship between an AE and the relevant trial product(s): –Probable - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. –Possible - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. –Unlikely - The event is most likely related to aetiology other than the trial product.CONFIDENTIAL"

This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. –Recovered/resolved with sequelae - The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. –Not recovered/not resolved - The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. –Fatal - This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. –Unknown - This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. 12.1.2 Serious adverse event A SAE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: !Death. !A life-threateningaexperience. !In-patient hospitalisationbor prolongation of existing hospitalisation. !A persistent or significant disability or incapacityc. !A congenital anomaly or birth defect. !Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threateningaor require hospitalisationbmay be considered an SAE when - based on appropriate medical judgement - they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAEd. a.The term “life threatening” in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. b.The term “hospitalisation” is used when a subject: – Is admitted to a hospital or in-patient, irrespective of the duration of physical stay, or – Stays at the hospital for treatment or observation for more than 24 hoursCONFIDENTIAL"

This includes events from the first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent until the end of the post-treatment follow-up period (P10). The events must be recorded in the applicable eCRF forms in a timely manner, see timelines below and Figure 12–1 . During each contact with the trial site staff, the subject must be asked about AEs and technical complaints, for example by asking: “Have you experienced any problems since the last contact?” All AEs, observed by the investigator or subject, must be reported by the investigator and evaluated. All AEs must be recorded by the investigator on an AE form. The investigator should report the diagnosis, if available. If no diagnosis is available, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs using separate AE forms. For SAEs, a SIF must be completed in addition to the AE form. If several symptoms or diagnoses occur as part of the same clinical picture, one SIF can be used to describe all the SAEs. For all non-serious AEs, the applicable forms should be signed when the event is resolved or at the end of the trial at the latest. Some events will undergo event adjudication by the event adjudication committee (EAC), please refer to Section 12.7.2 . For AEs qualifying for event adjudication, the Adjudication Form will also have to be completed in the eCRF. The Adjudication Form is a checklist of clinical data to be provided from the site. Timelines for initial reporting of AEs: The investigator must complete the following forms in the eCRF within the specified timelines: !SAEs: The AE form within 24 hours and the SIF within 5 calendar days of the investigator’s first knowledge of the SAE. Both forms must be signed within 7 calendar days from the date the information was entered in the eCRF. !For SAEs requiring reporting on a specific event form: In addition to the above the specific event form within 14 calendar days from the investigator’s first knowledge of the AE. !Events for adjudication: The adjudication form should be completed within 14 calendar days of investigator’s first knowledge of the AE, see Section 12.7.2 .

Novo Nordisk products used as concomitant medication If an AE is considered to have a causal relationship with a Novo Nordisk marketed product used as concomitant medication in the trial, it is important that the suspected relationship is reported to Novo Nordisk, e.g. in the alternative aetiology section on the SIF. Novo Nordisk may need to report this AE to relevant regulatory authorities. 12.3 Follow-up of adverse events The investigator must record follow-up information by updating the forms in the eCRF. Follow-up information must be reported to Novo Nordisk according to the following: !SAEs: All SAEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovered/resolved”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “fatal”, and until all queries have been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved”. Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” when the subject has completed the follow-up period and is expected by the investigator to recover. The SAE follow-up information should only include new (e.g. corrections or additional) information and must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s first knowledge of the information. This is also the case for previously non-serious AEs which subsequently become SAEs. !Non-serious AEs: Non-serious AEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved” or “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or until the end of the follow-up period stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries related to these AEs have been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved”. Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” when the subject has completed the follow-up period and is expected by the investigator to recover. The investigator must ensure that the recording of the worst case severity and seriousness of an event is kept throughout the trial. A worsening of an unresolved AE must be reported as follow up with re-assessment of severity and/or seriousness of the event.CONFIDENTIAL"

In the event of overdosage, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to subject’s clinical signs and symptoms. 12.7 Committees related to safety 12.7.1 Novo Nordisk safety committee Novo Nordisk will constitute an internal semaglutide s.c. safety committee to perform ongoing safety surveillance. The semaglutide s.c. saf ety committee may recommend unblinding of any data for further analysis, and in this case an independent ad hoc group will be established in order to maintain the blinding of the trial personnel . 12.7.2 Event adjudication committee An independent external EAC is established to perform validation of selected AEs according to pre- defined diagnostic criteria. The validation is based on review of pre-defined clinical data related to the specific AE. Pre-defined clinical data consist of copies of source documents collected and delivered by the investigational sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The events are reviewed by the event adjudication committee in a blinded manner. The EAC will have no authorisations to impact on trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments. The EAC works in accordance with written guidelines included in the EAC Charter describing in details the composition, tasks, responsibilities and work processes of the committee. The events outlined in Section 12.1.5 have been selected for adjudication in order to obtain an external independent validation of the diagnosis. In addition, cardiovascular events are being adjudicated according to Standardized Definitions 46. The EAC will review copies in English (translated if necessary) of medical documentation received in the adjudication packages (e.g. x-ray, ECGs, ultrasound images, discharge summaries, pathology reports and death certificates). The investigator must provide medical documentation as soon as possible, when they receive the request from Novo Nordisk or the event adjudication vendor.

Once data has been entered, it will be available to Novo Nordisk for data verification and validation purposes. The pregnancy forms are paper based CRFs. Also, the AE forms, technical complaint forms, and safety information forms will be provided in paper but are only to be used if for any reason the eCRF is unavailable. The investigator must ensure that data is recorded in these forms as soon as possible after the visit. At the end of the trial the investigator must ensure that all remaining data have been entered into the eCRF no later than 3 days after LPLV at the site in order to ensure the planned lock of the database.

The first monitoring visit will be performed as soon as possible after FPFV at the trial site and no later than 4 weeks after. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the eCRFs, the trial site's recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site to the protocol and GCP, but will not exceed 12 weeks for trial sites with active subjects (defined as subjects in screening, treatment or follow-up). The monitor must be given direct access to all source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition, the relevant trial site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (e.g. by telephone). All data must be verifiable in source documentation other than the eCRF. For all data recorded the source document must be defined in a source document agreement at each trial site. There must only be one source defined at any time for any data element. Source data generated by the trial site can be corrected by another person than the person entering the source data if accepted by local regulations; any correction must be explained, signed and dated by the person making the correction. The original of the completed diaries and ePROs (tablets) must not be removed from the trial site, unless they form part of the CRF/eCRF and a copy is kept at the site. All data entered will be automatically transferred from the tablet to the ePRO database hosted by the supplier which is considered as source data. The monitor will ensure that the eCRFs are completed and that paper CRFs are collected. The following data will be source data verified for screening failures : !Date for obtaining informed consent !Reason for screening failure Monitors will review the subject’s medical records and other source data (e.g. the diaries and ePROs) to ensure consistency and/or identify omissions compared to the eCRF.

The standard errors (SE) of the back-transformed mean and ratio to baseline estimates are also provided; these SEs are calculated using the delta-method (first order Taylor approximation), whereby the SE on the original scale is calculated as the product of the SE on log-scale and the exponentiated estimate of the mean (geometric mean). 17.1.2 Definition of baseline For each assessment, the baseline assessment is defined as the latest available measurement at or prior to the randomisation visit. This specifically implies that if a visit 2 assessment is missing (whether it was planned or not planned) then the screening assessment (from visit 1), if available, will be used as the baseline assessment. If no measurement(s) have been obtained, at or prior to randomisation, the baseline value will be left missing. 17.1.3 Primary estimand To further detail the trial objective an estimand is defined which is a de-jure (efficacy) estimand: !Primary estimand – The treatment difference (semaglutide versus placebo) at week 30 for all randomised subjects if all subjects completed treatment and did not initiate rescue medication. This primary de-jure estimand is considered clinically relevant as it assesses the expected glycaemic benefit a person with T2D is expected to achieve if initiating and continuing treatment with semaglutide. Accordingly, only data collected prior to discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication will be used to draw inference. This will avoid confounding from rescue medication. 17.1.4 Trial completion Unless subjects withdraw their informed consent, data collection will continue for the full duration of the trial. The full duration of the trial is defined as up to and including the follow-up visit (P10). Subjects completing the follow-up visit (P10) will be considered trial completers. 17.1.5 Missing data considerations at week 30 The rate of actual missing data at week 30 is expected to be maximum 10% based on the rate of trial completers from the s.c. semaglutide phase 3a clinical development program. The frequency of missing data is expected to be similar in the semaglutide and the placebo groups. When estimating the primary estimand, the combined rate of missing data, subjects discontinuing treatment prematurely or initiating rescue medication on top of trial product is expected to be maximum 20%. This is based on the results from the s.c. semaglutide phase 3a clinical development program. Based on these data, premature treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal AEs is expected to be low but more frequent with semaglutide compared to placebo. In contrast, with CONFIDENTIAL"

Other reasons for discontinuing treatment are assumed to be unrelated to treatment and therefore occur with similar rates in both treatment groups, so overall the frequency of missing data or data not used at week 30 in the primary analysis is expected to be similar across treatment groups. To document the extent and reason(s) for missing data, descriptive summaries and graphical representation of extent, reason(s) for and pattern of missing data will be presented by treatment group. 17.2 Sample size calculation Both the primary endpoint, change from baseline to week 30 in HbA 1cand the confirmatory secondary endpoint, change from baseline to week 30 in body weight (kg) are planned to be tested for superiority of semaglutide vs. placebo. A total of 300 subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 manner to receive either semaglutide 1.0 mg or placebo. The sample size is determined based on the need to collect safety data from subjects treated with the combination of semaglutide and SGLT-2 inhibitors with either metformin or SU for the safety evaluation of this treatment combination. With 300 subjects randomised the power for meeting HbA 1csuperiority of semaglutide vs. placebo out of the two pre-specified confirmatory hypotheses shown in Figure 17–1 is >99% across plausible assumptions. The closed testing procedure described in Bretz et al. (2011)47is used to control the overall type I error at a nominal two sided 5% level equivalent to controlling at a one- sided 2.5% level. The statistical testing strategy is built on the principle that glycaemic effect will have to be established in terms of HbA 1csuperiority before testing for added benefits in terms of body weight superiority. The power is calculated using the calcPower function in the R package, gMCP48using 10000 simulations. The two pre-specified confirmatory tests are assumed to be independent. Since the tests are positively correlated, the assumption of independence is viewed as conservative. The sample size assumptions for efficacy based on ‘on-treatment without rescue medication’ data and a treatment effect based on in-trial data (see 17.4.1 ) together with the standard deviation (SD) are given in Table 17–1 . These are based on the efficacy results and an observed reduction of approximately 15% in the treatment effect based on in-trial data compared to efficacy based on ‘on- treatment without rescue medication’ data in the placebo controlled trials in the s.c. semaglutide phase 3a clinical development programme.CONFIDENTIAL"

Multiplicity and criteria for confirming hypotheses The Type-I error rate for testing the two confirmatory hypotheses related to HbA 1cand body weight endpoints will be preserved in the strong sense at 5% (two-sided) using the weighted Bonferroni- based closed testing procedure described in Bretz et al47and outlined in Figure 17–1 . The first hypothesis to be tested is superiority of HbA 1c. It will be tested at the overall significance level (5%). Superiority will be considered confirmed if the mean treatment difference is supporting the corresponding alternative hypothesis and the two-sided p-value from the primary analysis of the primary estimand is strictly below the 5% two-sided significance level. 17.4 Definition of analysis sets The following analysis sets will be defined: !Full analysis set (FAS): includes all randomised subjects. Subjects in the FAS will contribute to evaluation “as randomised”. !Safety analysis set (SAS): includes all subjects exposed to at least one dose of trial product. Subjects in the SAS will contribute to the evaluation based on the trial product received for the majority of the period they were on treatment. This will be referred to as contributing to the evaluation “as treated”. 17.4.1 Data selections and observation periods Subjects and data to be used in an analysis will be selected in a two-step manner: !Firstly, subjects will be selected based on the specified analysis set. !Secondly, data points on the selected subjects from first step will be selected based on the specified observation period. Definition of the observation periods: In-trial: This observation period represents the time period where subjects are considered to be in the trial after randomisation, regardless of discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication.

On-treatment: This observation period represents the time period where subjects are considered exposed to trial product. The observation period is a subset of the in-trial observation period. It starts at the date of first dose of trial product. Two slightly different end dates will be needed to cover all assessments appropriately according to the flow chart. For adjudicated events, ECGs and AEs including hypoglycaemic episodes, the observati on period ends at the first date of any of the following: !the follow-up visit (P10) !the follow-up prematurely discontinuation visit (P10A) !the last date on trial product + 42 days !the end-date for the in-trial observation period The follow-up visit is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after the last date on trial product corresponding to approximately five half-lives of s.c. semaglutide. The visit window for the follow- up visit is + 7 days, which is the reason for the 42 days specified in the bullet above. Hence, for those assessments this period reflects the period in which subjects are exposed. For efficacy and other safety assessments (laboratory assessments, physical examination and vital signs) the observation period ends at the last date on trial product + 7 days. This ascertainment window corresponds to the dosing interval and will be used to avoid attenuation of a potential treatment effect on endpoints for which the effect is reversible shortly after treatment. Hence, for those assessments this period reflects the period in which subjects are treated. On-treatment without rescue medication: This observation period is a subset of the on-treatment observation period, where subjects are considered treated with trial product, but has not initiated any rescue medications. Specifically it starts at date of first dose of trial product and the observation period ends at the first date of any of the following: !the last dose of trial product +7 days !initiation of rescue medicationCONFIDENTIAL"

Imputation of missing data will be handled using multiple imputation assuming that missing data is missing at random (MAR). Missing data will be imputed using observed data within the same group defined by the randomised treatment (semaglutide/placebo). It is hereby assumed that the likely values of what the missing data would have been if available are best described by information from subjects who receive the same treatment. Technically missing values will be imputed as follows: !Intermittent missing values are imputed using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, in order to obtain a monotone missing data pattern. This imputation is done for each of the treatment groups separately and 200 copies of the dataset will be generated !A sequential regression approach for imputing monotone missing values at planned visits will be implemented starting with the first visit after baseline and sequentially continuing to the last planned visit at week 30. A model used to impute missing values at each planned visit will be fitted for each of the treatment groups using observed data. The model will include stratification factor and region as categorical effects and baseline and post-baseline HbA 1cvalues observed prior to the visit in question as covariates. CONFIDENTIAL"

Rubin’s rule will be used to combine the analysis results in order to draw inference. From this analysis, the estimated treatment difference between semaglutide and placebo at week 30 will be presented together with the associated two-sided 95% confidence interval and unadjusted two sided p-value for testing superiority. 17.5.2 Statistical subgroup analyses of HbA 1c Five subgroups based on baseline HbA 1cvalues are defined as follows: 1.≤ 7.5% 2. > 7.5% to 8.0% (inclusive) 3. > 8.0% to 8.5% (inclusive) 4. > 8.5% to 9.0% (inclusive) 5. > 9.0% Change from baseline in HbA 1cat week 30 for subgroups based on baseline HbA 1cvalues will be analysed for the primary estimand using a similar multiple imputation approach as described in section 17.5.1 . The complete data sets from the primary analysis will be reused. However the ANCOVA model used to analyse the 200 complete data sets will additionally include the interaction effect of subgroup and treatment as a categorical effect. Rubin’s rule will then be used to combine the results and p-value for the interaction effect and estimated treatment differences at week 30 with corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals for each subgroup will be presented. 17.5.3 Sensitivity analyses In order to investigate the robustness of the conclusion from the primary analysis and to stress test the sensitivity of the results with regards to the MAR assumption for missing data tipping-point sensitivity analyses will be performed for the primary estimand. 17.5.3.1 Sensitivity analysis for the primary estimand The estimation of the primary estimand will be repeated using the following sensitivity analysis: !Tipping-point analysis (pattern mixture model-based). This analysis will be based on the FAS using the ‘on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period. In this analysis, subjects from the semaglutide group with missing observations will be given a penalty, i.e., it is assumed that subjects with missing observations who are randomised to semaglutide will receive a treatment that is worse than subjects with observed values who are randomised to semaglutide .

The tipping point is the penalty level, at which the magnitude of efficacy reduction in subjects with missing data creates a shift in the overall treatment effect of semaglutide from being statistically significantly better than placebo to being non-statistically significantly better. Technically, this analysis will be implemented by replicating the primary analysis including the assumption of MAR but subsequently adding increasing penalty values at week 30 to imputed observations in the semaglutide group before applying an ANCOVA on the 200 complete dataset. 17.5.3.2 Other sensitivity analyses The following additional sensitivity analysis is specified: !In-trial treatment policy analysis based on the FAS using post-baseline measurements up to and including week 30 from the in-trial observation period. Missing data will be imputed using the same approach as described for the primary analysis of the primary estimand. However the imputation will be done within the same group defined not only by the randomised treatment (semaglutide/placebo) but also the status of treatment completion (still on randomised treatment at week 30 yes/no) (4 groups in total). It is hereby assumed that the likely values of what the missing data would have been if available are best described by information from subjects who at week 30 are similar in terms of randomised treatment and treatment completion status. In addition in the imputation step stratification factor and region is not included in the model in order to avoid potential issues with sparse data. This analysis could be considered addressing an effectiveness estimand. 17.6 Secondary endpoints 17.6.1 Confirmatory secondary endpoints Change from baseline to week 30 in body weight (kg) will be a confirmatory secondary endpoint. The primary estimand will be estimated using the same approach as described for the primary HbA 1cendpoint. Baseline and post-baseline body weight will be used as covariates instead of HbA 1cin the analyses. Superiority will be considered confirmed if the mean treatment difference is supporting the corresponding hypothesis and the two-sided p-v alue from the primary analysis of the primary estimand is strictly below the significance level of 5% equivalent to a one-sided superiority test at a 2.5% level.

The sections below describe the important identified and potential risks and precautions associated with semaglutide treatment. These are based on findings in nonclinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks and precautions, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. 18.1.2 Identified risks Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported AEs in clinical trials with semaglutide have been gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and constipation). Clinical trials have indicated that a low starting dose and gradual dose escalation mitigates the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Consequently, a low starting dose and dose escalation with 4 week dose-escalation steps have been implemented in the trial. 18.1.3 Potential risks Medullary thyroid cancer The human relevance of the proliferative C-cell changes found in rodents treated with GLP-1 RAs is unknown, but data suggest that rodents are more sensitive to the mode of action of GLP-1 RAs for induction of C-cell tumours. However, as a precaution, subjects with a family or personal history of MEN 2 or MTC will not be enrolled in the trial. During the trial, calcitonin will be measured on a regular basis, and the guidance for investigators on further evaluation and action on elevated calcitonin concentrations is included in appendix A . Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs including semaglutide. As a precaution, subjects with a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. Also, subjects will be informed about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and serum levels of lipase and amylase will be monitored throughout the trial. Pancreatic cancer Patients with T2D have an increased risk of certain types of cancer such as pancreatic cancer. There is currently no support from nonclinical studies or clinical trials or post marketing data that GLP-1-CONFIDENTIAL"

However, pancreatic cancer has been included as a separate potential risk due to the scientific debate surrounding a potential association to GLP-1-based therapies and the unknown long-term effects of stimulation of β-cells and suppression of α-cells. Pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1 RAs by EMA. Allergic reactions and injection site reaction As in the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, treatment with semaglutide may evoke allergic reactions. These may include localized injection site reactions or generalized reactions, including urticaria, rash, pruritus as well as anaphylactic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, subjects will be instructed to contact the site staff as soon as possible for further guidance if suspicion of a hypersensitivity reaction to the trial product occurs. Hypoglycaemia Based on current knowledge about the GLP-1 RA drug class, there is a risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. Hypoglycaemic episodes have mainly been observed when semaglutide is combined with SU or insulin. Acute renal impairment In subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs, including semaglutide, gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may lead to significant dehydration and secondary acute renal impairment. Subjects with gastrointestinal AEs are recommended to drink plenty of fluids to avoid volume depletion. Also, serum creatinine and other markers of kidney function will be monitored throughout the trial. SGLT-2 inhibitors, a background medication in this trial, have also been associated with volume depletion. It is recommended to monitor renal function and for signs and symptoms of fluid loss during therapy. Severe dehydration may be a risk factor for ketoacidosis. Impaired renal function may increase the risk of metformin associated lactic acidosis when GLP-1 RAs are co-administered with metformin. As a precaution, serum creatinine will be measured regularly. In subjects treated with metformin who experience prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, the investigator should monitor serum creatinine, and if clinically indicated, withhold metformin until resolution of renal dysfunction. The use of the background medication should be in accordance with the current, approved labels.CONFIDENTIAL"

Primates do not have an inverted yolk sac placenta which makes this mechanism unlikely to be of relevance to humans. However, as a precaution, females who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant or are of childbearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, pregnancy tests will be performed according to flowchart in Section 2and at any time during the trial if a menstrual period is missed, or as required by local law. Diabetic retinopathy A transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy is a recognised complication in selected patients with diabetes after initiation of intensive anti-diabetic treatment51. Risk factors for these events include long-standing poor glycaemic control and presence of proliferative retinopathy, and initial large improvements in BG may be an additional aggravating factor. Several studies have, however, documented long-term beneficial effects of intensive glycaemic treatment in reducing retinopathy progression 52, 53even in intensively treated patients who experienced early worsening54. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo. As a precaution in this trial, all subjects are required to have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed before enrolment into the trial; moreover, subjects with proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment will be excluded. As part of good diabetes management the investigator is encouraged to ensure adequate monitoring and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in subjects enrolled into the trial 55. General precautions All subjects will be included after a thorough evaluation in regards to in- and exclusion criteria defined in order to ensure that subjects are eligible for trial enrolment. There are also strict glycaemic rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial, see Section 6.4. If rescue medication is required, it should be in accordance with ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes33, 34(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care according to the principles outlined in Diabetes Care 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes55. Further details with regards to safety of trial product are described in the current edition of the IB for semaglutide (NN9535) 56, or any updates thereto.CONFIDENTIAL"

Subjects will therefore, for the majority of the trial period, be treated with a regimen anticipated to be better than or equal to the treatment they receive at the time of entry into the trial. Based on the results of the phase 3a trials, semaglutide is expected to provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight in subjects with T2D diabetes. In addition, it is expected that all subjects, including subjects randomised to placebo, will benefit from participation through close contact with the study site, with close follow-up of their T2D and a careful medical examination, all of which will most likely result in an intensified management of their T2D. Finally, data from two cardiovascular outcomes trials investigating treatment with GLP-1 RAs compared to placebo have indicated that there might be a potential beneficial effect of these drugs on cardiovascular outcomes when added to standard of care in subjects with T2D at high risk of cardiovascular events (see Section 3.1.5.3 ). All subjects in this trial will receive trial products and auxiliary supplies free of charge. 18.2 Risk and benefit conclusion The safety profile for semaglutide generated from the clinical and nonclinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of semaglutide in accordance with the planned clinical trial. The phase 3a results indicate that semaglutide will provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight. Safety and efficacy will be monitored regularly and acceptable glycaemic control will be reinforced at all times during the trial. In conclusion, the potential risk to the subjects in this trial is considered low and acceptable in view of the anticipated benefits semaglutide will provide to subjects with T2D. 18.3 Informed consent In seeking and documenting informed consent, the investigator must comply with applicable regulatory requirement(s) and adhere to ICH GCP1and the requirements in the Declaration of Helsinki2.CONFIDENTIAL"

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C-cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical interpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (greater than 100 ng/L) as likely indicative of C-cell neoplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !smoking !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical conditions and in different patient populations (i.e. with various co-morbidities) is poorly understood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells.CONFIDENTIAL"

The subject should remain in the trial; however, all medications suspected to relate to this condition must be discontinued until diagnosis has been established. Background: These values were found in 9 (0.15%) of a population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1. All of these patients were diagnosed with MTC, resulting in a positive predictive value of 100 %. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound examination !fine needle aspiration of any nodules > 1 cm !potentially, surgery with neck dissection In case a subject is diagnosed with MTC, it is common clinical practice to explore the family history of MTC or MEN2 and perform a genetic test for RET proto-oncogene mutation. 2.2 Calcitonin ≥ 50 and < 100 ng/L Action: The subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. The subject should remain in the trial and continuation on trial product should be based on the evaluation done by the thyroid specialist. Background: These values were found in 8 (0.14%) of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1. Two of these subjects were diagnosed with MTC and two were diagnosed with C-cell hyperplasia, resulting in a positive predictive value of a C-cell anomaly of 50%. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound examination !if available, and if there are no contraindications, a pentagastrin stimulation test should be done. For subjects with positive pentagastrin stimulation test, surgery should be considered. !if pentagastrin stimulation test is not available, thyroid ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy may add important clinical information about the need for surgery. 2.3 Calcitonin ≥ 10 and < 50 ng/L Action: The subject can continue in the trial on trial product. Continue sampling of calcitonin according to the protocol. If the value is from the last sample taken in the trial, the subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation.

However, the likelihood of having a medullary carcinoma >1 cm with calcitonin in this range is extremely low. For calcitonin values between 10-20 ng/L Costante et al.1identified 216 (3.7%) patients. One patient out of the 216 had a subsequent basal (unstimulated) calcitonin value of 33 ng/L, and had C- cell hyperplasia at surgery.

Complement level results should be included in the specific event form when reporting the AE. 1.5 Neoplasm All events of neoplasms (excluding thyroid neoplasms, which will be reported under thyroid disease) must be reported during the trial and the following additional information must be reported if available: !Type of neoplasm !Symptoms leading to identification of event !Diagnostic imaging !Pathological examination results !Treatment for the event !Participation in screening programs !Risk factors associated with the event 1.6 Pancreatitis For all confirmed events of pancreatitis the following additional information must be reported if available: !Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis !Specific laboratory test supporting a diagnosis of pancreatitis: !Imaging performed and consistency with pancreatic disease !Treatment for and complications of the event !Relevant risk factors for pancreatic disease !Family history of pancreatitis Assessments in case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis Most patients with acute pancreatitis experience severe abdominal pain that is located generally in the epigastrium and radiates to the back. The onset of the pain may be swift, reaching maximum intensity within 30 min, is frequently unbearable, and characteristically persists for more than 24 hours without relief2.The pain is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination usually reveals severe upper abdominal tenderness at times associated with guarding.CONFIDENTIAL"

The serum lipase may remain elevated slightly longer than amylase. The level of the serum amylase and/or lipase does not correlate with the severity of acute pancreatitis2. In general, serum lipase is thought to be more sensitive and specific than serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis, the trial product should promptly be interrupted (no treatment discontinuation call should be made in IWRS before diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed). Appropriate additional examinations must be performed, including local measurement of amylase and lipase. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features3: !abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back) !serum lipase activity (and/or amylase activity) at least three times greater than the upper normal limit !characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging. If acute pancreatitis is ruled out, trial product should be re-initiated. If acute pancreatitis is confirmed, appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject should be initiated. The subject must be discontinued from trial product (treatment discontinuation call in IWRS), but should remain in the trial (see Section 6.5and 8.1.6 ). 1.7 Renal event If a renal event is observed during the trial, the following additional information must be reported if available: !Signs and symptoms of renal failure !Specific laboratory tests supporting the diagnosis !Imaging performed supporting the diagnosis !Kidney biopsy results Risk or confounding factors identified including exposure to nephrotoxic agents 1.8 Thyroid disease If an event of thyroid disease, including any thyroid neoplasms, is observed during the trial, the following additional information must be reported if available:CONFIDENTIAL"

Thereafter, repeat testing (at the central laboratory) of ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin should be done regularly until the abnormalities return to normal or baseline state. Additional clinical information such as related symptoms, risk factors and contributing conditions (e.g. viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, hepatobiliary or pancreatic disorders) should be gathered to seek a possible cause of the observed laboratory test abnormalities. *Please note that risk of liver injury defined as ALT or AST > 3 × UNL and total bilirubin > 2 × UNL, where no alternative aetiology exits (Hy’s law), should also be reported as a SAE (important medical event, according to Section 12.1.2 ). 1.10 Diabetic retinopathy If an event of diabetic retinopathy (new onset or worsening of) is observed during the trial the following additional information must be reported if available on the diabetic retinopathy form: CONFIDENTIAL"
