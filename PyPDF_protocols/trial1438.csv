It is most often linked to the combination of a disk space narrowing (loss of height and bulging within the canal), a hypertrophy of t he yellow ligament and of the joint capsules and also a bone overgrowth by the posterior vertebral joints. This may be associated with Grade I spondylolisthesis. This pathology often extends over several levels, frequently two (L5S1, L4L5 or L4L5, L3L4) so metimes more. A relatively homogeneous group of patients falls within the group of stenosis, from S1 to L2, without significant deviation (scoliosis or cyphosis type). A wide variety of different surgical techniques are used to treat patients with LSS and patients who have symptoms despite well -conducted medical treatment. Decompressive laminectomy may prove to be insufficient when several levels are affected and also due to the fears of instability induced by the gesture itself (the joint hypertrophy respo nsible for nerve root compression is also a stabilizing element). Therefore, the scientific community usually associates a gesture of stabilization with the gesture of decompression. The choice of stabilizing means is discussed without any conclusive answe r provided by any controlled study. This question accounts for the subject of this study. Two alternatives are discussed:  The current gold standard is to practice rigid stabilization through bolted fusion, with or without inter somatic cage, despite the fa ct that it causes an excessive rigidification of the mobile segment, therefore responsible for the acceleration of the degeneration of the upper level.  Soft stabilization system with pedicular screwing B -Dyn type. It stabilizes the"

Based on the judgment from the dynamic profile images, the devices, some of which are approved in the USA claim to favor fusion while provi ding no information on the mobility of the upper level in their studies. The aim of this randomized and prospective comparative study would not only be to establish the non -inferiority of the procedure under study, versus conventional fusion (with or witho ut cage) on the degree of functional disability after surgery, but also to demonstrate the significantly higher preservation of the upper level’s mobility when assembling. STUDY PERIOD First inclusion : May 2020 Inclusion period : 24 months Last patient’s follow up : May 2027 Analysis and results : November 2027 Phase III STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary objective: The main objective is to evaluate at 12 months post -operatively the effect of the B -Dyn device in the treatment of degenerative lumbar steno sis (DLSS), with or without grade I spondylolisthesis compared to classical fusion on the degree of post -operative functional disability. Secondary objective 1. To e valuate the effect of B -Dyn in the treatment of DLSS compared to a Classical screw fusion (with or without cage) between inclusion, 2 months, 12 months and 60 months post -intervention on the following: The mobility of the instrumented level and adjacent levels; The degree of functional disability related to low back pain; The lumbar and radicular pain; The quality of life; The anxiety; The radiological parameters; The neurological and motion status; The walking distance 2. To evaluate during the study period, the rate of re -operation on the same instrumented level or on the adjacent level. 3. To assess rate of adjacent syndrome (ASD) up to 60 months post intervention 4. To assess side effects reported in both groups. ENDPOINTS PRIMARY ENDPOINT The main criterion is the degree of functional disability related to low back pain. It will be measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at the 12th month compared to the baseline data. SECONDARY ENDPOINT"

The Bdyn spine cushioning with Sterile Posterior Dynamic Stabilization - Bdyn is composed of a hollow metal cylindrical body containing elastomeric silicone and urethane polycarbonate components that are implantable in the long run, and are deformed by a me tal piston rod connected to the vertebra of the treated segment by pedicular polyaxials Bdyn screws. The elastomeric components ensure the absorption of the mechanical stresses exerted on the intervertebral joint that are in compression, in traction, in fl exion -extension, and in lateral flexion. Some configurations allow the fixation of several intervertebral levels. The B -Dyn device components as well as their properties are represented in the Figure 1. The combination of rigid and flexible parts allows to preserve mobility and absorb the bending loads, the traction and the compression. The B -Dyn product range is available in four different models: The references of the different models of the B Dyn device are listed in Appendix 20.2 Mobile rod Fixed rod Cylindrical cover Cushion made of silicone elastomer Ring made of PU elastomer"

DOCX 21 /96 The B Dyn device belongs to Class IIB. It obtained the CE marking in 2008. The CE conformity assessment was carried out by SGS (see Appendices 20.5). It is used worldwide. In addition to preserving the mobility of the treated segments, the surgeons appreciate in one hand, the speed of the intervention, and on the other hand, the compatibility of the device with the fusion, which allows them to to choose the best suited system for the patient, during the surgery (this decision is made once the screws are placed, the doctor can choose between fusion or B -Dyn®). 4.2. DESCRIPTION AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE USE OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE AND THE TREATMENT TIME The Bdyn spine cushioning with Sterile Posterior Dynamic Stabilization - Bdyn is intended for posterior stabilization of the thoracic vertebra T10 at the sacrum S1, with or without bone graft for the following: Degeneration of the intervertebral disc and/or joint fa cets, confirmed by further tests. Stenosis of the lumbar canal Grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis Segmental hypermobility The Bdyn device must be implanted exclusively by a qualified surgeon. The latter needs to have the knowledge of the use of the product as well as the knowledge of anatomy, spine surgery, the technique of attaching the pedicular screws and the specific surgical technique of installing the Bdyn device. 4.3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE USE OF THE DEVICE TO WHICH THE RESEARCH RELATES AND OF THE SURGICAL PROCEDURES The surgical technique for the installation of the B -Dyn device is detailed in Appendix 20.3 and 20.4. Surgery is performed under general anesthesia. The procedure begins with the installation of the first upper polyaxial screw using a polyaxial screwdriver. In order to position the second screw, it is necessary to use the phantom (Trial 10). Once the screws are positioned, the B - Dyn is caught between the jaws of the grip detection, so it can be inserted into the head of the poly axial screws. The B-Dyn’s mobile rod is then placed into the top screw head. The fixed rod’s positioning must be placed facing the operator, and it has to be into the center of the lower screw head. The B -DYN grip detection has to be held first, and then, the clamp adjustment is inserted in order to adjust the inter - pedicular distance of the B -DYN. Finally, the cap of the lower polyaxial pedicular screw is tightened. A final tightening of the two screw caps on the polyaxial pedicular screws is made for max imum security."

DOCX 22 /96 4.4. SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION OF THE RESEARCH Degenerative lumbar stenosis (Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: LSS) is an extremely common disease affecting more than 102 million people worldwide every year [1]. It is one of the most common indications for spinal surgery [2, 3]. It is the result a degenerative cascade combining a disc pinch (loss of height and bulging in the vertebral canal), a hypertrophy of the ligaments and joint capsules, and a bone hypertrophy in the posterior joints processes. In a ddition to these stenotic elements, there may be some malalignment of the vertebrae as they may shift from one another (spondylolisthesis grade I), or there may even occur some deformations such as the scoliosis or degenerative cyphosis type. This patholog y often develops on a number of levels, frequently two (L5S1, L4L5 or L4L5, L3L4), and sometimes even more. These elements cause a narrowing of the canal containing the spinal nerves, they also cause invertebral foramen allowing the nerves to exit the cana l. The clinical symptomatology of this nosological set combines spinal pain and root pain with possibly neurological claudication, degrading patients' quality of life [4]. The therapeutic approach often requires surgery, in cases in which the well -conducte d medical treatment remains unsuccessful [5]. Quite a few surgical techniques are used to treat patients with LSS, still, there is much controversy about this multifaceted syndrome [6]. The elementary surgical step (laminectomy) is intended to decompress t he contents of the degenerative canal, but it may be insufficient when several levels are affected, and because the means of union between the vertebrae have been sacrificed, this may cause additional instability induced by the gesture itself [5, 7]. This instability can in turn cause painful symptoms of the lower back and/or or of the joints, and impaired neurological signs [8, 9]. Therefore, it has been suggested by many authors to associate a gesture of stabilization with the gesture of decompression [10 ]. The choice of stabilization means is discussed without any controlled study providing a conclusive response [11 –14]. This question is the subject of this study. Two alternatives were discussed: Rigid stabilisations by bolted fusion, with or without inter somatic cage (intersomatic arthrodesis), are the current standard gold, although they are blamed for excessive rigidification of the mobile segment responsible for the acceleration of the degener ation of the upper level (Adjacent Segment Disease: ASD) [ 8]. Flexible stabilization systems with dynamic rod and pedicular screwing (for example, type B - Dyn, Dynesys ). This allows to stabilize the segment(s) operated while keeping some mobility of the anatomical region. This partial preservation of mobility could slow or prevent the degradation of the upper level [15] As a matter of fact, the ongoing degeneration of the adjacent segments relative to a lumbar vertebral fusion is a concern for surgeons, and a source of symptoms for patients. This degeneration of the upper level represents a significant percentage of the spinal revision surgery [16]. Literature tells us that radiographic degeneration of the adjacent segment is very common after lumbar spin al fusion (5 -45% of cases), but a smaller proportion of this evolution causes clinically significant symptoms, or requires revision surgery (2 -15%) [17]. T hese revision procedures (neurological decompression on the incriminated level, cephalic and/or cauda l extension of the assembly) require surgical procedures that can be complex, and may imply significant morbidity risks to patients [18]. Several types of dynamic stabilization devices have been developed to reduce mechanical stress on the adjacent segment . All of them claim the quality of the fusion, however, there are controversies about whether or not, such devices can reduce the ASD [19]. The current state of the art does not allow any conclusion."

DOCX 23 /96 The ideal procedure would therefore be to combine a dynamic stabilization with the first step of decompression; this dynamic stabilization provides the patient with the clinical benefits of a fusion without degrading the upper level [20]. Therefore, it see ms relevant to be able to provide reliable data on (i) the 12th -month clinical results of this type of implants, when it comes to pain control and quality of life improvement, and also, data on (ii) the radiological parameters showing the preservation of t he mobility of the upper level which reflects the protective effect of this dynamic system. The study will be extended by a 60th -month assessment to assess the presence of an adjacent clinical and radiological syndrome. The objective of this randomized , prospective comparative study would be to establish the non -inferiority of the studied device versus conventional fusion (with or without cage) on the degree of functional incapacity after surgery, but also to demonstrate the preservation of the mobility of the upper level when assembled."

The number of patients who experienced a serious adverse event during the follow -up period, The short term and long -term, pre -operative and post -operative complications rate 6.2. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 6.2.1. STUDY DESIGN AND FLOW CHART This is a prosp ective, randomized, multicenter , comparative study of non-inferiority in parallel groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1, single -blind (the patient will be blinded from the arm of randomization). The duration of patient follow -up is 60 months. The inclusion period is 24 months in order to recruit the number of subjects need ed for the study. When the patient is eligible, he is randomized. After each procedure, the follow -up is scheduled over 60 months, with 3 consultation visits scheduled after surgery: in the 2nd, 12th and 60th months, with collection and measurement of the criteria for evaluation. The V1 Inclusion Visit will confirm the indication; the inclusion and non -inclusion criteria will be assessed; the patient will have the opportunity to sign the consent. The random draw is also done during this visit (before the su rgery). The Visit V2 corresponds to the procedure. The Visit V3 happens at the 2nd month following the surgery. The Visit V3 on the 12th month will help assess the main judgement criterion, and the one that happens on the 60th month (V5) as the study close s In case of hospitalization or consultation that occurs outside the original schedule, ad ditional visits will be planned"

DOCX 2 /96 6.2.2. PARTICIPATION SITES The research will be carried out in the following countries: France, Belgium , Georgia, with 20 participating centers. Each center will have to recruit an average of 12 to 18 patients. The centers were selected according to the following criteria: Ability to recruit patients according to protocol; Sufficient availability to conduct the study; Ability to obtain high quality data in accordance with protocol requirements; Adheren ce to regulatory requirements (BPC, etc.), legal requirements and other requirements that are specific to the study. In addition, investigators must meet the following criteria: Have recognized experience in surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis and rod placement. 6.3. MEASURES TAKEN TO REDUCE AND AVOID BIAS 6.3.1. RANDOMIZATION This is a randomized study. The randomization list will be generated using SAS® 9.4 software. Once the eligibility criteria have been verified and once the consent have been obtained, the patient will be randomized by the computer. Randomization, with a ratio of 1:1 will be stratified on the center and on the presence of spondylolisthesis (spondyl olisthesis grade 1 on the highest level VS spondylolisthesis grade 1 on the other levels, or no spondylolisthesis at all). Randomization is performed in blocks of random sizes. It will be performed via the electronic application QUANTA VIEW®. During each r andomization, electronic information will be sent to the member of the study team responsible for monitoring inclusion rates . This information will include the patient’s initials, the date of inclusion, the inclusion number for the study, and the identific ation of the physician who included the patient. 6.3.2. BLIND ING The patient will be blinded to randomization arm. Since the procedure is performed under general anesthesia, the patient will not be informed whether or not the B -Dyn® device has been installed dur ing the procedure. The assessment of the main judgement criterion (the ODI being a patient reported outcome) will therefore be blind to the group of randomization. Other secondary criteria such as quality of life or pain intensity will also be evaluated blindly in regards to the group of randomization (assessment by patient). The blind process cannot be applied to the surgeon . The installation of the device cannot be hidden from him or her. A centralized reading of all radiographs (Tele -rachis or dynamic images) will be performed by an independent radiologist. The assessment criteria such as the re - operations are objective criteria, and they can be assessed without bias even if the monitor has some knowledge of the group randomization."

MODALITIES FOR USING THE DEVICES ON WHICH THE RESEARCH IS RELATED AND THE SURGICAL PROCEDURES INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DEVICE IN THE RESEARCH 6.4.1. THE B-DYN ® DEVICE All the investigators performing this implant must be surgeons who has a broad experience in the installation of surgical treatment devices for degenerative lumbar stenosis. The contents of the devices used for the research are aseptically -packaged. The implantation instruments, supplied separately for B -DYN are not sterile and must be sterilized beforehand (See details in appendix 20.2). The B -DYN® device is described in paragra ph 4.1. The surgical installation technique is developed in the attached manual (Appendix 20.5). The procedure is performed under general anesthesia. 6.4.2. THE BOLTED FUSION TECHNIQUE WITH OR WITHOUT CAGE The fusion, also called lumbar arthrodesis consists of blocking the painful level(s), in order to limit the movement of the affected disc. In just few months, this assembly results in the fusion (or welding) of the affected vertebrae, and therefore decreas es the pain. The surgeon will complete his gesture by placing 2 screws in the upper vertebra and 2 screws in the lower vertebra; the screws will be connected to each other to stabilize the assembly. This type of surgery is done via posterior approach. 6.5. PROC ESS AND DURATION OF INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATION 6.5.1. PROCESS FOR A PATIENT 6.5.1.1.

It will be measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at the 12th month compared to the baseline data. 9.1.2. SECONDARY ENDPOINTS 1. the mobility of the instrumented level a nd adjacent levels will be measured at inclusion, 2 months, 12 months and 60 months post intervention using dynamic X -rays of the lumbar spine: the degree of mobility is calculated by subtracting the angle that is formed in flexure by the tangent of the up per layer of the upper vertebra, and the tangent of the lower layer to the angle formed by these extending tangents. For double instrumentations, an average of the mobility of the two mobile levels is pulled off. 2. the degree of functional disability related to lumbar and radicular pain will be measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at inclusion, 2 months, 12 months and 60 months post -intervention; 3. the intensity of radicular and lumbar pain will be assessed by the VAS scale (0 -100) at inclusion, 2 mo nths, 12 months and 60 months post -intervention 4. the quality of life will be assessed by the SF -12 score at inclusion, 2 months, 12 months and 60 months post - intervention; 5. anxiety will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) at in clusion, 2 months, 12 months and 60 months post intervention; 6. radiological parameters such as lumbar lordosis (LL), instrumented level segmental lordosis, disk height of the disk above the instrumentation, and pelvic parameters (pelvic incidence PI, Sacral slope (Ps) and pelvic tilt (PT) will be measured at inclusion, 2 months, 12 months and 60 months post intervention using whole body imaging (tele -rachis/ Tele -spine or EOS) 7. Neurological and motion status will be assessed at the instrumented level and adjacent levels (right and left), by measuring motor skills, feeling of touch and stinging sensation at inclusion, 2 months, 12 months and 60 months post -intervention. Various tools will be used: MRC scale (which evaluates motor function from 0: no movemen t/contractions to 5: normal m uscle strength); another scale will be used: from 0 (Absent) to 2 (Normal ) to evaluate the feeling of touch and sting. 8. The walking distance will be evaluated by self-paced test at inclusion, 2 months, 12 months and 60 months post -intervention (patient will walk maximum possible distance) 9. The rate of re -intervention on the instrumented level or adjacent level during the study (up to 60 months). A re-operation during the stud y is defined as a secondary intervention at the instrumented level or adjacent level for any reason (infectious or mechanical): revision, implant removal (explantation), fusion, and need for additional fixation. etc 10.

On the MRI, it is defined by the postoperative progression of disc degeneration according to the Pfirrmann classification, as well as the progression of spinal canal stenosis evaluated according to the classification of Imagama et al [21]. The 1 grade progression of disk degeneration or spinal canal stenosis on MRI is considered an adjacent radiological syndrome. Adjacent sympto matic syndrome : is diagnosed when clinical symptoms such as radicular pain or intermittent claudications deteriorate after surgery, and that the lesion responsible for the symptoms is the one adjacent to the fused level (on MRI).

METHODS AND TIMELINE FOR MEASURING, COLLECTING AND ANALYSING THE PARAMETERS FOR ASSESSING EFFECTIVEN ESS The data collection calendar to assess effectiveness is provided in the general outline (cf. th e general outline in paragraph 6 .2.1). The various measurement tools and questionnaires used in this trial are listed below: 9.2.1. ODI ( OSWESTRY DISABILITY I NDEX ) The Oswestry questionnaire helps assess the symptoms and severity of back pain, as well as the impairment on daily life activities. The questionnaire contains 10 questions, concerning: pain, personal care, loads, walking ability, sitting position, standin g position, sleep, sexual life, social life, travels. Each question offers 6 answers, with a score of 0 to 6 that the patient must choose; score 0 corresponds to a normal function, and score 6 to a very diminished function. (CF appendix 20.3). The score ob tained is multiplied by 2 to get a percentage of disability, with 0% for the absence of disability, and 100% for the most important disability. Completion of the test takes about 5 minutes The Oswestry Disability Index will be measured at inclusion, 2nd month, 12th month and 60 th month post -surgery. 9.2.2. VAS SCALE TO ASSESS THE PAIN INTENSITY The visual analogue scale is shaped as a graduated ruler: from 0 to 100; 0 means that the subject has no pain and 100 is the maximum pain he can bear. It’s a self -assessment scale. It is sensitive, reproducible, reliable and validated in both acu te and chronic pain situations. The intensity of the lumbar and radicular pain will be measured at inclusion on the first post -operative day, at the 2nd month, 12th month and 60th month post -surgery. 9.2.3. QUESTIONNAIRE ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE SF12 The SF -12 test is an abridged version of the « Medical Outcomes Study Short -Form General Health Survey »(SF -36) with only 12 of the 36 questions.

There are seven questions related to anxiety (total A) and seven others related to the depressive dimension (total D ); this provides two scores (maximum score of each score = 21). (c f. appendix 20.9) The depression and anxiety score will be measured at inclusion on the first post -operative day, at the 2nd month, the 12th month , and the 60th month post -surgery. 9.2.5. NEUROLOGICAL AND MOTOR STATUS ASSESSMENT Different tools will be used: an MRC scale (which evaluates the motor function: 0 means no movement/contractions, 5 means normal muscle strength ), and another scale: 0 means Absent and 2 means Normal ; this is used to assess the sensation of touch and sting. The neurological and motor status will be assessed at the L4, L5 and S1 levels (right and left) ( See Appendix 20.8) 9.2.6. SIMPLE RADIOGRAPHY (TELE RACHIS OR EOS) This is a face and p rofil X -ray, on which the sagittal alignment parameters will be measured. It will be carried out at the 2nd month, the 12th month, and the 60th month post intervention. An independent radiologist will be in charge of the centralized reading. 9.2.7. DYNAMIC RADIOG RAPHY This is an radiograph, on which the mobility of the instrumented level and the adjacent levels will be measured. During this radiograph, the patient will be asked to bend down until he/she reaches the painful threshold in flexion and extension, and in lateral inclination. This image should focus on the instrumented level. It will be carried out at the 2nd month, the 12th month, and the 60th month post intervention.

Plan of the study in section Erreur ! Source du renvoi introuvable. .). 10.3. PROCEDURES IN PLACE FOR R FOR ADVERSE EVENT RECORDING AND REPORTING 10.3.1. DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)/ ADVERSE DEVICE EVENTS (ADE) Adverse event (AE): any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human beings undergoing research involving human subject, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research. Adverse device effect (ADE): any untoward and unintended responses to the use of an investigational medical device. This includes any adverse event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use, the deployment, the implantation, the installation, the operation , or any malfunction of the investigational medical device - This includes any event that is a result of a use error or intentional misuse. Each AE must be classified by the investigator as serious or non -serious. This classification determines the procedu re to be followed in reporting the event to the Sponsor Cousin Biotech. This definition includes events related to both the investigational device and the comparator. It also includes events relating to implantation of the device. The investigator must re cord all AEs observed directly and all AEs reported by the patient using suitable medical terminology. During visits, patient will be questioned by the investigator about the onset of any AEs throughout the entire study. Adverse events are recorded in the case report form. The investigator must indicate any possible relationship between the investigational device and the adverse event, as well as the relationship between implantation of the device and the adverse event. The safety evaluation criteria must b e evaluated and recorded by the investigators throughout the study, and collected by the Sponsor during monitoring visits. These comprise symptoms, dates, outcome, measures taken, and, where necessary, the results of any examinations and laboratory tests. The investigator must record in the “adverse events” section of the case report form any events significant for the study: 1. Reported by the patient (spontaneously or during the questioning) or observed by the investigator (during clinical examination); 2. Whe ther or not they are considered attributable to the device or to the surgery process; 3. the record of the event will comprise the following information:"

Patients may contact the investigator about any adverse events occurring during the study or after the end of the study. Defects in the device in terms of its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or its performances must be recorded throughout the entire duration of the study. Such deficiencies will be reported at least as adverse events. 10.3.2. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) Any adverse event which: 1. Results in death (including deaths due to progression of the disease being treated); 2. Places the life of the person involved in the research in danger (i.e., immediately life -threatening at the time of the adverse event independently of the consequences of corrective or palliative treatment); 3. Requires hospitalisation or prolongs hospitalisation; 4. Causes incapacity (any clinically signif icant, temporary or permanent handicap) or severe or sustainable handicap; 5. Results in a congenital abnormality or malformation. Planned hospitalisation for a pre -existing disorder or a procedure required by the protocol without serious deterioration in h ealth is not deemed to be a serious adverse event. Other events which do not meet the criteria listed above may be deemed to be “potentially serious”. These events may be declared in the same way as per the declaration of serious adverse events on the medical judgement of the investigator or COUSIN BIOTEC H. 10.3.3.

Thus, either the cause of the event has been identified or the investigational device cannot be implicated. RELATIONSHIP UNLIKELY The time to onset of the event is relatively inconsistent with the implantation of the device; other possible causes exist. RELATIONSHIP POSSIBLE A chronological relationship exists, but other causes appear more likely; however, the implantation of the device cannot be ruled out. RELATIO NSHIP PROBABLE A chronological relationship exists, and while other causes are possible, they are unlikely. 10.3.5. DURATION OF THE PERIOD OF NOTIFICATION OF SAE TO THE SPONSOR The collection period for AEs and SAEs will begin as soon as informed consent has been signed and end at the 24 month visit. This period, however, may be extended if the investigator considers that it is necessary to follow -up the event for a longer period of time or for an unresolved SAEs. All adverse e vents, whether or not related to the implanted device, must be followed -up until they have resolved or until the investigator considers them to be chronic or stable or until the patients’ participation in the study has ended (i.e., a final report has been produced for this patient). In addition, all serious and non -serious adverse events which are deemed by the investigator to be potentially related to the study device or to the procedure used for the device must be followed -up, even after the end of the st udy. The instructions to report changes in ongoing adverse events during the patient’s participation in the study are shown in the corresponding pages of the case report form. All events which occur in patients during this period must be reported to COUSIN BIOTECH by the investigator as soon as he/she becomes aware of them and whether or not they are deemed to be related to the device. Any event which occurs after the end of the study and which the investigator assesses as being potentially related to the r esearch must also be reported as an adverse event. 10.3.6.

NUMBER OF SUBJECTS REQUIRED The objective of the project is to look for a non -inferiority of the «B -DYN» group compared to the «bolted fusion with or without cage» group, on the degree of functional disability after surgery evaluated by the Oswestry disability index (ODI) at the 12th month post -surgery . According to the literature, patients with a fusion shows 37.1% ODI decrease by 1 -year, compared to the baseline. Considering this hypothesis, a sample size of N= 188 patients (94 “Bdyn” / 94 “Fusion”) will be a 90% demonstration proof of a non-inferiority by considering a non-inferiority margin of -2 and a standard deviation of 6.7. Considering a 15% attrition rate, we will include a total of 216 patients. An intermediate analysis is planned once 100 patients will have reached the main assessment criterion. 11.2. DESCRIPTION OF THE STATISTICAL METHODS This is a randomized, single -blind, comparative study. All analyses will be described and detailed in the statistical analysis plan, and will be drawn up by the statistician in charge of the s tudy, and validated before the database is frozen. The analysis plan will be reviewed by the statistical and clinical team, when the data are complete and available, and before the unblinding at the Blind review meeting. During the review, decisions will b e made on the appropriate course of action to be taken, in relation to contentious cases (including false data), this will also be detailed in the final statistical analysis plan.

For qualitative criteria: percentages and 95% CI will be calculated. The characteristics of inclusion will be described for each group. As the study is randomized, no statistical tests will be used to compare patient’ s characteristics at inclusion. 11.2.3.2. ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN CRITERION Each time 100 patients meet the main criteria of evaluation, the analysis will be conducted with intent to treat each of them. This analysis will use a triangular test. The analysis of the main judgement criterion will consist of comparing the Oswestry Di sability Index (ODI) between the ""B -DYN"" group and the ""Bolted Fusion with or without cage"" group at M12, adjusted to the base score value by a covariance analysis (ANCOVA). A random effect at the center level will be introduced. 11.2.3.3. ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY CRIT ERIA OF EFFICIENCY Analysis of the B -DYN effect on the evolution of the Oswestry disability index, the lumbar and radicular pain VAS score, the quality of life score, anxiety, and the range of radiological parameters (mobility, etc.), between the inclusion , M2 and M 12, and M60. The motor and neurological status scores will also be assessed in a mixed ANCOVA model for repeated measurements. In case of a non -compliance with the validity conditions of the test, a transformation of variables can be applied. If this method shows to be insufficient, a rank analysis will be implemented. A random effect at the center level will be introduced into the model. For all these tests, the bilateral significance threshold is set at 5%. The comparison of the relapse rate an d surgical re -operations (explantations, revisions and re -operations whatever the cause) between the two groups will be done using a Chi2 or Fisher test in case of insufficient numbers. 11.2.3.4. ANALYSIS OF THE CLINICAL TOLERANCE The occurrence of these events (re vision, explantation) will be described by using the Kaplan -Meier method, and it will be compared between the two groups by the log -rank test. The incidence rates of adverse events will be calculated and compared between the groups using Chi² or Fisher in case of insufficient numbers. The intensity of adverse events will be compared between the groups using Chi² or Fisher in case of insufficient numbers. The incidence of Aes will be tabulated by preferred system and/or organ, and by the term defined by the MedDra classification. A particular attention will be paid to patients who have had at least one severe adverse event with severe intensity, causing the explantation of the tested device; or if the severe adverse event is judged in relation to the treatmen t being tested (possible, severe or certain). The analysis of adverse events will be conducted through a “patient” approach rather than an “event” approach. For all these tests, the bilateral significance threshold is set at 5%. 11.3.

The data will be collected in real time by the clinicians and processed in accordance with current legislation. Monitoring will be provided by the clinical research associates in each investigating centre throughout the duration of the study in order to ensure that the study is conducted correctly. Signature and compliance of each patient’s consent will be routinely checked. The original documents will be reviewed to ensure that the data are consist ent with the case report form. Monitoring will be conducted in accordance with ICH E6 recommendations. The investigator and staff involved in the study must be available during the monitoring visits and any audits or inspections and provide sufficient tim e for these to be conducted. Quality control will be carried out by the Clinical Research Associate. As the sponsor has classified this study as increased monitoring status which means that the CRA will carry out 1 set up visit, the number of monitoring visits required to check 20% of the case report forms and a closure visit in each centre. All of the case report form data and the presence of all signed co nsents will be checked. The presence of all signed consents will be checked. These visits will be carried out according to the QM standard operating procedures. A visit report will be drawn up following these visits and sent within a maximum period of 7 days to the project lead who will approve these. The data submitted will be checked and subject to data management in accordance with QUANTA MEDICAL requirements and procedures and consistent with professional requirements. An audit may also be carried ou t by COUSIN BIOTECH or any organisation appointed by the sponsor or by the Health Authorities . 13.1.

POTENTIAL BENEFITS The use of the B -DYN device in the surgical treatment of lumbar stenosis could lead to maintaining the functional disability related to low back pain (preservation of walking ability and mobility) compared to fusion processing; it also helps mainta in the level’s mobility, while respecting the sagittal balance. The hypothesis expresses that patients in the experimental group (B -DYN) will have less long -term adjacent syndrome compared to patients who have had a fusion. 16.5.2. POTENTIAL RISKS This research does not entail any additional risk compared to the risk incurred during surgeries for the management of lumbar stenosis. The complications are essentially those related to the surgical procedure: Complications of general anesthesia: these complications are detailed in the information sheet of the French Society of Anesthesia and Resuscitation, and are identical to those of any general anesthesia. Complications related to any surgery on the spine. We will menti on infections, hemorrhage, pain, leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid, loss of neurological functions, etc. These complications will all be presented to you by your surgeon before the procedure. The treatment of these complications is well known and the inve stigative doctor knows how to take them in charge Other complications that may arise are related to the medical device itself: Early or late loosening of any or all of the components"
