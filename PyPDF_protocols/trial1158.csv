Prior to randomization, investigators must select and record the TPC option in the event the participant will be assigned to that arm. Randomization will follow a predefined randomization scheme based on the following stratification factors: MMR status (proficient [pMMR] or deficient [dMMR]), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 or 1), geographic region (Region 1: Europe, USA, Canada, Aust ralia, New Zealand, and Israel or Region 2: rest of the world), and prior history of pelvic radiation (yes or no). First, participants will be stratified according to MMR status. Then, only within the pMMR stratum, participants will be further stratified a ccording to ECOG performance status, geographic region, and prior history of pelvic radiation. A total of 9 strata will be utilized for the study. Duration of ParticipationAfter a screening phase of 28 days, each eligible participant will be assigned to receive study treatment until disease progression is radiographically documented and verified by BICRper RECIST 1.1, and only when clinically appropriate, confirmed by the site per unacceptable adverse event(s) (AEs), withdrawal of consent, intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator’s decision to discontinue the participant, noncompliance with study treatment or procedure requirements or admin istrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment, until the participant has received 35 administrations of pembrolizumab (approximately 2 years), or the participant has received a lifetime cumulative dose of 500mg/m² of doxorubicin.

Participants will be permitted to continue study treatment beyond RECIST 1.1 -defined disease progression as long as the maximum dose of the study drugs have not been reached (eg, 35 administrations of pembrolizumab or lifetime cumulative dose of 500 mg/m² of doxorubicin), if the treating investigator considers that the participant may experience clinical benefit with continued treatment, and the participant is tolerating study treatment. All decisions to continue treatment beyond 2 consecutive scans (at least 4 weeks apart) showing progression must be discussed with the MSD Medical Monitor (Section8.2.1.6 and Appendix 5) . After the end of treatment, each participant will be followed for the occurrence of AEs and spontaneously reported pregnancy as described under Section 8.4. Participants who discontinue for reasons other than radiographic disease progression will have post- treatment follow-up imaging for disease status until disease progression is documented radiographically per RECIST1.1 and verified by BICR, initiating a non -study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent, or becoming los t to follow-up.All participants will be followed by telephone for overall survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study.

Lenvatinib inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functio ns, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; platelet -derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. Lenvatinib also exhibited antiproliferative activity in cell lines dependent on activated FGFR signaling with aconcurrent inhibition of FGF -receptor substrate 2α phosphorylation. Pembrolizumab combined with o nce daily (QD) dosing of lenvatinib is currently being developed for the treatment of advanced endometrial cancer . Refer to the respective Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed background information on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib . Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background Lenvatinib Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from a pre -existing vascular network, is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. VEGF and its family of receptors (VEGRs 1 -3) play a major role in tumor angiogenesis [Ferrara, N., et al 2003] [Ellis, L. M. 2008] [Tammela, T. 2010] . Accumulated evidence suggests that FGF and its receptor tyrosine kinase, FGFR also play important roles for tumor angiogenesis [Cross, M. J. 2001 ] [Lieu, C., et al 2011] [Limaverde -Sousa, G., et al 2014] . Lenvatinib is a potent multiple RTK inhibitor that selectively inhibits VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), FGFR1 -4, PDGFRα, KIT, and RET. Among known kinase inhibitors in clinical use, lenvatinib is one of the only inhibitors currently labeled with a mechanism of action as an inhibitor of not only VEGFRs but also FGFRs, both of which are currently believed to be very important for tumor angiogenesis. Lenvatinib inhibited cell -free kinase activities for VEGFR1- 3 and FGFR1-3 with K ivalues around 1 nmol/L, and 8 -22 nmol/L, respectively. In cell-based assays, lenvatinib inhibited VEGF-derived and FGF -derived tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)with IC 50values of 2.1 and 7.3 nmol/L, respective ly. Analysis of the signal transduction molecules revealed that lenvatinib inhibited both the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)pathway and the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR)-S6 kinase ( S6K)- S6 pathway in HUVECs triggered by activated VEGFR and FGFR.Furthermore, lenvatinib (10, 30 mg/kg) significantly inhibited both VEGF -and FGF-driven angiogenesis in a murine in vivo model [Yamamoto, Y., et al 2014] . In vivo, lenvatinib exhibited anti tumoractivity 06DJ4W"

I n addition, the anti tumoractivity of lenvatinib in combination with other anticancer agents in several xenograft models was greater than that of lenvatinib or the other agents alone. In summary, lenvatinib inhibited VEGF -driven VEGFR2 phosphorylation and suppressed proliferation and tube formation in HUVEC models. A ntitumoractivity of lenvatinib in vivo has been shown in numerous xenograft animals. These results suggest that lenvatinib may be a novel anticancer therapy through inhibition of angiogenesis and may be useful as eithe r monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer drugs. Pembrolizumab The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformations has been known for decades [Disis, M. L. 2010] .Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies. In particular, the presence of cluster of differentiation 8 positive (CD8+) T- cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T- regs) correlates with improved prognosis and long -term survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and RCC.Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor responses in cancers such as melanoma [Dudley, M. E., et al 2005] [Hunder, N. N., et al 2008]. The PD-1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control.The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD L1 and/or PD- L2) [Greenwald, R. J., et al 2005] [Okazaki, T., et al 2001] . The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [Zhang, X., et al 2004] .PD-1 and its family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig -variable–type (IgV type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic ta il of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif. Following T- cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP -1 and SHP-2, to the immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase C-theta (PKCθ), and zeta -chain-associated protein kinase (ZAP70), which are involved in the C D3 T-cell signaling cascade [Okazaki, T., et al 2001] [Chemnitz, J. M., et al 2004] [Sheppard, K- A, et al 2004] [Riley, J. L. 2009] .The mechanism by which PD -1 down- modulates T -cell respons es is similar to, but distinct from, that of CTLA- 4, because both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins [Parry, R. V., et al 2005] 06DJ4W"

M., et al 2010] .As a consequence, t he PD 1/PD -L1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in endometrial cancer (EC). Endometrial Cancer: Epidemiology and Current Therapeutic Options Endometrial cancer is the fifth most common cancer in women worldwide, with approximatel y 320,000 new cases diagnosed in 2012 [Ferlay, J., et al 2015] .In the United States, the estimated numbers of new cases and deaths occurring in 2017 are 61,380 and 10,920, respectively. A majority of EC cases are identified at an early stage with a 5 -year survival rate of 95.3% for localized EC [National Cancer Institute 2017] .However, despite early detection, approximately 13% of all endometr ial cancers recur [Fung-Kee-Fung, M., et al 2006].In general, for patients with advanced or recurrent EC, median survival is only approximately 12 months [Obel, J. C., et al 2006] . For patients presenting with advanced disease, treatment options are limited with no consensus on a standard regimen. Chemotherapy has been the standard of care in the first-line treatment of EC, with platinum compounds, anthracyclines ,andtaxanes being the most commonly used ,alone and in combination [National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2017][Colombo, N., et al 2013] .Cytotoxic therapy is also a de facto standard in second -line treatment; however, response rates are low, progression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are short ,and no drug has proven to be effective. To date, studies in this setting have shown response rates of 15% or lower with median OS and PFS of approxima tely 12 months and 4 months, respectively [McMeekin, S., et al 2015] . Given the unmet clinical need in this patient population, exploration of novel therapeutic approaches is warranted. The proposed multicenter, randomized, open -label, Phase 3 study ( KEYNOTE- 775/E7080- G000-309, hereafter referred to as “Study 309”) will compare the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab versus treatment of physician’s choice (TPC) in participant s with advanced EC. Scientific Rationale for the Combination of Lenvatinib with Pembrolizumab In preclinicalmodels, lenvatinib decreased the tumor associated macrophage (TAM) population ,which is known as an immune -regulator in the tumor microenvironment. The decrease in TAM population was accompanied by increases in activated cytotoxic T -cell populations through stimulation of interferon -gamma signaling, resulting in increased immune activation [Kimura, T., et al 20 18].The immune -modulating effect of lenvatinib may result in a potent combination effect with PD -1/PD-L1 signal inhibitors. The effect of combining lenvatinib with an anti -human PD -1 humanized mAb was investigated in 4 murine tumor isograft models, whi ch showed significant tumor growth inhibition compared to control. In the RAG murine tumor isograft tumor model, survival in the group treated with the combination was significantly longer than that of the respective monotherapy groups. In the CT26 murine tumor isograft model, treatment with the combination significantly increased the population of activated cytotoxic T -cells compared to that of the respective monotherapy groups [Kato, Y., et al 2019] . All treatments were well tolerated, and severe body weight loss was not observed . 06DJ4W"

The EC participants were predominantly Caucasian (83%), with a median age of 63.7 years, and all had an ECOG performance status score of 0 (38%) or 1 (62%). All participants had received prior anticancer therapy regimens (1 prior [42%], 2 prior [42%], ≥3 prior [17%]). At baseline, 85% of participants had microsatellite stable (MSS ) tumors, 7.5% had microsatellite instability (MSI) -high (MSI -H) tumors, and 7.5% of participants had an unknown MSI status. Thirteen participants (24.5%) were PD -L1 positive, 11 (20.8%) were PD- L1 negative, and 29 (54.7%) were not tested for PD -L1 status. The best overall response (BOR) was evaluated per immune -related Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (irRECIST) by both investigator assessment and independent radiology review (IRR). As of the 15-DEC-2017 data cutoff, the BOR by investigator assessment included 1 CR (1.9%), 20 PR (37.7%) and 25 SD (47.2%). The BOR as assessed by independent radiology review (3 CR [5.7%], 22 PR [41.5%], and 19 SD [35.8%]) was comparable to the BOR by investigator assessment. By investigator assessment, the prima ry endpoint of objective response rate (ORR)at Week24 (ORR Week24) was equal to the overall ORR (39.6% [21/53; 95% CI: 26.5 –54.0]). Comparable ORRs were observed in subgroups of participants with MSI -H tumors (2/4 [50.0%]; 95% CI: 6.8 –93.2) versus those with MSS tumors (16/45 [35.6%]; 95% CI: 21.9 – 51.2). Secondary analysis of tumor efficacy by IRR showed an ORR Week24of 45.3% and an overall ORR of 47.2%. Median PFS by investigator assessment per irRECIST was 7.4 months (95% CI :5.0-not estimable). Treatment with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was associated with an acceptable safety profile in this patient population. Toxicities were generally manageable with supportiv e medications, dose interruptions, and/or lenvatinib dose reductions. The most frequently reported treatment -related AEs (any grade) were hypertension (59%), fatigue (55%), diarrhea (51%), hypothyroidism (47%), and decreased appetite (40%). Of the 5 deaths that occurred in this study, only 1 death (caused by an AE of intracranial hemorrhage) was considered related to the study intervention by the investigator. Clinical Data on Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab as Single Agents for the Treatment of EC Eisai and M SD have conducted studies of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab as single agents, respectively, in the treatment of advanced EC. Eisai has conducted a Phase 2 open -label, single -arm study of lenvatinib monotherapy in advanced EC following first -line platinum -based chemotherapy with 133 treated participant s (E7080-G000-204).The primary endpoint was ORR, based on RECIST 1.1, as determined by independent radiologic review (IRR).

For the responders, the median duration of response was 7.2 months based on I RR assessment and 8.0 months based on investigator assessment. Median OS was 10.6 months with a median duration of follow -up of 15.2months(Eisai Data on File). Most participant s experienced at least 1 treatment -emergent AE ( TEAE; 126/133 participant s, 94.7%) and at least 1 TEAE reported as treatment- related (116/133 participant s, 87.2%). The most frequen tly reported TEAEs (>20% of all participant s, in descending frequency) were hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, asthenia, vomiting, stomatitis, proteinuria, dysphonia and weight decreased. The most commonl y reported TEAEs reported as treatment -related (>20% of participant s, in order of descending frequency) were as follows: hypertension, fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, headache, nausea, proteinuria, and stomatitis. TEAEs that were Grade 3 or above (severe) occurred in 97 (72.9%) participant s; this includes 14 participant s (10.5%) with Grade 5 events. Among the 14 Grade 5 SAEs, 6 of these were also associated with disease progression. Observed toxicities were consistent with previously reported events associated with lenvatinib and other drugs that target the VEGFR (Eisai D ata on File). MSD has conducted a Phase 1b study evaluating pembrolizumab monotherapy (10 mg/kg administered IV every 2 weeks [Q2W]) in 24 participants with PD -L1 positive adva nced EC, including 22 participant s who received 1 or more prior lines of therapy for advanced disease (KEYNOTE -028[KN028], NCT02054806).At the time of the data cutoff ( 17-FEB-2016), the ORR, based on RECIST 1.1, was 13% (n=3), and median PFS observed was 1.8 months with 6-and 12-month PFS rates of 19.0% and 14.3%, respectively. The median OS was not reached, and the 6 -and 12-month OS rates wer e 67.0% and 51.0%, respectively [Ott, P. A., et al 2017] . At the time of the data cutoff, the median follow -up duration was 76.2 weeks (range: 2.6 to 94.3 weeks). Thirteen participant s (54.2%) experienced treatment -related AEs, with fatigue (20.8%), pruritus (16.7%), pyrexia (12.5%), and decreased appetite (12.5% ) occurring in ≥10% of participant s. Grade 3 treatment -related AEs were reported in 4 participants (16.7%): 1participant had asthenia and back pain; 1 participant had anemia, hyperglycemia, and hyponatremia; 1participant had chills and pyrexia; and 1participanthad diarrhea. No participant experienced a Grade 4 AE or immune -mediated AE of any grade, no participant discontinued treatment because of an AE, and no participant experienced treatment-related death [Ott , P. A., et al 2017] . MSD is further investigating the clinical benefit of pembrolizumab monotherapy (200 mg administered IV Q3W) for in advanced EC, regardless of PD-L1 positivity, in the multi-cohort Phase 2 KN158 (NCT02628067) study. As of 28-APR-2017, 107 EC participant s have been treated. A majority of participant s (62.6%) had not received prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy. Most participant s had received prior therapy for recurrent/metastatic disease (1 prior [29.0%], 2 prior [27.1%], 3 or more prior [31.8%]), with 10.3% of participant s receiving no prior therapy for recurrent/metastatic disease(MSD Data on File) . 06DJ4W CCI"

Median PFS observed was 2.1 months. The median OS was 11.1 months (MSD Data on File). The majority of participant s had at least 1 AE (n=103; 96.3%), with 64.5% (n=69) considered related to the study drug by the investigator. Grade 3, 4, or 5 events occurred in 57.9% of participant s, with 15.9% considered related to the study drug by the investigator. There were 3 participant s who died while on study. One death case was due to pulmonary sepsis (starting 32 days after start of treatment), 1 death was due to dyspnea (starting 45 days after start of treatment ), and 1death was due to general physical deterioration, with cardiac arrest (starting 14 days after the start of treatment). These deaths were not attributed to clinical or radiological progression. The most com mon AEs of any grade occurring in ≥25% of participant s were decreased appetite (26.2%), nausea (29.0%), and fatigue (29.9% ; MSD Data on File) . The observed toxicities of pembrolizumab monotherapy in advanced EC are consistent with previously reported events associated with pembrolizumab. The ORR from these studies suggest that the activity observed for the combination of lenvatinib with pembroli zumab in Study 111 /KEYNOTE- 146 is greater than can be accounted for by each of these single agents on their own.

Benefit/Risk Assessment It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studieswill directly benefit from treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information about the safety and effectiveness of an investiga tional medicine. As discussed in Sections 2.1.2.5 and 2.1.2.6, both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab (alone and in combination), have shown promising efficacy in participants with EC. Given the short median survival [Obel, J. C., et al 2006] and limited treatment options for patients with advanced or recurrent EC, there is an unmet need for clinical need for novel therapies in this setting.The existing data suggest that in hibiting angiogenesis in combination with PD- 1 blockade is a promising therapeutic strategy and the benefit:risk assessment for participants included in this study is considered to be favorable. 06DJ4W CCI"

Enrollment of dMMR participants will be capped at 120. Prior to randomization, investi gators must select and record the TPC option in the event the participant will be assigned to that arm. Randomization will follow a predefined randomization scheme based on the following stratification factors: MMR status (pMMR or dMMR), ECOG performance s tatus (0 or 1), geographic region ( Region 1: Europe, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel or Region 2: rest of the world ), and prior history of pelvic radiation (yes or no). First, participant s will be stratified according to MMR status. Then, only within the pMMR stratum, participant s will be further stratified according to ECOG performance status, geographic region, and prior history of pelvic radiation. A total of 9strata will be utilized for the study. The end of the study will be the date o f data cutoff for the final OS analysis (ie, 526deathsin pMMR participants ) or the time of last participant /last treatment, whichever occurs later. Screening Period Screening will occur between Day -28 and Day -1. The purpose of the Screening Period is to obtain informed consent and to establish protocol eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in Section 5.1and Section 5.2, respectively. Informed consent will be obtained after the stud y has been fully explained to each participant and before the conduct of any screening procedures or assessments. Procedures to be followed when obtaining informed consent are detailed in Section 8.1.1. Eligible participants must have measurable disease a ccording to RECIST 1.1 [Eisenhauer, E. A., et al 2009] confirmed by BICR prior to randomization. Available historical tumor or fresh tumor biopsy specimen must be submitted for all participants prior to randomization for determination of MMR status by a designated central laboratory. Laboratory tests should be performed within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment. A pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential [WOCBP]) should be performed wi thin 72 hours of the first dose of study treatment. Repeated laboratory evaluation to establish eligibility is not allowed unless discussed and agreed upon with MSD . Participants who complete the Screening Period and meet the criteria for inclusion/exclus ion (Sections 5.1 and 5.2) will begin the Treatment Period. The appropriate case report form (CRF)page must be completed to indicate whether the participant is eligible to participate in the study and to provide reasons for screen failure, if applicable. If the MMR result is not available within 28 days from when the original consent was obtained, an extension may be grantedafter consultation with MSD as long as all other screening procedures are performed within the correct timeframe. 06DJ4W"

Participant s will undergo safety and efficacy assessments as defined in the SoA (Section 1.3 .1). Participant s will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression is confirmed by BICR, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, receipt of 35administrations of pembrolizumab (approximately 2 years), or a lifetime cumulative dose of 500mg/m² of doxorubicin. Discontinuation of pembrolizumab treatment may be considered for participants who have attained a confirmed CR ,have been treated for at least 8 cycles (at least 24 weeks) with pembrolizumab ,and had at least 2 treatments with pembrolizumab be yond the date when the initial CR was declared. Participant s who stop study treatment after receiving 35 administrations of pembrolizumab for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability, or participant s who attain a CR and stop pembrolizumab may be eligible for up to an additional year of treatment with pembrolizumab ( 17 cycles ) ± lenvatinib upon experiencing disease progression (Second Course Phase; Section6.6.5). Participants who complete treatment with pembrolizumab after 35 cycles (approxi mately 2 years) or CR will continue to receive lenvatinib alone until disease progression is confirmed by BICR, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Participant s will be permitted to continue study treatment beyond RECIST 1.1- defined disease progression as long as the maximum dose of the study drugs have not been reached (e.g. 35administrations of pembrolizumab or a lifetime cumulative dose of 500 mg/m² of doxorubicin), the treating investigator considers that the participant may experience clinical benefit with continued treatment, and, the participant is tolerating study treatment (Section 8.2.1.6and Appendix 5).All decisions to continue treatment beyond 2 consecutive scans showing progression at least 4 weeks apart must be discussed with the MSD Medical Monitor. Disease progression (per RECIST 1.1) must be confirmed by BICR by the central imaging vendor(CIV) prior to the investigator discontinuing study tre atment for a participant .In situations where the investigator judges that alternative treatments must be instituted immediately for a participant ’s safety study drug may be discontinued without waiting for confirmation of radiographic evidence of disease progression by BICR.In these cases, the investigator should consult with MSDbefore discontinuation of the participant from study treatment, if possible.

Efficacy Follow -up Period The Efficacy Follow-up Period will begin the day after the EOT Visit and will continue as long as the participant is alive,until the data cutoff date for the primary OS analysis, or when all participant s have discontinued study treatment, unless the participant withdraws consent, or is lost to follow -up.If a participantdiscontinues study treatment and withdraws consent to continued follow -up, the investigator must not access confidential records that require the participant ’s consent. However, an investigator may consult public records to establish survival status if permitted by local regulations. If participants in the TPC arm meet the eligibility criteria and enter the Crossover phase, the procedures for Crossover phase will be followed (Section 8.2.3). This information will be recorded unless this information is not allowed to be provided due to confidentiality. Participants will also be asked to complete HRQoL questionnaires as outlined in S ection8.2.2. If a participant fails to attend a scheduled assessment (eg, visit/phone), the investigator or designee will make every attempt to contact the participant to determine his or her status. All attempts at contact will be recorded in the participant’s medical notes. Participant s will be judged as lost to follow -up as outline din Section 7.3.

F ollowing Amendment 08, the pre -planned IA2 is no longer required because the success criteria for the study hypotheses of PFS, OS, and ORR were met at the first interim analysis (IA1). Details are described in Section 9 .7. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This multicenter, randomized, open -label, Phase 3 study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of lenvatini b in combination with pembrolizumab versus TPC in participant s with advanced EC who have been treated with at least 1 prior platinum -based chemotherapy regimen. Randomization will be used in this study to avoid bias in the assignment of participant s to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown participant attributes (eg, demographics and baseline characteristics) are balanced across treatment arms, and to ensure the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment arms. Treatments wil l be open- labeled, since the dosage and administration is different between lenvatinib, pembrolizumab, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel. The sample size is estimated based on the primary endpoints ofPFS and OS, and the required target events to detect the superiority of lenvatinib to TPC in the comparison of PFS and OS. Rationale for Patient Population Tumors that have a large number of somatic mutations have been shown to be more susceptible to PD -1 inhibition. One mechanism that generates increased numbers o f somatic mutations is through defects in MMR. MMR corrects errors that spontaneously occur during DNA replication, such as single -base mismatches ,short insertions ,and deletions. Tumors with defects in MMR are known to harbor hundreds to thousands of somatic mutations. Regions of repetitive DNA, known as microsatellites, are known to be particularly susceptible to these deficiencies. Although the length of these mic rosatellite regions is highly variable from person to person, each individual has microsatellite regions of a set length. MMR deficiency leads to the accumulation of mutations in these regions, termed microsatellite instability (MSI). Patients with MSI -H/dMMR -mutant EC appear to have more favorable response rates to pembrolizumab alone , whichwas recently granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI -H or dMRR tumors, including EC. In order to account for the improved efficacy of pembrolizumab in the MSI -H/dMRR EC population, the sample size will be powered for the pMMR population. Thus, the study will enroll all EC participants (both pMMR and dMMR) and the sample size would increase to account for the additional dMMR patients (an estimated 10- 15% increase in sample size). The study will stop recruitment once fully enrolled for pMMR participants (n=660) and the number of participants with dMMR will be capped (n=120). The primary statistical analysis will be completed for pMMR participants first, then the entire study population (all -comers). 06DJ4W"

The use of BICR and RECIST 1.1 to assess PFS is typically considered acceptable by regulatory authorities. Images will be read by a CI Vblinded to treatment assignment to minimize bias in the response assessments. In addition, the final determination of radiologic progression will be based on the central assessment of progression, rather than a local site investigator/radiology assessment. Real time determination of radiologic progression as determined by central review will be communicat ed to the site. Overall survival has been recognized as the gold standard for the demonstration of superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy in randomized clinical studies. RECIST 1.1 RECIST 1.1 will be used by the BICR when assessing images for efficacy measures and by the local site when determining eligibility (Section 8.2.1.5). Although traditional RECIST 1.1 references a maximum of 5 target lesions in total and 2 per organ, this protocol has implemented a modification to RECIST 1.1 to allow a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per organ. 06DJ4W CCI CCI"

Adverse events will be assessed as defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 3. Rationale for Patient Reported Outcomes Symptomatic improvement is considered a clinical benefit and accepted by health authorities. As part of the analyses for this study, participants will provide information regarding their health-related QoL (HRQoL) via the following assessment tools: European Organisation for the Research and Tre atment of Cancer (EORTC )QLQ-C30, and the questionnaires. These measures are not pure efficacy or safety endpoints because they are affected by both disease progression and treatment tolerability. EORTC QLQ -30 The EORTC QLQ -C30 is the most widely used cancer-specific health -related quality oflife (QoL) instrument, which contains 30 items and measures 5 functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 3 symptom items (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), 6 single items (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact), and a global health and QoL scale [Aaronson, N. K., et al 1993] . The EORTC QLQ - C30 is a psychometrically and clinically validated instrument appropriate for assessing QoL in oncology studies [Aaronson, N.

There were 2 dose -limiting toxicities ( DLTs)at thedose oflenvatinib 24 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W (1 participant had Grade 3 arthralgia and another had Grade 3 fatigue); hence, this was defined as the toxic dose. No DLTs were reported in the next 10participant s (expansion part), all of whom received the lenvatinib 20 mg/day plus pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W dose. Based on the promising antitumor efficacy and tolerable safety profile seen in both the endometrial carcinoma and RCC expansion cohorts from Study 111/KEYNOTE -146 [Makker, V., et al 2018] , threePhase 3 studies have been initiated for both of these tumor types, Study E7080 -G000-309/KEYNOTE -775,Study E7080- G000-307/KEYNOTE- 581, and LEAP- 001. Pembrolizumab The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg Q3W. Based on the totality of data generated in the Ke ytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications and regardless of tumor type. As outlined below, this dose is justified by: •Clinical data from 8 randomized studies demonstrating flat dose -and exposure - efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q2W, •Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including overall survival at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications, and •Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred from pharmacokinetic [PK] data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically based PK [PBPK] analysis) at 200 mg Q3W Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled with melanoma and NSCLC, covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously treated, PD- L1 enriched, and all- comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q 3W versus 10 mg/kg Q3W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of these studies demonstrated flat dose -and exposure -response rela tionships across the doses studied representing an approximate 5 -to 7.5-fold difference in exposure. 06DJ4W"

Subsequently, flat dose -exposure-response relationships we re also observed in other tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming 200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose independent of the tumor type. These findings are consistent with the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, which acts by interaction with immune cells, and not via direct binding to cancer cells. Additionally, pharmacology data clearly show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. First, PK data in KN001 evaluating target -mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated saturation of PD -1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W. Second, a PBPK analysis was conducted to predict tumor PD -1 saturation over a wide range of tumor penetration and PD -1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD -1 saturation in both blood and tumor. Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed -dosing provides similar control of PK variability as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by these PK characteristics and gi ven that fixed- dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was selected for evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols. Chemotherapy Doses and regimens for TPC (Arm B ; doxorubicin 60 mg/m2Q3W or paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 3weeks on/1 week off ) were selected based on standard clinical practice. Maximum Dose/Exposure for This Study The maximum dose/exposure of pembrolizumab allowed in this study is 200 mg Q3W up to 2 years; however, participants may be eligible for an additional 17 administrations (1 year; Section 6.6.5). The lifetime maximum cumulative dose of doxorubicin allowedis 500mg/m2. There is no maximum dose/exposure for lenvatinib or paclitaxel .The maximum dose for paclitaxel is determined by site’s standard of care. Beginning and End of Study Definition The overall study begins when the first participant signs the Informed Consent Form (ICF).

If participant s receive additional anticancer therapies, this will be judged to represent evidence of disease progression, and stu dy medication will be discontinued. These participant s should complete all end of treatment assessments and continue to be followed for survival in the Follow- Up Period. For further information on the prohibited concomitant therapies for doxorubicin or pac litaxel, please refer to their respective Prescribing Information . Drug-Drug Interactions There are no drug-drug interaction (DDI) -related concomitant medication prohibitions or restrictions. Lenvatinib is not expected to clinically meaningfully alter exp osure to CYP3A4/ P-glycoprotein (P -gp) substrates based on results from a lenvatinib DDI study with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A and P -gp substrate). Clinical studies also showed that co- administration of lenvatinib with either inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/P -gp are not of clinical concern. No drug interaction is expected between pembrolizumab and lenvatinib because of their divergent metabolic pathways. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is primarily catabolized like other proteins, while lenvatinib is metabolized by enzymatic (CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase) and non- enzymatic processes (lenvatinib IB). 06DJ4W"

Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with potential immunologic etiology are outlined along with the dose modification guidelines in Table 4.Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or IV treatment with corticosteroids, as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab and/or lenvatinib . Note: If after the evaluation of the event, it is determined not to be related to pem brolizumab, the investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance. Refer to Table 4in Section6.6.2.1for guidelines regarding dose modification and support ive care. It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event. Hematopoietic Growth Factors Primary prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G -CSF) may be used per the discretion of the treating physician andin line with local guidelines. Dose Modification (Escalation/Titration/Other) Adverse events will be graded using NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 3. Investigators will decide the probability of the event being related to one or both drugs as to whether dose modification of one or both drugs is required. Participants who interrupt or discontinue one drug in the pembrolizumab -lenvatinib combination due to toxicity can continue with the other drug in the combination until criteria for treatment discontinuation are met (eg, unacceptable toxicity, disease progression). Refer to Section 6.6.3 for dose modification guidance for overlapping toxicity for the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab combination. Lenvatinib Lenvatinib dose reduction and interruption for participants who experience lenvatinib - pembrolizumab combination therapy- related toxicity will be in accordance with the dose modification guidelines described in Table 3.An interruption of study treatment for more than 28 days will require MSDapproval before treatment can be resumed. The starting dose of lenvatinib is 20 mg/day for participant s enrolled in Arm A. Dose reductions of lenvatinib occur in succession based on the previous dose level (14, 10, and 8mg/day). Any dose reduction below 8 mg /day must be discussed with MSD .Once the lenvatinib dose has been reduced, it may not be increased at a later date, unless the dose has been mistakenly decreased; in this situation, MSD’s approval is required to increase the dose. 06DJ4W"

Investigators should therefore ensure that participant s enrolled to receive treatment with lenvatinib have BP of ≤150/90 mm Hg at the time of study ent ry and, if known to be hypertensive, have been on a stable dose of antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week before C1D1.Early detection and effective management of hypertension are important to minimize the need for lenvatinib dose interruptions and r eductions. Regular assessment of BP should be as detailed in the SoA(Section 1.3.1 and Section 1.3.2 ). Hypertension will be graded using NCI CTCAE v4.0 3,based on BP measurements only (and not on the number of antihypertensive medications) . If the participant’s first BP measurement of the current assessment is elevated ( ie, systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg), the BP measurement should be repeatedat least 5 minutes later.One BP assessment is defined as the mean value of 2measurements at least 5 minutes apart. If the BP assessment (ie, the mean of the 2 BP measurements obtained at least 5 minutes apart) is elevated (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg), a confirmatory assessment should be obtained at least 30 minutes later by performing 2measurements (at least 5 minutes apart) to yield a mean value . Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg) is confirmed on 2 assessments at least 30 minutesapart.The choice of antihypertensive treatment should be individualized to the participant ’s clinical circumstances and follow standard medical practice.For previously normotensive participant s, appropriate antihypertensive therapy should be started when systolic BP ≥140mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg is first observed on 2 assessments at least 30minutesapart.For those participant s already on antihypertensive medication, treatment modification may be necessary if hypertension persists. Lenvatinib should be withheld in any instance where a participant is at imminent risk to develop a hypertensive crisis or has uncontrolled hypertension with significant risk factors for severe complications (eg, BP ≥160/100 mm Hg, significant risk factors for cardiac disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, or other significant co -morbidities) . Once the participant has been on the same antihypertensive medications for at least 48 hours and the BP is controlled, lenvatinib should be resumed as described below.

For example, hypertension, arterial thrombotic events, proteinuria, and hemorrhagic events are known risks for lenvatinib treatment, while immune -related AEs are risks for pembrolizumab treatment. However, certain AEs, such as such as diarrhea, hypothyroidism, and liver enzyme elevation, may be initially considered attributable to either study drug. Therefore, evaluation of attribution is important for determining the study drug most likely related to the AE, or an alternative etiology, and subsequently proper clinical management. The following aspects should be considered: 1.Timing of AE onset Since lenvatinib is dosed daily and continuously due to a relatively short half -life (28hours), and pembrolizumab is dosed Q3W due to a long half -life, lenvatinib can be interrupted to assess whether an AE improves/resolves with dechallenge (ie, interruption of treatment) based on the following 2 scenarios: oIf an AE is identified during a treatment cycle (ie, between 2 pembrolizumab doses), only lenvatinib dose interruption is needed. oIf an AE is identified at the beginning of a treatment cycle, lenvatinib can be interrupted and dosing of pembrolizumab should be held. If the participant recovers from an AE in response to lenvatinib interruption (ie, positive dechallenge), the event is more likely to be related to lenvatinib. Otherwise, after excluding other alternative explanations, an immune -related AE should be considered. 2.Severity o f AE If an AE is suspected to be treatment -related and is severe/life -threatening at the time of onset or is rapidly worsened, action including interrupting both drugs and initiating treatment with a corticosteroid (with exception of hypothyroidism, TIDM) and other supportive care should be taken promptly. 3.Participants receiving the combination therapy (pembrolizumab pluslenvatinib) must discontinue study intervention if any of the following occur: 1)ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks. Pembrolizumab will have already been permanently discontinued per Table 4, but lenvatinib may be administered at a reduced dose by the timethis criterion is met and must be permanently discontinued immediately. 2)ALT or AST >3 × ULN and (TBL >2 × ULN or INR >1.5). Although Table 4 advises pembrolizumab to be withheld (interrupted), and Table 3 advises lenvatinib to have no dose modification or a reduction, if this criterion is met, both drugs must be permanently di scontinued immediately. 06DJ4W"

Delegation of studysite personnel responsibilities will be documented in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). ●All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. ●Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the proto col-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. ●Additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the investigator and or MSDfor reasons related to participant safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially sensitive in nature (eg, HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require that additional informed consent be obtained from the participant . In these cases, such evaluations/t esting will be performed in accordance with those regulations. Administrative and General Procedures Informed Consent The investigator or qualified designee must obtain documented consent from each potential participant or each participant’s legally acceptable representative prior to participating in a clinical study. If there are changes to the participant’s status during the study (eg, health or age of majority requirements), the investigator or qualified designee must ensure the appropriate consent is in place.

The participant or his/her legally acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the participant’s willingness to continue participation in the study. The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the participan t’s dated signature or by the participant’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature. Specifics about a study and the studypopulation will be added to the consent form template at the protocol level. The informed consent will adhere to IRB/IEC requirements, applicable laws and regulations and MSD requirements. If the investigator recommends continuation of study intervention beyond disease progression, the participant or her legally acceptable representative will be asked to sign consent. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the investigator or qualified designee to ensure that the participant qualifies for the studyand Crossover Phase, if applicable . Participant Identification Card All participants will be given a Participant Identification Card identifying them as participants in a research study. The card will contain study site contact information (including direct telephone numbers) to be utilized in the event of an emergency. The investigator or qualified designee will provide the participant with a Participant Identification Card immediately after the participant provides written informed consent. At the time of treatment allocation/randomization, site personnel will add the treatment/r andomization number to the Participant Identification Card. The participant identification card also contains contact information for the emergency unblinding call center so that a health care provider can obtain information about study treatment in emerge ncy situations where the investigator is not available. Medical History A medical history will be obtained by the investigator or qualified designee. The medical history will collect all active conditions and any condition diagnosed within the prior 10years that the investigator considers to be clinically significant. All medical history related to any cancer other than ECshould be collected, regardless of when it occurred. Comprehensive details regarding the participant’s EC history will be recorded separately and not listed as medical history. These details include but are not limited to FIGO stage at initial diagnosis, histopathology, location(s) of tumor burden, and all prior treatment (including prior radiation, prior chemotherapy, and prior surgery). 06DJ4W"

Prior and Concomitant Medications Review Prior Medications The investigator or qualified designee will review prior medication use, including any protocol-specified washout requirement, and record prior medication taken by the participant within 30 days before the first dose of study medication. Concomitant Medications The investigator or qualified designee will record medication, if any, taken by the participant during the study. Assignment of Screening Number All consented participants will be given a unique screening number that will be used to identify the participant for all procedures that occur prior to randomization . Each participant will be assigned only one screening number. Screening numbers must not be re -used for different participants. Any participant who is screened multiple times wi ll retain the original screening number assigned at the initial screening visit. Specific details on the screening visit requirements (screening/re -screening ) are provided in Section 8.12.1. Assignment of Treatment/Randomization Number All eligible partic ipants will be randomly allocated and will receive a treatment/randomization number. The treatment/randomization number identifies the participant for all procedures occurring after treatment allocation/randomization. Once a treatment/randomization number is assigned to a participant, it can never be re -assigned to another participant. A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 treatment/randomization number. Treatment Administration Study treatments will be administered by the investigator and/or study staff according to the specifications within the pharmacy manual .Lenvatinib may be administered at home except on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. Please refer to Section 8.1.8.1.1 for further detail . Lenvatinib may be also be administered at home during the Crossover Treatment Phase except on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 . Lenvatinib compliance will be calculated by the Sponsor based on the drug accountability documented by the site staff and monitored by the Sponsor/designee.

Timing of Dose Administration Lenvatinib Lenvatinib 20 mg ( two 10-mg capsules) once daily will be taken orally with water (with or without food)at approximately the same time each day in each 21 -day cycle. However, on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2, lenvatinib willbe administered 0 to 4 hoursafter completion of pembrolizumab administration. If a lenvatinib dose is missed and cannot be taken within 12 hours then that dose should be skipped,and the next dose should be taken at the usual time of administration. Pembrolizumab Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30- minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle.Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to si te, a window of – 5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 30 minutes: – 5 min/+10 min). After Cycle 1 Day 1, p embrolizumab may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each subsequent cycle due to administrative reasons. Treatment of Physician’s Choice TPCconsists of either doxorubicin hydrochloride or paclitaxel. Doxorubicin hydrochlor ide will be administered by IV bolus or 1- hour infusion (or per institutional guidelines) at a dose of 60 mg/m2on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle. Paclitaxel will be administered IV at a dose of 80 mg/m2administered as a 1- hour IV infusion (or per institution al guidelines on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle ; i.e. 3weeks on, 1 week off). The administration procedure should follow the approved prescribing information for doxorubicin or paclitaxel in each country/region or institutional guidelines . Discontinuation and Withdrawal Participants who discontinue study treatment prior to completion of the treatment period should be encouraged to continue to be followed for all remaining study visits. When a participant withdraws from participation in the study, all applicable activities scheduled for the discontinuation visit(End of Treatment visit) should be performed (a t the time of withdrawal ). Any AEswhich are present at the time of withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 8.4 . If discontinuation occurs ≥30 days after the last dose of study treatment, a Safety Follo w-up Visit (Section 8.12.3.1) is not required.

Documentation of equipment calibration must be retained as source documenta tion at the study site. Demography Participant demography information will be collected at the Screening Visit. Demography information includes date of birth (or age), sex, race/ethnicity. Efficacy/Immunogenicity Assessments Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease The process for image collection and transmission to the CIVcan be found in the Site Imaging Manual (SIM). Tumor imaging of the chest is to be acquired by computed tomography (CT). For the abdomen and pelvis, contrast -enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred modality ; however, CT with iodinated contrast may be used when contrast -enhanced MRI is contraindicated, or when mandated by local practice. MRI is the strongly preferred modality for imaging the brain. The same ima ging technique regarding modality, ideally the same scanner, and the use of contrast should be used in a participant throughout the study to optimize the reproducibility of the assessment of existing and new tumor burden and improve the accuracy of the ass essment of response or progression based on imaging. Note: for the purposes of assessing tumor imaging, the term “Investigator” refers to the local investigator at the site and/or the radiological reviewer located at the site or at an offsite facility. Participant eligibility will be determined using prospective BICR assessment based on RECIST1.1.All scheduled images for all study participants from the sites will be submitted to the CIV.In addition, images (including via other modalities) that are obtain ed at an unscheduled time point to determine disease progression, as well as imaging obtained for other reasons, but which demonstrate radiologic progression, should also be submitted to the CIV. When the Investigator identifies radiographic progression pe r RECIST 1.1, the CIV will perform expedited verification of radiologic PD and communicate the results to the studysite and MSD (See Section 8 .2.1.5 and Figure2).Treatment should continue until PD has been verified. All decisions to continue treatment beyond 2 consecutive scans showing progression at least 4 weeks apart must be discussed with the MSD Medical Monitor (Section 8.2.1.6 and Appendix 5) .

The site study team must submit screening images to the CIV to confirm the participant has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. Tumor imaging performed as part of routi ne clinical management is acceptable for use as screening tumor imaging if it is of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days prior to the date of randomization and can be assessed by the CIV. If brain imaging is performed to document the stability o f existing metastases, MRI should be used if possible. If MRI is medically contraindicated, CT with contrast is an acceptable alternative. Tumor imaging at baseline includes the following: CT or MRI (preferred) of the abdomen and pelvis CT of the chest Bone scan for participants with a history of bone metastases or who are clinically symptomatic Brain scan for participants with a history of protocol-eligible treated brain metastases or who are clinically symptomatic Tumor Imaging During the Study The first on study imaging assessment should be performed at 8 weeks (56 days ±7days) from the date of randomization. Subsequent tumor imaging should be performed every 8weeks (56 days ±7 days) or more frequently if clinically indicated .Following the primary analysis for the study, tumor imaging should be performed Q12W (84 days ±7 days) or more frequently if required by local standard of care and bone and brain scans should be performed per local standard of care. Imaging timing should follow calendar days from r andomization and should not be adjusted for delays in cycle starts. Imaging should continue to be performed until disease progression is identified by the Investigator and verified by the CIV the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurs first. All supplemental imaging must be submitted to the CIV. Objective response should be confirmed by a repeat imaging assessment. Tumor imaging to confirm PR or CR should be performed at least 4 weeks after the first indication of a response is observed. Participants will then return to regular scheduled imaging, starting with the next scheduled imaging time point. Participants who receive additional imaging for confirmation do not need to undergo the next scheduled tumor imaging if it is less than 4weeks later; tumor imaging may resume at the subsequent scheduled imaging time point.

Following the primary analysis for the study, tumor assessments should be performed every 12 weeks or more frequently per local standard of care. Participants who are eligible for retreatment with pembrolizumab according to the criteria in Section 6.6.5 will move from the Efficacy Follow-Up Phase to the Second Course Phase when they experience disease progression. Details are provided in the SoA(Section 1.3. 2) for retreatment with pembrolizumab. Participants in the TPCarm who have discontinued study treatment and opt to receive treatment with lenvatinib pluspembrolizumab in the Crossover Phase (according to the criteria in Section 8.12.2.1) may move from the Efficacy Follow -up Phase to the Crossover Phase, if they experience investigator -defined disease progression by RECIST 1.1. Details are provided in Section 1.3.3 –Crossover Phase for TPCArm Only.

First, participants will be stratified according to MMR status. Then, only within the pMMR stratum, participan ts will be further stratified according to ECOG performance status, geographic region, and prior history of pelvic radiation. A total of 9 strata will be utilized for the study. Analysis PopulationsEfficacy: Intention to Treat (ITT) Safety: All Participants as Treated (APaT) Primary EndpointsProgression -free survival (PFS) based on RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. Overall survival (OS).

Statistical Methods forKey EfficacyAnalysesThe primary hypotheses will be evaluated by comparing in PFS and OS using a stratified Log-rank test. The hazard ratio ( HR) will be estimated using a stratified Cox regression model.Event rates over time will be estimated within each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical Methods forKey SafetyAnalysesThe analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach. The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. There are no events of interest that warrant elevation to Tier 1 events in this study. Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) provided for between -group comparisons; only point estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters.

A 0.0005 Type I error rate is initially allocated to test PFS and 0.0245 Type I error rate is initially allocated to test OS between two treatment arms in pMMR participants . Details of alpha allocation strategy among hypotheses of PFS, OS , andORR are provided in Section 9.8 Multiplicity. The study will be considered positive if either testing of PFS or testing of OS is significant in pMMR participants . SampleSizeand PowerThe planned sample size is approximately 780 participants (660 pMMR participants and 120 dMMR participants) with 330 pMMR participants and 60 dMMR participants in each arm. For th e pMMR participants : With approximately 5 64 PFS events at the planned PFS analysis,the study will have at least 99% of power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.55 at the one- sided 0.0005 significance level. With approximately 368, 463, and 526 OS events in the pMMR participants at the planned IA1, IA2,and finalOS analys is(FA), respectivel y, the study will have 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 at the one - sided 0.0245 significance level. Following Amendment 08, the pre -planned second interim analysis (IA2) is no longer required and will not be performed. This is because the success criteria for the study hypotheses of PFS, OS, and ORR were met at the first interim analysis (IA1) .The prespecifiedfinal analysis will be performed without multiplicity adjustment after approximately 526 OS events have been observed in the pMMR participants and at least 18months after the last participant was randomized. Updated analyses may be performed duringthe trial at any time point to provide additional estimates with longer follow-up.

Statistical Methods Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses This section describes the statistical methods that address the primary and secondary objectives. Methods related to exploratory objectives will be described in the sSAP. Efficacy results for pMMR participants and all-comer participantsthat will be deemed to be statistically significant after consideration of the Type I error control strategy are described in Section 9.8–Multiplicity.Nominal p-values will be computed for other efficacy analyses, but should be interpreted with caution due to potential issues of multiplicity. Primary Efficacy Analysis Progression -free Survival The non-parametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS curve in each treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS will be assessed by the stratified log- rank test (based on the stratification factors defined in Section 6.3.1.1). A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, the HR) between the treatment arms. The HR and its 95% CI from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (Section 6.3.1.1) will be applied to both the stratified log -rank test and the stratified Cox model. Since disease progression is assessed periodically, PD can occur any time in the time interval between the last assessment where PD was not documented and the assessment when PD is documented. For the primary analysi s, for the participants who have PD, the true date of disease progression will be approximated by the date of the first assessment at which PD is objectively documented per RECIST 1.1 (based on BICR), regardless of discontinuation of study drug. Death is a lways considered as a confirmed PD event. For the primary analysis, any participant who experiences an event (PD or death) immediately after 2 or more missed disease assessments will be censored at the last disease assessment prior to the missed visits. In addition, any participant who initiates new anticancertherapy prior to documented progression will be censored at the last disease assessment prior to the initiation of new anticancer therapy. Participants who do not start new anticancertherapy and who do not experience an event will be censored at the last disease 06DJ4W"

If a participant meets multiple criteria for censoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest will be applied. In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, 2 sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules will be performed. The first sensitivity analysis handles participants who miss more than 1 diseas e assessment (with or without a subsequent death or progression) differently from the primary analysis. The second sensitivity analysis handles participants who discontinue treatment or initiate an anticancer treatment subsequent to discontinuation of study- specified treatments differently from the primary analysis. The censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses are summarized in Table8.

The treatment difference in survival will be assessed by the stratified log -rank test (based on the stratification factors defined in Section 6.3.1.1).A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference ( ie, the HR).

Participants without documented death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last known contact. Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) method may be conducted for OS to account f or the possible non- proportional hazards effect. Secondary Efficacy Analysis Objective Response Rate (ORR) Stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method will be used for comparison of the ORR between two treatment groups. The difference in ORR and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method with strata weighting by sample size w ill be reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (See Section 6.3.1.1) will be applied to the analysis. Statistical Analysis for Safety Analysis Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters inclu ding AEs, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG measurements. The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach (Table 9).The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. AEs (specific terms as well as system organ class terms) and events that meet predefined limits of change (PDLCs) in laboratory values, vital signs and ECG parameters are either prespecified as “Tier 1” endpo ints or will be classified as belonging to “Tier 2” or “Tier 3” based on the observed proportions of participants with an event. Tier 1 Events Safety parameters that are identified a priori constitute “Tier 1” safety endpoints that will be subject to infer ential testing for statistical significance with p-values and 95% confidence intervals provided for between -group comparisons. AEsof special interest (AEOSIs) that are immune-mediated or potentially immune -mediated are well documented and will be evaluated separately; however, these events have been characterized consistently throughout the pembrolizumab clinical development program and determination of statistical significance is not expected to add value to the safety evaluation. Further, the combinatio nof pembrolizumab and lenvatin ibhas not been associated with any new safety signals. Additionally, there are no known AEs associated with participants for which determination of a p-value is expected to impact the safety assessment. Therefore, there are n o Tier 1 events in this study. 06DJ4W"

Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 10 % of participants in any treatment group exhibit the event; all other AEs and predefined limits of change will belong to Tier 3. The threshold of at least 10% of participants was chosen for Tier 2 events because the population enrolled in this study is in critical condition and usually experiences various AEs of similar types regardless of treatment; events reported less frequently than 10 % of participants would obscure the assessment of the overall safety profile and add little to the interpretation of potentially meaningful treatment differences. In addition, Grade 3 to 5 AEs ( ≥5% of participants in 1 of the treatment groups) and SAEs (≥1 % of participants in 1 of the treatment groups)will be considered Tier 2 endpoints. Because many 95% CIs may be provided without adjustment for multiplicity, the CIs should be regarded as a helpful descriptive measure to be used in safety review, not as a formal method for assessing the statistical significance of the between -group differences. Tier 3 Events Safety endpoints that are not Tier 1 or 2 events are considered Tier 3 events. The broad AE categories consisting of the proportion of participants with any AE, a drug -related AE, a serious AE, an AE which is both drug -related and serious, a Grade 3 -5 AE, a drug-related Grade 3-5 AE, and discontinuation due to an AE will be considered Tier 3 endpoints.

Specifically : In the scenario that the events accrue slower than expected and the observed number of events is less than the expected number of events at a given analysis, the information fraction will be calculated as the observed number of events at the interim analys is over the target number of events at FA. In the scenario that the events accrue faster than expected and the observed number of events exceeds the expected number of events at a given analysis, the information fraction will be calculated as the expected number of events at the interim analysis over the target number of events at FA . The final analysis will use the remaining Type I error that has not been spent at the earlier analyses. The observed event counts for all analyses will be used to compute corr elations. Of note, while the information fraction used for the alpha spending calculation will be the minimum of the actual information fraction and the expected information fraction, the correlations required for deriving the bounds will still be computed using the actual information fraction based on the observed number of events at each analysis over the target number of events at FA . The minimum spending approach assumes timing is not based on any observed Z -value and thus the Z test statistics used for testing conditioned on timing are multivariate normal. Given the probabilities derived with the proposed spending method, the correlations based on actual event counts are used to compute bounds that control the Type I error at the specified alpha level for a given hypothesis conditioned on the interim analysis timing. Since this is true regardless of what is conditioned on, the overall Type I error for a given hypothesis unconditionally is controlled at the specified level. By using more conservative spen ding early in the study, power can be retained to detect situations where the treatment effect may be delayed. 06DJ4W"

Supporting Documentation and Operational Considerations Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical and Study Oversight Considerations Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. (MSD) Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials I.Introduction A. Purpose MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting these trials in compliance with the highe st ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participants in clinical trials is the overriding concern in the design of clinical trials. In all cases, MSD clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national regulations (e.g., I nternational Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice [ICH- GCP]) and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. B. Scope Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clini cal interventional investigations sponsored by MSD irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (e.g., contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials which are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator- initiated trials, which are not under the full control of MSD. II.Scientific Issues A. Trial Conduct 1.Trial Design Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of MSD or comparator products. Alternatively, MSD may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various end point measures, or trials to dete rmine patient preferences, etc. The design (i.e., participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial. Participants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enro lled in the trial. 2.Site Selection MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to tr ial initiation, sites are evaluated by MSD personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the trial. 3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity Investigative trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principl es of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per MSD policies and procedures, if fraud, scientific/resea rch misconduct or serious GCP -non-compliance is suspected, the issues are investigated. When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and eth ics review committees notified. B. Publication and Authorship Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish the primary and secondary results of its registered trials of marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the pre -specified plans for data analysis. To the extent scientifically appropr iate, MSD seeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing; in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity. MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the recommendations published by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and 06DJ4W"

All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. MSD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications. III.Participant Protection A.Ethics Committee Review (Institutional Review Board [IRB]/Independent Ethics Committee [IEC]) All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC before being initiated at each site. Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the ethics committee prior to implementation, except changes required urgently to prot ect participant safety that may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval. For each site, the ethics committee and MSD will approve the participant informed consent form. B.Safety The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance. Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local standard of care. All participation in MSD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is obtained. Participants may withdraw from an MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that ma y otherwise be available to them. C.Confidentiality MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or representative), ethics committee, and/or regulat ory authorities will have access to confidential medical records that might identify the participant by name. D.Genomic Research Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by an ethics committee. IV.Financial Considerations A.Payments to Investigators Clinical trials are time -and labor- intensive. It is MSD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of MSD trials. MSD do es not pay incentives to enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts. MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, MSD may compensate referring physicians for time spent on chart review to identify potentially eligible participants. B.Clinical Research Funding Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by MSD, and that the in vestigator or sponsoring institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, all publications resulting from MSD trials will indicate MSD as a source of funding. C.Funding for Travel and Other Requests Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (e.g., to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) wil l be consistent with local guidelines and practices. V.Investigator Commitment Investigators will be expected to review MSD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. 06DJ4W"

Events m eetingthe AE definition ●Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, or are considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. ●Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. ●New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. ●Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. ●Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. ●For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentio nal) with an associated AE, the AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose of study treatment without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using the terminology “accidental or in tentional overdose without adverse effect.” ●Any new cancer (that is not a condition of the study). Note: Progression of the cancer under study is not a reportable event. Refer to Section 8.4.5 for additional details. 06DJ4W"
