It describes the TIPAL trial, sponsored by the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and co -ordinated by NCTU. It provides inf ormation about procedures for entering participants into the trial, and provides sufficient detail to enable: an understanding of the background, rationale, objectives, trial population, intervention, methods, statistical analyses, ethical considerations, dissemination plans and administration of the trial; replication of key aspects of trial methods and conduct; and appraisal of the trial’s scientific and ethical rigour from the time of ethics approval through to dissemination of the results. The protocol should not be used as an aide -memoire or guide for the treatment of other patients. Every care has been taken in drafting this protocol, but corrections or amendments may be necessary. These will be circulated to registered investigators in the trial. Site s entering participants for the first time should confirm they have the correct version through a member of the trial team at NCTU. NCTU supports the commitment that its trials adhere to the SPIRIT guidelines. As such, the protocol template is based on the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2012 Statement for protocols of clinical trials (1) The SPIRIT Statement Explanation and Elaboration document (2) can be referred to, or a member of NCTU Protocol Review Committee can be contacted for further detail about specific items. 1.1 Compliance The trial will be conducted in compliance with the approved protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki (2008), the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as laid down by the Commission Directive 2005/28/EC with implementation in nati onal legislation in the UK by Statutory Instrument 2004/1031 and subsequent amendments, the Human Tissue (Quality and Safety for Human Application) Regulations 2007, the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 , and the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research , the European Directive 2001/20/EC (where applicable) and other national and local applicable regulations. Agreements that include detailed roles and responsibilities will be in place betwee n participating sites and NCTU. Participating sites will inform NCTU as soon as they are aware of a possible serious breach of compliance, so that NCTU can fulfil its requirement to report the breach if necessary within the timelines specified in the UK Cl inical Trials Regulations (currently 7 days). For the purposes of this regulation a ‘serious breach’ is one that is likely to affect to a significant degree:  The safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects in the trial, or  The scientific value o f the trial. 1.2 Sponsor Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is the trial sponsor and has delegated responsibility for the overall management of the TIPAL trial to the Chief Investigator (CI) and NCTU. Queries relating to sponsors hip of this trial should be addressed to the CI or via the trial team."

It is progressive and usually fatal with a 5 -year survival of 20 -40% (3). More people will die each year from IPF than from ovarian cancer, leukaemia or mesothelioma (4). People with this condition e xperience progressive breathlessness and a socially isolating cough, with cough bei ng particularly difficult to treat. They frequently have comorbid disease , gastro -oesophageal reflex disease (GORD) being one of the most common. Reflux disease and anti -reflux therapy in IPF: clear associations The cause of IPF is unknown , however , there are well -accepted aetiological factors including genetic variants and environmental exposures, for example smoking and aspiration of gastric fluid (5). IPF itself may increase gastro -oesophageal reflux (GOR) by reducing intra -thoracic p ressure or because of increased oesophageal traction (6). Indeed nearly 90% of people with IPF have GOR (7), with a correlation between radiological evidence of lung fibrosis and oesophageal reflux episodes (8). Despite this, only half of individuals have classic reflux symptoms (7). Case series and secondary analysis of randomised clinical trials (RCTs), suggest that anti -reflux therapy slows disease progression. In a pooled analysis of 242 individuals taken from the placebo arms of three trials, anti -acid therapy resulted in a statistically and clinically significant difference in absolute forced vital capacity (FVC) decline over a 30 -month period (9). This amounted to a 50% reduction in FVC decline. However these findings were not replicated in a post -hoc analysis of data from individuals with IPF and FVC > 50% predicted, randomised to the placebo (10) arm o f the CAPACITY studies, possibly due to the unadjusted nature of the analysis (11). Two systematic reviews have report ed the effect of anti -acid therapy on mortality. Tran and Suissa (12) examined all -cause mortality and reported a n overall reduction with anti -acid therapy but argued that the signal for this difference mostly came from studies subject to possible immortal time bias. Fidler et al (11) found no effect on all -cause mortality but reported a reduct ion of I PF-related mortality . PPIs are the cornerstone of anti -reflux therapy Proton Pump Inhibitors ( PPIs) are the first -line anti -acid treatments for people with reflux disease according to current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) guidelines (www.nice.org.uk/CG184). H istamine -2 receptor antagonists (H2A), previously first -line treatment, have been superseded by PPIs given the clear evidence of greater acid suppression and symptomatic control (13). Thus, H2A are only now offered to those with an inadequate response to PPIs. Prokinetics are not recommended by NICE guidelines, cannot be used for long -term therapy due to concerns about adverse effects and do not improve symptomatic or endoscopic response in GORD (14). Laparoscopic fundoplication results in better symptom control but worse side effects than PPIs (15), but this intervention can only be advocated for highly selected individuals with IPF. Lifestyle changes are recommended by guidelines and may improve symptom burden (16). A review found evidence to support sleeping head -up and weigh t loss improved pH profiles and symptoms (17). Antacids and raft"

Overall, nearly all of the evidence about anti -reflux therapy in IPF comes from people receiving PPIs. All of the individuals in the initial case series were taking PPIs and more than 90% of individuals in the secondary analysis of c linical trials were receiving PPIs . PPIs have anti -inflammatory, anti -oxidant and anti-fibrotic properties demonstrated in vitro (19) and in vivo (20). Thus, there are plausible biological mechanisms by which they may reduce disease progression in addition to their anti -acid effects (21). A small randomised control trial of a PP I in people with IPF (PPIPF) (22) showed that a definitive large - scale trial was feasible. As expected, the main reason for exclusion was due to existing PPI therapy, however 25 out of 59 people taking PPIs were el igible for a trial of withholding therapy for two weeks after which 16 (64%) did not have a return of symptoms and were able to successfully enter into the trial. PPIs were well tolerated in IPF with slightly increased lower respiratory tract infections i n the active arm. Invasive assessment of GORD was not considered feasible but there was a suggesting of a meaningful improvement in objective cough scores. GORD may influence sleep quality in people with IPF due to nocturnal coughing, which was shown to be improved in the PPIPF trial (22) indeed GORD, IPF, coughing and obstructive sleep apnoea may be interrelated (23). Of the five licensed PPIs in the UK, omeprazole and esomeprazole induce cytochrome enzymes potentially resulting in redu ced efficacy of the anti -fibrotic drug pirfenidone (www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/29932). The acid suppression potency (24) and symptom relief of the remaining PPIs is similar (25), however lansoprazole is the cheapest available PPI and the one with which UK physicians are most familiar. Non -erosive oesophagitis occurs at a higher pH than erosive gastritis and therefore higher doses of PPIs are often required to increase the pH to a degree that will treat non -reflux symptoms such as cough (26). Lansoprazole 30mg twice per day results in significantly greater acid suppression and for longer duration than lower doses (27), with a pH greater than 4 occurring 75% of the time with 30mg twice daily compar ed to 60% of the time with 30mg once daily or 15 mg twice daily. However very high doses do not produce greater acid suppression (27). A dose of 30mg twice daily (with a dose step - down option if adverse effects emerge), will minimise resistant reflux disease although may result in slightly higher rates of diarrhoea (5.0% compared to 3.7% for 30mg daily) (28). PPI: potential adverse effects Long -term PPI therapy may result in significant adverse effects. A systematic review and meta -analysis of 26 studies evaluating six million people showed that PPI therapy increases the risk of community -acquired pneumonia (CAP), including CAP requiring hospitalisation (29), by 50% . This is in keeping with the suggestion of a higher incidence of pneumonia with PPI therapy in patients with IPF randomised to the placebo arm of the C APACITY studies(38), albeit in those with more severe disease (30). Pneumonia is common in people with IPF (31) and a frequent cause of death (32). Alkaline stomach pH is thought to permit bacterial colonisation, which can be aspirated – a risk that may be increased in IPF -related GOR and micro -aspiration. Osteoporo sis is also increased by 25 -50% with PPI treatment (33). Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhoea (CDAD) is increased with PPI use and outcomes for CDAD are worse for those receiving PPIs (34). Primary outcome data collection"

FVC has been utilised as the primary endpoint in nearly all published late phase clinical trials in IPF, including those of pirfenidone and nintedanib, which were used for licensing purposes. FVC has been accepted by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) as an appropriate endpoint for licensing of medication (38). The change in FVC over time has been repeatedly shown to be highly predictive of mortality (39) and is a component of prognostic algorithms. Furthermore, as it is captured at least annually by all centres entering data onto the British Thoracic Society ( BTS) ILD Registry (www.brit -thoracic.org.uk/standards -of-care/lung - disease -regis tries/bts -ild-registry/), long -term follow -up using FVC can be undertaken at minimal inconvenience to patients and the service. Spirometry is considered to be an aerosol generating procedure (https://www.artp.org.uk/News/artp -guidance -respiratory -function -testing -and-sleep -services - during -endemic -covid -19) and as a re sult provision for undertaking laboratory FVC measurements is limited . For this reason, along with the technological advances in spirometers and internet network connections, home spirometry is increasing ly used as a clinical method of monitoring chronic respiratory disease. Home spirometry has been shown to be a good predictor of mortality (40) and has good adherence at least up to 24 weeks (41). Home spirometry has been repeatedly shown to have good correlation with laboratory spirometry (40, 41) with cor relation coefficients greater than 0.9. It has been utilised in as an endpoint in a clinical trial of unclassifiable fibrotic interstitial lung disease but l inear regression modelling was not possible (42). 5.1.1 Explanation for choice of comparators Lansoprazole will be compared with matched placebo as this is the most robust way to determine the efficacy and adverse effects of lans oprazole . All patients involved in the trial will continue to receive usual care (defined in section 6.4.5) . Treatment allocation is double -blind ed to reduce potential bias in reporting of the primary outcome and patient reported secondary outcomes. 5.2 Objectives The p rimary research hypothesis is that pa rticipants treated with lansoprazole will have smaller absolute decline in percentage predicted (%) FVC at 12 months post -randomisation versus pa rticipants treated with placebo. The secondary research hypotheses are that participants treated with lansoprazole will :  cough fewer times over a 24h period at 3 months than pa rticipants treated with placeb o  have a lower cough score assessed by the VAS score than pa rticipants treated with placebo at each study time point following baseline  have a better cough -related quality of life as measured by the LCQ than pa rticipants treated with placebo at each stu dy time point following baseline  experience less breathlessness indicated by the MRC Dyspnoea scale than pa rticipants treated with placebo at each study time point following baseline"

Outcomes will be assessed during a treatment period of 12 months. The primary endpoint is absolute change in % predicted FVC measured between baseline and 12 months post -randomisation of lansoprazole versus placebo . FVC will be measured on a weekly ba sis during the trial by domiciliary spiromet ry. Randomisation will be performed centrally according to a computer -generated randomisation code by secure automated e-mail from NCTU to central research pharmacists only. Minimisation factors are: recruiting s ite, baseline anti -fibrotic therapy, presence of reflux and presence of cough. A subgroup of 160 participants (80 per group) will be recruited in to the cough count sub -study . 5.3.1 Pilot Phase This study includes a n internal pilot phase during which recr uitment will be closely monitored by all relevant parties and oversight committees to ensure recruitment of the planned sample size is feasible, safe and ethical. Progression will be assessed constantly throughout the study according to a traffic light system , with green flagging if the study is progressing above target, red flagging if the study is not likely to deliver and amber flagging if in between. Observed total recruitment will be assessed against expected total recruitment to assign flags. A red flag is indicated where the observed recruitment total is less than 50% of the expected recruitment total for the relative study timepoint. Actions to be taken according to the p rogression flagging status;  Green flagging – study and recruitment to contin ue as planned  Amber flagging – results in increased recruitment of sites and discussion and monitoring of existing sites regarding recruitment and best practice approached"

The pilot phase will commence from the date the first recruiting site is activated to recruitment. At the end of the pilot phase a decision will be made by the funder, in consultation with the TSC and DMC, regarding progression to completion of the trial as intended. Recruitment will continue until this decision has been reached. All pa rticipants recruited during the pilot phase will be included in the further study analyse s. There are no planned interim efficacy analyses. 6 Methods 6.1 Site Selection The trial sponsor has overall responsibility for site and investigator selection and has delegated this role to the CI and NCTU. 6.1.1 Study Setting The study will be conducted primarily in secondary and tertiary care hospitals within the United Kingdom . Sites will be specialist ILD centres, meet the specifications required for specialist ILD centre status or work in association with specialist centres . Due to the restrictions in face-to-face clinical and research consultations, resulting from the COVID -19 pandemic, outcomes will be collected remotely without the requirement of hospital/research centre attendance along with opportunistic capture of rout ine clinical outcome assessments. 6.1.2 Site/Investigator Eligibility Criteria Once a site has been assessed as being suitable to participate in the trial, the trial team will provide them with a copy of this protocol and the Summary of Product Characteri stics (SPC ). To participate in the TIPAL trial, investigators and trial sites must fulfil a set of criteria , agreed by the TIPAL Trial Management Group (TMG) , as defined below. In exceptional circumstances, a site may be excluded from some aspects of the study if they do not meet the criteria below following approval from the CI. Eligibility criteria:  A named clinician is willing and appropriate to take Principal Investigator (PI) responsibility  Suitably trained staff are available to recruit participants, undertake /observe study assessments and measurements, enter data and collect and store samples  Site is i nclu ded on the BTS IPF and Sarcoidosis registry or willing to join registry prior to activation  The site has a suitable potential patient population to adequately recruit participants from"

In addition, selected sites will be invited to participate in the TIPAL cough count sub-study and will approach and consent eligible patients accordingly. Trial sites meeting eligibility criteria will be issued with a TIPAL Investigator Site File ( ISF) and a pack of documentation needed by the Research and Development (R&D) Department of their Trust to enable the Tr ust to provide confirmation of capacity and c apability to undertake the study. 6.1.2.1 Principal Investigator’s (PI) Qualifications and Agreement s The investigator(s) must be willing to sign an investigator statement to comply with the trial protocol (confirming their specific role and responsibilities relating to the trial, and that their site is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the trial (see section 12) ). This includes confirmation of appropriate qualifications, familiarity with the appropriate use of any investigational products, agreement to comply with the principles of GCP, to permit monitoring and audit as necessary at the site, and to maintain documented evidence of all staff at the site who have been delegated significant trial related duties. 6.1.2.2 Resourcing at site The investigator(s) should be able to demonstrate a potential for recruiting the required number of suitable subjects within the agreed recruitment period (i .e. the investigator(s) regularly treat(s) the target population). They should also have an adequate number of qualified staff and facilities available for the foreseen duration of the trial to enable t hem to conduct the trial properly and safely. Sites will be expected to complete a delegation of responsibilities log and provide staff contact details. GCP training is required for all staff responsible for trial activities. The frequency of repeat train ing may be dictated by the requirements of their employing institution or 2 yearly where the institution has no policy, and more frequently when there have been updates to the legal or regulatory requirements for the conduct of clinical trials. The site sh ould have sufficient data management resources to allow prompt data return to NCTU. 6.2 Site approval and activation The Clinical Trial Authorisation (CTA) for the trial requires that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is suppl ied with the names and addresses of all participating site Principal Investigators (PIs) . Trial staff at NCTU will perform this task. On receipt of the signed investigator statement , approved delegation of responsibilities log and staff contact details, w ritten confirmation will be sent to the site PI. The trial manager or delegate will notify the PI in writing of the plans for site initiation. Sites will not be permitted to recruit any patients until a letter for activation has been issued. The Trial Mana ger or delegate will be responsible for issuing this after a green light to recruit process has been completed. The site must conduct the trial in compliance with the protocol as agreed by the Sponsor, H ealth Research Authority (HRA) and, by the regulatory authority (as appropriate), and which was given"

A list of acti vate d sites may be obtained from the Trial Manager. 6.3 Participants 6.3.1 Eligibility Criteria 6.3.1.1 Participant selection There will be NO EXCEPTIONS (waivers) to eligibility requirements at the time of randomisation. Questions about eligibility criteria should be addressed PRIOR to attempting to randomise the participant. The eligibility criteria for this trial have been carefully considered and are the standards used to ensure that only medically appropriate participants are entered. Participants not meeting the criteria should not be entered into the trial for their safety and to ensure that the trial results can be appropriately used to make future treatment decisions for other people with similar diseases or conditions. It is therefore vital that exceptions are not made to these eligibility criteria. Participants will be considered eligible for enrolment in this trial if they fulfil all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria as defined below. In the event a patient fails screening due to presentation with magnesium deficiency or self -reported respiratory tract infection within four weeks of screening, they may be re -screene d once magnesium levels have returned ≥0.7mmol/L and/or four weeks have elapsed since resp iratory tract infection symptom onset. Participants are permitted to repeat baseline FVC measurements upon receipt of the domiciliary spirometer to familiarise themse lves on use of the equipment. Baseline FVC measurements should be attempted for a period up to a maximum of 14 days upon which, a decision as to whether to proceed to trial enrolment will be made by the local PI in collaboration with the CI and patient whe re appropriate , if clinically consistent results have been challenging to obtain. 6.3.1.2 Participant Inclusion Criteria 1. Male or female, aged greater than or equal to 40 years . 2. A diagnosis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) based on local or regional multi -disciplinary consensus according to the latest international guidelines ( Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2018;198: e44-e68 (50)). 3. Patients may be receiving licensed anti -fibrotic medication (for at least 4 weeks prior to randomisation with no plan ned amendments for at least 4 weeks post -randomisation ). 4. Able to provide informed consent . Additional Inclusion Criteria for cough count sub -study : 1. Pre-existing diagnosis of persistent cough (defined as troublesome for more than 8 weeks prior to study enrolment ). 6.3.1.3 Participant Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients unable to comply with study assessments including the ability to complete reliable spirometry assessments. 2. Concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or prokinetic drugs (cisapride, domperidone, metoclopramide, erthryomycin, pruclopride etc.) within 2 weeks prior to randomisation."

Female s who are of childbearing potential or lactating. A postmen opausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. 10. Receipt of an other investigational drug or biological agent associated with another clinical trial within the 4 weeks prior to TIPAL study en rolment or 5 times the drug half -life, whichever is the longer. 11. Receiving long -term oxygen therapy . 12. Patients with hypomagnesemia (defined as magnesium ≤0.6 mmol/L) . Patients receiving PPIs prior to study participation invitation, may undergo a 2 week washout per iod, if clinically acceptable, with randomisation into the study if they remain asymptomatic at the end of this period. The patient’s GP should be contacted, via the study GP letter, following the informed consent process in order to notify them of the int ention for their patient to complete the washout period. FEV1/FVC ratios should be assessed at screening from the most recent spirometry assessments taken in the clinic recorded in patient notes. Investigators are encouraged to contact the TIPAL CI , via the NCTU trial team , for guidance in assessing eligibility in relation to exclusion criterion six prior to approaching the patient about the trial if required . Magnesium deficiency was defined based on 0.7 - 1.0mmol/L being reg arded as a typical normal range (49). 6.3.1.5 Co-enrolment Guidance Concurrent participation in clinical trials of investigational medical products is not permitted.

IMP should be taken at least 30 minutes before food . 6.4.1.3 Dispensing Participants will have investigational medicinal product (IMP) dispensed 6 monthly. The IMP will be supplied in packages providing one month’s supply . IMP will be shipped to the pa rticipant’s home addre ss by the study’s central pharmacy. A dosing card will be dispensed with the IMP stating the required treatment schedule. 6.4.1.4 Dose Modifications, Interruptions and Discontinuations Treatment should be reduced to 15mg (as 1 x 15mg capsule) twice daily , at least 30 minutes before food , in those confirmed or suspected of developing adverse reactions as outlined below:  Respiratory tract infection and pneumonia  Clostridium difficile infection  Hypom agnesaemia defined as magnesium l evels of ≤0.6mmol/L Trial t reatment dose may be reduced to 15mg (1 x 15mg capsule ) due to patient and/or clinician discretion. Site staff should ensure that all reports of these adverse effects are recorded on the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) as completely as possible. Participants will be administered a new dosing card containing details of the reduced treatment schedule; the superseded dosing card should be returned to site , by freepost/courier or in person, at the next visit following dose reduction. If a pa rticipant forgets to take a dose and it is more than 24 hours after their scheduled dose, they should omit the missed dose and take the next dose when it is due . Participant s must not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Interruptions should be avoid ed where possible, any reported should be recorded on the eCRF. 6.4.2 Placebo Arm 6.4.2.1 Products Placebo (manufactured to appear identical to IMP)."

Treatment should be taken at least 30 minutes before food . 6.4.2.3 Dispensing The TIPAL trial is a double -blind study and so dispensing for the placebo arm will be managed identically to the active arm (see section 6.4.1.3). 6.4.2.4 Dose Modifications, Interruptions and Discontinuations Treatment may be reduced to 1 capsule twice daily , at least 30 minutes before food , in those developing adverse reactions (see section 6.4.1.4 ) at the discretion of the PI or by participant choice . The reason for dose modification will be documented in the eCRF . Participant s will be administered a new dosing card containing details of the reduced treatment schedule; the superseded dosing card should be returned to site , by freepost/courier or in pers on, at the next visit following dose reduction. If a pa rticipant forgets to take a dose and it is more than 24 hours after their scheduled dose, they should omit the missed dose and take the next dose when it is due . Participants must not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Interruptions should be avoided where possible, any reported should be recorded on the eCRF. 6.4.3 Accountability The central pharmacy will be responsible for drug accountability for all sites, this includes records of drug and placebo received at the pharmacy, dispensed to participants and unused drug and will ensure batch recall is possible in event of it being necessary. The central pharmacy are also responsible for ensuring IMP is handled and stored appropriately, di spensed accurately and for shipping IMP to each participant’s home address on a 6 monthly basis during trial participation (upon receipt of an appropriately signed prescription) . IMP will be returned to the central pharmacy for destruction. 6.4.4 Compliance and Adherence Compliance to study treatment , in the form of returned capsule counts , will be monitored as part of drug accountability at relevant visits as outlined in section 6.6 . 6.4.5 Concomitant Care Standard Care All pa rticipants will recei ve treatment as usual for their IPF regardless of randomisation into this trial. Standard care will be as defined by NICE guidelines ( www.nice.org.uk/CG163) including anti -fibrotic therapy, p ulmonary rehabilita tion, oxygen, transplant referral and palliative care input as appropriate. Comorbidities are identified and managed according to individual disease -specific guidelines. All participants (in the control and intervention arms) will be provided with the publicly available British Digestive Disorder Charity (CORE) patient information leaflet about heartburn and reflux at entry into the study. This provides information about the causes, inves tigations and treatment for reflux including lifestyle changes. Dyspepsia will be managed with lifestyle changes, reviewing the requirement for medications causing dyspepsia and treatment with antacids and alginates in both"

Pa rticipants still symptomatic with these treatments, or requiring PPIs for oesophagitis or duodenal ulcer, will be withdrawn from the study. Concomitant medication Patients receiving anti -fibrotic medication for their IPF must have been in receipt of the treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to randomisation and not have any planned amendments for at least 4 weeks post -randomisation . Use of antacids and raft alginates is also permitted. All concomitant medication including over the counter and herbal remedies will be recorded at baseline with any changes during participation recorded . Non -permitted medication The following medications are not permitted due to interactions , described in the SPC, with lansoprazole as outlined belo w and thus patients are excluded from the study (see section 6.3.1.3):  HIV protease inhibitors – e.g. atazanavir - due to significant reduction in bioavailability when co-administered with lansoprazole  Ketoconazole and itraconazole – absorption is enhanced by the presence of gastric acid thus co-administration with lansoprazole may result in sub -therapeutic concentrations of these drugs  Methotrexate – serum levels may be elevated and prolonged (including of its metabolite) when co -administered with lansoprazole  Tacrolimus - increased plasma concentrations when co -administered with lansoprazole  Fluvoxamine – increases plasma concentrations of lansoprazole significantly  Prokinetics – due to potential to contaminate study results. Sites are therefore advised to review patient’s concomitant medication and amend prescriptions for prokinetics ( cisapride, domperidone, metoclopramide, erythromycin, pruclopride etc.) accordingly if trial participation is otherwise deemed safe and appropriate a nd the patient wishes to consent (see exclusion criteria 2) . N.B. Erythromycin is permitted for short -term antibiotic use only during the trial. Increased monitoring Concomitant medication requiring increased monitoring:  Warfarin – monitored for increase in international normalised ratio (INR) and prothrombin time.  Digoxin – increased plasma levels when co -administered with lansoprazole  Theophylline – reduced plasma concentrations when co -administered with lansoprazole Sites are responsible for providing increased monitoring for participants receiving the above mentioned medication(s) and for any other s the PI or sub -investigator deem appropriate . Results of additional monitoring procedures do not need to be recorded on the eCRF. Additional guidance"

Therefore lansoprazole should be taken at least 1 hour after taking these medicinal products. 6.4.6 Overdose of Trial Medication The SPC for Lansoprazole states : “The effects of overdose o n lansoprazole in humans are not known (although the acute toxicity is likely to be low) and, consequently, instruction for treatment cannot be given. However, daily doses of up to 180 mg of lansoprazole orally and up to 90 mg of lansoprazole intravenously have been administered in trials without significant undesirable effects.” Treatment is symptomatic and supportive care . Observe the patient for at least four hours and monitor U rea & Electrolyte s (U&Es) and full blood count (FBC) in symptomatic cases. Lansoprazole is not significantly eliminated by haemodialysis. If necessary, gastric emptying, charcoal and symptomatic therapy is recommended. 6.4.7 Protocol Treatment Discontinuation In consenting to the trial, participants are consenting to trial treatment, trial follow -up and data collection. However, an individual participant may stop treatment early or be stopped early for any of the following reasons:  Unacceptable treatment toxicity or adverse event  Inter -current illness that prevents further t reatment  Any change in the participant’s condition that in the clinician’s opinion justifies the discontinuation of treatment  Withdrawal of consent for treatment by the participant  Where patients are unable or unwilling to continue to undertake study measu rements/activities, the decision as to whether the participant should continue with trial treatment and/or follow -up assessments will be at the discretion of the local PI and/ or CI. As participation in the trial is entirely voluntary, the participant may c hoose to discontinue trial treatment at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Although not obliged to give a reason for discontinuing their trial treatment, a reasonable effort should be made to establish t his reason, whilst remaining fully respectful of the participant’s rights. Participants who discontinue protocol treatment, for any of the above reasons, should remain in the trial for the purpose of follow up and data analysis. 6.5 Outcomes 6.5.1 Primary Outcome The primary outcome will be disease progression as assessed by absolute change in % predicted forced vital capacity ( FVC) at 12 month s post -randomisation of lansoprazole versus placebo. 6.5.2 Secondary Outcomes The following secondary outcomes will be assesse d comparing lansoprazole to placebo : Cough frequency:  Measure d using a Vitalo JAK cough monitor over a 24 hour period at baseline and 3 months post -randomisation"

The TIPAL Study Within A Tr ial (SWAT) is designed to evaluate the potential of patient support groups to improve r ecruitment and retention rates in clinical trials. Recruitment rates can be poor and many patients, who are keen to be involved in clinical trials, are denied the opport unity to participate because they are not informed about the research . Patients are keen to ensure that clinical trials are delivered quickly so that clinical research questions can be answered and are generally supportive of research. Patient support grou ps often have a remit of promoting and supporting research. Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis (APF ) is the UK national ILD charity with a remit to support patient support groups, give patients a voice, raise awareness of ILD and support research. There are nearly 50 ILD patient support groups in the UK and all specialist centres potentially involved with TIPAL have an affiliated support group. ILD patient support groups meet every 2 -4 months, with interim mailing of newsletters, and groups are attended by be tween 20 and 60 patients or relatives. We will perform a cluster -randomised pilot trial of patient -facilitated research awareness involving at approximately 2 0 sites within the UK. Recruitment for the SWAT will be stratified for impact rating (a score give n by APF to reflect attendance, engagement and function of the group) . The intervention will last for 12 months . It will include patient support group recruitment and retention initiatives, described in a training manual, with support from APF . After an as sessment of the methods and impact, a revised intervention will be rolled out to the control sites to maximise recruitment into the study. We will assess the impact by capturing the following at 12 and 24 months from the end of the development phase : 1) The n umber of self -reported self -referrals or enquires to participate in research studies as obtained from an exit questionnaire s provid ed to all patients from all support groups. 2) The number of participants recruited via patient support group as obtained from s ite recruitment logs. 3) The number of hits on the study websites. We will capture this at individual site level by using the bitly.com redirecting website. 4) The completeness of the primary endpoint data. 5) The general knowledge and enthusiasm about research as well as the degree of empowerment and motives for participating in research, plus adverse or unintended consequences, from an exit questionnaire provid ed to all participants from all support groups. We will not undertake a formal qualitative analysis how ever, descriptions of the initiatives used by different sites by questionnaire from site research champion will be discussed by a review group comprising members of APF and other members of the TIPAL team. This will permit further refinement"

Each visit will occur in the setting best suited to the participant and the recruiting site. T he study is intended to be conducted remotely throughout if required , as such there is no minimum on -site visit requirement. Where remote visits are conducted, research staff will conduct phone / video calls to counsel participants where necessary i.e. in completion of domiciliary spirometry assessments, fitting cough monitors, to collect updated/trial data etc. In the event that participants attend the site for standard care appointments and complete full lung function tests including spirometry and gas tr ansfer assessments, this data should be entered onto the BTS IPF registry. Domiciliary spirometry assessments must continue to be completed weekly as outlined in section 6.10.1. Where safety bloods are to be taken at the participant’s GP surgery, site staf f will need to request the bloods are taken, ensure they are received and processed at the local laboratory and an authorised clinician will need to review the results at each timepoint. 6.6.1. 2 Screening The PI or delegate is responsible for identifying eligible patients to invite to participate in the study in accordance with the eligibility criteria defined in section 6.3.1. Eligible patients will be approached in clinic or identified via a local databas e/IPF patient list or clinical records and provided with the relevant study specific literature explaining the aims, methods and potential hazards and benefits of participation in the trial (see section 6.8.1) either in person or by mail . Patients will be given adequate time to consider their participation prior to the site seeking written informed consent electronically or paper -based following consultation in person or via phone/video call . Informed consent will be sought prior to completion of any assess ments/procedures etc. required by the study outside the remit of usual care for patients in the same situation . Consenting patients will receive a TIPAL study supplies kit containing a CE marked domiciliary spirometer with an adequate supply of mouthpiece s for the trial participation period, a smart device (i.e. smartphone or tablet) with pre -installed software required for the study (and a pre -loaded data sim card if necessary ) for use during the trial . Patients consenting to the sub -study will also recei ve a cough monitor, and may receive a wrist -based accelerometer, with instructions for return, contact details for IT support if needed and ‘frequently asked questions’ guidance. Baseline FVC measurements should be attempted for a period up to a maximum o f 14 days. PPI use has been associated with an increase of 25 -50% in osteoporosis (33). This should be considered , along with other risk factors for osteoporosis, by the recruiting clinician prior to enrolment in the trial who may wish to increase measures for reducing osteoporosis risk. 6.6.1. 3 Baseline Once written informed consent has been obtained , either in person, electronically or remotely via video/phone , the patient will be required to complete the following baseline assessments: domiciliary spirometry assessments, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, MRC Dyspnoea scale, K -BILD questionnaire,"

Patient demographics , smoking status (including vaping), alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), co -morbidities and relevant medical history and concomitant medication (including over -the-counter antacids ) will be recorded in the eCRF. Where possible this data will be obtained from the BTS Registry, otherwise patient notes will be reviewed or patients asked directly for the relevant data. Blood samples (full blood count (FBC) , urea and electrolytes (U&Es), liver function tests (LFTs) , calcium and magnesium ) will be taken for safety purposes at the GP surgery or recruiting site prior to enrolment. Results of safety bloods taken at the GP surgery must be reviewed by an aut horised clinician. Where participants are attending baseline visits at the recruiting centre, and provided it is feasible and the participant is willing to do so, a separate research blood sample will be taken. A further blood sample will also be taken and stored for genotyping for consenting participants (see section 6.6.2 for sample details) ; this will be taken once only at the recruiting site and may be taken at any timepoint following consent . Domiciliary spirometry assessment guidance is provided in section 6.10.1 . Participants will be trained by video/phone call(s) with trained staff on how to reliably complete domiciliary spirometry assessments throughout the study . Participants should complete spirometry assessments daily for 5 days at this timepoi nt. Where the abovementioned assessments and/or data is captured as part of standard care within 28 days of randomisation within the requirements of this protocol , these observations may be recorded as the baseline values to avoid patients having to repeat procedures unnecessarily. Participants eligible and consenting to the cough sub -study at applicable sites will also be required to undergo objective cough monitoring prior to starting trial treatment . Participants will be provided with a wearable cough re cording device, a VitaloJAK monitor , to capture cough count over a 24 hour period . In addition, sub -study pa rticipants may also be invited to wear a wrist -based accelerometer during this 24h per iod to monitor activity levels and sleep concurrently. Activit y and sleep monitoring is an optional additional component of the sub -study; pa rticipants are therefore able to participate in the cough monitoring aspect only. Sites /research staff will be trained in counselling pa rticipants on safe, accurate and reliable use of the devices and data extraction and processing following the monitoring period prior to activation to recruitment. Participants may be fitted with the cough monitor in person where visits to the recruiting site are completed or participants may be counselled to fit the monitors remotely via video/phone calls with trained staff. Cough, and activity, monitors will be returned to the recruiting site or trials unit by courier upon completion of the monitoring period. Questionnair es will be completed on paper or electronically . During the consent process pa rticipants will be offered the option to complete questionnaires electronically. In this instance pa rticipants will complete all relevant questionnaires electronically via REDCap at each study time point. Pa rticipants opting not to receive the questionnaires electronically will complete paper copies of each questionnaire at each visit for return via courier or freepost ."

Treatment allocation will be determined by a computer generated randomisation code via a web -based system facilitated by NCTU. A semi -blinded randomisation outcome will be circulated via email to the central research pharmacy only. The site PI and delegates will receive a blinded randomisation notification email. An initial 6 month supply of IMP will be dispensed by the central research pharmacy following confirmation of treatment allocation and receipt of a completed trial prescription signed by the PI or delegated sub -investigator . The central research pharmacy are responsible for arranging shipment to the pa rticipant . Participants will be instructed to commence weekly domiciliary spirometry measurements from the date of receipt of their study drug. The pa rticipant ’s General Practitioner (GP) will be informed of the patient’s randomisation into the study. 6.6.1. 5 3 Months The following assessments should be completed 3 months post -randomisation: full lung function (including spirometry and gas transfer assessments) where possible , domiciliary spirometry, Leicester cough questionnaire, MRC dyspnoea scale, K -BILD quest ionnaire, EQ -5D-5L questionnaire, cough score questionnaire, short Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, DeMeester score, adverse events and safety bloods (FBC, U&Es , LFTs, calcium and magnesium ). Site staff will contact participants by phone/video call to asse ss adverse events and any changes to concomitant medication and/or medical history where visit occurs remotely. Safety bloods will be taken at the recruiting site where feasible or at the participants GP surgery for remote visits. Results of safety bloods taken at the GP surgery must be reviewed by an authorised clinician. Genotype blood samples may be collected for consenting participants only if visit occurs on site and a sample has not been obtained previously. Participants will be retrained in completi ng domiciliary spirometry assessments if needed. Where these assessments are completed as part of standard care and within the time frame permitted by and requirements of this protocol, the results may be recorded for those required at the 3 month study ti me point. Participants completing paper -based questionnaires will be provided with a freepost envelope to return them to the trials unit otherwise they will be completed electronically via REDCap . Cough sub -study participants will again be required to comp lete objective cough monitoring over a 24 hour period at applicable sites . Participants will be provided with a wearable VitaloJAK device to monitor cough frequency. In addition, pa rticipant s may again be invited to wear a wrist -based accelerometer to measure concurrent activity levels and sleep during this 24h period. Where this visit occurs remotely, participants will again be counselled in fitting the device(s) and initiating recording."

These may be taken and processed at the recruiting site, or taken at the participant’s GP surgery and shipped for processing at the recruiting site in accordance with local standard procedures. 10mLs of whole blood for genotype analysis will be taken at the recruiting site from consenting participants only once at any timepoint during their participation. If appropriately consenting participants do not attend any study visits in person at the recruiting site, it will not be possible to obtain a sample for genotype analysis. 20mLs of whole blood for future research purposes will be taken at baseline and 12 months post - randomisation at the recruiting site where possible. As study visits may be conducted remotely, it may not be possible to obtain samples from all participants at any or both ti mepoints. Zero, o ne or both research blood samples will be obtained from participants willing to provide samples for analysis in future research projects where possible . Relevant samples will stored at -80°C at recruiting sites, and transported to the Norwich Research Park Biorepository for genotyping or future analysis of any potential biomarker including but not limited to interstitial lung disease, infection or reflux, pending additional ethical approval, at a later date. Sample handling training will be provided to all sites prior to activation detailing sample collecti on, handling and storage procedures . Sites are responsible for ensuring samples collected at GP surgeries are requested, taken, shipped , processed , reviewed and reimbursed in accord ance with standard NHS procedures. Detailed written instructions and appropriate tissue transfer agreements will be put in place prior to the transfer of relevant material. 6.6.3 Early Stopping of Follow -up Sites must inform NCTU of all forms of early tr ial discontinuation via the eCRF . In instances where a participant has decided to withdraw consent, it is essential for the site to establish which aspects of the trial the participant is withdrawing consent from.  If a participant chooses to discontinue t heir trial treatment, they should continue to be followed up as closely as possible to the follow -up schedule defined in the protocol, providing they are willing. They should be encouraged and facilitated not to leave the whole trial, even though they no l onger take the trial treatment.  If a participant who has discontinued trial treatment no longer wishes to attend any remaining follow -up visits, relevant follow up data will continue to be collected from the registry during the trial providing the partici pant is willing for this to continue .  If, however, the participant exercises the view that they no longer wish to provide data either through study visits or remotely via the registry , this view must be respected and the participant withdrawn entirely from the trial. Data already collected will be kept and included"

Any samples provided by the participants, which have yet to be analysed will be destroyed and the registry will be updated so that no further data is provided to NCTU. Where patients are unable or unwilling to continue to undertake study measurements/activities, the decision as to whether the participant should continue with trial treatment and /or follow -up assessments will be at the discretion of the local PI and/ or CI. Participants who stop trial follow -up early will not be replaced. 6.6.4 Participant Transfers If a participant moves from the area making continued follow up at their consenting centre inappropriate, every effort should be made for them to be followed -up at another participating trial centre. Written consent should be taken at the new centre , either electronically or paper -based following consultation either in person or via vide o/phone call, and then a copy of the participant’s CRFs should be provided to the new centre. Responsibility for the participant remains with the original consenting centre until the new consent process is complete. 6.6.5 Loss to Follow -up Sites will be as ked to account for the vital status and details of admission to hospital for all patients who have consented to participate in the study regardless of whether they have withdrawn from the intervention or study assessments. Patients will be asked to provide consent so that all follow -up information on overall or hospital free survival can be obtained from the BTS registry if required. 6.6.6 Trial Closure The end of the trial is defined as 4 months following the last follow -up visit of the last patient rando mised, to allow for data entry and data clean ing activities to be completed. 6.7 Sample Size A sample size of 2 70 individuals, 13 5 per group, will provide 90% power to detect a minimal important difference (MID) of 4% reduction in % FVC versus placebo assu ming a standard deviation of 9% (from the TIPAC trial) and a loss to follow -up rate of 20% (from the TIPAC and EME -TIPAC trials ) and a significance level of 5%. However, we will randomise 298 patients (149 per group) in order to account for 10% of patient s being asymptomatic . A sample size of 160 patients (80 per group) will provide 90% power to detect a ratio of geometric means of 0.6 of cough frequency, which is smaller than the published MID (47), assuming a coefficient of variation of 1 (from the PPIPF trial) and a loss to follow -up rate of 30%. The sample size was based on references which used lab -based spirometry devices, due to COVID -19 the measurement that will be used i s the home -based spirometry. The trial team felt it was simpler to leave the sample size as it was originally as there is a lack of data available on the variability of the outcome in the devices used and no reason to think that the MID would be different due to the different devices. The DMC will monitor the assumptions of the sample size calculation in accordance with the Terms of Reference."

Identification will also be via screening patient registries, hospital medical records and databases of research interested patients or clinical deta ils. Recruitment strategies , summarised in figure 3, may include any of the following:  Patients will be approached by the clinical care team directly when they attend the hospital outpatient clinic who will give an invitation letter on hospital headed paper which provides an overview of the study and a participant information sheet . The clinic staff will arrange a subsequent screening visit.  The clinic team may also mail (by post or e -mail) an invitation letter with or without a participant information sh eet along with a contact email address /phone number to respond to, detailing a range of methods for the interested potential patients to contact the local trial team to arrange a screening appointment.  Where patients are due to attend clinic for a routine appointment in the near future, the clinical care team may mail (by post or e -mail) an invitation letter on hospital headed paper which provides an over view of the study, and a participant information sheet, so that the patient receives these documents at least 24 hours in advance of the forthcoming routine clinic assessment visit. After the participant has provided written informed consent, screening for eligibility and baseline assessments will be undertaken at the routine clinic visit.  For centres with access to a volunteer database, the researchers may mail the invitation letter and reply form directly to the volunteer.  Patients may be approached as outlined above, seeking initial verbal consent to participate in the study and for their contact details to be shared with the NCTU trial team to be documented in the patient notes. Following verbal consent, NCTU staff may arrange /oversee shipment of the TIPAL study supplies kit including a smart device to allow e -consent to be completed and the remaining ass essments to be completed from baseline onwards as long as the participant remains willing."

Enrolment will then be scheduled either via a face -to-face visit or by consultation via phone/video call for those willing to consent to participate . Potential participants and site staff will c onfirm whether consent will be recorded electronically or on paper, with the decision documented in the patient’s medical notes, to facilitate preparations for the enrolment visit. Remote consent For those being enrolled remotely and completing paper cons ent forms, a localised consent form with a freepost or stamped address envelope, will be mailed to the potential participant for their completion following the study consultation. The person taking consent will countersign the form upon receipt at the recruiting site. Where electronic consent is being sought, participants will verbal ly consent to the sharing of their email address and/or contact details in order to r eceive the link to the electronic consent form to facilitate the process. This will be documented by site staff in the patient’s medical notes. Both parties will complete the electronic consent form following the phone/video call consultation by providing a wet-ink signature equivalent on the designated field via REDcap (51).

Copies of the completed forms will be mailed (by post or email) to participants. Consent will be obtained prior to any study related procedure. Following consent, screening bloods will be taken and other eligibility criteria will be assessed. Patients meeting all entry criteria (after review of screening bloods) and willing to consent to participate or having already provided consent, will be sent a TIPAL study supplies kit including the spirometer and smart device. Participants may be randomised without a subsequent visit. Medication will be dispensed by the central study pharmacy and couriered (or sent via another signed for delivery service) directly to the pa rticipant and will requ ire signature on receipt. Participants will be advised to store their medication below 25°C but there may not be any temperature monitoring after IMP has been dispens ed. 6.8.2 Retention This study has been designed to be able to be conducted completely rem otely reducing participant burden significantly by removing travel time and associated cost(s), allowing almost complete flexibility around completion of study assessments and removal of any risks associated with breaking COVID -19 social distancing guidel ines. A remote study design also means trial participation can continue in the event of local lockdowns for any reason. Maintaining additional contact outside of standard clinic appointments may also encourage retention . The provision of a smart device , with a pre-loaded sim card if required and regular support where needed, affords all participants equal opportunity to participate despite any pers onal technological inequalities. Postage for participants opting to complete paper -based questionnaires and costs associated with couriering TIPAL study supplies kits including equipment required for the sub -study and IMP to, and from , where applicable, participants are not payable by participants at any point. Couriers will be scheduled following consultation w ith the participant where possible to ensure collection/delivery is convenient to the participant . Participant s will also be offered the option to subscribe to an email based pa rticipant newsletter during the study’s recruitment period in order to help keep participants en gaged and informed of study progress during and beyond their participation. The SWAT is als o intended to improve pa rticipant retention at intervention sites. Participan ts will be given /posted a card with the contact details of the local PI that will request details of hospital admissions to be reported at consent/baseline . Patients will be asked to provide informed consent for their contact details to be stored in a tria l contacts database at UEA. Pa rticipants can withdraw consent to this in writing at any time. 6.9 Assignment of Intervention 6.9.1 Allocation 6.9.1.1 Sequence generation - The allocated treatment for a patient will be generated via computer written code using minimisation. Minimisation will be performed using Taves’ method with the factors measured at baseline: i) study site, ii) baseline licensed medication for IPF (yes/no), iii) reflux symptoms (presence/absence) and iv)"

In order to decide on the treatment allocation the code will calculate the number of patients in each group that have the same characteristics as the patient awaiting allocation; they will be allocated to the intervention with the smaller number with a high probability. If the numbers are the same then simple randomisation is used. Full details of the minimisation algorithm (including the probability of allocation) will be documented in a separate document (TIPAL Allocation Schedule) stored in a share d file accessible to only the study statistician(s) and data management team as appropriate. 6.9.1.2 Allocation concealment mechanism Allocation will be computer generated by a web -based system ensuring concealment prior to randomisation. Following consen t and confirmation of eligibility the PI or delegate will enter data confirming eligibility into the eCRF generating a pa rticipant identification number. Blinded notification of randomisation will be sent to the PI and/or delegates, CI and NCTU trial team. A semi -blinded notification of randomisation will be sent to the central pharmacy. 6.9.1.3 Allocation Implementation The PI or delegated sub -investigator is responsible for ensuring only eligible patients are randomised and prescribed study medication. Pa tients will be allocated to the intervention by a process embedded in the web -based data management system. The randomisation code will be saved in the study database for later decoding and also for emergency unblinding purposes. 6.9.2 Blinding This is a double blind study. The placebo and active treatments will appear identical and will be dispensed in identical containers. All trial pa rticipant s, care providers and outcome assessors will remain blind throughout the study . 6.9.3 Emergency Unblinding The decision to unblind a single case should be made when knowledge of an individual’s allocated treatment is required: • To enable treatment of severe adverse event/s, or • In the event of an overdose Where possible, requests for emergency or unplanned unblinding of individuals should be made via the trial manager and a greement of the CI will then be sought. However, in circumstances where there is insufficient time to make this request or for agreement to be sought, the treating clinician should make th e decision to unblind immediately. This will be done via the study database (local PIs and the CI will have special logins which will allow unblinding and which will be closely audited within the database management system) or by contacting the CI who will authorise unblinding by the Data Management Team. All instances of unblinding should be recorded and reported to NCTU by the local PI, or delegate , including the identity of all recipients of the unblinding information . 6.9.3 Non -emergency Unblinding For circumstances where non -emergency unblinding is required e.g. GP/clinician or pa rticipant request, following confirmation from the CI, treatment allocation will be revealed by the eCRF, using log-ins and forms separate to those required to unblind in eme rgency situations.

A record of non - emergency unblinding and those individuals unblinded to trial treatment will be recorded and filed. 6.10 Data Collection , Management and Analysis 6.10.1 Data Collection Methods An on -line patient screening log will contain the details of the patient initials, date of contact and the route of identification for all potential participants who have received a patient information sheet (PIS) . Following confirmation of consent, e ach participant will be given a unique trial Participant IDentification Number (PI D). Data will be collected at the time -points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (see section 6.6) . Data collection will vary according to the data variable in question. Laboratory spirometry will be captured according to E uropean Respiratory Society (ERS)/ American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria (50) by an Association for Respiratory Technology & Physiology (ARTP) registered pulmonary function technologist (see relevant working instruction available from NCTU trial team ) where possible. Once erroneous blows have been rejected as required, the FVC for the highest three blows will be recorded. Gas transfer measurements will be performed to ERS/ATS standards (48) by an ARTP registered pulmonary fun ction technologist. Domiciliary spirometers are provided to participants following consent to obtain weekly spirometry data from receipt of the study drug to 12 months post - randomisation . Participants will be asked to perform at least three forced expirato ry volume manoeuvres. Measurements will be made on 5 consecutive days at baseline and at twelve months and once weekly for the remainder of the study. The domiciliary spirometer will transfer data for each blow via Bluetooth to the accompanying app pre -installed on the smart device provided. The assessments will be graded according to ERS/ATS criteria ( 50) within the app. The raw data including flow -volume loops and volume -time curves will be automatically synced from the app on the participant’s smart devi ce to a validated clinical trials data platform or entered into the eCRF . The following variables will be recorded during domiciliary spirometry assessments and recorded onto the accompany clinical trials data platform or eCRF and/or should be observed du ring lung function (including spirometry and gas transfer assessments) and recorded onto the BTS registry/eCRF as required where assessments are possible :  FEV1  FVC  DLCO  KCO  The FEV1/FVC ratio will be calculated from the data provided. Further guidance for the conduct of domiciliary spirometry assessments is provided in the corresponding TIPAL working instruction available from the NCTU trial team . Participants will also be provided with ethically approved literature to assist them in th e completion of their spirometry assessments in addition to the guidance given by the app during the measurements."

Participants will be asked to complete online questionnaires but there will be a provision of completing the questionnaires on paper if required. Paper questionnaires wi ll be sent to NCTU (by post or email using high resolution scanning) , where they will be read using optical character recognition software and the resulting data imported into the study database. Online responses will be stored directly in the eCRF . Relev ant data will be exported at regular intervals and imported into the study database. The datasets will be matched on the TIPAL PID, which will be stored in the BTS Registry and domiciliary spirometer clinical data platform if applicable . The BTS Registry I Ds will be stored in the TIPAL study database as a means of double -checking the correct records have been imported. Patient consent will be sought prior to data sharing. Data required only for study purposes will be entered by direct online entry into the eCRF by delegated members of research site staff. Positive tests for covid -19 during trial participation will be recorded on the eCRF following a review of patient medic al notes /discussion with participants by site staff. Covid -19 infection will be confirmed at baseline and at each study visit thereafter as part of the adverse event review. Further information on data collection and management processes are provided in th e TIPAL Data Management Plan. Data may be entered onto paper Case Re port Forms (CRFs) prior to entry onto the database. Staff will receive training on data collection and use of the online system (see Section 6.10.2 ). Data collectio n, data entry and queries rais ed by a member of the TIPAL trial team will be conducted in line with NCTU and trial specific Data Management Standard Operating Procedure. Identification logs and enrolment logs will be kept at the trial site in a locked cabinet within a secur ed room. Participant identifiable data will be stored on a Participants Database for the purpose of couriering IMP and TIPAL study supplies kits , contacting participants to collect trial data, arrange couriers etc., sending questionnaires and reminders and for sending newsletters during the trial . All participant identifiable data will be stored securely, with access only granted to those members of the study team who require it. Clinical trial team members will receive trial protocol training. All data wi ll be handled in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and GDPR 2018 and any subsequent revisions . 6.10.2 Data Management Data will be entered under the participants PI D number onto the central database stored on the servers based at NCTU.

The physical location of the servers is protected physically and environmentally in accordance with Unive rsity of East Anglia’s General Information Security Policy 3 (GISP3: Physical and environmental security). Each participant will have a profile on the app which accompanies the domiciliary spirometer following consent. The app profile will contain clinical ly relevant data necessary to grade spirometry assessments and may contain some personal information to allow identification of the participant at the recruiting site and/or trials unit. Cough count sub -study data will be held within a trial specific data base developed and maintained by the cough monitor manufacturers. Participants will be identified by their PID. Access will be restricted to relevant members of the NCTU trial team , cough analysts, and authorised members of site staff at recruiting sites v ia a unique username and password. Site staff will have access to participant data recruited by their site only whereas the NCTU trial team, cough monitor manufacturer project team and cough analysts will have oversight of data for all trial participants. The eCRF and associated code will be developed by NCTU Data Management, in conjunction with the TIPAL trial team. The eCRF software will provide a number of features to help maintain data quality, including; maintaining an audit trail, allowing custom val idations on all data, allowing users to raise data query requests, and search facilities to identify validation failure / missing data. After completion of the trial the eCRF will be retained for at least 5 years on the servers of NCTU for on-going analysi s of secondary outcomes. Cough count sub -study data will be retained by Vitalograph for at least 25 years. The identification and enrolment logs, linking participant identifiable data to the pseudoanonymised PID, will be held locally by the trial site. This will either be held in written form in a locked filing cabinet or electronically in password protected form s on hospital computers. After completion of the trial the identification and enrolment logs will be stored securely by the sites for 5 years un less otherwise advised by NCTU. 6.10.3 Non -Adherence and Non -Retention The consent form will explain that if a participant wishes to withdraw from the study the data and samples acquired prior to that point will be retained. Reason for withdrawal will be r ecorded, if given, as will loss to follow up. Non -adherence to trial medication will be assessed through capsule counts of unused returned drug supplies at each relevant study visit. Where patients are unable or unwilling to continue to undertake study me asurements/activities, the decision as to whether the participant should continue with trial treatment and/or follow -up assessments will be at the discretion of the local PI and/ or CI. 6.10.4 Statistical Methods 6.10.4. 1 Outcomes Primary outcome"

The average of the best value undertaken each day over a 5 day period will be calcu lated. An adjusted analysis will also be undertaken adjusting for the baseline %FVC. Additional adjusted analysis may be undertaken for factors associated with the outcome. In addition, a linear mixed model will be used to combine all the post -randomisation %FVC results into a single model which will adjust for the same factors and include a patient identifier as a random effect . An interaction between group and time will also be included to assess if the effect of the intervention is constant over time or varies as time progresses. A sensitivity analysis will be undertaken excluding asymptomatic individuals. Secondary outcomes The decline and rate of decline in %FVC during the 12 months: This will be based on a longitudinal model w ith a factor for the intervention or control to represent the average change over the course of the trial , and a time -trend to represent the decline in %FVC during the 12 months of the control group , and a time -trend x intervention interaction to represent the additional decline in %FVC during the 12 months. If the re is evidence of a non-linear time trend , then to ease interpretation , the data will be averaged to the average %FVC each month and time will be treated as categorical. Different temporal correl ation structures will be investigated. Cough frequency: This will be based on a log -transformed cough count at 3 months , the model used will be a general linear model adjusting for the minimisation factors used in the allocation algorithm . An adjusted anal ysis will also be undertaken adjusting for baseline cough count. The effect size will be estimated as the geometric mean. Cough score: This will be based on a general linear model with cough score at 12 months as the outcome, adjusting for the minimisation factors used in the allocation algorithm. An adjusted analysis will also be undertaken adjusting for baseline cough score. The effect size will be estimated as the mean difference. In addition, a linear mixed model will be used to comb ine all the post -randomisation cough score results into a single model which will adjust for the same factors and include a patient identifier as a random effect . An interaction between group and time will also be included to assess if the effect of the intervention is consta nt over time or varies as time progresses . Cough related Q uality of Life (QoL) : This will be based on a general linear model with cough related QoL at 12 months as the outcome, adjusting for the minimisation factors used in the allocation algorithm. An adj usted analysis will also be undertaken adjusting for baseline cough related QoL. The effect size will be estimated as the mean difference. In addition, a linear mixed model will be used to comb ine all the post -randomisation cough related QoL results into a single model which will adjust for the same factors and include a patient identifier as a random effect . An interaction between group and time will also be included to assess if the effect of the intervention is constant over time or varies as time progre sses. MRC dyspnoea scale: This will be based on a Mann -Whitney U test comparing the MRC dyspnoea scale at 12 months between groups. It will not be possible to adjust for the minimisation factors used in the allocation algorithm or to report an effect size, however the median in each group will be reported.

However, use of health services recorded throughout the trial will focus on use of secondary care services as they are significant events for both patients and the NHS. These data will be reported as summaries and analysed using the methods described above. 6.10. 6 Analysis of Tissue Samples There is not any planned analysis of tissue samples other than safety analysis. Blood, serum and plasma will be stored for analysis in future studies following ethical approval. A laboratory analysis plan for genotype samples will be agreed and approved by the CI and TMG prior to analysis. In addition, a laboratory manual for sample ha ndling will be developed and agreed by the CI and circulated to sites prior to activation to recruitment. 6.11 Safety reporting 6.11.1 Safety reporting Adverse events will be collected at each visit and analysed according to the SAP. Adverse events by treatment group will be reviewed regularly by the DMC as described in their Terms of Reference (ToR) . Definitions of harm of the EU Directive 2001/20/EC Article 2 based on the principles of ICH GCP apply to this trial. Table 2 : Adverse Event Definitions Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this product. Adverse Reaction (AR) Any untoward and unintended response to an investigational medicinal product related to any dose administered/trial treatment . Unexpected Adverse Reaction (UAR) An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable produc t information (e .g. Investigator’s Brochure for an unauthorised product or SPC for an authorised product or treatment . Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR) Any AE or AR that at any dose:  results in death  is life threatening*  requires hospitalisation or prolongs existing hospitalisation**  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  or is another important medical condition***"

Hospitalisation for pre - existing conditions (including elective procedures that have not worsened) do not constitute an SAE. *** Medical j udgement should be exercised in deciding whether an AE or AR is serious in other situations. Important AEs or ARs that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalisation, but may seriously jeopardise the participant by requiring intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the table (e .g. a secondary malignancy, an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive emergency treatment, seizures or blood dyscrasias that do not require hospitalisation, or development of drug d ependency). Adverse events include:  an exacerbation of a pre -existing illness  an increase in the frequency or intensity of a pre -existing episodic event or condition  a condition (regardless of whether PRESENT prior to the start of the trial) that is DETECTED after trial drug administration . (This does not include pre -existing conditions recorded as such at baseline – as they are not detected after trial drug administrati on)  continuous persistent disease or a symptom present at baseline that worsens following administration of the trial treatment Adverse events do NOT include:  Medical or surgical procedures: the condition that leads to the procedure is the adverse event  Pre-existing disease or a condition present before treatment that does not worsen  Hospitalisation where no untoward or unintended response has occurred e .g. elective cosmetic surgery  Overdose of medication without signs or symptoms AEs will be coded accordin g to the current version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) dictionary. 6.11.2 Investigator responsibilities relating to safety reporting All non -serious AEs and ARs, whether expected or not, should be recorded in the patient’s m edical notes and reported on the adverse events f orm of the eCRF within 7 days of report/becoming aware . All SARs and SAEs should be should be notified to NCTU immediately after the investigator becomes aware of the event (in no circumstance should this notification take longer than 24 hours)."

If the event is classified as ‘serious’ an SAE form must be completed and NCTU notified immediately . Investigators will also assess causality of the event(s) according to Table 3. 6.11.2.2 Severity or grading of Adverse Events The severity of all AEs and/or ARs (serious and non -serious) in this trial should be graded according to CTCAE grading criteria and be assigned a grade 1 -5. 6.11.2.3 Causality The investigator must assess the causality of all serious events in relation to the trial treatment using the definitions in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Event Causality Definitions Relationship Description Event type Unrelated There is no evidence of any causal relationship . Unrelated SAE Unlikely to be related There is little evidence to suggest that there is a causal relationship (e.g. the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). There is another reasonable explanation for the event (e.g. the participant’s clinical condition o r other concomitant treatment) . Unrelated SAE Possibly related There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g. because the event occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g. the participant’s clinical condition or other concomitant treatment) . SAR"

SAR Definitely related There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. SAR If an SAE is considered to be related to trial treatment, and treatment is discontinued, interrupted or the dose modifi ed, refe r to section 6.4.1.4 of this protocol . 6.11.2.4 E xpectedness If there is at least a possible involvement of the trial IMP (including any comparators), the investigator and NCTU must assess the expectedness of the event. An unexpected adverse reaction is on e that is not reported in the approved SPC, or one that is more frequently reported or more severe than previously reported. See section 4.8 of the SPC for a list of expected reactions associated with the IMP being used in this trial. If a SAR is assessed as being unexpected , it becomes a suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reaction (SUSAR ) and MHRA and REC reporting guidelines apply (see Notifications sections of the protocol section 6.11.3 ). 6.11.3 Notifications 6.11.3 .1 Notifications by the Investigator to NCTU NCTU must be notified of all SAEs immediately an d no later than 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. Investigators should notify NCTU of any SAEs occurring from the time of randomisation until 30 days after the las t protocol treatment administration. SARs and SUSARs must be notified to NCTU until trial closure . Any subsequent events that may be attributed to treatment should be reported to the MHRA using the yellow card system (https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/the -yellow-card -scheme/). The SAE form must be completed by the investigator or sub -investigator (a clinician named on the delegation of responsibilities list who is responsible for the participant’s care) with attention paid to the grading, causality and expect edness of the event. In the absence of the responsible investigator, the SAE form should be completed and signed by a member of the site trial team and emailed as appropriate within the timeline. The responsible investigator should check the SAE form at th e earliest opportunity, make any changes necessary, sign and then email to NCTU. Detailed written reports should be completed as appropriate. Systems will be in place at the site to enable the investigator to check the form for clinical accuracy as soon as possible. The minimum criteria required for reporting an SAE are the trial number and date of birth, name of reporting investigator and sufficient information on the event to confirm seriousness. Any further information regarding the event that is unavail able at the time of the first report should be sent as soon as it becomes available."

Follow -up SAE forms (clearly marked as fol low-up) should be completed and emailed to NCTU as further information becomes available. Additional information and/or copies of test results etc . may be provided separately. The participant must be identified by trial number, date of birth and initials o nly. The participant’s name should not be used on any correspondence and should be redacted and replaced with trial identifiers on any test results. 6.11.3. 2 NCTU responsibilities Medically qualified staff at NCTU and/or the CI (or a medically qualified d elegate) will review all SAE reports received and the NCTU trial team will notify the Sponsor as appropriate . In the event of disagreement between the causality assessment given by the local investigator and the CI, both opinions and any justifications wil l be provided in subsequent reports. The causality attributed to lansoprazole by the local investigator cannot be downgraded by other parties. NCTU is responsible for the reporting of SUSARs to the regulatory authorities (MHRA and competent authorities of other European member states and any other countries in which the trial is taking place) and REC as appropriate. Fatal and life threatening SUSARs must be reported to the competent authorities within 7 days of NCTU becoming aware of the event; other SUSARs must be reported within 15 days. NCTU will keep investigators informed of any safety issues that arise during the course of the trial. The trial manager or delegate at NCTU will submit Development Safety Update Reports (DSURs) to competent authorities. 6.12 Data Monitoring 6.12.1 Data Monitoring Committee Details of the roles and responsibilities of the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), including membership, relationships with other committees, decision making processes, and the timing and frequency of interim analyses (and description of stopping rules and/o r guidelines where applicable) are described in detail in the TIPAL DMC ToR. 6.12.2 Interim Analyses There are no interim analyses planned. 6.12.3 Quality Assurance and Control 6.12.3.1 Risk Assessment The Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) c onsiderations for the TIPAL trial are based on the standard NCTU Quality Management Policy that includes a formal Risk Assessment, and that acknowledges the risks associated with the conduct of the trial and proposals of how to mitigate them through approp riate QA and QC processes.

QA is defi ned as all the planned and systematic actions established to ensure the trial is performed and data generated, documented and/or recorded and reported in compliance with the principles of GCP and applicable regulatory requirements. QC is defined as the ope rational techniques and activities performed within the QA system to verify that the requirements for quality of the trial related activities are fulfilled. 6.12.3.2 Central Monitoring at NCTU NCTU staff will review the eCRF data for errors and missing key data points. The trial database will also be programmed to generate reports on errors and error rates. Essential trial issues, events and outputs, including defined key data points, will be detailed in the TIPAL trial Data Management Plan. The quality of the domiciliary spirometry data will be monitored regularly during the study and at least at every 3 monthly visit. Participants will be retrained as required . Patients are consented to enable NCTU to hold a copy of the comp leted consent form to allow central data monitoring checks to be completed. 6.12.3.3 On-site Monitoring The frequency, type and intensity of routine and triggered on -site monitoring will be detailed in the TIPAL Quality Management and Monitoring Plan (QMM P). The QMMP will also detail the procedures for review and sign -off of monitoring reports. In the event of a request for a trial site inspection by any regulatory authority, NCTU must be notified as soon as possible. 6.12.3.3.1 Direct access to participan t records Participating investigators must agree to allow trial related monitoring, including audits, REC review and regulatory inspections, by providing access to source data and other trial related documentation as required. Participant consent for this must be obtained as part of the informed consent process for the trial. 6.12.3.4 Trial Oversight Trial oversight is intended to preserve the integrity of the trial by independently verifying a variety of processes and prompting corrective action where nece ssary. The processes reviewed relate to participant enrolment, consent, eligibility, and allocation to trial groups; adherence to trial interventions and policies to protect participants, including reporting of harms; completeness, accuracy and timeliness of data collection; and will verify adherence to applicable policies detailed in the Compliance section of the protocol. Independent trial oversight complies with the NCTU trial oversight policy. In multi -centre trials this oversight is considered and described both overall and for each recruiting centre by exploring the trial dataset or performing site visits as described in the TIPAL QMMP. 6.12.3.4.1 Trial Management Team The Trial Management Tea m (TMT) will be set up to assist with developing th e design, co -ordination and day -to-day operational issues in the management of the trial, including budget management.

The IDMC is responsible for safeguarding the interests of trial participants, monitoring the accumulating data and making recommendations to the TSC on whether the trial should continue as planned. The membership, f requency of meetings, activity (including review of trial conduct and data) and authority will be covered in the IDMC terms of reference. The IDMC will consider data in accordance with the SAP and will advise the TSC through its Chair . 6.12.3.4.5 Trial Spo nsor The role of the sponsor , Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, is to take on responsibility for securing the arrangements to initiate, manage and finance the trial. The Sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the study meets the relevant standards, and makes sure that arrangements are put and kept in place for management, monitoring and reporting. A proportion of the Sponsor’s activities have been delegated to the CI, UEA and NCTU as outlined on the form for delegated activities agreed and signed by all parties before the start of the trial. 7 Ethics and Dissemination 7.1 Research Ethics and Health Research Authority Approval Before initiation of the trial at any clinical site, the protocol, all informed consent forms and any material to be given to the prospective participant will be submitted to the relevant REC and to HRA for approval. Any subsequent amendments to these documents will be submitted for further approval. The rights of the participant to refuse to par ticipate in the trial without giving a reason must be respected. After the participant has entered the trial, the clinician remains free to give alternative treatment to that specified in the protocol, at any stage, if s/he feels it to be in the best inter est of the participant. The reasons for doing so must be recorded. After randomisation the participant must remain within the trial for the purpose of follow up and data analysis according to the treatment option to which they have been allocated. However, the participant remains free to change their mind at any time about the protocol treatment and follow -up without giving a reason and without prejudicing their further treatment. 7.2 Competent Authority Approvals This protocol will be submitted to the MHRA ."

Therefore, a CTA is required in the UK. The progress of the trial, safety issues and reports, including expedited reporting of SUSARs, wil l be reported to the MHRA in accordance with relevant requirements and practices. 7.3 Other Approvals Documentation will need to be submitted to the R&D Department at each NHS Site in order to gain confirmation of capacity and capability prior to the stud y being initiated at that site. Confirmation from the site will take the form of a site agreement signed by the Sponsor , NCTU and the relevant site as required . A copy of the local R&D approval and of the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and consent f orm on local hospital headed paper must be forwarded to the co -ordinating centre before participants are randomised to the trial. The protocol has received formal approval and methodological, statistical, clinical and operational input from the NCTU Proto col Review Committee. 7.4 Amendments Amendments to the Protocol and other documents (e.g. changes to eligibility criteria, outcomes, sample size calculations, analyses) will be agreed by the TMG. Such amendments will be forwarded to the Sponsor for confirm ation as to whether it is either substantial or non -substantial and will then be submitted to the MHRA, HRA or Ethics Committee for categorisation and approval as required . Once the amendment has been categorised it will be sent to relevant sites for consi deration in accordance with standard MHRA and/or HRA processes and timescales. Amendments must not be implemented until all approval s are received and sites have either confirmed acceptance or, no objection has been received within the defined timescale (s). Notification will be sent by NCTU to trial personnel to confirm when an amendment can be implemented. A summary of protocol amendments will be maintained within the protocol. 7.5 Consent or Assent Patients will be provided with a PIS and given time to read it fully. Following a discussion with a medical qualified investigator or suitably trained and authorised delegate, any questions will be satisfactorily answered and if the participant is willing to participate, written informed consent will be obtai ned either electronically or paper -based following consultation in person or via phone/video call . During the consent process it will be made completely and unambiguously clear that the participant is free to refuse to participate in all or any aspect of the trial, at any time and for any reason, without incurring any penalty or affecting their treatment . Consent will be re -sought if new information becomes available that affects the participant’s consent in any way. This will be documen ted in a revision to the participant information sheet and the participant will be asked to sign an updated consent form. These will be approved by the ethics committee prior to their use. A copy of the approved consent form and PIS are available from the NCTU trial team."
