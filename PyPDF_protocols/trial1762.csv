Endpoints: Primary endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is to determine differences between patients in the 2 treatment arms according to the following criteria:  Proportion of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA, as defined per protocol ) during a 2 year ( 96 week) period  Pre-planned study extension: Proportion of patients with NEDA (as defined per protocol) during a 5 year (2 40 week) period. NEDA is the absence of a protocol defin ed disease activity event. A protocol -defined disease activity event is the occurrence of at least one of the following: - A new T 1Gd-enhanced lesion on MRI of the brain and spinal cord - A new T 2 hyperintense lesion on MRI of brain and spinal cord - A protocol -defined MS relapse (see d efinition below) - 24 week confirmed d isability progression based on increases in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) ( see definition below and Appendix C) MS relapse is defined as new or worsening neurological symptoms attributable to MS, lasting at least 48 hours, without pyrexia, after at least 30 days of clinical stability with an objective change on neurological examination3. Disability progression is defined as an increase of one point in the EDSS score (or half"

It is most frequently diagnosed at 20 -40 years of age . In Scandinavia, the prevalence of MS is approximately 200/100 0006. There is no curative treatment. At disease onset , the majority of MS -patients (85 %) have a relapsing remitting disease course (RRMS) with exacerbations followed by complete or partial clinical recover ies. Relapsing -remitting MS is treated with immunomodulatory medications to prevent relapses and to delay disability development. Immunomodulatory treatment reduces the annually MS relapse rate in RRMS 20 -70 %, and recent studies indicate a slower progression of disability compared to studies prior to the era of immunomodulatory MS - treatment7, 8. A major proportion of RRMS patients experience disease activity despite the use of registered immunomodulatory MS -treatment, and these patients have significant risk of developing severe disability at a young age9, 10. Accordingly, there is a need for improved immunomodulatory treatment options that rapidly and consistently prevent CNS inflammation, MS -relapses and progression of clinical disabilities . 1.2 Background - Therapeutic Information Every occurrence of inflammatory MS -disease activity has long -term clinical consequences 11, 12. Pre-relaps e function is not regained i n more than 30% of MS -relapses13. The number/volume of MS -lesions is correlated to long-term disability and to reaching the chronic progressive disease stage11. An emerging endpoint is thus the proportion of patients achieving “no evidence of disease activity” (NEDA). NEDA has been defined as no new T 2 lesions or T1 gadolinium (Gd) enhancing les ions on MRI, no clinical relapses, and no disability progression2, 14. In a longitudinal MS cohort the positive predictive value (PPV) of NEDA at 2 years for progression of disability at 7 years was 78 %14. The PPV of NEDA at 2 years was greater than each individual component. In the placebo groups of immunomodulatory RRMS treatment studies approximately 7 -16 % of patients have NEDA after 2 years14. In a cohort study of patients with a disease duration of 5 years or less, only 12% had NEDA after 5 years, and 6 % had NEDA at 7 years14 In a meta -analysis of immunomodulatory treatment effects in RRMS, the highest ranking immunomodulatory drug for reduction of annualized relapse rate and 3 month confirmed disability progression was alemtuzumab15. In a randomized treatment study the proportion of patients treated with alemtuzumab with NEDA over 2 years was 32 % 3. 1.3 Clinical Experience with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) 1.3.1 Treatment effect o f autologous HSCT in MS Data from recently published patient series indicate that autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT ) may have a significantly higher treatment effect than standard RRMS immunomodulatory treatment16-18. The premise of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) in MS is that the self -reactive immune response is eradicated by the conditioning regime, and that the immune system is “reset” after reinfusion of autolog ous hematopoietic stem cells, producing an immune system that is less self -reactive. Early HSCT – studies were mainly small patient series or cohort studies on MS patients with predominantly progressive disease and advanced disability19. A large percentage of patients in these studies experienced continued disability progression, consistent with a significant role of neurodegenerative mechanisms at this late disease stage20. In more recent non -randomized treatment studies , a major proportion of the study population are RRMS patients with short disease durat ions and clinically/radiologically highly active inflammatory activity . The study results indicate that HSCT may be an effective treatment option in the RRMS patient group17, 18, 21, 22 . After HSCT , the inflammatory disease process is halted for several years in a majority of MS patients. In a study of 145 MS"
25,page_25,"Study: RAM -MS CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 20-Dec-2017 RAM -MS Version no. 4.1, 08-Dec-2017 Page 26 of 96 patients (81 % RRMS, 19 % SPMS) treated with HSCT , using low intensity conditioning based on Cyclophosphamide, 80 % of patients had NEDA over 2 years, and 68 % had NEDA over 4 years after treatment17. In a patient series of 41 MS patients (34 patients with RRMS) treated with medium or high intensity conditioning HSCT in a multi centre study in Sweden, 68 % had NEDA over 5 years18. In an interim analysis of an ongoing, multi centre , singl e-arm clinical trial of HSCT for RRMS patients who experienced treatment failure on other immunomodulatory treatment, 24 patients received HSCT . The study participants received medium intensity conditioning with carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melph alan (BEAM). 78.4% of the treated patients had NEDA at 3 years22. In a recent single -group phase 2 trial at three hospitals in Canada 24 patients (50 % RRMS, 50 % SPMS) received high intensity myeloablative conditioning with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and rabbit anti - thymocyte globulin, followed by autologous HSCT21. 70% of patients had no disease activity (NEDA) at 3 years after transplantation. The patients had no MS relapses, new Gd-enhancing lesions or new T 2 lesions during a median follow -up of 6.7 years. The yearly rate of brain atrophy decreased to a level compa rable with healthy controls. These results are not directly comparable to data from randomized and controlled studies with registered immunomodulato ry treatments due to differences in patient populations and study design s. A significant proportion of patients in several of the HSCT studies had progressive MS or did not meet the inclusion criteria, or the inclusion criteria were significantly different than criteria used in randomized trials of immunomodulatory MS treatment. The autologous HSCT -studies were not randomized, and did not include a control group. The proportion of patients with NEDA may also vary depend ing on the clinical and radiological p re– and post -treatment follow -up protocol s. 1.3.2 Side effects of autologous HSCT There is a risk for serious side effects of HSCT , mainly due to the toxicity of the conditioning regimens. The HSCTrelated mortality rate reported to The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) from 1995 to 2000 was 7.3 %, whereas from 2001 to 2007 it was significantly lower; 1.3 %. This change may be due to better patient selection and improved investigator experience, but could also be associated with a concomitant switch from high intensity conditioning to the use of medium intensity (BEAM) or low intensity, cyclophosphamide - based conditioning regimens. In the 4 most recently reported MS patient series of non -myeloablative conditioning 299 patients were treated, and there was no registered treatment related death17, 18, 22, 23 . In a recently reported MS patient material treated with a high intensity myeloablative conditioning regimen, consisting of busulfan, cyclophosphamide and anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG), one of the 24 patients died of transplantation -related complications21. Other frequent serious side effects of HSCT include , neutropenic fever, infectious disease s complicated with bacteremia/sepsis, hemorrhagic cystitis, liver toxicity and reactivation of varicella virus Epstein - Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV). . Mucositis and diarrhea were more prevalent in earl y studies using medium and high intensity conditioning regimens . Following the immediate post transplant period (which per definition extends to HSCT day +100), there is an increased risk of secondary autoimmune disease s, including thyroid disease and immunological thrombo cytopenia (ITP) . The incidence rate of autoimmunity has been reported to be lower in treatment protocols using ATG than in protocols including alemtuzumab17, and also lower than registered when treating with alemtuzumab alone16. 1.3.3 Autologous HSCT : Mechanisms of action In autoimmune diseases like MS, autologous HSCT is applied to eradicate the autoimmune immunological memory and to regenerate a n aïve and self -tolerant immune system from hematopoietic precursors24 . However, the mechanisms of action of HSCT in MS patients still need to be clarified. The MS-disease process is believed to be driven by the adaptive immune system, comprising T cells and B cells. One hypothesis is that HSCT works by eradicating autoreactive T cells and B cells, replacing them with a non -autoimmune rep ertoire. One study using high-throughput sequencing of T cell receptor (TCR) beta -chains following HSCT showed that the CD4+ T cell repertoire was replaced to a larger extent than the CD8+ T cell repertoire25. The B cell repertoire has so far not been investigated in HSCT . Another study has demonstrated that HSCT promotes anti -inflammatory T cell responses17. Distinct cytokine profiles may be associated with high MS activity and flares26. As recommended by the EBMT, a wide array of immunological parameters should thus be monitore d in prospective HSCT -studies in MS27."

It is, however, not known why some patients relapse after treatment whereas others seem to respond very well. It has been shown that a less diverse post-treatme nt TCR repertoire is associated with a poor response 25. Thus, pre - and post -treatment characterization of the TCR and probably also the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires, and post -treatment monitoring of possible pathogenic T and B cell clones may provide important clues to why the treatment fails in a subgroup of MS patients. Finally, it will be of interest to investigate whether the oligoclonal B cell response in the cerebrospinal f luid, which is a hallmark of the disease, remains after successful treatment with HSCT 28. Detection of other immunological biomarkers and pre - and post transplant cytokine levels may also be of value in reflecting treatment responses after HSCT in RRMS patients27. 1.4 Rationale and p urpose for the study This study is a randomized multi centre treatment study of RRMS patients with breakthrough inflammatory disease activity in spite of ongoing standard immunomodulatory medication . The study has two treatment arms; arm A : HSCT and arm B: alemtuzumab, a registered immunomodulatory treatment of RRMS. A pre-planned 3- year follow -up extension period will be performed depending on future funding . The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness and side effects of a new treatment intervention in RRMS; HSCT, and, thereby, the value of HSCT in clinical practice. Data from recently published patient series indicate that HSCT may have a significantly higher treatment effect than currently registered RRMS immunomodul atory treatment s16-18. This study will determine the relative role of HSCT versus alemtuzumab. The main hypothesis of the study: HSCT is superior to EMA –approved immunomodulatory drugs in preventing further inflammatory disease activity and/or development of disability in RRMS patients with recent breakthrough inflammatory disease activity. This is a randomized study of autologous HSCT using a low intensity , non-ablative conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide and ATG versus treatment with the currently presumed best available immunomodulatory medication ( alemtuzumab ) in RRMS patients with significant inflammatory disease activity in spite of ongoing immunomodulatory MS treatment. Significant disease activity is defined as having one or more clinically reported multipl e sclerosis (MS) relapse(s), AND 1 or more T 1 Gd-enhanced lesion(s), OR three or more new or enlarging T2 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over the last year while being treated on immunomodulatory medication by standard national guidelines. The relapse(s) must have occurred 3 or more months after the onset of an immunomodulatory treatment, asimmunomodulatory treatment in MS may reach full effect after 3 months or more2. Both the knowledge of the treatment effect of registered immunomodulatory therapies for RRMS, and the number of treatments approved for RRMS by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are rapidly increasing. During the study period, there may thus appear new supplementing information on other MS immunomodulatory treatments that favour the use of a new comparator (replacing or supplementing alemtuzumab as a comparator ). This will be evaluate d by the PMC if applicable during the study period and the planned extension period. If the treatment efficacy obtained by HSCT is better than the cu rrently most efficacious standard ,immunomodulatory treatment in randomized treatment trials, HSCT will likely be approved as a part of the standard treatment recommendations for a significant proportion of RRMS patients. A randomized study regarding the clinical outcome of autologous HSCT compared to a standard immunomodulatory treatment in MS has not yet been published . Except for Sweden , HSCT is currently not registered as a part of standard MS treatment in the public health services of Europe. The HSCT regimen for the study will be ident ical to the regimen used in similar patient population s in Sweden , Norway and the USA17, 18."
27,page_27,"Study: RAM -MS CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 20-Dec-2017 RAM -MS Version no. 4.1, 08-Dec-2017 Page 28 of 96 Alemtuzumab has been chosen as the primary comparator, because it is the immunomodulatory medication currently authorised by the EMA fo r treatment of RRMS with the most favourable therapeutic effect s. In a meta - analysis of immunomodulatory treatment effect s in RRMS, alemtuzumab was the immu nomodulatory drug with the most eminent reduction of annualized relapse rate and 3 month confirmed disability progression 15. In this study, a health economic evaluation will be included . Accordingly, the proposed study should provide a robust basis for future official decision s regar ding the role of HSCT in RRMS treatment . 1.5 Benefit -risk assessment The risk to subjects in this trial will be minimized by compliance with eligibility criteria, close clinical monitoring, avoidance of prohibited treatments and adherence to protocol contraceptio n requirements and Investigator guidance regarding specific safety areas. The inclusion of an active comparator arm ensures that all patients in the study will receive active therapy. The overall benefits and safety profile for autologous HSCT ha s been outlined in section 1.3. Data suggest that the treatment related mortality with HSCT can be decreased to 1 –2 % in experienced centres using HSCT with mainly conditioning of high and medium intensit ies, and it has been even lower (≤ 0.3 %) in MS patients treated with low intensity conditoning regimens17, 18, 21, 29 -31. However, the mortality rate for HSCT has not been compared to that of other immunomodulatory MS treatments in a prospective randomized clinical study . MS is associated with a n extensive loss of quality -adjusted life years32, 33 Despite the risk of treatment related mortality and serious side effects, the overall longterm benefits associated with HSCT thus support continued research on HSCT and treatment of RRMS29, 34. The comparator alemtuzumab is approved for the treatment of relapsing RRMS . In controlled clinical trials, treatment with alemtuzumab was associated with autoimmune thyroid disorders in 30 -40 % of patients, serious events of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in approximately 1 %, and nephropaties, including anti -glomerular basem ent membrane (anti -GBM) disease in 0.3 % during a 48-53 months follow -up period after an initial LEMTRADA exposure16. Treatment with alemtuzumab is associated with an increased risk of infections, including but not restricted to urinary tract infection, uppe r respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, oral herpes, influenza, and bronchitis . The most common adverse reactions with alemtuzumab (in ≥20% of patients) are rash, headache, pyrexia, and respiratory tract infections . The efficacy of alemtuzumab in reducing clinical (ARR and disability progression) and MRI disease activity as well as brain volume loss, has been demonstrated in Phase 3 clinical trials3, 35. Overall, the balance of benefit s and risk s support a clinical study to evaluate the potential of HSCT as an effective and safe therapy in the target population . 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND RELATED ENDPOINTS 2.1 Study objective The objective of this prospective, randomized study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of HSCT compared to alemtuzumab in patients with aggressive relapsing remitting MS. In Norway, the clinical study is supplemented with a health economi c evaluation."

If a new immunomodulatory MS treatment is registered durin g the study recruitment phase it will be evaluated if the new treatment should be added as comparator. The study design is chosen because it is expected to produce results which clar ify the relative efficacy of HSCT versus the currently considered most eff icient standard immunomodulatory drug used for RRMS. This prospective, randomized study will provide data with impact on the possibility of HSCT to be accepted as a standard immunomodulatory treatment option for RRMS 19. The target group of th is study is RRMS patients with breakthrough inflammatory disease activity while on other immunomodulatory MS treatment. The study will enroll approximately 100 patients. Patients will be assessed for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and safety parameters following study treatment s at predefined timepoint s (scheduled study visits) and supplementing, unscheduled study visits , see section 6.1.5. Figure 3.1: 1 Study design Patients are included in the trial once they have signed the informed consent form (ICF). All patients considered suitable after screening and meeting the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of the treatment arms. The r andomiz ation will be unbli nded.T he patients will be assigned at a ratio of 1:1 to either HSCT (arm A) or i the currently most efficient of currently registered i mmunomodulatory treatment (arm B) . The patient assignment is stratified by age, sex and residency ( country ). Patient participation is concluded when they have completed the last planned study visit. Th e end of study is defined as “last patient out” (LPO) , i.e. last visit comp leted by last patient after 2 year follow -up period, and for the planned study extension after 5 year follow -up period. Enrollment of patients into the study is competitive , however , if recruitment on country level exceeds agreed target this must be approved by the Sponsor .

The Sponsor of this study is Helse Bergen HF, Haukeland University Hospital (HUS) , and the study will be conducted as a multi centre study in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and possibly other European countries. The members of a Project Management Committee (PMC) and a Coordinating Investigator (CI) are assigned by the Sponsor . The PMC has the overall responsibility for the planning, conduct and reporting in the study. Use of study data and biological material for additional scientific substudies will be determined by the P MC. The CI is responsible for coordinat ion of clinical i nvestigators at defined study sites . . Medical Officer s will be assigned and provide medical counselling to all participating study sites. Approval by Ethics Committees and Health Authorities must be available as applicable. An international Reference Group (RG) consisting of independent experts will be established to provide clinical and/or scientific advice for the Sponsor, PMC and CI. The composition , tasks and responisibilities of the RG will be documented in the Trial Master File ( TMF). The organization of the study at participating sites will be done according to agreed responsibilities and tasks . A signed contract must be filed before the initiation of the clinical study. Tasks and functions assigned in order to organize, manage and evaluate the study will be defined per Norwegian Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (NorCRIN) SOPs. A list of responsible clinicians (specialists in neurology and hematology comprising Principal investigators (PI) and co -PIs) at each study site will be given in the TMF. Any substantial amendments to the study protocol will be discussed and clarified with PIs and co -PIs, and with other re search collaborators if applicable. follow -up GCP -training conducted within the last 5 years is compulsory for all members of the PMC, as well as for all PIs and co -PIs. Neurologists performing EDSS -scorings at study visits also need to document recent EDSS certification. The Sponsor can provide formal training and certification in EDSS scoring for all relevant study personnel, see section 7.1.3. Curriculum vitae will be obtained from all formal clinical study personell as well as assigned research colla borators , and all documentation will be filed in the Investigator Site File (ISF) . Data management will be handled by the Clnical Trial Unit at Oslo University Hospital, Norway, who will provide the eCRF and Randomization system. The study will use electr onic CRF (eCRF) and randomization from ViedocTM, with role based access control, an interactive eCRF with in -data validation and signing, monitoring/locking functions, internal reporting of AEs and SAEs with notification to the Medical Officer, Monitor and representatives from the PMC as applicable , and data export.

The D SMB will advice the S ponsor on whether to continue, modify, or stop the trial. The tasks and responsibilities of the DSMB will be specified in a separate charter filed in the TMF . A central study radiology reading centre will be appointed by the P MC. Spinal fluid proteomic analyses will be performed by the Proteomics group at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine. Spinal fluid and blood immunologic al analyses will be performed at research laboratories at HUS and Akershus University Hospital. Other collaborating research institutes are Sahlgrenska Academy University of Gothenburg,Rigshospitalet Copenhagen, and the VUmc MS Center in Amsterdam. The users of this study are RRMS patients. Representatives from a national MS patient organization , The Norwegian MS Society ( MS-Forbundet ),have been included in planning this study . Their r epresentatives will also be involved in the following tages of the study through representation in the RG, and in informing the MS patient population of the study pro gress ,results, and about the implications of study results on the routine medical treatment of RRMS patients . This is to ensure that all aspects of the study are in accordance with the best interest of the target group. 4 STUDY POPULATION 4.1 Selection of study population An appropriate number of RRMS -patients will be screened in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and possibly other European countries. . National/regional study sites will be assigned to ensure that approximately 100 patients are randomized within the e stimated timeframe of 2 years. If enrollment is delayed or the enrollment rate is lower than anticipated, additional sites m ight be assigned by Sponsor . The number of patients included may be increased during the study period if study drop out or event rat es differ from expected levels. Every patient who fulfils the inclusion criteria and does not fulfil any exclusion criteria will be randomi zed, and receive the allocated study treatment. Re-testing: Re-testing for eligibility criteria is only to be performed once for a laboratory result which is obviously received beyond stability or thought to be a spurious result based on earlier laboratory values for a patient. To avoid protocol violations, a re-test sho uld be carried out as soon as possible to ensure that the result of the laboratory test is received within the next planned visit window . Re-screening: Re-screening of a patient is only allowed once. If failing, t he patient shoul d be declared as a screening failure in the eCRF with their original ly allocated patient number , and a new patient number will be assigned at the time of re-screening . The patient must be re -consented using the current ly approved version s of the Patient Information Sheet (PIS) and Informed Consent Form (ICF). A log of all pati ents enrolled into the study (i.e . having signed the Informed Consent Form) must be maintained by the site staff in the ISF at the investigational site irrespective of whether they have been treated with an investigational drug or not. This log should clearly identify any re -screened patient."

Patients participating in a purely observational trial w ill not be excluded . 4.4 Removal of patients from therapy or assessments 4.4.1 Removal of individual patients This is a long-term study and all patients should be encouraged to stay compliant with the study protocol and remain in the study , if continued study partic ipation is found to be medically safe and in the best interest of the patient . Permanent study medication discontinuation is only justified when a clear and persistent contraindication arise s, or if the patient request to stop study treatment (i.e. not to receive the second treatment cure with alemtuzumab at the 1 year visit (Visit 7)). An excessive withdrawal rate can severe ly impact the scientific value of the study. The “Intention to treat ” (ITT) analysis requires that all randomized patients be followed until end of study. This includes careful patient selection and appropriate explanation of the study procedures and visit schedule prior to enrolment, including an explanation of the conseq uences of premature withdrawal. Withdrawal of informed consent A patient has the right to withdraw informed consent for participation at any time for any reason. However, withdrawal of consent should be very rare and unusual. Patients must be informed that they can withdraw from the study without withdrawing consent and perhaps agree to the collection of their vital status e.g. by phone. A true withdrawal of consent means that the patient cannot be contacted about the study again. Because of this, the Inves tigator must be inv olved in the discussion with th e patient regarding a withdrawal of consent, and preferably discuss the withdrawal of consent with the Sponsor ’s representat ive prior to study discontinuation."
36,page_36,"Study: RAM -MS CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 20-Dec-2017 RAM -MS Version no. 4.1, 08-Dec-2017 Page 37 of 96 If the patient withdraws informed consent for participation in the study , the study will end for the patient. The patient must stop receiving study medication, and should be asked to return to the clinic for the end of study visit and perform assessments as described in the Flow Chart. Patient los t to follow -up If a patient is lost to follow -up, every effort should be made by the investigator and site staff to contact and locate the patient before the patient is declared lost to follow -up. Investigators and site staff must use every possible means, according to local regulations, to locate patients who have missed visits. Pregnancy If a patient becomes pregnant during the study, the study medication will be stopped, and the patient will be followed according to the patient ’s original scheduled study visits during the trial , and until birth or termination of the pregnancy. Due to the nature of the disease under study, patient s who become pregnant during the course of the study will be removed from per protocol analysis . 4.4.2 Trial Discontinuation The overall study or a specific study site , or a patient may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Sponsor in the event of the following:  Occurrence of AEs unknown to date in respect of their nature, severity and duration, invalidating the earlier positive benefit -risk-assessment  Incorrect enro llment , i.e. the patient does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria  Violation of GCP, the clinical study protocol, or the contract, affecting the continued performance of the trial  Failure to reach required recruitment targets on trial level or at a specific study site The Sponsor , PMC and CI will inform all investigators, relevant Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees in case of a prescheduled termination of the study along with the reasons for such an action. If the study is terminated early on grounds of safety, the Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees will be informed within 15 days."

The conditioning regimens used for HSCT in MS can be separated into high, intermed iate and low dose intensity. In MS treatment studies using high intensity HSCT regimen treatment related mortality was approximately 4%, while the mortality rate was lower in MS patient s treated with low or medium intensity conditioning regimens17, 18, 21, 29, 30 A recent meta analysis found no significant differences in 2 -year rate s of disability progression in patient s treated with HSCT using high, intermediate and low regimen intensit ies34. The highest proportion of MS-patients with NEDA at 24 months was found in a serie of 145 patients , using HSCT with low regimen intensity17, 34. Given these results regarding treament effect and treatment related mortality using high, intermediate and low intensity conditioning regimens , a low intensity regimen has been selected for use in this trial. Alemtuzumab is an approved treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis , and is considered to be the most effective immunomodulating for treatment of MS. The s elected dose is in accordance with literature recommendations and clinical practice . For more details see the current versio n of the SmPCs. 5.2.2 STUDY ARM A (HSCT): Mobilization and peripheral blood stem cell harvesting Priming chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide) is included in the standard study mobilization regimen to enhance mobilization while maintaining disease control and to preve nt a potential flare, which may be a consequence of granulocyte colony stimulating factor therapy alone36. Day 1: Cyclophosphamide 2.0 g/m2 body surface area will be given iv in 1000 ml of standard glucose (glucose 50mg/ml) over 60 minutes. The cyclophosphamide dose is highly emetogenic, and an appropriate, combined antiemetic regime should be used37-39. A forced diuresis with a desired minimum volume of 150 ml urine/hour is obtained by infusion of at least 3000 ml of normal saline iv supplemented with 20 ml furosemide/1000 ml fluid, and complement ary doses of 20 mg furosemide iv to obtain the required urinary output. To further protect the urothelium (prevent hemorrhagic cystitis) , uromitexan (Mesna®) 800 mg/m2 is applied 15 minutes prior to the cyclophosphamide infusion, as well as 3, 6 and 9 hours after start of the cyclophosphamide infusion. Since neurogenic bladder with delayed emptying is common, a foley catheter is placed in patients with a history of urin e retention. Days 5-10: Granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( filgrastim) 5 mcg/kg body weight /day sc in the evening. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) or mild oral opioids are acceptable as on demand medication against filgrastim - associated pain in the skelet on and soft tissues. Day 1 1 and until apheresis is discontinued: Granuloc yte colony stimulating factor ( filgrastim) 5 mcg/kg body weight x 2 sc/day. Daily measurements of CD34+ counts in peripheral blood. Apheresis begins according to local routines, and continues until a minimum of 2 x 3.0 x 106 CD 34+ cells/kg body weight is obtained. The stem cell graft is processed and stored in accordance with local routines and national regulations. Lymphocyte depletion of the stem cell graft is not yet recommended b y the study officials."

Interval between mobilization and conditioning In order to avoid cumulative cardiac toxicity from cyclophosphamide, a minimum of three weeks should separate administration of cyclophosphamide for mobilization and for conditioning. A maximum interval of eight weeks is recommended. Conditioning regime ( HSCT days -5 to -1) and reinfusion of the stem cell product ( HSCT day 0) HSCT d ays -5 to -2: Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day will be given iv in 1000 ml of standard glucose (glucose 50mg/ml) over 4 hours. The cyclophosphamide dose is highly emetogenic, and an appropriate, combined antiemetic regime shoul d be used37-39. A forced diuresis of minimum 150 ml urine/hour should be obtained by infusion of at least 3000 ml normal saline iv supplemented with 20 mg of furosemide per 1000 ml fluid, and complementary doses of 20 mg furosemide iv to obtain the required urinary output to preserve the kidney function . To prevent hemorrhagic cystitis, r epeated doses of uromitexan (Mesna®) 30mg/kg over 30 minutes in 100 ml normal saline (NaCl 9%) are given 30 minutes prior to cyclophosphamide infusi on, as well as 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 hours after start of each cyclophosphamide infusion, respectively. A foley catheter should be placed in patients with a history of urine retention. HSCT d ays -5 to -1: Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG -rabbit, Thymoglobuline®) 0.5 mg/kg body weight will be given iv on day –5, 1.0 mg ATG -rabbit/kg will be given iv on day -4, and 1.5 mg ATG -rabbit /kg will be given iv on days - 3,-2 and -1 over 10 hours in 500 ml of normal saline (NaCl 0.9%). Due to the risk of an anaphylactic rea ction, premedicate with methylprednisolone 500 mg iv and an oral antihistamine of local choice 60 minutes prior to each ATG test dose and subsequent ATG infusion. An ATG test dose (1 ml of the ATG infusion) should always be administered at least 10 minute s before initiating the ATG infusions . Patients are instructed to remain in the ward during the entire infusion period, and an available a naphylaxis emergency kit is mandatory. An in -line 0.22 m filter should be applied for the ATG administration. Ulcus pro phylaxis should also be applied during high dose steroid therapy. HSCT d ay 0: Reinfusion of a minimum of 3,0 x 106 CD 34+ cells/kg body weight. Pr emedication according to local routines; oral acetoaminophen 1000 mg po and an oral antihistamine are recommended. Additional compulsory supportive therapy: Prednisolone: Declining doses of Prednisolone are used to prevent ATG -associated serum sickness: • HSCT d ays 0, +1 and +2: Prednisolone 60 mg x 1 po • HSCT d ays +3 and +4: Prednisolone 40 mg x 1 po • HSCT d ays +5 and +6: Prednisolone 20 mg x 1 po • HSCT d ays +7 and +8: Prednisolone 10 mg x 1 po. • If fever or other signs of serum sickness: A supplement of metyl predisolone (Solu -medrol) 250 mg iv (followed by 125 mg iv/day for 2 days) is considered in addition to broad spectrum antibiotics if consistent fever >380C. Fever or other reactions may also result in neurological deteriation in MS - patients, and thus shou ld be immediately addressed according to site routines36. Antibiotic prophylaxis36: • Gram -negativ e prophylaxis according to local standard, starting the latest 2 days after stem cell reinfusion (HSCT Day +2) • HSCT d ay -5 and until 6 months after transplantation: Valaciclovir 500 mg x 2 po. • HSCT d ay +2 and until 3 months after transplantation: Flukonazol 200 mg x 1 po."

Therapy of fever and suspected or documented infections: Microbiological specimens (blood cultures, urine and nasopharyngeal aspiration viral tests) should immediately be obtained if fever o r other signs of infection (may be subtle in neutropeni a), followed by prompt inititation of broad -spectrum iv antibiotic medication according to site routines. CMV and/or EBV reactivations (indicated by PCR results and/or clinical signs) should also be preemptively treated according to national /local/study si te policies and protocols36. ATG-associated serum sickness (see above) or emerging bone marrow regeneration should also be considered and dealt with in febrile episodes, but should not exclude or replace broad spectrum iv antibiiotics for suspe cted or documented infections. Blood product transfusions: Platelets and erythrocyte transfusions should be administered according to study site policies and protocols. Blood products should be irradiated36. Cyclophosphamide -associated hemorrhagic cystitis: Hemorrhagic cystitis should be suspected if hematuria and/or painful miction (urination) during or following cyclophosphamide infusion s. Suspected hemorrhagic cystitis should be investigated and treated according to transplant study site procedures. Revaccination schedule : Revaccinations should be performed after HSCT . Recommendations provided in Appendix B should be adjusted at each study site according to national guidelines. 5.2.3 STUDY ARM B (alemtuzumab): Premedication ( prior to every alemtuzumab infusion) : a. Cetirizine 10 mg po or similar oral antihistamine b. Methylprednisolone 1000mg iv in 100ml 0.9% saline prior to alemtuzumab infusion c. Acetaminophen 1000 mg po prior to alemtuzumab infusion Alemtuzumab 12 mg iv daily on 5 consecutive days at first alemtuzumab treatment cycle, followed by 3 consecutive days at the seco nd alemtuzumab treatment cycle 12 mon ths later. Around 3% of patients treated with alemtuzumab experience serious infusion reactions. The patient should be monitored with measurement of blood pressure and pulse every hour during infusion. After each infusion with alemtuzumab, the patient sho uld be observed for 2 hours for infusion associated reactions. Resources for the management of anaphylaxis or serious reactions should be available. The infusion should be stopped if any of the following occur: Hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 or a decrease of >10mmHg from baseline if baseline systolic blood pressure <90), Persistent high grade fever, oxygen desaturation, dyspnoea, back pain, pruritus, restlessness, or other subjective complaints). The most common i nfusion reactions could be treated as follows: Hypotension: Isoplex 500mls followed by 0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus 1L IV over 30 minutes. Rigors: chlorphenamine 10mg IV. Fever: paracetamol 1g by mouth. Dyspnoea, back pain, pruritus, O2 desaturation: 100% Oxygen through a non -rebreathing mask followed by hydrocortisone 100mg IV and chlorphenamine 10mg IV. Consider 0.5ml epinephrine (adrenaline) 1:1000 intramuscularly. If infusion reaction symptoms completely resolve and the patient is back to baseline, re -challenge with alemtuzumab but at a slower infusion rate, doubling the infusion time. Antiviral prophylaxis: Acyclovir 200mg po twice daily, beginning at the first day of alemtuzumab infusion and continuing for 1 month after each alemtuzumab treatment cycle."

Extended monitoring duration when indicated. 5.3 Duration of therapy The planned duration of therapy is stated in section 5. 2 Duration of therapy may d eviate from what is planned if an intercurrent illness effect s the safety of the patient, the ability to administer treatment , or the primary study endpoints . Fertility measures implemented for women of childbearing potential may postpone initiation of stem cell mobilization for up to 2-4 weeks . 5.4 Premedication and monitoring Premedication and washout will be performed as indicated in section 5.1 5.5 Concomitant medication, restrictions and rescue therapy Concomitant medication related to MS study treatment is stated in section 5. 2. All other concomitant medication (incl. vitamins, herbal preparation and other “over -the-counter” drugs) used by the patient will be recorded by the Investigator in the patient’s medical record and eCRF. Herbal preparations should be avoided for the last month before start of treatment procedures (uncertainties regarding possible side effects on treatment medications and stem cells). Pain medication other than acetaminophen and po opioids should not be used 2 weeks prior to stem cell mobilization due to possible adve rse effects o n stem cell function by a variety of “pain killers”. 5.5.1 Restricted therapy Prohibited therapy in both study treatment arms: Natalizumab, fingolimod, dimetylfumurat, glatiramer acetate, interferon beta medication s, teriflunomide, and alemtuzumab if administered outside the study . In Arm A which includes cyclophosphamide, concomitant administration and dosages of agents inhibiting or inducing CYP450 may alter the treatment effect. The risk for CYP450 induction or inhibition must be carefully consi dered prior to or during concomitant administration of known inducing and inhibiting agents , including; amiodarone, aprepitant, bupropion, ciprofloksacin, azoles (i ncluding flukonazol in daily doses >150 mg) , klaritromycin , prasugrel, sulfonamide s, telit romycin, rifampicin, fenobarbital, karbamazepin, fenytoin, St. John’s Wort and systemic corticosteroids. MS-relapse treatment with a 5 -day course of iv or per oral methylprednisolone is permitted by the study protocol. Apart from immunomodulatory MS treatment (see section 5.1 for wash out), n o cytotoxi c or immunosuppressive treatments or drugs other than the study medications can be used during the last six months prior to entry or during the trial, and the patient starting such medication will be exclude d. 5.5.2 Rescue medication, emergency procedures and additional treatments During the study period, and in particular after recent discharge from hospital, the patient should without hesitation contact the study site or a local emergency ward if signs of infecti ons or any other sign of altered general condition. It is essential for optimal interpretation of the study results that t he patient s are informed to contact their regular neurologist or their study PI/co -PI within three days in the case of a suspect ed relapse (MS attack) .- The patient"
42,page_42,"Study: RAM -MS CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 20-Dec-2017 RAM -MS Version no. 4.1, 08-Dec-2017 Page 43 of 96 must undergo a neurological evaluation within 7 days from the onset of relapse symptoms . If the treating physician decides th at the patient has a possible relapse, the patient should without undue delay be referred for an unscheduled relap se visit at a defined study site including a quantitative neurological examination, EDSS scoring and MRI . If the relapse is considered to impede neurological function, the patient is treated with iv or oral methylprednisolone 500 or 1000 mg daily for 3 or 5 consecutive days according to local routines. Patients with aggressive attacks should be discussed with the CI/NC/PI before local initiation of high dose steroid treatment. 5.6 Drug compliance and accountability All study treatments are admi nistered as intravenous therapy. The study drug is administered by health care personnel and the patient is admitted to hospital during treatment. Compliance is therefore expected to be close to 100%. Distribution, return, accountability , batch numbers and destruction of the study drug must be logged and filed in the ISF. Internal procedures at the hospital may be followed if fulfilling GCP /GMP requirements. 5.7 Drug labeling , storage and supply The investigational product will have a label permanently affixed to the outside and will be labeled according with ICH G MP and national regulations, stating that the material is for clinical trial / investigational use only and should be kept out of reach of children. For detailed description of the label, pleas e refer to the ISF. Study medication must be stored under recommended storage conditions indicated on the label. A temperature log must be maintained by the investigator/pharmacist to make certain that the drug supplies are stored at the correct temperatur e. The product s have a marketing authorization, is routinely ordered by the pharmacy and will be dispensed from the pharmacy's own stock . 5.8 Subject numbering and assignment to treatment groups Each subject is identified in the study by a unique subject num ber that is assigned through the eCRF system. When a subject signs the Informed Consent Form he/she is considered enrolled into the study as a screened patient . Patients not eligible for randomization after screening will be registered as Screen ing Failures in the eCRF. Once assigned the subject number cannot be reused for any other subject. 5.9 Fertility related procedures Due to the chemotoxicity of cyclophosphamide, cou nselling regarding fertility conserving measures (at Visit 3) is recommended for both females and males randomized to the study . Fertility conserving measures (i.e. sperm, oocyte and/or ovarian storage) are performed according to national guidelines and must be completed prior to start of stem cell mobilization at Visit 4.1 ."

The patient should be given ample time to ready through and consider participation in the study before signing the Informed Consent Form. No trial procedures should be done unless the patient has in writing consented to taking part in the trial. The study will consist of the following periods; screening, pre-transplantation/evaluation, randomization, treatment, an d follow -up phase s. All trial related procedures at selected visits will be done according to the Flow Chart with footnotes, and per det ails provided in the section s below. All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart, and if a visit is re -scheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit date schedu le (one month is defined as 28 calendar day s). 6.1.1 Screening No trial procedures should be done unless the patient has consented to taking part in the trial. Screening (Visit 1) of the patients will take place at participating study sites. Once the patient has consented to trial participation, he/she is considered to be enrolled in the trial and have started screening. The patient should be registered in the enrol lment log and in the eCRF as a screened patient. All eligibility criter ia should be assessed together with relevant baseline parameters prior to study inclusion (inclusion/exclusion criteria). If the patient meets the entry criteria, Visit 2 should occur as soon as possible once it has been confirmed that the patient is eligi ble to continue. Patients who fail screening (i.e. fail to meet one or more of the inclusion criteria, and/or meet one or more of the exclusion criteria) following Visit 1 procedures should be registered as a screen ing failure in ViedocTM. If the patient does not meet the entry criteria, the patient will be followed and treated according to national/ local clinical treatment guidelines. 6.1.2 Randomization visit Randomization will occur at Visit 2 using eCRF after confirming that all inclusion criteria are still fulfilled, but no exclusion criteria are fulfilled. The randomization visit (Visit 2) can be performed as a Phone Visit if there are no clinical relevant changes for the patient since the screening visit (Visit 1). Adverse events and concomitant medicatio n should be documented and registered in the eCRF. For patients currently being treated with natalizumab, fingolimod, dimetylfumurat, glatiramer acetate, interferon beta-1a/1b , teriflunomide, or alemtuzumab, please refer to section 5.1 for details regardi ng washout of the immunomodulatory treatment s. 6.1.3 Pre-transplantation evaluation Arm A - Patients randomized to HSCT All patients should have a full physical examination at both pre -treatment visits (Visit 3). Comorbidities , concomitant medication , and any adverse events must be reported (see section 8) . Pre-transplantation evaluation : Before start of stem cell mobil ization and harvesting, pre-transplantation information (oral and written) and clinical evaluation should be performed by a transplant specialist/hematologist"

Critical organ tolerabilities for HSCT are evaluated by blood tests (h ematology, clinical biochemistry, liver tests, thyroid status, viral serology), chest X-ray, lung function tests (spirometry incl. DLCO), echo cardiography, and dental examination ( to exclude or eradicate potentially infectious oral foci prior to start of treatment ). Also , the patients should be offered fertility coun selling to decide whether fertility measures should be performed before start of stem cell mobilization. Minimum c riteria for respiratory and cardiac function s36 must be fulfilled;  FEV1/FVC > 60% of predicted after bronchodilator therapy  DLCO > 50% of predicted  Resting LVEF > 50 % If the transplant specialist/ hematologist find s that the patient is eligible for autologous HSCT preparations for ste m cell mobilization/harvesting can start. Patients not found eligible for HSCT after the pre -transplantation evaluation will be discontinued from study treatment and treated according to standard guidelines. Fertility related procedure s: Before start of treatment and/or treatment related procedures, all patients (men and female) should have blood sample s collected for fertility hormone status for long-term storage in Biobank Haukeland for future research. Fertility conserving measures according to individual preferences and in line with national guidelines must be completed prior to start of stem cell mobilization (Visit 4.1) . For male patients : collection of s perm for storage. For most female patients : start of hormone therapy for fertility conserving measures , followed by h arvesting and storage 2 -4 weeks later. Arm B - Patients randomized to alemtuzumab Patients randomi zed to alemtuzumab will not under go supplementing clinical pre -treatment visits after randomization (Visit 3 will therefore be omitted ), before return ing for Visit 4.1 to start study treatment . 6.1.4 Treatment and follow -up period Patient reported outcome forms (PRO s) should be filled in at the start of the visit, physical examination and laboratory assessments must be done prior to administ ration of any study drugs or start of study treatment . PROs will be available both in paper and electronic format. If any additional treatment is considered necessary for the patient’s welfare during th e treatment period it may be given at the investigators discretion (see section 5.5 for restricted medication). Arm A - Patients randomized to HSCT If the patient is considererd eligible for autologous HSCT (by pretransplantation evaluation) , procedures fo r stem cell mobilization/harvesting , conditioning and HSCT are i nitiated. Hospital stays I and II (outward setting in some study hospitals) : For stem cell mobilization most patient s will be hospitalized for 2(-3) days while rece iving cyclophosphamide and standard supportive medication for mobilization of stem cells . This is followed by daily subcutaneous injections of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (Filgrastim®) from Day 5 until finalized stem cell harvesting. On Day 10 or 11 the patient returns to the study hospital for stem cell harvesting. Details regarding dosing a nd administration of the mobiliz ation regime are provided in Section 5.2. Mobilization and harvesting procedures and any events that occur are registered on Visit 4.1 in the eCRF . In order to avoid cumulative cardiac toxicity from cycl ophosphamide, a minimum of 3 weeks should separate administration of cyclophosp hamide for mobilization and conditioning. A maximum inter val of 8 weeks is recommended ."

Detailed instructions on administration of study treatments during this stay are pro vided in Section 5.2 and in Appendix A (a schematic overview of the patient flow). The isolation period usually lasts for 5 -10 days. Routine blood sampling will be performed daily as part of the patient monitoring during the hospital stay III for condition ing, reinfusion and isolate period (3 weeks). Daily tests: Hgb, leucocyte count with differentials, thrombocyte count (2 times daily for 5 days while receiving ATG), CRP, creatinine, sodium, kalium. Three times a weeks: blood cross -match, ALP, GT, ASAT, AL AT. bilirubin (and supplementing liver tests on demand if suspected liver toxicity). Once a week: p -CMV and p -EBV PCRs. The patient is discharged from hospital according to local routines, but the patient should as a minimum have a reconstituted bone marro w function, be off parenteral antibiotics and other supplementary iv therapy and be capable of performing adequate daily activities of life. Procedures and any events that occur are registered on Visit 4. 2 in the eCRF. Short term follow -up after HSCT (post -transplantation control visits) : After discharge from hospital, weekly follow - up is required until Day +100 after HSCT for saf ety monitoring (blood test and consultation) and clinical care (see also section 7.1.8) . Weekly blood tests and consultations should be under the direct control of a transplant specialist or combined care between transplant specialist/hematologist and referring neurologist or a general practitioner when a patient is considered clinically stable by the transplant spe cialist (intervals may be extended by the transplant specialist after the first 6 weeks ). Monthly blood pregnancy tests are required. The first post -transplant study visit is performed at day +100 after HSCT at designated HSCT -study sites . According to the study design the HSCT day +100 visit is considered to “parallel” the 3 month s study visit in arm B (Visit 5). Long -term follow -up (study visits at HSCT /central study site(s) ): All patients will return for study follow -up visits , endpoint evaluation and collection of study data according to Flow Chart at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after Treatment day “0” (and after 30,36, 42,48, 54 and 60 months during the study extension) . Between study visits patients should have the following safety laboratory tests analyzed locally - Every third month (at least) : - Hematolo gy: HgB, leucocytes with cell differentials, thrombocytes - Clinical chemistry: serum sodium, potassium, bilirubin, CRP, creatinine - Thyroid gland: TSH, free T4 - Urine strip analysis - Monthly: - Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test (required only until 12 months after last administration of alemtuzumab An unscheduled visit should be performed i n case of abnormal findings indicating MS relapse or disability progression (as per protoco l definition s, see section 2.2), suspected treatment complication, any acute illness of undetermined cause, or at the discretion of the Investigator . Close communication between the patients and local hospital staf f involved in weekly/quarterly safety follow -up is crucial for timely identification and reporting of events in the study. Fertili ty measures : For women with fertility conserving measures prior to HSCT treatment, transvaginal ultrasound of ovaries will be performed at 1 year and 2 year follow -up visits (Visit 7 and 9) to investigate potential impact of cyclophosphamide on fertility. For men, sperm sampling wil l be performed at 1 year and 2 year follow -up visits (Visit 7 and 9) to investigate potential impact of cyclophosphamide on fertility."

Gynecological examination including HPV/cervical dysplasia screening annually . An unscheduled visit should be performed in case of abnormal findings indicating MS relapse, suspected treatment complication, any acute illness of undetermined cause, or at the discretion of the Investigator . Close communication betwe en the patients and local hospital staff involved in weekly/quarterly safety follow -up is crucial for timely identification and reporting of events in the study. In case the study extension will not be performed, patients in both study arms should be follo wed up long-term according to standard of care by their treating neurologist. For arm B this also includes the monthly laboratory tests until 48 months after the last alemtuzumab treatment cycle, as specified above in this section. 6.1.5 Unscheduled visits In addition to the scheduled study visits, patients may have unscheduled study visits due to a new, confirmed MS activity event (clinical relapse , disability progression or MRI findings per protocol definition s, see section 2.2), a suspected treatment complic ation, any acute illness of undetermined cause, for other reasons, or at the discretion of the Investigator. Data collected during unscheduled study visits will be recorded in the unscheduled visit eCRFs. Additional procedures and investigations should be performed as indicated by the clinical situation. Patients must be instructed to immediately report new neurological symptoms, re -occurring or worsening of previous symptoms to the Investigator. If a patient reports symptoms that may be consistent with relapse, an unscheduled study visit must be performed as soon as possible (whenever possible within 7 days of onset of the symptoms). 6.1.6 Withdrawal and e arly study discontinuation If a patient refuses to attend all originally planned study visits , but agrees with vital status assessment, the latter will be conducted preferably according to visit schedule as in the Flow Chart, but as a minimum at the 2 year visit (Visit 9), and at the 5 year visit (Visit 15) for the planned study extension."

For patients completing study per protocol, the last scheduled visit will be at 2 years follow -up, and for the extension study 5 years follow -up. 6.1.8 Switch to other therapy Patients may be offered treatment corresponding to the opposite study treatment arm or start other MS medication if they experience s ignificant new inflammatory disease activity (see Section 2.2) during the study treatment period. Significant inflammatory disease activity during the treatment period is a protocol -defined disease activity event ( refer to s ection 2.2), but must include bo th a relapse and protocol defined MR I activity and/or disability progression. Start of therapy corresponding to the treatment offered in the opposite study treatment arm will need to wait for 12 months after the latest alemtuzumab treatment or 12 months after conditioning in the HSCT treatment arm.Earlier rescue treatment should be discussed with the CI. A follow -up study visit (scheduled or unscheduled) prior to cross -over is required to assess the patients clinical status and safety parameters. 6.2 Procedures for discontinuation For patients who stop study treatment after Visit 4.1 (only applicable for arm B) , or who wishes to withdraw from further study participation, the following should be performed whenever possible: End of Study (EOS/EOXS) visit procedures including completion of PROs, physical examination, vital signs, neurological examination, MRI, recording of adverse events and concomitant medication, sampling of blood for safety laboratory parameters and biobanking, CSF and stool sample. Patients discontinuing study treatment should continue to follow the original visit schedule. 6.3 Laboratory tests Collection of biological material must be done at timepoints as specified in the Flow Chart. The local study site laboratory will be used for the analys es of hematology , biochemistry and serology specimens collected , sperm analysis ( at selected sites only and according to WHO standard) and for serum hCG pregnancy test. Biological material for biobanking will be collected and shipped to Biobank Haukeland for long -term storage. Details describing collection, processing, shipment and storage of samples are available in the ISF ."

Measures of new lesions, enlargement of existing lesions, the total lesion load, and changes in brain volume will be done at a central MRI reading site . Procedures for obtaining and reading of MRI images will be filed int the ISF. 7.1.2 Clinical MS relapse A relapse should without undue delay be confirmed by an assigned neurologist (PI or co -PI at a study site at a scheduled study visit (if a suspected relapse occurs within a few days before a scheduled visit) or at a supplementing, unscheduled study visit, including a full clinical neurological examination with EDSS scoring followed by MRI, preferably within 7 days from onset of symptoms. 7.1.3 Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Disability progression will be assessed using EDSS at timepoints indicated in the Flow Chart40. For assessment of EDSS, see Appendix C. 7.1.4 For individual patient s EDSS score s should preferably be assessed by the same neurol ogist (PI or co-PI) throughout the study. EDSS certification is compulsory for all study personnel performing EDSS scoring s at defined study visits , and copies of relevant certificate s should be placed in the ISF .Patient reported outcomes (PROs) Assigne d investigator s or other designated site -personnel should ensure that the patient has access to a quiet area at the study site where the patient can record her/his answers in the questionnaire s. If a patient cannot give or decide upon a response to a specific questions no response should be recorded. The study site i nvestigator or designated site -personnel should check that all items have been completed by the patient, but the patient response to each item should not be scrutini zed . Instructions to patients are included in the questionnaire s. EQ-5D-5L Health related quality of life will be assessed using the EQ -5D-5L (see Appendix D) according to the Flow Chart41. EQ-5D-5L is a standardised instrument to measure of health outco me. It is designed for self -completion by the patients41. The EQ -5D-5L self-report questionnaire essentially consists of 2 pages comprising:  the descriptive system (five dimensions of health; namely mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension comprises three levels (no problems, some/moderate problems/extreme problems).  the EQ -VAS (visual analogue scale) which records the patient’s self -rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 – 100) VAS."
49,page_49,"Study: RAM -MS CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 20-Dec-2017 RAM -MS Version no. 4.1, 08-Dec-2017 Page 50 of 96 In Norway, as a part of an extended QoL assessment and a health economic evaluation, the EQ -5D-5L quest ionnaire will be supplemented with questionnaire s regarding the overall contentment of the patient , employment status and participation in social life. Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS -29) is a 29 -item self -report measure comprising 20 items associated with a physical scale and 9 items associated with a psychological scale. Patients (or their proxies ) are asked about the impact of MS on day -to-day life in the last 2 weeks. All items have 5 response options from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). Each of the 2 scales are scored by adding up the responses across items, then converting to a 0 to 100 scale, where 100 indicates greater impact of disease on daily function (worse health). Reliability and validity evidence have been obtained in multiple samples of people with MS from disability levels of 0 to 9.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale. The MSIS -29 is responsive to intervention, with a change score of about 8 on the physical scale or about 6 on the psychological scale having moderate to high sensitivity and specificity for patients, indicating whether they had improved or not42. Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a method for evaluating fatigue in multiple sclerosis and other neurological conditions. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is designed to differentiate fatigue from clinical depression, since both share same symptoms. Essentially, the FSS involves answering a short questionaire that requ ests a rating of the patients’ subjective level of fatigue . 7.1.5 9-Hole Peg Test and Timed 25 -foot walk 9-HPT and T25FW are two out of three variables recommended as primary measures in the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC)43. 9-HPT is a quantitative measure for upper extremity function, whereas the T25FW is a quantitative measure for lower extremity function44. 7.1.6 The Brief International Cognitiv e Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) The BICAMS is a brief cognitive assessment that can be used also in study sites with staff members with no neuropsychological training45 The tests address specific cognitive deficits that are common in MS patients, and the scales were chosen also for their psychometric qualities (reliability, validity and sensitivity)46. Tests must be administered during daytime, in a standardized manner, and in a quiet room . The order of tests will be fixed: the Symbol Digit Modalities Test ( SDMT ),Brief Visuospatial Memory Test -Revised ( BVMT -R), and California Verbal Learning Test -II (CVLT -II). 7.2 Assessment of s afety and tolerability Safety will be monitored by the assessments described below and re ported AEs. Significant findings present prior to the signing of informed consent s must be included in the relevant medical history/ current medical condition page of the eCRF.

The first 2 mL will be used for routine analysis . The supernatant will be aliquoted into 8 x 500 µL and stored in -80⁰C in Biobank Haukeland. The cells will be fixed and stored at -80⁰C. Stool: A portion (approximately 10 g) of the first stool of the day will be collected , processed , split into 8 x 800 µL aliquotes and frozen at -80 °C in the biobank. *Sperm: Participants will be asked to abstain from ejaculation for 2 consecutive days and then to masturbate without lubricant into a glass specimen container. * Stem cell product: Approximately 1 mL of the stem cell product will be collected from patients treated at HUS. 7.3.3 Cerebrospinal fluid CSF a nalyses will include , but are not limited to, T cell receptor sequencing, B cell receptor sequencing, isoelectric focusing, quantification of neurofilament light chain levels (ELISA) and cytokines , proteomic study for potential other biomarkers for therape utic response , but also other analyses in the future for upcoming scientific purposes to better understand the nature of the MS disease and/or the human responses to the applied study treatments . 7.3.4 Fertility measures Sperm sampling will be performed at the 1 year and 2 year follow -up visits (Visit 7 and 9) to investigate potential impact of study treatment on male fertility. Specimen volume , consentration and pH will be measured. Specimens will also be inspected for motility and morphology . Transvaginal ultra sound will be performed to investigate potential impact of study treatment on female fertility. Fertility related hormones will be analyzed in male and female patients. 7.3.5 Microbiota analysis The microbiota of stools will be analysed by DNA extraction and purification, library preparation, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Other analyses might also be performed if new knowledge indicates scientific interest to better understand the nature of the MS disease and/or the human responses to the applied study treatments. 7.3.6 Blood cells To investigate characteristics of the treatment mechanisms and identify markers of therapeutic response , cells from whole blood will be collected p re- and post -treatment . Mass cytometry will be used to study immune reconstitution and immune ablation during treatment. Further , these cells will be used to sequence T -cell and B- cell receptor s. Immune monitoring will be performed in PBMCs, serum and CSF as recommended by EBMT24.

An aliquot of the graft sample will also be analyzed with various immunological analyses . 7.3.8 Analyses of p lasma for virus activation of IgG response Several studies have shown an association between first appearence (or relapse) of MS and high levels of humoral immune activation against Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) - in particular titers of EBV nuclear antigen -147; EBNA47. A putative mechanism fo r this relationship is ”molecular mimicry” , i.e. a cross activation of EBV peptides and human cellular epitopes. However, the role of EBV in MS is not confirmed, and an enhanced IgG reactivity could alternatively reflect EBV -specific antigenic exposure. EBV antibodies in serum from both groups of patients will be analyzed retrospectively. Plasma, routinely stored in the biobank at regular intervals (and at relapse), will be used for analyses of EBV antibodies. As controls, antibody titers against other viru ses with or without connection to CNS diseases will be analysed. 7.3.9 MRI MRI will be performed at regular intervals as part of the clinical effect evaluation as specified in the primary and secondary endpoints. Other MRI endpoints related to treatment effect may be added. 7.3.10 Proteomics Proteomics analyses are planned for the CSF samples in this project, and partially also for the plasma/serum samples (only targeted analyses). Global quantitative proteomics where as many as possible of the proteins in the CSF of all samples to be compared are identified and quantified will be used to get an overview of the proteins affected by the treatment. For the proteins of interest from these analyses, those affected by the treatment given, we will develop or establish target ed proteomics assays to enable absolute accurate quantification of up to 40 proteins in a multiplexed manner. These assays will be used to analyze new samples for verifying the initial findings and when verified they will serve as measurement of the affect ed biological processes in larger cohorts of various disease states and treatments to reflect patient disease status and potentially predict prognosis and treatment effect. 8 SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE). Each patient will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately should they manifest any signs or symptoms perceive d as potenti ally serious. The methods for collection of safety data are described below."
55,page_55,"Study: RAM -MS CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 20-Dec-2017 RAM -MS Version no. 4.1, 08-Dec-2017 Page 56 of 96 8.1 Definitions 8.1.1 Adverse Event (AE) An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationshi p with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not r elated to the medicinal (investigational) product. The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs. An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product or treatment which is noxious and unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product or treatment and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. Adverse reactions may arise from use of the medicinal product or treatment within or outside the terms of the marketing aut horisation or from occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authori sation include off -label use, overdose, misuse and abuse . If an abnormal laboratory value/vital sign are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign/symptom should be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign should be considered additional information that must be collected on the relevant eCRF. 8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse evente (SAE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence that:  Results in death  Is immediately life -threatening  Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Medical and scientific judgment is to be exercised in deciding on the seriousness of a case. Im portant medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the listed outcomes in the definitions above. In such situations, or in doubt ful cases, the case should be considered as serious. Hospitalization for administrative reason (for observation or social reasons) is allowed at the investigator’s discretion and will not qualify as serious unless there is an associated adverse event warranting hospitalization. A pre -planned hospitalization admission (i .e. elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of treatment ) for pre -existing condition , or hospitalization due to a MS -relapse is not considered to be a serious adverse e vent. 8.1.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction s are SAEs that are unexpected as defined in section 8.2 and possibly related to the investigational medicinal product(s)."
56,page_56,"Study: RAM -MS CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 20-Dec-2017 RAM -MS Version no. 4.1, 08-Dec-2017 Page 57 of 96 8.2 Expected adverse events To fulfill the regulatory requirement for expedited safety reporting, the Medical Officer appointed by the Sponsor evaluates whether a particular adverse event is a known side effect of the treatment or not. Reference documents for known side effects are the current versions of the SmPCs for alemtuzumab (Lemtrada®) , cyclophosphamide (Sendoxan ®), anti-thymocyte globulin e (ATG -rabbit, Thymoglobulin®) , uromitexan (Mesna®) . 8.3 Time Period for Reporting AE and SAE For each patient the standard time period for collecting and recording AE and SAEs will begin at signature of informed consent and continue until the day of the 2 year follow -up visit (and until year 5 for the planned extension visit) . If future funding allows the study extension to be performed, then AE reporting should be limited to SAEs and AEs related to study treatment during the extension period . During the course of the study , all AEs and SAEs will be proactively registered for each patient; events should be followed up to resolution, unless th e event is considered by the investigator to be unlikely to resolve due to the underlying disease. Every effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all events, even if the events continue after study discontinuation/ completion. 8.4 Recording of adverse events If the patient has experienced adverse event(s), the investigator will record the following information in the eCRF :  The nature of the event(s) described by the investigator in precise standard medical terminology (i.e. not necessarily the exact words used by the patient).  The duration of the event described in terms of event onset date and event ended data.  The intensity of the adverse event (mild, moderate, severe)  The Causal relationship of the event to the study medication , which should be ass essed as one of the following: Unrelated: There is not a temporal relationship to investigational product administration (too early, or late, or investigational product not taken), or there is a reasonable causal relationship between non -investigational product, concurrent disease, or circumstance and the AE. Unlikely: There is a temporal relationship to investigational product administration, but there is not a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. Possible: There is reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear. Probable: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. The event responds to dechallenge. Rechallenge is not required. Definite:"

It is importan t to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity , whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 8.1.2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered as severe nausea, but is not an SAE. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke, but would be an SAE. 8.5 Reporting procedure s 8.5.1 AEs and SAEs All adverse events and serious adverse events defined in section 8.1 will be registered in the patient's eCRF . SAEs must be reported within 24 hours after the site has become aware of the SAE. Every SAE must be documented by the investigator . By filling in seriousness criteria on the AE page in the eCRF the SAE form is recorded in the database, and notification sen t to the Medical Officer (at Sponsor). The initial report shall promptly be followed by detailed, written reports if necessary. The initial and follow -up reports shall identify the individual subjects by unique code numbers assigned to the latter. The Sponsor keeps detailed records of all SAEs reported by investigators , and performs an evaluation with respect to causality and expectedness. Based on, among other, SAE reports , the Sponsor will evaluate whether the study risk/benefit ratio associated with the study is changed. All participating study sites will be informed bimonthly of serious adverse events. 8.5.2 SUSARs Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs ) will be reported to the Competent Authority and Ethics Committee according to national regulation s. The following timelines should be followed: The sponsor will ensure that all relevant information about SUSARs that are fatal or life -threatening is recorded and reported as soon as possible to the Competent Authority and Ethics Committee in any case no later than seven (7) days after knowledge by the sponsor of such a case, and that relevant follow -up information is subsequently communicated within an additional eight (8) days. All other SUSARs will be reported to the Competent Authority and t he Ethics Committee as soon as possible but within a maximum of fifteen (15) days of first knowledge by the sponsor. SUSARs will be reported using the Danish Medicines Agency’s e -form for electronic reporting to the European Union (EU) medicines regulator y network. The e -form is available via the web -site www.laegemiddelstyrelsen.dk . 8.5.3 Exemption s to SAE reporting A list of serious adverse events that commonly occur in the trial population or are components of a trial endpoint are exempted from expedited reporting to regulatory agencies or ethics committees. These events are known cons equences of the underlying disease , and it is not possible, based on a single case to conclude that there is a reasonable poss ibility that these events are caused by the study treatment. Refer to current version of SmPCs for a list of SAEs exempted from expedited reporting to authorities."

The format will comply with national requi rements. 8.5.5 Clinical study report The adverse events and serious adverse events occurring within the study period will be discussed in the safety evaluation part of the Clinical Study Report. 8.6 Procedures in case of emergency The investigator is responsible f or assuring that procedures and expertise are available to cope with emergencies . A Medical Officer is available for clinical guidance. Contact details are provided in the ISF. 9 DATA MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING 9.1 Case report forms The Clinical Data Management System (CDMS) used for the eCRF in this study is ViedocTM. The setup of the study specific eCRF in the CDMS will be performed by the D epartment of clinical research support at Oslo Univerity Hospital. The eCRF system will be FDA Code of Federal Regulations 21 Part 11 compliant. The designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the eCase report forms (eCRF). The Investigator is responsible for assuring that data entered into the eCRF is complete, accurate, and tha t entry is performed in a timely manner. The electronic signature of the investigator will attest the accuracy of the data on each eCRF. If any assessments are omitted, the reason for such omissions will be noted on the eCRFs. Corrections, with the reason for the corrections will also be recorded. An online eLearning with detailed instructions incorporated is included in the CDMS. After database lock, the investigator will receive a digital copy of the subject data for archiving at the investigational site . 9.2 Source data In accordance with regulatory requirements the Investigator should prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents and study records. Source data are all information in original records and certified copies of original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents (original records or certified copies). Changes to the data should be trac eable (audit trail). Data reported on the eCRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must be explained. The medical records for each patient should contain information which is important for the patient’s safety and continued care, a nd to fulfill the requirement that critical study data should be verifiable."

The current medical history of the subject may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility for the study and the Investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any diagnostic tests. In this case the Investigator must retrieve previous medical records. Before providing any copy of patients’ source documents to the Spons or the Investigator must ensure that all patient identifiers (e.g. patients name, initials, address, phone number, social security number) have been properly removed or redacted to ensure patient confidentiality. 9.3 Study monitoring The Sponsor will monitor the conduct of the study by regular visits to study sites and by in-house data quality review. The Clinical Study Monitor will check the following:  Informed consent process  Reporting of adverse events and all other safety data  Adherence to protocol and treatment compliance"
60,page_60,"Study: RAM -MS CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 20-Dec-2017 RAM -MS Version no. 4.1, 08-Dec-2017 Page 61 of 96  Maintenance of required regulatory documents  Drug accountability  Facilities and equipments  Data completion on the eCRF s including source data verification (SDV). The Study Monitor will review the relevant eCRF s for accuracy and c ompleteness and will ask the site staff to adjust any discrepancies as required. A combination of on -site, remote and central monitoring will be implemented to direct focus and resources to the areas of greates t risk, which have the most potential impact on patient safety and data quality. Sponsor representatives (e.g. monitors, auditors) and/or competent authorities will be allowed access to source data for source data verification in which case a review of those parts of the hospital records relevant to the study will be required. 9.4 Confidentiality The investigator shall arrange for the secure retention of patient identification and code list. Patient files shall be kept for the maximum period of time permitted by each hospital. The study documentation (CR Fs, Site File s, etc) shall be retained and stored during the study and for at least 15 years after study closure , according to current legislation . All documentation re garding study drug s and the subject code list must be kept for 30 years after expiry date. All information concerning the study must be stored in a safe place inaccessible to unauthorized personnel. 9.5 Database management Data management will be performed by the Department of clinical research support at Oslo University Hospital. The Data management procedures will be performed in accordance with the department’s SOPs and ICH guidelines. The data management process will be described in the study specific data handling plan and the study specific data handling report after database closure. Data entered into the eCRF will be validated as defined in the data validation plan. Validation includes, but is not limited to, validity checks (e.g. range checks), consistency checks and customised c hecks (logical checks between variables to ensure that study data are accurately reported) for eCRF data. A majority of edit checks will be triggered during data entry and will therefore facilitate efficient ‘point of entry’ data cleaning. Data management personnel will perform both manual eCRF review and review of additional electronic edit checks to ensure that the data are complete, consistent and reasonable. The electronic edit checks will run continually throughout the course of the study and the issue s will be reviewed manually online to determine what action needs to be taken. Manual queries may be added to the system by clinical data management or study monitor. Clinical data managers and study monitors are able to remotely and proactively monitor th e patient eCRFs to improve data quality. All updates to queried data will be made by authorised study site personnel only , and all modifications to the database will be recorded in an audit trail. Once the queries have been resolved, eCRFs will be signed b y electronic signature Any changes to signed eCRFs will be approved and resigned by the Investigator. Adverse events and medical history will be coded from the verbatim description (Investigator term) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities MedDRA. Prior and concomitant medications and therapies will be coded according to the always latest version of ATC/DDD Index."
61,page_61,"Study: RAM -MS CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL 20-Dec-2017 RAM -MS Version no. 4.1, 08-Dec-2017 Page 62 of 96 Once the full set of eCRFs have been completed and locked, the Sponsor will authorise database lock and all electronic data will be sent to the designated statistician for analys es. Subsequent changes in the database will be restricted to written agreement between HUS and Department for clinical research support at Oslo University Hospital, Norway . The data will be stored in a dedic ated and secured area at HUS . Data will be stored in a de -identified manner, where each study participant is recognisable by his/her unique trial subject number. The data will be stored until 30 years after archiving of the Clinical Study Report . 10 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS 10.1 Determination of sample size The sample size for the study was estimated on the basis of previous studies on the comparators. After two years of follow -up, the proportion of NEDA after HSCT was 80 % in an observational study17, while it was 32 % in a randomized trial after treatment with alemtuzumab3. The proportion of NEDA after HSCT is in this study conservatively predicted to be 6 4 %, repre senting a double percentage of NEDA compared to 32 % for alemtuzumab. A χ2 test was used t o determine the sample size using a type 1 error rate of 0.05 . A sample size of 50 patients per treatment group would give a 87 % power to detect th is predicted difference while assuming a dropout rate of 10 %. In a randomized RRMS treatment trial , the dropout rate was < 10 % in the alemtuzumab treatment group3. If there, for any reason, is a dropout rate of more than 10% in one of the treatment arms after randomization, but before first treatment, 10 additional patients will be recruited to the study and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatment arms. This volume of patients is expected to be reached within 2 years after start of patient inclusion, based on the incidence rate of RRMS in Sweden/Denmark/Norway , which is approximately 1500 patients per year, and the current yearly rate of HSCT treatment of RRMS in Scandinavia using current (more narrow) indication crit eria: approximately 50 patients6 10.2 Randomization 10.2.1 Allocation - sequence generation Eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio between the two t reatment arms, using a computer randomisation procedure stratified by age, sex and country . The randomisation will be blocked within each stratum. Details of block size and allocation sequence generation will be provided in a separate document unavailable to those enrol ling patients or assign ing treatment s. 10.2.2 Allocation - procedure to randomize a patient The computer -generated randomi zed allocation sequence will be imported into the eCRF system and made available to the investigator (and sub -investigator if authorized by the principal investigator). The allocation will not be available until the patient has signed the informed consent form and deemed eligible to participate in the study. That is, authorized personnel will only know the allocation of included patients, but not for future patients."

Patients that withdraw from the study for any reason at any stage after randomization will stil l be included in the ITT analyses. - Per-protocol (PP) population: Includes all patients who adhere to the protocol. Only subjects with important protocol violations (IPVs) for efficacy will be excluded from the PP population. These IPV definitions will inc lude consideration of important violation criteria, treatment non -compliance, treatment dispensing errors and prohibited concomitant medication. - Safety population: Includes all subjects who have received at least one dose of study medication. Subjects who withdraw from the study will be included in the safety analysis. A list of withdrawn subjects, preferably with the reasons for withdrawal, will be made. All efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT population. In addition, the PP population will be used in sensitivity analyses to evaluate the influence of protocol violations on the results from the ITT analyses. 10.4 Planned analyses Prior to the main statistical analysis, the data base will be locked for further entering or altering of data. A separa te statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide further details on the planned statistical analyses. The SAP will be finalized, signed and dated prior to database lock. The treatment allocation will be revealed after the database lock and used in the stati stical analysis. There is no formally planned interim analysis . Deviation from the original statistical plan will be described and justified in the Clinical Study Report. Amendments to plan can be done until day of D atabase lock. 10.5 Statistical analysis 10.5.1 Prim ary analysis NEDA will be defined as no protocol defined disease activity events during follow -up, as specified in section 2.2. The proportion of NEDA after 96 weeks in the HSCT group and the alemtuzumab group will be compared using a univariable logistic regression model , conducted as an ITT analysis. The proportion of NEDA in each treatment arm with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), the p -value for the difference in proportions and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval ( CI) for NEDA a ccording to treatment with HSCT compared to alemtuzumab will be presented. If the odds of NEDA in the HSCT group is signicantly higher compared to the odds of NEDA in the alemtuzumab group in this model, it will be concluded that HSCT has demonstrated a superior effect on NEDA compared to alemtuzumab. The s tatistical test used will be based on a two-sided hypothesi s. Patients lost to follow -up will be excluded from the anal ysis of primary outcome. To assess the robustness of the ITT analysis, two sensitivity analyses will be conducted. First, the analysis above will be repeated in the PP population to evaluate the influence of protocol violations. Secondly, if there is imba lance in any of the stratification variables in the treatment arms, these covariates will be include in separate multivariable logistic regression models as independent variables to evaluate the in fluence of these on the results."
