To be determined. Objectives The primary objective of the study is to estimate the objective response rate (ORR) for metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (Group 1) or unresectable locally advanced BCC (Group 2), according to central review, when treated with cemiplimab monotherapy in patients who have progressed on Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitor (HHI) therapy, or were intolerant of prior HHI therapy. The secondary objectives for both Group 1 and Group 2 are to:  Estimate ORR according to investigator review  Estimate the duration of response, progression -free survival (PFS) by central and investigator review, and overall survival (OS)  Estimate the complete response (CR) rate by central review  Assess the safety and tolerability of cemiplimab  Assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of cemiplimab (at select sites only)  Assess the immunogenicity of cemiplimab  Assess the impact of cemiplimab on quality of life using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cance r Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ -C30) and Skindex -16 The exploratory objectives (for Group 2 only) are to explore the pharmacodynamic effects of cemiplimab in tumor biopsies obtained at baseline, during treatment, and at progression in BC C patients treated with cemiplimab, and to assess predictive potential and correlation to clinical response for biomarkers of interest including but not limited to:  Tumor RNA expression  Number and distribution of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, T regulatory cells, and tissue permitting, other subtypes such as B cells, myeloid -derived cells, natural killer [NK] cells, etc.)  Expression levels (mRNA and/or protein) of programmed death ligand 1(PD -L1), glucocorticoid -induced T NFR family related gene (GITR), and lymphocyte activation gene -3 (LAG -3), and possibly other check -point modulators  Mutations in known oncogenes and potential tumor neoantigens  Tumor mutational burden VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"
20,page_20,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 21 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL Study Design This is a phase 2, non -randomized, 2 -group, multi -center study of cemiplimab at a 350 mg dose administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) in patients with advanced BCC who experienced progression of disease on HHI therapy or were intolerant of prior HHI therapy. The study will have 2 grou ps. Group 1 is for patients with metastatic BCC. Group 2 is for patients with unresectable locally advanced BCC. All patients will undergo screening procedures to determine eligibility within 28 days prior to the initial administration of cemiplimab. The re is no randomization or placebo control. After a screening period of up to 28 days, patients will receive up to 93 weeks of treatment. Each patient will receive a 350 mg Q3W dose of cemiplimab IV. The infusion time for cemiplimab is approximately 30 min utes (± 10 minutes). Tumor assessments will be made at the end of each treatment cycle, 5 treatment cycles of 9 weeks followed by 4 treatment cycles of 12 weeks). Extensive safety evaluations will occur on day 1 of each cycle, with routine safety evaluat ions to be conducted at each cemiplimab dosing visit. A patient will receive treatment until the 93 -week treatment period is complete, or until disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or confirmed CR. Patients with confirmed CR after a minimum of 48 weeks of treatment may elect to discontinue treatment and continue with all relevant study assessments (eg, efficacy assessments). Patients who discontinue study treatment due to PD should return to the clinic 30 days (range: 28 days to 42 days) after the last study treatment to complete the end-of-study (EOS) assessments. After the EOS visit, patients with PD should be followed for survival status until death, loss to follow up, or study termination by the sponsor. Study Duration After a screening period of up to 28 days, patients will receive up to 93 weeks of treatment. After the end of study visit, there is a follow -up period consisting of periods of 28 days. Patients should be followed for survival status until death , loss to follow up, or study termination by the sponsor. Population Sample Size: Approximately 137 adult patients (53 in Group 1 and 84 in Group 2) are expected to be enrolled. Target Population: Patients with metastatic (Group 1) or unresectable locally advanced (Group 2) BCC who experienced progression of disease on HHI therapy, or were intolerant of prior HHI therapy. Treatments Study Drug Dose/Route/Schedule: Cemiplimab at 350 mg administered IV over 30 minutes (± 10 minutes) Q3W for up to 93 weeks VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"
21,page_21,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 22 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL Endpoints Primary: The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the ORR as determined by central review. The ORR will be assessed separately for patients with metastatic BCC (Group 1) or unresectable locally advanced BCC (Group 2):  For patients in Group 1 (metastatic BCC), Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 will be used to determine ORR. Clinical response criteria may be used for patients with externally visible target lesions if all metastatic lesions are not measurable by RECIST (as may occur in patients with bone -only metastases).  For patients in Group 2 (unresectable locally advanced BCC), clinical criteria will be used to determine ORR. Composite response criteria will be used for patients with lesions that are measurable by both clinical response criteria and RECIST 1.1. The secondary endpoints are:  Duration of response  PFS  OS  CR rate  Change in scores of patient -reported outcomes in the EORTC QLQ -C30 and the Skindex -16  Adverse events (AEs)  Concentrations of cemiplimab in serum  Anti-cemiplimab antibodies Secondary: Exploratory: The following exploratory analyses are planned:  Associations between tumor non -synonymous mutational burden at baseline and efficacy of cemiplimab  Pharmacodynamic changes, comparing baseline and on -treatment biopsies: o Changes in tumor mRNA expression o Changes in number of TILs (CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, T regulatory cells, and tissue permitting, other subtypes such as B cells, myeloid -derived cells, NK cells, etc.) and descriptive change in distribution of TILs in respect to tumor tissue and stroma o Change in expression levels (mRNA and/or protein) of PD -L1, GITR, and LAG -3, and possibly other check -point modulators o Change in number and type of genetic mutations in known oncogenes and potential tumor neoantigens Procedures and Assessments Tumor imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and digital medical photography (for externally visible lesions) will be performed to measure tumor burden and to characterize the efficacy profile of study treatments using response criteria.

Page 23 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL Physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, and recording of AEs and concomitant medications will be performed to ensure patient safety and to characterize the safety pr ofiles of study treatments. Other assessments will include:  Blood samples for PK  Blood samples to assess anti -cemiplimab antibodies  Tumor biopsies  Biomarkers  Quality of life assessments Statistical Plan In order to describe objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), the data cut for primary efficacy analysis will allow responding patients to be followed from onset of response for at least 6 months. The primary analysis for each group will be statistically independent. For Group 1, 50 patients are required to provide at least 85% power to reject a null hypothesis of an ORR of 15% at a 2 -sided significance level of 5% if the true ORR is 34%. For Gro up 2, 80 patients are required to provide at least 85% power to reject a null hypothesis of an ORR of 20% at a 2 -sided significance level of 5% if the true ORR is 35%. Given the sample sizes above, the non -clinically meaningful ORR of 15% for Group 1 will be excluded using the lower limit of 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) if the observed ORR is 28.0% or more; ie, the ORR for Group 1 is significantly different from 15%. The non -clinically meaningful ORR of 20% for Group 2 will be excluded using the l ower limit of 95% CI if the observed ORR is 30.0% or more; ie, the ORR for Group 2 is significantly different from 20%. The sample sizes will be further increased by 5% to account for patients who withdraw prematurely from the study. Hence, the total sam ple sizes will be 53 patients for Group 1, and 84 patients for Group 2, for a total of 137 patients. The primary endpoint for efficacy analyses is the ORR as determined by RECIST version 1.1 for visceral lesions or by modified WHO criteria for skin lesions or by the composite response criteria for patients with both visceral and skin lesions. The ORR assessment for the primary analysis will be performed by an independent central review committee. The investigator -assessed ORR will be considered as a second ary analysis. Efficacy analyses of Group 1 and Group 2 will be independent of each other. The primary analyses of efficacy for Group 1 and Group 2 are based on the exact binomial CI approach, ie, whether or not the lower limit of 2 -sided 95% CI will exclud e a historical control ORR that is not deemed clinically meaningful. The secondary analyses of efficacy as measured by duration of response, PFS, and OS will be summarized by median and its 95% CI using the Kaplan -Meier method. An interim analysis for Gro up 1 will be performed at the time of the planned efficacy analysis for Group 2. The quality of life of patients will be repeatedly measured by the EORTC QLQ -C30 and Skindex -16 at day 1 of each treatment cycle.

Clinical Characteristics and Current Management of Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignancy in the United States (US), with an estimated incidence of over 3 million, and UV exposure is the major risk factor ( Wu 2013 ). Accurate incidence numbers and mortality estimates are not available because the disease is not tracked in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. However, data from prospective studies suggest that the incidence of BCC in the US has doubled in the last 2 decades (Wu 2013 ). Basal cell carcinoma incidence also appears to be increasing slightly in European Union (EU) nations, with approximately 50 to 90 new patients per 100,000 individuals annually in EU countries ( Madan 2010 ). The most common clinical subtype is nodular BCC. Less common clinical subtypes are superficial, morphoeic (fibrosing), and fibroepithelial. Most patients are cured by surgery, but a small percentage of pati ents develop unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. The American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for BCC is the same as that for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), but is felt to be of limited clinical utility in BCC due the lower metastatic potential for this disease ( Porceddu 2015 ). Virtually all BCCs are characterized by aberrant signaling of the hedgehog signaling pathway, most commonly due to sporadic loss -of-function mutation in the gene encoding protein patched homologue (PTCH), a tumor suppressor. A PTCH mutation results in loss of patched -mediated inhibition of the G -protein coupled receptor Smoothened (SMO), thereby enhancing downstream signaling that results in uncontrolled cellular prolifera tion ( Sekulic 2016 ). A small percentage of BCCs arise in the context of the autosomal dominant disorder Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), also known as Gorlin Syndrome, in which patients carry a germline mutation in PTC H that results in de -repression of SMO ( Athar 2014 ). Recognition of the oncogenic role of SMO in BCC led to the development of vismodegib and sonidegib, orally available inhibitors of SMO, generally referred to as Hedgehog Inhibitor s (HHIs). ERIVANCE was a non -randomized phase 2 study that led to regulatory approval of vismodegib in the US, EU, and several other countries, for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic BCC. Vismodegib yielded objective response rates (ORRs) o f 30% and 43% in metastatic and unresectable locally advanced BCC, respectively, in the original report ( Sekulic 2012 ). At the 12 - month update, median durations of response were 7.6 months for metastatic BCC and 9.5 months for loca lly advanced BCC ( Sekulic 2015 ). The largest prospective safety experience with vismodegib was the STEVIE (SafeTy Events in VIsmodEgib) study, which enrolled BCC patients in 36 countries to receive vismodegib 150 mg/day ( Basset -Seguin 2015 ). Among 499 evaluable patients (468 locally advanced, 31 metastatic), median duration of exposure was 36.4 weeks. The most common adverse events (AEs) were muscle spasms (64%), alopecia (62%), dysgeusia (54%), and weight l oss (33%). Most AEs were grade 1 or grade 2, but 22% of patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs). Sonidegib, another orally available HHI, also has received regulatory approval, at the dose of 200 mg per day, for unresectable locally advanced BC C, based on demonstration of ORR of 43% (18 responses among 42 patients) in this population ( Migden 2015 ). The most common AEs at VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

Page 29 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL the approved dose were muscle spasms (49%), alopecia (43%), and dysgeusia (38%). For BCC patients wh o progress on vismodegib, subsequent treatment with sonidegib appears to be inactive (Danial 2016 ). There is no approved agent for BCC in patients who experienced progression of disease on HHI therapy, or who are intolerant of prio r HHI therapy. 1.2. Cemiplimab, an Anti -PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody Under chronic stimulation, T cells lose proliferative and effector function capacity, often due to signal down -modulation via the increased expression of proteins such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1), an inhibitory checkpoint receptor of the CD28 receptor family. Binding of programmed cell death ligand (PD -L1 or PD -L2), which can be expressed on tumor cells or other immune cells, to PD -1 imparts an inhibitory signal to the T cell, thus d own modulating the anti-tumor T -cell response. The largest clinical experiences with PD -1 inhibition are with the monoclonal antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Blockade of the PD -1 is an effective and well tolerated approach to stimulating the immune response, and has achieved therapeutic advantage against various human cancers, including melanoma, renal cell cancer (RCC), and non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ( Postow 2015 ). Inhibition of PD -1 can be associated with a wide ra nge of immune - related AEs, including pneumonitis, dermatologic toxicities (including rash, pruritus, and vitiligo), nephritis, hepatitis, diarrhea, colitis, ocular toxicities (including uveitis), endocrine disorders (including hypophysitis, thyroid dysfunc tion, and diabetes), and neurologic toxicities ( Spain 2016 ). Cemiplimab is a high -affinity, fully human, hinge -stabilized IgG4P antibody directed to the PD -1 receptor that potently blocks the interaction of PD -1with its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. In syngeneic tumor models in immunocompetent mice humanized for PD -1, the antitumor activity of cemiplimab delivered as a monotherapy against a mouse colon adenocarcinoma tumor line is similar to that observed with the anti -PD-1 monoclonal a ntibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab generated in -house, based on the publicly available genetic sequences (unpublished data). The first -in-human (FIH) protocol of cemiplimab (R2810 -ONC -1423; NCT02383212) evaluates the safety of cemiplimab as monotherapy at different dose levels and in combination with selected other anti -tumor agents that may augment the potency and durability of an anti -tumor immune response. The initial clinical experience with dose escalation cohorts (n = 60 patients) indicates that c emiplimab has generally been well tolerated ( Papadopoulos 2016 ). There were no dose - limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the dose escalation cohorts. The most common treatment -related AEs were fatigue (n=17 [28.3%]), arthralgia (n=7 [11. 7%]), and nausea (n=7 [11.7%]). Eight treatment -related AEs of grade ≥3 were observed: anemia in 2 cases (3.3%), and 1 (1.7%) case each of lymphopenia, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and cognitive diso rder with anti -HuD associated paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis. Objective responses were observed in 18% of patients, including 1 patient with metastatic BCC (see Section 3.2.1 ). The phase 1 experience supports a 3 mg/kg cemiplimab intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks as dose for further study (see Section 3.2.3 ). Libtayo® (cemiplimab) has received marketing authorization an d is now approved in the United States (US) , Europe, Canada, and Brazil for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or patients with locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation .

Hypothesis Basal cell carcinomas have a high mutational burden that encodes neoantigens for presentation to effector T (T eff) cells. Therefore, T eff cell responses against BCC will be unleashed by blockade of the PD -1 checkpoint with cemiplimab, achieving high ORR. 3.2. Rationale 3.2.1. Rationale for Clinical Study of Cemiplimab in Advanced BCC Several lines of evidence suggest that inhibition of the PD -1 checkpoint could be clinically advantageous for patients with advanced BCC. First, the mutational burden in BCC is among the highest of any human malignancy ( Jayaraman 2014 , Chalmers 2016 , Bonilla 2016 ). Tumor types with high mutational burden are generally more responsive to PD -1 blockade than tumors with low mutational burden, and this is thought to be due to generation of neoantigens that can be recognized by T eff (Le 2015 , McGranahan 2016 , Rizvi 2015 ). Second, solid organ transplant patients have an approximately 10 -fold increased risk of BCC, suggesting that immune surveillance is relevant in thi s disease ( Euvrard 2003 ). Third, other immune modulators have activity against BCC. The Toll -Like Receptor -7 (TLR -7) agonist imiquimod is an approved therapy for superficial BCC ( Gollnick 2008 ). There is a case report of a BCC response to ipilimumab, an inhibitor of cytotoxic T -lymphocyte associated protein 4 ( Mohan 2016 ). In a recent case report, disease stabilization of a previously progressing metastatic BCC was achieved with off-label administration of pembrolizumab ( Winkler 2016 ). In the ongoing FIH study of cemiplimab, a confirmed partial response (PR) has been observed in a patient with vismodegib -refractory metastatic BCC. The patient is a 66 -year-old woman who had previously received vismodegib from September 2014 until February 2015. She began treatment with 10 mg/kg cemiplimab on 3 Aug 2015. Response assessments after cycles 1 and 2 showed stable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, but with gradual regression. The tumor measurements had further decreased to -37% compared with baseline (unconfirmed PR) at the end of cycle 3, and met the criteria for PR (confirmed) at the end of cycle 4. The patient has tol erated treatment well and continues on therapy as of the date of issue of this protocol. 3.2.2. Rationale for Study Design Because there is no standard of care for BCC patients who experienced progression of disease on HHI therapy, or are intolerant of prior HHI therapy, and metastatic and locally advanced disease are relatively rare, it has been acceptable to assess efficacy with non -randomized single -arm studies. Non -randomized studies without control arms, in which primary endpoints were ORR, were accepted by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the approvals of vismodegib and sonidegib for advanced BCC in the ERIVANCE ( Migden 2015 ) and BOLT ( Sekulic 2012 ) studi es, respectively. Objective response rate is the primary endpoint in ERIVANCE, BOLT, R2810 -ONC -1540 (a phase 2 study of cemiplimab in patients with advanced CSCC) (NCT02760498, EudraCT 2016 -000105 -36), and in the current study protocol.

32,page_32,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 33 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL Tumor biopsies wil l be obtained at baseline and during treatment for patients with locally advanced tumors to inform an understanding of mechanisms of response and resistance to tumor treatment. The study populations in this study include patients with both metastatic (Grou p 1) and unresectable locally advanced (Group 2) BCC (see Section 5.1.1 ). The decision to analyze separate groups of patients with metastatic and unresectable locally advanced disease is based on the observation of higher response rates in locally advanced versus metastatic disease seen in data from studies of SMO inhibitors against BCC ( Sekulic 2012 , Migden 2015 ). This observation was also seen in a literature review of the reported experiences with other systemic therapies in CSCC, which demonstrates that response rates for various chemotherapy regimens generally are higher against advanced primary t umors that are locally advanced than against tumors that have metastasized to lymph nodes or distant visceral organs ( Nakamura 2013 ). The rationale for including patients who are intolerant of HHIs is that such patients are unlikely to have a high probability of objective response if re -challenged with HHI. In the routine clinical practice setting of the STEVIE study, the median time to response was 2.7 months, whereas the median times to onset of muscle spasms and dysgeusia were 2. 8 and 6.5 months, respectively (Basset -Seguin 2015 ). Because objective response tends to occur before onset of AEs, it is unlikely that patients who interrupt HHI due to AEs will experience objective response upon re-challenge. Co nsistent with the prediction that intermittent dosing of HHIs is unlikely to increase markedly the efficacy of this class of drugs, there was no obvious signal of enhanced efficacy in preliminary data from a phase 2 study (MIKIE) that compares 2 intermitte nt dosing regimens of vismodegib in locally advanced BCC ( Rogers 2015 ). 3.2.3. Rationale for Dose Selection In the ongoing FIH study, the 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) intravenous (IV) dose has shown anti-tumor activity and acceptable safety in the FIH study, including in NSCLC patients; efficacy was also observed at 1 mg/kg Q2W. As many standard chemotherapy treatments for NSCLC are dosed on an every 3 -week (Q3W) schedule, the clinical development strategy of cemiplimab coalesced around a Q 3W treatment interval. The ongoing clinical development of cemiplimab also seeks to incorporate a flat dosing paradigm. As such, a Q3W flat dose regimen has been selected that is expected to provide a similar clinical efficacy and safety profile to that observed for the 3mg/kg Q2W regimen. A flat IV cemiplimab dose of 350 mg Q3W was selected, based on population PK modeling and simulation, as it is expected to provide exposure that closely replicates that observed in patients (mean weight - 80 kg) for the 3 mg/kg Q2W IV regimen in the ongoing FIH study R2810 -ONC -1423 (NCT02383212). Simulations of cemiplimab exposure in 1000 patients using population PK analyses indicated that: 1) a 350 mg Q3W dose in patients resulted in similar (≤20% difference) C trough, AUC 12W, and C max, as compared to the 3 mg/kg Q2W dose in the FIH patient population (mean weight - 80 kg), and exceeded those observed at the 1 mg/kg Q2W dose; and 2) the variability in cemiplimab exposure (CV%) was similar for body -weight adjusted dos es as compared to flat doses. Given the similar predicted exposure for 350 mg Q3W when compared to the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen, a similar efficacy/safety profile is also expected. Therefore, the 350 mg Q3W IV dose of cemiplimab is being proposed for new stud ies in patients with NSCLC, and across the cemiplimab program. VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Baseline characteristics will include standard demography (eg, age, race, weight, height), disease characteristics including medical his tory, and medication history for each patient. 4.2. Primary and Secondary Endpoints 4.2.1. Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the ORR as determined by central review. The ORR will be assessed separately for patients with metastatic BCC ( Group 1) or unresectable locally advanced BCC (Group 2):  For patients in Group 1 (metastatic BCC), RECIST version 1.1 ( Eisenhauer 2009 ) (Appendix 1 ) generally will be used to determine ORR. Clinical response criteria may be used for patients with externally visible target lesions, if all metastatic lesions are not measurable by RECIST (such as may occur in patients with bone -only metastases).  For patients in Group 2 (unresectable locally advanced BCC), clinic al response criteria (Appendix 2 ) will be used to determine ORR. Composite response criteria ( Appendix 2 ) will be used for patients who have both target lesions measurable by clinical response criteria and b y RECIST 1.1.  Patients who are deemed not evaluable by RECIST version 1.1 (Group 1; Appendix 1) or by the composite response criteria (Group 2; Appendix 2 ) will be considered as not reaching PR/CR for ORR. 4.2.2. Secondary Endpoints The secondary endpoints are:  Duration of response  PFS  OS  CR rate  Change in scores of patient -reported outcomes in the EORTC QLQ -C30 and the Skindex -16  AEs  Concentrations of cemiplimab in serum (at select sites)  Anti-cemiplimab antibodie s VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

Study Description and Duration This is a phase 2, non -randomized, 2 -group, multi -center study of cemiplimab at a 350 mg dose administered IV Q3W in patients with advanced BCC who experienced progression of disease on HHI therapy, or were intolerant of prior HHI therapy. The study will have 2 groups. Group 1 is for patients with metastatic BCC. Group 2 is for patients with unresectable locally advanced BCC. All patients will undergo screening procedures to determine eligibility within 28 days prior to the initial administration of cemiplimab . There is no randomization or placebo control. After a screening period of up to 28 days, patients will receive 5 treatment cycles of 9 weeks followed by 4 treatment cycles of 12 weeks for up to 93 weeks of treatment. Each patient will receive a 350 mg dose of cemiplimab IV Q3W. The infusion time for cemiplimab is approximately 30 minutes (± 10 minutes). Tumor assessments will be made at the end of each treatment cycle (5 treatment cycles of 9 weeks followed by 4 treatment cycles of 12 weeks). Extensiv e safety evaluations will occur on day 1 of each cycle, with routine safety evaluations to be conducted at each cemiplimab dosing visit. A patient will receive treatment until the 93 -week treatment period is complete, or until disease progression (PD), una cceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or confirmed CR. Patients with confirmed CR after a minimum of 48 weeks of treatment may elect to discontinue treatment and continue with all relevant study assessments (eg, efficacy assessments). Patients who d iscontinue study treatment due to PD should return to the clinic 30 days (range: 28 days to 42 days) after the last study treatment to complete the end -of-study (EOS) assessments. After the EOS visit, patients with PD should be followed for survival statu s until death, loss to follow up, or study termination by the sponsor. 5.1.1. Study Groups There will be 2 study groups:  Group 1: Patients with metastatic BCC. These patients are required to have histologic confirmation of distant BCC metastases (eg, lung, liver, bone, or lymph node). Group 1 includes patients with both nodal metastatic and distant metastatic disease.  Group 2: Patients with unresectable locally advanced BCC. These patients are required to have disease that is considered inoperable, or to have medical contraindication to surgery or radiation, or have not achieved disease control with these treatments (see Section 6.2.1 ). Note in clari fication: For patients with in -transit metastases ( Carucci 2004 ) if the baseline comprehensive work -up confirms that there are no nodal metastases or distant metastases, then the patient will be deemed to have locally advanced dise ase and would be enrolled in Group 2. Patients with in -transit metastases are typically managed by a multidisciplinary team (Carucci 2004 ), and therefore the multidisciplinary review regarding potential surgery or radiation therapy options, which is required prior to study enrollment for all Group 2 patients, is appropriate for patients with in -transit metastases.

End of Study Definition The end of the study will occur when the last patient to enter retreatment (per Section 8.1.5 ) completes the retreatment plus safety follow -up for 5 half -lives (105 days). 5.2. Planned Interim Analysis Interim Analysis for Group 1: At the tim e of the planned efficacy analysis for Group 2 (approximately 57 weeks after last patient, first dose), an interim analysis of Group 1 patients will be performed in order to assess the risks and benefits of cemiplimab in metastatic BCC. This analysis will be restricted to Group 1 patients with potential for adequate follow -up, defined as patients who have the opportunity to be followed approximately 57 weeks at the time of the interim analysis. This analysis will provide an ORR (with 95% confidence interva l) for Group 1 patients with adequate follow -up. For additional details, please see Section 10.5. 5.3. Study Committees 5.3.1. Independent Data Monitoring Committee An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), composed of members who are independent from the sponsor and the study sites, will be established to monitor patient safety by conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data. The IDMC would provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the clinical study to ensure the protection and safety of the patients enro lled in the study, per the IDMC charter. 5.3.2. Study Steering Committee A Study Steering Committee (SSC) will be appointed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron), comprising approximately 3 to 7 investigators participating in the trial and Regeneron repr esentatives from the study team. The SSC will ensure transparent management of the study according to the protocol through recommending and approving modifications as circumstances require. The SSC will review protocol amendments as appropriate. Togethe r with the study team, the SSC will also develop recommendations for publications of study results including authorship rules. The details of the role of the steering committee will be defined in a steering committee charter. 5.3.3. Central Review Committee To assess the primary endpoint of response rate, the processes for the independent reviews and the central reviews will be appropriately described in the charter documents.

Number of Patients Planned Up to app roximately 137 adult patients (53 in Group 1 and 84 in Group 2) are expected to be enrolled at up to approximately 70 sites globally. The large number of sites is due to the rarity of patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced BCC. 6.2. Study Po pulation Patients with metastatic (Group 1) or unresectable locally advanced (Group 2) BCC who experienced progression of disease on HHI therapy, or were intolerant of prior HHI therapy. 6.2.1. Inclusion Criteria A patient must meet the following criteria to be e ligible for inclusion in the study: 1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive BCC Note for clarification: The following are acceptable histologic subtypes of BCC: nodular, morpheaform, metatypical, superficial, micronodular, infiltrative, mixed, basosquamous, keratotic, desmoplastic 2. Patients must be deemed unlikely to benefit from further therapy with an HHI due to any of the following: a. Prior progression of disease on HHI therapy, or b. Intolerance of prior HHI therapy defined as: (i) any Grade 3 or 4 AE deemed related to HHI (ii) Or any of the following HHI -related events in patients with at least 3 months of exposure to HHI therapy (exclusive of treatment breaks):  Grade 2 muscle spasms or myalgias (iia)  Grade 2 dysgeusia or anorexia, if accompanied by ≥Grade 1 weight loss (iib)  Grade 2 nausea or diarrhea despite medical management or (iic) c. No better than a stable disease after 9 months on HHI therapy (exclusive of treatment breaks) 3. At least 1 lesion that is measurable by study criteria If a previously radiated lesion is to be followed as a target lesion, progression must be confirmed by biopsy after radiation therapy. Previously radiated lesions may be followed as non -target lesions if there is at least 1 other measurable target lesion. Group 1 : At baseline, there must be at least 1 measurable lesion ≥10 mm in maximal diameter (1.5 cm in short axis for lymph nodes) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"
39,page_39,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 40 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL Group 2 : At baseline, there must be at least 1 measurable baseline lesion in which the longest diameter and the p erpendicular diameter are both ≥10 mm if measured by digital medical photography. Non -measurable disease for Group 2 is defined as either unidimensionally measurable lesions, tumors with margins that are not clearly defined, or lesions with maximum perpen dicular diameters <10 mm. Patients without measurable disease at baseline are not eligible for the study. Note in clarification: In the case of a Group 1 patient with metastatic disease that does not meet target lesion criteria by RECIST 1.1 (eg, bone on ly lesions, perineural disease; Appendix 1) and with externally visible BCC target lesion(s), Appendix 2 may be used, in which bi -dimensional measurements are required (at baseline, perpendicular diameters must both be ≥10 mm). The patient would then be enrolled in Group 1 with the plan to measure externally visible target lesion(s) by photography with bi -dimensional measurements. The metastatic lesions that are not measurable by RECIST 1.1 criteria would be followed as non -target lesions on scans. In the case of a Group 2 patient with a deeply invasive lesion that the investigator deems is best measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), measurement for that target lesion will be done according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix 1 ). The requirement for a lesion to be measurable by RECIST 1.1 is that it must be ≥10 mm in longest dimension. 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1 5. At least 18 years old 6. Hepatic function: a. Total bilirubin ≤1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) (or ≤3x ULN, if liver metastases).

Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)*, or sexually active men, who are unwilling to practice highly effective contraception prior to the initial dose/start of the first treatment , during the study, and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Highl y effective contraceptive measures include: a. stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with in hibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening b. intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS); c. bilateral tubal ligation d. vasectomized partner (provided that the male vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP study participant and that the vasectomized partner has obtained medical assessment of surgical success for the procedure) e. and/or sexual abstinence†,‡. * WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile following menarche until becoming postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cau se. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of a postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with doc umented hysterectomy or tubal ligation. † Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs. The reliability of sexual abs tinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. ‡ Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only , and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) are VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

Premature Withdrawal from the Study A patient has the right to withdraw fro m the study at any time, for any reason, and without repercussion. The investigator and/or sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuat ion in the study places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow study procedures). An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients shoul d be avoided. Patients who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study assessments, as described in Section 8.1.4 . During the treatment period and follow -up period, a patient who withdraws consent to continue participation in the study will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn. Rules for discontinuation of study treatment (permanent or temporary) are discussed in Section 7.3.2 . 6.4. Replacement of Patients Patients prematurely discontinued from the study will not be replaced. 7. STUDY TREATMENTS 7.1. Investigational and Reference Treatments Open -label cemiplimab will be supplied as a liquid in sterile, single -use -vials. Each vial will contain cemiplimab at a concentration of 50 mg/mL. Instructions on dose preparation are provided in the pharmacy manual . Open -label cemiplimab will be administered in an outpatient setting as an IV infusion over approximately 30 minutes (± 10 minutes). Each patient’s dose will be administered as a dose of 350 mg Q3W (dose is not weight based, dosing in this study is a fla t dose). A pharmacist or other qualified individual will be identified at each site to prepare cemiplimab for administration. Detailed preparation and administration instructions will be provided to the sites in the pharmacy manual. 7.2. Pretreatment(s) Appro priate premedication for study treatments may be administered at the investigator’s discretion as per usual clinical practice and in accordance with institutional guidelines.

Dose Modification The planned dose and schedule is a 350 mg dose of cemiplimab IV over approximately 30 minutes (± 10 minutes) Q3W. Patients will generally remain on the assigned dosage of cemiplimab throughout the course of study treatment. Dose reduction of cemiplimab may be allowed following temporary discontinuation of study drug, based on the guidelines below, and only after discussion and agreement between the investigator and sponsor. 7.3.2. Study Tre atment Hold or Discontinuation Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw from the study should continue follow -up in the study without additional treatment until progression of disease, completion of all study assessments , or closure of the study ( Section 6.3). Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study will be asked t o complete study assessments, per Section 6.3. Adverse events are to be reported according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criter ia for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) version 4.03. Patients who experience grade ≥3 treatment -related toxicity (excluding laboratory abnormalities that are considered clinically insignificant) that is not otherwise specified in the protocol will be required to temporarily discontinue treatment with cemiplimab. Such patients may be considered for resumption of treatment once the toxicity resolves to grade 1 or baseline, or when the toxicity is stable and manageable through supportive/medical therapy (eg, grad e 3 hypertension that can be controlled with the addition of a second anti -hypertensive agent). Upon occurrence of a study treatment -related event at any time in the study, resumption of treatment after resolution or stabilization of the condition is allow ed at the discretion of the investigator and sponsor if resuming treatment is thought to be in the best interest of the patient, with the exception of the following categories:  Patients with events that require cemiplimab to be discontinued for more than 84 consecutive days from the previous dose  Patients with grade ≥2 uveitis will generally be discontinued from study treatment, unless there is resolution to grade ≤1 as outlined in Appendix 3 AND discussion with and approval by the m edical monitor. All patients with grade ≥3 uveitis will be permanently discontinued from study treatment. After other AEs, resumption of treatment may be at the initial dose level, or at 1 dose level reduced, based upon the discretion of the investigator and the sponsor ( Table 1).

Please see the CRF completion guidelines for information about attribution of irAEs. Investigators must be extremely vigilant and be ready to intervene early in the management of irAEs, as the onset of symp toms of irAEs (eg, pneumonitis or endocrinopathies) may be subtle. Detailed guidance of management of irAEs is provided in Appendix 3. In the event of irAEs that are not addressed in Appendix 3, general gui dance is provided in Table 3. The recommendations in Table 3 and Appendix 3 should be seen as guidelines, and the treating physician should exercise clinical judgment based on the symptoms and condition of the individual patient. Table 3: General Treatment Hold Guidelines for Immune -Related Adverse Events Severity Withhold/Discontinue Treatment? Supportive Care Grade 1 No action Provide symptomatic treatment Grade 2 May withhold treatment Consider systemic corticosteroids in addition to appropriate symptomatic treatment Grade 3 Grade 4 Withhold treatment Discontinue if unable to reduce corticosteroid dose to <10 mg per day prednisone equivalent within 12 weeks of toxicity Systemic corticosteroids are indicated in addition to appropriat e symptomatic treatment. May utilize 1 to 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent per day. Steroid taper should be considered once symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less and tapered over at least 4 weeks. For any severe (Grade 3 -4) irAE, if symptoms worsen or do not improve on adequate corticosteroids within 48 to 72 hours, consider adding additional immunosuppressive agents (to be selected from agents such as infliximab, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil). Referral of the patient to a specialize d unit for assessment and treatment should be considered. Note : These recommendations should be seen as guidelines, and the treating physician should exercise clinical judgment based on the symptoms and condition of the individual patient. Note regarding irAEs : For any AE that is of a type known to be potentially immune -related (eg, rash, colitis, elevated transaminases, endocrine), but is deemed not to be an irAE by the investigator, the sponsor may request additional information. Based on the emerging safety profile of cemiplimab and other antibodies targeting the PD -1/PD -L1 axis ( Weber 2015 , Naidoo 2015 ), the following working case definitions are provided to help investigators distinguish irAEs from non -immune AEs. These case definitions pertain to the more commonly reported irAEs associated with PD -1 inhibition ( Weber 2015 , Naidoo 2015 ), and is not exhaustive of all possible irAEs. Clinical presentations of less common irAEs, including neurologic, musculoskeletal, cardiac, renal, and ocular events ( Zimmer 2016 , Hofmann 2016 ), should be reviewed in patients with concerning presentations. The case definitions below have not been validated, and are intended only as guidance for investigators to help distinguish irAEs from non -immune AEs. Investigators’ clinical judgment may include other factors when determining immune -relatedness. The case definitions for irA Es may evolve as clinical experience increases with cemiplimab and other antibodies targeting the PD-1/PD -L1 axis. VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

Immune -related rash : Skin examination demonstrates a rash that is usually maculopapular, but other presentations may occur, including papulo pustular, follicular, or urticarial dermatitis. Consider dermatologic consultation and biopsy for atypical presentations. Exclude other cause such as virally -induced rash or contact dermatitis. b. Immune -related diarrhea/colitis : These events are on a con tinuum, with diarrhea defined as increased stool frequency, and colitis involves abdominal pain and/or radiologic evidence of colonic inflammation ( Naidoo 2015 ). Onset at 4 to 6 weeks is common ( Weber 2015 ). A CT scan usually demonstrates diffuse colitis (Tirumani 2015 ). Exclude clostridium dificile or other infectious etiologies and exclude laxative misuse. c. Immune -related hepatitis : Laboratory studies are notable for elevated ALT a nd/or AST that is usually asymptomatic. Viral or other drug -induced hepatitis is excluded. Exclude alcohol -related liver toxicity. If clinically appropriate, consider radiologic imaging to exclude malignant causes. If clinically appropriate, exclude wo rsening of underlying cirrhosis. d. Immune -related hypothyroidism : Laboratory studies are notable for elevated TSH associated with low serum free thyroxine (free T4). If elevated TSH is detected, it is recommended that free T4 level also be tested. Elevate d TSH with low free T4 establishes the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism may be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms such as fatigue, constipation, cold intolerance, dry skin, weight gain, and/or bradycardia. Exclude other causes of hypothy roidism, such as prior radiation therapy to the neck. In patients with prior history of hypothyroidism, exclude noncompliance with thyroid replacement medication. e. Immune -related hyperthyroidism : Hyperthyroidism should be managed with standard antithyroid pharmacotherapy, and consultation with an endocrinologist is recommended. f. Immune -related pneumonitis : Pneumonitis, defined as inflammation of the lung parenchyma, may present as shortness of breath, cough, fever, and/or chest pain. Median time from start of anti -PD-1 therapy to onset of pneumonitis is 2.6 months (Nishino 2016 ), but delayed onset of pneumonitis has been reported. The most common radiologic pattern on CT chest has been described as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), but other radiographic patterns may occur ( Nishino 2016 ).

Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of infu sion reactions must be available for immediate use. All infusion reactions must be reported as AEs (as defined in Section 9.4.1 ) and graded using t he grading scales as instructed in Section 9.5.1 . In the event of an infusion reaction of Grade 3 or greater severity during or directly following cemiplimab infusion, dosing should be stopped and the patient must be permanently discontinued from cemiplimab treatment. To assist investigators in identifying cemiplimab -related infusion reactions, the following case definition is provided:  Typical sympt oms may include fever, chills, rigors, skin flushing, dyspnea, back pain, abdominal pain, and nausea  Reason why the event is deemed immune -related  Infusion reactions usually occur either during the infusion or within 2 hours after the infusion is complete d  Vital signs may be notable for hypotension and/or tachycardia The investigator’s clinical judgment may include other factors when evaluating a possible cemiplimab -related infusion reaction. For example, rarely, an infusion reaction may occur up to 24 hours after initiation of the infusion.

Prohibited Medications and Procedures While participating in this study, a patient may not receive any standard or in vestigational agent for treatment of a tumor other than cemiplimab as monotherapy. After communication with the sponsor, focal palliative treatment (eg, radiation) would be allowed for local control of a tumor once a patient has completed 24 weeks of stud y treatment. Patients must not receive live vaccines during the study and up to 5 half -lives after the last dose of study drug. Any other medication which is considered necessary for the patient’s welfare, and which is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study drug, may be given at the discretion of the investigator. Patients using immunosuppressive doses (>10 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent) of systemic corticosteroids other than for corticosteroid replacement will not be eligible for the study. It is recommended that patients do not receive systemic corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone (Solu -Medrol®) or dexamethasone (Decadron®) at any time throughout the study except in the case of a life -threatening emergency and/or to treat an irAE. Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if >10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non -autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted.

Surgery For patients with locally advanced target lesions that are considered unresectable at baseline, but are subsequently deemed resectable during the course of the study due to tumor response to cemiplimab, curative intent surgery may be allowed, but must be discussed with the medical monitor prior to any surgical procedure. (This statement do es not apply to patients in emergency life-threatening situations that require immediate surgery). Patients with inoperable BCC at baseline who are rendered operable with clear margins will be deemed to have experienced PR. If during the course of the stu dy a patient develops new cutaneous lesions that are suspected to be a non -melanoma skin cancer other than BCC (eg, CSCC), removal of the lesion and continued treatment on study may be allowed after discussion with the medical monitor. 7.7.3. Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy is not part of the study regimen. Patients for whom radiation therapy is planned are not eligible. If, during the course of the study, a patient develops a symptomatic lesion for which palliative radiation therapy is deemed appropriate by the investigator, this will be deemed PD and generally the patient would be removed form study. Palliative radiation therapy may be allowed in certain circumstances in patients who have been on study for at least 24 weeks (see Section 7.7.1 ). Such cases must be discussed with the medical monitor prior to any radiation therapy if the investigator feels that restarting cemiplimab after radiation is in the best interest of the patient. The patient will be deemed to have experienced disease progression if radiation therapy is instituted, but will be followed for OS. 8. STUDY SCHEDULE OF EV ENTS AND PROCEDURES 8.1.

Follow -up Patients who discontinue study treatment due to PD should return to the clinic 30 days (range: 21 to 42 days) after the last study treatment to complete the EOS assessments indicated in Table 4 (same as in Table 5), as appropriate . After the EOS visit, patients with PD should be foll owed for survival status until death, loss to follow -up, or study termination by the sponsor. For all patients in Group 2, tumor biopsies ( Appendix 4 ) should be obtained at time of progression, whether progression occurs in cycles 1 through 9 or during follow -up (after cycle 9). Patients who discontinue study treatment due to reasons other than PD (eg, toxicity, confirmed CR after 45 weeks) should continue follow -up to complete all assessments in Table 6 until PD or completion of follow -up visits 1 to 7 and extended follow -up (Table 6).

Prior to resumption of cemiplimab treatment, patients must be re -consented (including resigning informed consent) and must repeat all screening activities (with the ex ception of providing new archived pathology material, research biopsies, or brain MRI), and the investigator must confirm that the patient still meets all eligibility criteria (other than the exclusion regarding prior treatment with anti-PD-1). Such patie nts will resume cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W monotherapy treatment for 48 weeks (maximum 4 retreatment cycles; 12 weeks per cycle), as per the schedule of events in Table 5. However, PK, ADA, research blood samples, and research tumor biopsies (exploratory “Tumor Biopsies” for Group 2) are not required for these patients during retreatment . In response to AESI like anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity, ADA samples closer to the event may be collected and analyzed, based on the judgement of the medical investigator and/or medical monitor. After retreatment, patients will be followed quarterly for survival and tumor treatment status, if available, until death. Follow -up status may be determined at clinic visits or via telephone contact with the patient, a family member of the patient, or the physician. 8.1.6. Unscheduled Visits All attempts should be made to keep patients on the study schedule. Unscheduled visits may be necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laboratory results, for follow -up of AEs, or for any other reason, as warranted.

Regeneron reserves the right to terminate this study at any time if safety concerns emerge that warrant study closure. 8.2. Study Procedures 8.2.1. Procedures Performed Only at the Screening/Baseline Visit The following procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility or characterizing the baseline populatio n:  Serum β -HCG (result must be ≤72 hours before first dose).  HBV, HCV, and HIV screening: hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C positive RNA (positive hepatitis C antibody test will require hepatitis C RNA test to rule out active infection), HIV -1, or HIV-2 serum antibody  Documentation of pathologic confirmation of BCC by a pathologist at the study site (see Section 6.2.1 , Inclusion Criterion #1). The pathology report that documents the diagnosis of BCC should be from the most recent biopsy that documented BCC. Pathology material (FFPE block or 10 unstained slides from the sample in the submitted pathology report) must be provided to the sponsor p rior to enrollment.  Group 2 only : Baseline/screening research biopsy is required (see Appendix 4 for guidelines). This baseline biopsy is intended for exploratory assessments, but will only be used for this purpose after central p athology confirmation of diagnosis of BCC is obtained on archived material. If the archived material is not sufficient for confirmation of diagnosis of BCC by central review, baseline biopsy material will be used for central pathologic confirmation; remai ning baseline tumor material can only be used for exploratory assessments after central pathology confirmation of diagnosis of BCC has been established.  Brain MRI, with gadolinium, is required at screening if it has not performed in the prior 60 days. Bra in scans during the treatment and follow -up periods are required if there is a prior history of lesions present at screening or as clinically indicated. A brain CT with iodinated contrast may be performed if an MRI is contraindicated.  Group 1 – Baseline i maging should include all known target lesions. Baseline scans must evaluate extent of disease, including imaging of chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This may be accomplished with CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast, or CT chest with contrast and MRI abdomen/pelvis with gadolinium. The imaging modality for metastatic lesions may be either CT with iodinated contrast or MRI with gadolinium, per investigator discretion. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium is generally preferred for bone lesions, perineural lesions, abdomen, pelvis, extremity, and head and neck. Computed tomography with contrast is generally preferred for chest. For Group 1 patients who also have externally visible lesions, digital medical photography will be used, and these lesi ons generally will be followed as non -target lesions.

Page 69 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL (eg, bone only lesions, perineural disease) and with externally visible BCC target lesions, digital medical photography may be used to follow the externally visible lesions as target lesions.  Group 2 – Externally visible lesions will be followed by digital medical photography. Baseline assessments will include radiologic imaging of all target lesion s (preferably MRI with gadolinium for all anatomic sites except lung, but CT with iodinated contrast allowed at any anatomic site, per investigator discretion) to assess for deep invasion. Baseline radiologic assessment will also include CT chest, prefera bly with contrast (If CT chest identifies a metastatic lesion, the patient should be assigned to Group 1). 8.2.2. Efficacy Procedures For patients with disease that can be measured radiologically according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendi x 1; Eisenhauer 2009 ), a CT or MRI for tumor assessment will be performed as detailed in and Table 5 . The choice of whether the imaging is by CT or MRI is an investigator decision, but preferred imaging choices are provided in Section 8.2.1 . Once the choice of CT scan or MRI has been made, subsequent assessments should be made using the same modality whenever possible. For patients whose BCC lesions are evaluable on the skin, compos ite response criteria (Appendix 2 ) should be used on the same schedule (every 9 weeks for cycles 1 to 5, every 12 weeks for cycles 6 - 9), in combination with radiologic imaging if appropriate.  Group 1 : Whole -body imaging – as perf ormed at the baseline assessment – is strongly recommended at each response assessment. At a minimum, all radiologically measurable target lesions (RECIST 1.1) should be imaged at each response assessment. The same radiologic imaging modality should be u sed at each response assessment. Additionally, radiologic imaging of anatomic area of externally visible target lesions should be performed at each response assessment (MRI with gadolinium is preferred for all anatomic sites except lung). Externally visi ble BCC lesions noted at baseline should be photographed at each response assessment ( Appendix 5 ), and will generally be deemed non-target. New externally visible lesions that are clinically suspicious for malignancy should be phot ographed ( Appendix 5 ) and biopsied. Note : In the case of a Group 1 patient with metastatic disease that is not measurable by RECIST criteria (eg, bone only lesions, perineural disease) and with externally visible BCC target lesions , digital medical photography may be used to follow the externally visible lesions as target lesions.  Group 2 : All externally visible BCC lesions should be photographed in a consistent manner at each response assessment as described in Appendix 5 . Radiologic imaging (MRI with gadolinium preferred) of anatomic area of externally visible target lesions should be performed at screening and at each response assessment. For each target lesion, the investigator will decide (based on scree ning imaging) if the radiology (CT or MR) or photo will be the most appropriate method to measure that target lesion, and should use the same modality to measure that target lesion at baseline and at each assessment. If photo is selected to measure a targe t lesion, imaging (CT or MR) should be obtained to provide supplemental information. In cases in which it is the opinion of the investigator that no significant added information was provided by baseline radiologic imaging of the lesion (beyond the informa tion that was provided by baseline digital medical photography), it is allowed to use digital medical photography only (without radiologic imaging) at VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"
69,page_69,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 70 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL subsequent response assessments of that lesion, at the discretion of the investigator (or vice-versa). I f the investigator opts to discontinue cross -sectional radiologic imaging after the baseline assessments and follow the lesion only with digital medical photography (or vice-versa), the reason(s) should be captured in the CRF. To account for the possibili ty of unconventional immune responses, immune -related response criteria (irRC) ( Nishino 2013 ) can inform the decision regarding whether to continue treatment for an individual patient if the investigator believes it is in the best c linical interest of the patient, after discussion and approval from the medical monitor. Reasons for any such decision to treat beyond the protocol definitions of progression must be documented in the CRFs. When possible, progression should be confirmed. However, irRC are currently deemed a surrogate endpoint (Postow 2015 ), and irRC data are not included in the primary endpoint of this study. Any patient who experiences best response (PR or CR) after initial progression (per Appendix 1 or Appendix 2, as appropriate) in the context of continued treatment (according to principles of irRC in after sponsor approval) will not have that best response (partial or complete) counted towards the primary endpoint of this study. In Group 1, patients will generally be followed by RECIST 1.1 criteria ( Appendix 1 ). It is possible that some patients in Group 1 may also have externally visible lesions that are measurable by digital medical photography. Generally, it will be clinically appropriate to follow these externally visible lesions as non -targets. However, for Group 1 patients with externally visible lesions that are deemed clinically significant by the investigator, the clinical and composite response criteria in Appendix 2 may be used in selected cases. However, it is anticipated that most patients in Group 1 will be followed by RECIST 1.1 only. For Group 2, response assessment is according t o the clinical and composite response criteria in Appendix 2. See Appendix 5 for guidelines on annotation of photos. If annotation of full perimeter of the lesion is deemed not clinically appropriate by the investigator (eg, an ulcerated lesion), the priority annotation will be of the axes delimiters. The perimeter of the lesion should be annotated as fully as possible without causing undue discomfort to the patient. For externally visible lesions that are i ndeterminate -appearing regarding presence of BCC, see Appendix 4 for guidelines on tumor biopsies. All radiological scans, photography, and biopsy results will be independently reviewed. An independent central review committee wi ll be formed to determine overall response for each patient based on the integration of these modalities. 8.2.3. Safety Procedures 8.2.3.1. Vital Signs Vital signs, including temperature, resting blood pressure, pulse, and respiration, will be collected at time points acc ording to Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6 .

On treatment days, ECG will be collected 30 minutes (±10 minutes) after the end of the infusion. The patient should be relaxed and in a recumbent or semi -recumbent position at least 5 minu tes before recording an ECG. The ECG strips or reports will be retained with the source. The ECG will be reviewed by the investigator (paper or electronic tracing) and will be available for comparison with subsequent ECGs by the investigator. The follow ing will be recorded on the CRF:  PR interval (msec)  QRS interval (msec)  QT interval (msec)  Heart rate (beats per minute; recorded from the ventricular rate) Any ECG finding that is judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) compared to the baseline value will be considered an AE, recorded, and monitored. 8.2.3.4. Immune Safety Assays Immune safety assays consist of rheumatoid factor (RF), thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer and pattern. If, during the course of the study, a 4 -fold or greater increase from baseline in RF or ANA or abnormal levels of TSH or CRP are observed, the following tests may also be performed: anti DNA antibody, anti -Sjögren’s syndrome A antigen (SSA) an tibody (Ro), anti -Sjögren’s syndrome B antigen (SSB) antibody (La), antithyroglobulin antibody, anti -LKM antibody, antiphospholipid antibody, anti -islet cell antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody, C3, C4, CH50. 8.2.3.5.

Drug Concentration Measurements and Samples Cemiplimab PK parameters will be determined by measuring cemiplimab concentrations in serum samp les using a validated assay at visits and time points indicated in Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6, and listed in Appendix 7 . The actual time of each blood draw must be record ed. “Predose” is defined as before the start of the first cemiplimab infusion. Predose samples may be collected ≤72 hours prior to day 1 dosing. Subsequent PK sampling times will be based on the cemiplimab dosing time that precedes the PK sampling. Pre -infusion is defined as before the start of the cemiplimab infusion and “0 hour” is defined as immediately after the end of the cemiplimab infusion. 8.2.4.2. Anti -Drug Antibody Measurements and Samples Samples for ADA assessment will be collected prior to dosing at time points listed in Table 4 and Table 5, and at the follow -up time points specified in Table 6. In response to AESI like anap hylaxis or hypersensitivity, ADA samples closer to the event may be collected and analyzed, based on the judgement of the medical investigator and/or medical monitor (in treatment, follow -up, or retreatment). The relationship between immunogenicity and PK of cemiplimab may be assessed, as appropriate. 8.2.5. Biomarker Procedures Soluble biomarker samples will be collected at time points according to Table 4. 8.2.5.1. Biomarker Measurements and Samples Speculated pharmacodynamic, predictive and prognostic biomarkers related to cemiplimab treatment exposu re, clinical activity, or underlying disease will be investigated in tumor tissue collected at baseline (including archival tumor tissue), after treatment with cemiplimab, and at progression, if available. Biomarker results will be reported separately from the clinical study report. 8.2.5.2. Tumor Biomarker Procedures For patients with locally advanced BCC (Group 2), tumor biopsies will be collected per the time points and methodology in Appendix 4 and the Laboratory Manual. Expression levels (mRNA and/or protein) of PD -L1, GITR, and LAG -3, as well as the number and distribution of TILs (defined by lineage markers CD4, CD8, CD25, FoxP3) will be assessed in VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

Obliga tions of Investigator The investigator must promptly report to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) all unanticipated problems involving risks to patients per local IRB/EC requirements . 9.2. Obligations of Sponsor During the course of th e study, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the study drug (suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction [SUSAR]), to the health authorities, IECs/IRBs as appropriate, and to the investigators. Any AE not listed as an expected event in the RSI section of the Investigator’s Brochure will be considered as unexpected for regulatory reporting purposes. Any worsening of or new onset of symptoms related to BCC that occur during th e screening/washout period prior to study drug administration will be considered expected for the underlying disease population and will be recorded as AEs/SAEs. In addition, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are unexpected and a t least reasonably related to the study drug to the health authorities, according to local regulations. At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clinical study report to hea lth authorities and IECs/IRB as appropriate. 9.3. Definitions 9.3.1. Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically signif icant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug. Progression of underlying malignancy will not be considered an AE if it is clearly consistent with the typical progression pattern of the underlying cancer (including time course, affected organs, etc.). Clinical symptoms of progression may be reported as AEs if the symptom cannot be determined as exclusively due to the progression of the underlying malignancy, or does not f it the expected pattern of progression for the disease under study.

75,page_75,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 76 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL If there is any uncertainty about an AE being due only to progression of the underlying malignancy, it should be reported as an AE or SAE as outlined in Section 9.3.2 . 9.3.2. Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  Results in death – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrela ted to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  Is life-threatening – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . In-patient hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital or an emergency room for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator or treating physician.  Results in persistent or signif icant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions th at do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse). Hospitalization or death due solely to manifestations consistent with typical progression of underlying malignancy will not be considered an SAE. Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events. See Section 9.4 for more information on recording and reporting SAEs. 9.3.3. Adverse Event s of Special Interest An AESI (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate. Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to characterize and understand it. Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by the trial sponsor to other parties (eg, regulators) might also be warranted (Section 9.4.3 ).

Infusion Reactions Infusion reactions are defined as any AE that occurs during the infusion or within 2 hours after the infusion is completed. See Section 7.4.1 for case definition. All infusion reactions must be reported as AEs (defined in Section 9.4.1 ) and graded using the grading scales as instructed in Section 9.5.1 . 9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 9.4.1. Adverse Events The investigator (or designee) will seek information on AEs at each patient contact, and record all AEs that occur from the time the inf ormed consent is signed until 105 days (5 half -lives) after the end of study treatment. Prior to initiation of study treatment, only the following categories of AEs should be reported on the AE CRF:  SAEs  Non-SAEs associated with a protocol -mandated interv ention (eg, AEs related to an invasive procedure such as a biopsy) Other AEs that occur prior to first treatment should be reported on the medical history CRF. All AEs after initiation of study treatment and until 105 days (5 half -lives) after the last stu dy treatment, regardless of relationship to study treatment, will be reported on the AE CRF. Information on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section 9.4.6 . Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs as outlined in Section 9.4.5 . 9.4.2. Serious Adverse Events All SAEs, reg ardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug, must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours. Refer to the study reference manual for the procedure to be followed. Information not available at the time of the initial report mu st be documented in a follow -up report. Substantiating data such as relevant hospital or medical records and diagnostic test reports may also be requested. In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE that occurs until 105 days (5 half -lives) after the last dose of study treatment, only those SAEs or other AEs of concern deemed by the investigator to be related to study treatment will be reported to the sponsor. The investigator should make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcom e of a treatment -related SAE until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.

Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of the event: Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug: Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2 times the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if associated with an AE. Pregnancy: Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24 hours of identification, any pregnancy occurring in a female or female partner of a male , during the study or within 105 days (5 hal f-lives) of the last dose of study drug. Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female study patient or female partner of a male study patient, and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE. Outcome for all pregnan cies should be reported to the sponsor. Adverse Events of Special Interest: AESIs for this study may include:  Grade 2 or greater infusion -related reactions  Grade 2 or greater allergic/hypersensitivity reactions  Grade 3 or greater irAEs  An irAE of any grade in a patient previously treated with a PI 3 -K inhibitor. Note: An irAE can occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. All AEs of unknown etiology associated with drug exposure should be evaluated to determ ine possible immune etiology. If an irAE is suspected, efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes prior to labeling an AE as an irAE. Refer to the study manual for the procedures to be followed. 9.4.4. Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s medical monitor within 30 days. Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be followed. 9.4.5. Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE include:  the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  the test result re quires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose adjustments)  the test result leads to discontinuation from the study, significant additional con comitant medication, or other therapy VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlined in Section 9.5.1 . 9.4.6. Follow -up Information for any non -SAE that starts during the treatment period or within 105 days (5 half-lives) after last treatment will be collected from the time of the event until resolution of the event, or until the patient’s last study visit, whichever comes first. Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or stable. 9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality 9.5.1. Evaluation of Severity The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale: The severity of AEs (including test findings classified as AEs) will be graded using the current version of the NCI -CTCAE gradin g system. Adverse events not listed in the NCI -CTCAE will be graded according to the following scale:  1 (Mild): Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated  2 (Moderate): Moderate; minimal, lo cal or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)*  3 (Severe): Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicat ed; disabling; limiting self-care ADL**  4 (Life –threatening): Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  5 (Death): Death related to AE * Instrumental ADLs refer to activities such as preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. ** Self-care ADLs refer to activities such as bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not being bedridden. If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity s hould be based on the degree of physiological impairment the value indicates. VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

STATISTICAL PLAN This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. The SAP may be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned analyses. The final SAP will be issued before the database is locked. In order to describe ORR and DOR, the data cut for primary efficacy analysis will allow responding patients to be followed from onset of response for at least 6 months. Because responses may emerge slowly in BCC patients ( Falchook 2016 ), and the primary endpoint results are not known prior to data cut, the convention in this study will be that all patients will have the opportunity for at least 6 months to develop response. For primary a nalysis, the last patient in a group will have the opportunity to be followed for approximately 57 weeks, including 27 weeks (cycles 1 to 3) for response, plus an additional 30 weeks (cycles 4 to 6) for DOR. If the last patient(s) has early EOS, the timin g of data cut will be determined by the enrollment date of the last enrolled patient who remains on study (first dose + approximately 57 weeks). An updated analysis of the response duration will be performed after all responding patients have been follo wed for a minimum of 12 months from onset of response. An interim analysis of Group 1 patients will be performed at the time of the primary analysis for Group 2. For additional details, please see Section 10.5. Analysis variables are listed in Section 4. 10.1. Statistical Hypothesis For the primary endpoint of ORR, the statistical hypothesis is that cemiplimab -treated patients will have an ORR representing a clinically meaningful treatment, with G roup 1 and Group 2 evaluated independently. 10.2. Justification of Sample Size Patients will be enrolled into 2 separate groups according to the stage of disease: metastatic BCC (Group 1) or unresectable locally advanced BCC (Group 2). The benchmarks for clinic ally meaningful response rates of >15% and >20% in metastatic and in unresectable locally advanced BCC, respectively, are consistent with published literature for BCC (Sekulic 2012 , Migden 2015 ). For Group 1, 50 patients are requir ed to provide at least 85% power to reject a null hypothesis of an ORR of 15% at a 2 -sided significance level of 5% if the true ORR is 34%. For Group 2, 80 patients are required to provide at least 85% power to reject a null hypothesis of an ORR of 20% at a 2-sided significance level of 5% if the true ORR is 35%. Given the sample sizes above, the nonclinically meaningful ORR of 15% for Group 1 will be excluded using the lower limit of 2 -sided 95% CI if the observed ORR is 28% or more (see Table 7) among 50 patients. The nonclinically meaningful ORR of 20% for Group 2 will be excluded using the lower limit of 2 -sided 95% CI if the observed ORR is 30.0% or more (see Table 8) among 80 patients. The sample sizes will be further increased by 5% to account for patients who withdraw prematurely from the study . Hence, the total sample sizes will be 53 patients for Group 1 and 84 patients for Group 2, for a total of 137 patients. VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

The ORR assessment for the primary analysis will be performed by an independent cent ral review VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

The investigator -assessed ORR will be considered as a secondary analysis. Efficacy analyses of Group 1 and Group 2 will be independent of each other. The primary analyses of efficacy for Group 1 and Group 2 are based on the binomial exact confidence interval approach, ie, whether or not the lower limit of 2 -sided 95% confidence interval will exclude an historical control ORR that is not deemed clinically meaningful. The 95% binomial exact confidence intervals using the Clopper -Pears on method ( Clopper 1934 ) for observed ORRs is listed for Group 1 ( Table 7) and for Group 2 (Table 8). 10.4.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Analysis The secondary analysis of efficacy as measured by duration of response, PFS, and OS will be summarized by median and its 95% confidence interval by the Kaplan -Meier method. The CR rate will be summarized descriptively with 95% confidence interval. Absence of residual BCC in patien ts with locally advanced BCC achieving a clinical response to cemiplimab, as measured by central review, will be summarized descriptively. 10.4.3.3. Multiplicity Considerations Patients will be enrolled into 2 separate groups according to the stage of disease: metas tatic BCC (Group 1) or unresectable locally advanced BCC (Group 2). Statistical analyses of the primary endpoint for Group 1 and Group 2 will be conducted and reported separately (ie, efficacy results and clinical conclusions from Group 1 will not affect those of Group 2, and vice versa). There is no hypothesis test for secondary endpoints. Therefore, statistical control of overall type I error for the whole study is not planned. Unless specified otherwise, all efficacy endpoints will be summarized usin g 2-sided 95% confidence interval. 10.4.4. Exploratory Analyses 10.4.4.1. Subgroup Analyses Subgroup efficacy analyses may be performed based on the number of pr ior systemic therapy regimens, the degree of differentiation of the tumor (well, moderate, or poor), the presen ce or absence of human papillomavirus in the tumor, and the presence or absence of use of immune suppressive medications (eg, high dose steroids) to manage irAEs that may arise during the study. Subgroup efficacy analysis will also be performed based on th e reason that a patient was deemed unlikely to benefit from further HHI therapy (progression/lack of response versus intolerance). Patients with stable disease will be included in the ""lack of response"" category for this analysis. If a patient experience s both progression and intolerance, progression will be scored as the reason that the patient would be unlikely to benefit from further HHI therapy. In the subgroup of patients in Group 2 who experience objective responses, the number of patients who remai n with unresectable BCC and the number of patients from whom BCC becomes resectable (complete gross resection) will be tabulated. 10.4.4.2. Quality of Life and Skindex -16 Analysis The patient -reported outcomes and quality of life of patients will be repeatedly measured by the EORTC QLQ -C30 and the Skindex -16 at day 1 of each treatment cycle.

The summary scores of the QLQ -C30 and the Skindex -16 will also be graphically depicted by longitudinal plots. 10.4.5. Safety Analysis Safety observations and measurements including drug exposure, AEs, laboratory data, vital signs, and ECOG performance status will be summarized and presented in tables and listings. 10.4.5.1. Adverse Events Definitions For safety variables, 3 observation periods are defined:  The pretreatment period is defined as the time from signing the ICF to before the first dose of study drug.  The on -treatment period is defined as the time from first dose o f study drug to 105 days after the last dose of study drug.  The post -treatment period is defined as the time starting 1 day after the on -treatment period. Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that are not present at baseline or represent the exacerbation of a pre -existing condition during the on -treatment period and treatment -related AEs that occurs any time after the first cemiplimab dose. Note regarding retreatment: For patients who receive cemiplimab as retreatment, which start s more than 45 days after their last regular cemiplimab treatment, the on -treatment period ends at the earlier day of 105 days after the last regular cemiplimab dose and the day before their first cemiplimab retreatment dose. Cemiplimab retreatment that s tarts within 45 days after the last regular cemiplimab dose will be considered as regular cemiplimab treatment. Analysis All AEs reported in this study will be coded using the currently available version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). Coding will be to lowest level terms. The verbatim text, the preferred term (PT), and the primary system organ class (SOC) will be listed. Summaries of all TEAEs by group will include:  The number (n) and percentage (%) of patients with at least 1 TEAE by SOC and PT  TEAEs by severity (NCI -CTCAE, version 4.03 grade), presented by SOC and PT  TEAEs by outcome  TEAEs by relationship to experimental treatment (related, not related), presented by SOC and PT Deaths and other SAEs will be li sted and summarized by group.

Analysis of Drug Concentration Data Summaries of study drug concentrations will be presented by no minal time point (ie, the time points specified in the protocol) and group. 10.4.7. Analysis of Anti -Drug Antibody Data Formation of ADAs will be assessed in individual patients and per group as follows:  Possible correlation between changes in PK profile and the p resence/absence of treatment -emergent anti -cemiplimab antibodies will be evaluated to identify a potential impact of treatment -emergent anti -cemiplimab antibodies on drug exposure  Possible correlation between AEs and the presence/absence of treatment -emerg ent anti-cemiplimab antibodies may be evaluated to identify a potential impact of treatment -emergent anti -cemiplimab antibodies on safety. Cases of ADA positivity will be listed and summarized as appropriate. 10.4.8. Analysis of Biomarker Data Biomarker data will be analyzed using standard scientific methods and summarized by descriptive statistics and plot.

Both comp arative analysis and correlative analysis will be exploratory in nature and will be described in a separate report. VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"
88,page_88,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 89 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL 10.4.8.1. Sample Size Justification for Biomarker Measurements in Tumor Tissue Biopsies Although many biomarkers may be assayed in tumor biopsy tissues, CD274 (PD -L1) was selected to illustrate the power analysis as an example. PD -L1 expression level, as defined by percent tumor cells with membranous staining by immunohistochemistry, was reported to be associated with clinical activity of nivolum ab (Borghaei 2015 ). The prevalence of PD -L1 expression levels ≥1%, ≥5%, ≥10% were 53%, 41%, and 37%, respectively, and the ORRs of control therapy vs. nivolumab were reported as 9% vs. 31%, 10% vs. 36%, 11% vs. 37% for each categor ization of PD L1 expression level, respectively. In the following power analysis, the following variations are considered ( Table 9): 1. The actual number of tumor biopsies obtained and deemed evaluable is 60, 50, or 40. 2. The PD -L1 expression level categorization results in PD -L1 negative/positive ratios of 1:1 or 3:2. 3. ORRs of 10% (PD -L1 negative) vs. 30% (PD -L1 positive) results in an odds ratio of 3.857, a nd 10% (PD -L1 negative) vs. 25% (PD -L1 positive) results in an odds ratio of 3.0. The power analysis was based on the one -sided Chi -square test with type I error of 20% due to the exploratory nature of biomarker analysis, performed in nQuery Advisor 7.0 ( Elashoff 2007 ). The power may be overestimated for some configurations as the large sample approximation may not be adequate for a Chi -square test with small sample sizes. In summary, requiring each patient enrolled in this study to provide tumor biopsy provides moderate power for exploratory biomarker analysis. VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

Interim Analysis For regions where alpha spending is not required : For this planned interim analysis on Group 1 patients , the ORR and associated 95% confidence interval will be summarized. As the primary objective of this interim analysis is point estimation on ORR and characterizing the precision of point estimation, there is no hypothesis testing associated with this interim analysis. Also, no decisions will be made regarding study conduct associated with the interim analysis. Therefore, Type I error adjustment is not applicable for this planned interim analysis. For regions w here alpha spending is required : For this interim analysis on Group 1 patients, a 2-sided alpha of 0.0001 will be allocated for interim analysis, and a 2-sided alpha of 0.0499 will be preserved for the final analysis. Correspondingly, for the interim ana lysis of the primary endpoint of ORR in Group 1 patients, the precision of ORR will be estimated by an adjusted and 2-sided 99.99% exact confidence interval. The unadjusted and 2 -sided 95% exact confidence interval will also be reported at the time of int erim analysis. At the time of the final analysis for Group 1 patients, both adjusted 95.01% and unadjusted 95% exact confidence interval s will be reported. For other efficacy endpoints in Group 1 patients, only a 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval will be presented both at the interim and at the final analysis.

Additional Statistical Data Handling Conventions The following analysis and data conventions will be followed: Definition of baseline:  Unless otherwise specified, the last assessment before th e initial administration of cemiplimab will be considered the baseline evaluation General rules for handling missing data:  Unless otherwise specified, there will be no imputations for missing data  If the start date of an AE or concomitant medication is inc omplete or missing, it will be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of study medication, except if an incomplete date (eg, month and year) clearly indicates that the event started prior to treatment. If the partial date indicates the same month or year of the intake of study medication date, then the start date by the study medication intake date will be imputed, otherwise, the missing day or month by the first day or the first month will be imputed.  Patients who are deemed not evaluable by RECI ST version 1.1 (Group 1; Appendix 1) or by the composite response criteria (Group 2; Appendix 2 ) will be considered as not reaching PR/CR for ORR. Their disease progression will be censored at the date of ba seline tumor assessment + 1 day. Duration of response and PFS will be censored at the last tumor assessment date for patients without disease progression.  Missing data in quality of life analysis will be presented as missing in changes scores Visit windows:  Assessments taken outside of protocol allowable windows will be displayed according to the CRF assessment recorded by the investigator. 10.7.

Page 103 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL APPENDIX 1: RESPONSE EVALUATIO N CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS: RECIST GUIDE LINE (VERSION 1.1) For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 9 weeks in cycles 1-5, and every 12 weeks in cycles 6 – 9. Confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response or progressive disease. For patients in whom all target lesions are followe d by radiologic imaging, it is acceptable to use RECIST 1.1 for all response assessments and composite response criteria are not required. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by the revised Res ponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1; Eisenhauer 2009 ). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. Selection of Lesions  Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm (≥2 cm) by chest x -ray or as ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). Note:  Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15 mm (≥1.5 cm) in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm [0.5 cm]). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short a xis will be measured and followed.  Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm [<1 cm] or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm [≥1 to <1.5 cm] short axis), are considered non -meas urable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable. Note: Cystic lesio ns that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases c an be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  Target lesions: All measurable lesion s up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible meas urement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"
103,page_103,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 104 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a rule r or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to chara cterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  Clinical les ions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color p hotography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  Chest x -ray. Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.  Conventiona l CT and MRI . This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5 cm) or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm (0.5 cm), the minimum size for a measurable lesion sho uld be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situation.  PET -CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. Howev er, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.

104,page_104,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 105 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL  Ultrasound . Ultrasound is not usefu l in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that t he same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be u sed instead of CT in selected instances.  Endoscopy, Laparoscopy . The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  Tumor markers . Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Cytology, Histology . These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (eg, residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease  18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG -PET) . While FDG -PET response assessments need additional stu dy, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG - PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease -specifi c medical literature for the indication. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.

105,page_105,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 106 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL Note: A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. Response Criteria Evaluation of Target Lesions  Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target o r non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm (<1 cm).  Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increa se in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increa se of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm). (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm [<1 cm] short axis). Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the no rmal limits.  Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase. Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later ti me by the review panel (or Principal Investigator). Evaluation of Overall Response Criteria The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive di sease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Page 108 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL APPENDIX 2: CLINICAL AND COMPO SITE RESPONSE CRITER IA FOR PATIENTS WITH LOCALLY ADVANCE D BCC These criteria are designed primarily for patients in Group 2. This appendix describes clinical response criteria for externally visible lesions that can be measured bi -dimensionally using digital medical photography. This appendi x also provides clinical and composite response criteria for disease that is measureable by both clinical response criteria and RECIST 1.1. Group 2 patients will be followed by digital medical photography. Group 2 patients will also undergo radiologic imag ing (typically, MRI with gadolinium) at baseline, and this will also be performed serially at each response assessment unless the investigator deems that baseline radiologic imaging was uninformative. Radiologic imaging (preferably, MRI with gadolinium) will be essential in the evaluation of tumors that have subdermal components that cannot be adequately assessed by digital medical photography. See protocol Section 8.2.1 and Section 8.2.2 for further information on imaging requirements for Group 2 patients. Response assessments occur every 9 wee ks during cycles 1 – 5 and every 12 weeks during cycles 6 – 9 and also as specified in follow -up schedule. Standardized digital photographs of the externally visible component of all target lesions must be obtained at baseline and at the time of each subs equent tumor assessment. Guidelines for digital medical photography are provided in Appendix 5 . Investigators will also provide a clinical description of the externally visible target lesion(s) at baseline and at each tumor assessme nt, as well as comments on any changes in the lesion(s) since the previous assessment. SPECIAL ISSUES FOR EXTERNALLY VISIBLE TUMORS: 1) Anatomic Defects Regarding tumor around a surgical cavity/anatomic defect (eg, rhinectomey), such lesions should be cons idered non -measureable unless there is a nodular lesion measuring ≥10 mm in maximal bi - dimensional perpendicular diameters. The surgical cavity or anatomic defect should not be considered in measuring the lesion. 2) Indeterminate -Appearing Tissue If ther e is uncertainty about whether a given lesion or area of a lesion represents malignancy versus benign process (eg, scarring, fibrosis), biopsies should be obtained. Indeterminate -appearing areas (eg, scarring, fibrosis) are included in the tumor measuremen ts unless biopsies are obtained to establish benign status. To reduce risk of sample error, biopsy of only a single area on the tumor is not allowed. Biopsy of at least 2 separate areas of the lesion are required when biopsy is indicated. Each biopsy will be performed in a pairwise manner (approximately adjacent) so that there will be one sample for local review and one for central review for each biopsy, as per Appendix 4 . As such, when the decision is made to perform biopsy, at least 4 biopsy samples are obtained (biopsy of 2 separate areas, with 2 biopsies in each area: one for central, one for local from each area). Biopsy samples will not be bisected or split in half for local and central review; rather, separate adjacent samples will be obtained. See Appendix 4 for biopsy details. Note on timeline for finalization of measurement/response assessment: Generally, baseline disease measurements and res ponse assessments should be completed on the day of the visit at VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

However, for visits in which tumor biopsies are performed, it is understood that the local pathology report may not be available for up to 5 business days after the biopsy. When biopsies are performed to distinguish between benign versus malignant tissue, the annotated photograph for that visit should clearly indicate the region of the tumor that was biopsied to distinguish benign versus malign ant tissue. Within one week of the date of biopsies, the investigator should finalize the tumor measurements for that visit with the benefit of the local pathology report. For circumstances in which the intent of the biopsy is to distinguish between disea se stability and response, it is not necessary to hold study treatment while the local pathology report is pending. For circumstances in which the biopsy, if positive, would result in discontinuation of study treatment due to progression, treatment should be held until biopsy results are finalized and progression has been ruled out. 3) Local Versus Central Review An independent central review committee, with access to de -identified digital medical photography results and biopsy results, will provide respon se assessments as required by the sponsor to address study objectives ( Section 5.3.3 ). Central reviews will be scheduled by the sponsor or designee, b ut will not be continuous or “real -time.” Clinical management decisions generally will be as per investigator response assessments and local pathology review. In the unlikely event that central review yields major differences with the local response assess ment that could have implications for the ongoing management of an active patient on study, the situation will be discussed between the sponsor and the investigator in order to determine patient management. 4) Confirmation of Responses After any objective response, confirmatory digital photography (and radiologic imaging, if performed as part of the initial response assessment) will be obtained at least 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response. For any complete responses observed in di gital medical photography of externally visible target lesions, confirmatory biopsies are required to establish status of complete response. 5) Patients in Group 1 with Externally Visible Tumors Regarding Group 1 (metastatic BCC), these patients will gener ally be followed by RECIST 1.1 criteria ( Appendix 1 ). It is possible that some patients in Group 1 may also have externally visible lesions that are measurable by digital medical photography. In such circumstances, the externally visible lesions generally will be followed as non -target lesions. The exception to this rule would be a patient with externally visible lesions in whom the only M1 lesions are not measurable by RECIST (eg, a patient with bone -only metastases), in which case the externally visible lesions (lesion size ≥10 mm in baseline dimensional perpendicular axes) would be target lesions and followed as per clinical response criteria in this appendix, and the non -measureable metastatic lesions (eg, bone metastases) would b e followed as non -target lesions. For any target lesions in Group 1 or Group 2 that are measured by digital medical photography, measurements will be bi-dimensional. VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

Page 110 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL 6) Patients in Group 2 with Deeply Invasive Tumors Regarding Group 2 (unresectable locall y advanced BCC), tumor measurements for these patients will generally be performed with digital medical photography (bi -dimensional measurements). However, some patients in Group 2 may have deeply invasive target lesions in which tumor measurements can be tter be obtained with cross -sectional imaging (eg, MRI with gadolinium or CT with contrast). For any target lesions in Group 2 or Group 1 that are measured by cross -sectional imaging (eg, MRI with gadolinium or CT with contrast), measurements will be unidi mensional according to RECIST 1.1. Clinical Response Criteria for Externally Visible Tumors (for all patients with locally advanced BCC ) A. External ly Visible Tumor Dim ension The externally visible component of target lesion(s) will be measured using bi-dimensional WHO criteria as the sum of the products (of individual target lesions) in the longest dimension and perpendicular second longest dimension – at each tumor assessment and will be documented using standardized digital photography ( Appendix 5 ). In the absence of substantial change in lesion geometry, subsequent visit measurements should be performed in the same axes and the investigator should refer to the previous visit’s annotated photographs as a starting point to iden tify axis for measurement when making subsequent assessments. Clinical response criteria for externally visible tumor(s) require bi -dimensional measurements according to WHO criteria, and are as follows:  Complete response of externally visible disease (vCR ): all target lesion (s) and non-target lesions no longer visible, maintained for at least 4 weeks. Documentation of vCR requires confirmation by biopsies of site(s) of externally visible target lesion(s) with histologic confirmation of no residual malignan cy, per central pathology review (Appendix 4 ). In the absence of such histologic confirmation, a patient cannot be deemed to have experienced vCR and the best response would be partial response.  Partial response of externally visibl e disease (vPR): decrease of 50% (WHO criteria) or greater in the sum the products of perpendicular longest dimensions of target lesion(s), maintai ned for at least 4 weeks  Stable externally visible disease (vSD): not meeting c riteria for vCR, vPR, or progr essive disease  Progression of visible disease (vPD): increase of ≥25% (WHO criteria) in the sum of the products of perpendicular longest dimensions of target lesion( s). In rare cases, unequivocal progression of a non -target lesion may be accepted as vPD. B. New Lesions A new cutaneous lesion consistent with BCC will be considered as cPD if the lesion is ≥10 mm in both maximal perpendicular diameters, and can be clearly documented as not being previously present, unless it is confirmed on biopsy not to be cons istent with BCC. If a new cutaneous lesion is not biopsied or if the histology is inconclusive, it should be considered BCC and deemed cPD. VV-RIM-00082550-1.0 Approved - 29 Jul 2019 GMT-5:00"

Page 123 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL APPENDIX 4: GUIDELINES FOR BIOPS IES FOR LOCALLY ADVANCED BCC This appendix provides time points and research procedures for biopsies in patients with locally advanced BCC. Because of the potential for sampling error with any single biopsy, 2 separate sites (preferabl y on the same target lesion) should be biopsied for any biopsy assessment. Regarding the required exploratory biopsies for Group 2, if the investigator feels that the biopsy creates an unacceptable safety risk for the patient or cannot be performed withou t interfering with the measurements of the target lesions, the biopsy requirement may be waived for an individual patient after communication with the Medical Monitor. Note in clarification: Exploratory biopsies are not required for Group 1 patients (meta static). For Group 1 patients (metastatic disease) who have externally visible BCC lesions that are amenable to biopsy with minimal risk, exploratory biopsies (baseline, day 22, at progression) may be obtained at investigator discretion. Time Points : 1. Base line (required): The study inclusion criteria require that the sponsor be provided with archived pathology material that will be used for the purpose of confirmation of the diagnosis of BCC by central pathology review for all study patients. If the archiv ed material is not sufficient for confirmation of diagnosis of BCC by central review, baseline “exploratory” biopsy material (required only for Group 2 patients) may be used for central pathologic confirmation only if it is determined that no other archive d pathology material is available for confirmation of diagnosis BCC by central pathology review. Remaining baseline tumor material can only be used for exploratory assessments after central pathology confirmation of diagnosis of BCC has been established. 2. Baseline or at any scheduled response assessment (If needed to differentiate benign versus malignant area of skin): Areas of indeterminate -appearing tissue should be biopsied to distinguish malignant tissue versus benign process (eg, scarring, fibrosis). In circumstances in which biopsies are planned, it is preferred that these be performed on the day of a regularly -scheduled response assessment. 3. On cycle 1 day 22 (±3 business days) for exploratory assessments, 2 biopsies (punch biopsies, 3 to 5 mm each) s hould be obtained, preferably from the same externally visible lesion from which the baseline biopsies were taken. Both samples will be provided to the sponsor for exploratory assessments. The cycle 1 day 22 samples are not intended for local pathology rev iew.

123,page_123,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 124 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL 4. At clinical complete response (required): Complete response status for externally visible lesions requires biopsy confirmation. The number of biopsies that are needed to confirm complete response status depends on the baseline size of the lesion. Recommended Number of Biopsies to Establish Complete Response, Based on Baseline Size of Lesion Lesion size (cm2) Minimal Number Biopsy Samples to Establish CR ≤4 2 >4 but ≤10 4 >10 but ≤25 6 >25 8 5. At progression (strongly encouraged): Two sites of externally visible progressing tumor should be biopsied. Research procedures for ALL biopsies: 1. Where and How: The technique and sites of biopsies will be selected by the investigator based on the sizes and locations of lesions. Generally, biopsies will be 3 mm punches. Biopsies should not be taken at the perimeter of a lesion because this could interfere with measurement of bi -dimensional perpendicular diameters for response assessments. Whenever possibl e, biopsy sites should be ≥5 mm from the edge of baseline lesional area. Note: If the investigator deems that a biopsy ≥5mm from edge is not possible, then the requirement for an exploratory biopsy will be waived after communication with and approval from the medical monitor, due to the potential for the biopsy to confound tumor measurements if the biopsy is close to edge of the tumor. 2. How many: For exploratory assessments: 2 biopsies of externally visible BCC will be obtained at baseline and again at cyc le 1 day 22 (±3 business days). These required biopsies for Group 2 patients are called ""Exploratory Biopsies"" for the purposes of this study. Two biopsies at time of progression should also be obtained. In the event that an investigator determines that clinical circumstances interfere with the ability to obtain the recommended number of minimal biopsies at baseline or cycle 1 day 22 (±3 business days), the monitor will be contacted to discuss the number of biopsies that can be reasonably obtained and thi s will not be deemed a protocol violation. For indeterminate -appearing tissue: In addition to these biopsies for exploratory assessments, biopsies should be taken at baseline and at any response assessment if there is tissue that is indeterminate -appeari ng regarding presence of benign versus malignant tissue.

124,page_124,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1620 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 125 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL These optional biopsies are referred to as ""Response Biopsies"" (eg, in response to a clinical question), to distinguish from the required ""Exploratory Biopsies"" described above. When the decision is made to perform a “response biopsy” of a lesion (or an area of a lesion) to clarify benign versus malignant status, 4 biopsies should be taken. This approach will mitigate the possibility for sample error or misleading results with any 1 biopsy, because 2 sites in the “indeterminate appearing” tissue will be selected. At each of the selected sites, 2 biopsies should be performed that are approximately adjacent (1 for central review, 1 for local pathology review). As such, 4 biopsies would be performed (2 s ites, with paired biopsies at each site: 1 for local pathology, and 1 for central = 4 total biopsies). When an investigator deems that biopsy of indeterminate -appearing tissue is warranted, 4 biopsies is the recommended minimal number of biopsies. If the area of indeterminate -appearing tissue is >10 cm2, the recommended number of biopsies to evaluate the presence or absence of tumor in indeterminate -appearing tissue is 6 (3 sites, each with paired biopsies at each site: 1 for central review, and 1 for lo cal). To establish complete response: the number of required biopsies is based on the baseline size of the lesion, as per the table above. 3. Annotation and Photography The punch biopsies should be labeled (annotated) on the patient and photographed, such th at on review of the photograph the following information is clear for each biopsy site: the study week and day of the biopsy (eg, Baseline, Cycle 1, Day 22, etc), the identifying number of the biopsy (because at least 2 sites would be biopsied), and which samples are for central review and which samples are for local review. The tumor will also be annotated with a skin pen to indicate the tumor perimeter and delimiters of the longest bi -dimensional perpendicular axes. All biopsies will be photographed and a nnotated, including the cycle 1 day 22 biopsies that are for exploratory assessments. Annotated photographs must be uploaded into Canfield secure website (see Appendix 5 ). 4. Disposition of Samples Biopsy samples required for explorato ry assessments (baseline, cycle 1 day 22) will be provided to the sponsor. It is also strongly encouraged that biopsy samples at time of progression be obtained for exploratory assessments, and these should also be provided to the sponsor. For each site t hat is biopsied to clarify indeterminate tissue, the entire block for one biopsy sample (designated for central) must be submitted to the Central Laboratory as per the Laboratory Manual. Because each biopsy site is sampled twice (closely adjacent samples) when there is indeterminate -appearing tissue, the second sample may be used for local pathology review. If only 1 adequate (eg, interpretable by pathologist) sample is obtained at a biopsy site, it will be provided to the sponsor for central review to addr ess the study objectives ( Section 5.3.3 ).

Classification of Pathology Samples For response assessments in which biopsies were performed, pathology re sults guide the determination of the area of invasive BCC versus benign tissue. Residual squamous carcinoma in situ will not be deemed to be invasive cancer. A minute focus of residual BCC in an otherwise benign responding biopsy sample will not automatica lly supersede a determination of partial response. However, the best response that can be recorded if the pathology report demonstrates any residual BCC is partial response (not complete response).

Proper Patient Preparation and Positioning: In these clinical photographs for the duration of the study, the only variable allowed to change is the skin condition itself. Therefore, an ything extraneous to the condition (furniture, etc.) is to be eliminated from the photographic field, starting at the entry visit through the final visit. The necessity of good end -of-study photographs should be stressed to patients to ensure their coopera tion. Lighting, framing, exposure, and reproduction ratios must be held constant. In the end, the images should read like a time -lapse movie. In the close up view, the area of interest is the individual target lesion itself. In the global view, the area o f interest includes the target lesion as well as relevant anatomical landmarks, e.g. side of face, side of neck, upper torso, full view of shoulder, etc. Photographs should be taken with the camera positioned at the same vertical height as the center of ar ea of interest. Further, all shots should be made with the axis of the camera lens perpendicular to the surface of area of interest when possible. Glancing shots where the camera lens is not perpendicular to the patient’s area of interest are to be avoided as these photographic angles may distort the image perspective yielding inaccuracies when measurement of lesions is performed on photos by central review.

Page 128 of 133 CONFIDENTIAL The Canfield Capture software controls the setting of the camera specific to the protocol. The lens is set for auto focusing. The close -up view is accomplished using the attached standardized mm scale. The global view is accomplished when the ranging lig hts converge on the target area. Any doubt as to the correctness of the photographic technique should result in an immediate re -shoot. At the baseline visit, a profile view (perpendicular to the skin’s plane) will also be obtained of each lesion to captur e any projection above the skin. For all lesions in which the baseline profile view demonstrates significant projection above the skin, defined as ≥15mm, the profile view will also be obtained at subsequent scheduled clinical assessments of response. For each global view and each close up view, an unannotated photograph must be taken followed by a manually annotated photograph. For response assessments, Canfield imaging software should be used to assure that the photograph is taken at the same position an d angle as the Baseline photograph. The annotated image from the prior visit should be referenced on the laptop screen prior to making annotations on the new image. Photographic Procedures: 1. Prior to capturing the patient images using the camera system, the photographer launches the Canfield Scientific Canfield Capture Application by selecting the icon from the desktop. 2. The photographer either creates a New Patient for an initial visit or, for a return subject, highlights the appropriate existing Patient ID listed in the Canfield Capture database. The visit name (as per study schedule) is selected by the photographer and the image date is captured by the software. 3. With the patient’s target area positioned correctly in front of the camera system, the Photogra pher adjusts the camera distance for accurate system focus. The first capture is a Close -up view of patient’s target BCC area(s) using the attached mm scale, consisting of one individual BCC lesion. The second capture is Global view of patient’s target BCC area(s), consisting of up to 2 individual BCC lesions. For the global view the camera is moved closer to or further away from the target until the 2 green ranging lights converge to become one dot. 4. The Photographer captures the image and is then prompted to review image acceptability. The Photographer either accepts the image and moves on to the next capture or does not accept and recaptures the image. 5. After capturing the series of non -annotated lesion(s), the Investigator will annotate the circumference and axes delimiters of lesion with supplied skin pen. If any biopsies are taken at this visit (eg, baseline, cycle 1 day 22, at any regularly scheduled visit, or at time of progression), each biopsy will also be annotated as per Appendix 4 . The annotated photo will include the largest area, including both palpable and visible components of the lesion, as outlined by the investigator. Following the same procedure as the non -annotated image capture the site will capture the series of annotated lesion(s) images 6. Following the session, the Photographer submits the images to Canfield. Upon exiting, the software automatically reads, checksums, encrypts, packages, and duplicates the data to submit to Canfield via internet or removable medi a submission.

Internet: A secure, validated, compliant web server set up at Canfield is used for secure transfer of study images by study sites. Images are to be transferred the day they are recorded. Only approved individuals by the Sponsor have access t o the website. The application logs a record of this action to a local database and prompts the Photographer when completed. 1. Upon completion of photography session, the Investigator will log in to the Canfield tracing application to annotate the lesion a nd the software will provide measurements (surface area, longest diameter, perpendicular diameter) of the lesion. 2. Trained Canfield staff review the data files for technical quality and acceptability and communicate any comments to the site. 3. At the end of the study, a copy of site specific patient images will be provided to each site. This is in addition to the Photography Result Reports available for printing from the Clinical Services Website after each session. Remote access to all images b y the Sponsor is also provided.
