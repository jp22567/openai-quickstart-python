These were detail ed in the USM letter dated 07 May 2020 and sent to investigators, Competent Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Institutional Review Boards . The USMs are introduced due to the exceptional situation generated by the COVID -19 pandemic. The objective of these USMs is to limit the risk of exposure to COVID -19 infection to ensure the safety and well -being of study subjects. The USMs are: − phone visits or t elevisits as alternative to on-site visits ; − collection of study assessments at the subject's home or other remote location (if possible an d available) ; − extension of visit windows ; − additional guidance for on -site visits ; − direct-to-patient (DTP) shipment of investigational medicinal product ( IMP) and other supplies to the subject’s home ; − additional guidance on the decision for continuation of IMP after missed visits . In addition : − Exclusion criterion 15 has been amended to include all lower respiratory tract infections requiring treatment, rather than those requiring antibiotic treatment. − Clarification has been added that the investigator will be responsible for managing COVID -19 infected subjects. − Exclusion criterion 5 was modified to clarify that subjects are permitted to take stable doses of immunosuppressive medication for reasons other than treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). − The possibility was added to perform source data review remotely when access to hospitals is restricted. − The international nonproprietary name, ziritaxestat, was added . The changes made to the clinical study protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Version 6.00 (17-Dec- 2019) are listed below, with a brief rationale of each change and the applicable sections. If a randomized subject is not able to attend a scheduled study visit on site for any COVID -19 related reason , then the investigator should perform a phone call or use a virtual platform such as Skype, Facetime, etc., to evaluate safety and assess well -being of the study subject. Subject visits at home or at a remote location (other than the investigational site) can be considered at the investigator’s discr etion. Applicable Section s: Section 4.1 Clinical Study Design Section 6 Clinical Study Assessments Section 6.1.1 Alternative Timing and Assessment Procedures for Subjects who, due to any Covid -19-related Reason, Cannot Perform the Study Procedures Section 6.11.1 Schedule of Activities: Screening and First 52 Weeks of Study Treatment Section 6.11.2 Schedule of Activities: After 52 Weeks of Study Treatment"
8,page_8,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 9/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information Amendment 5 (General) To allow for the flexibility of obtaining safety and efficacy data when subjects are unable or unwilling to complete the study procedures due to any COVID -19-related issue, the visit windows for Visits 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 may be increased to ±7 days and the visit windows for Visit 9 and Visit 12 may be increased to ±28 days.

9,page_9,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 10/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information Amendment 5 (General) Exclusion criterion 15 has been amended to exclude all l ower respiratory tract infections requiring treatment (rather than those requiring antibiotic treatment) within 4 weeks prior to screening and/or during the screening period. This is to exclude subjects with suspected or confirmed COVID -19 lower respirator y tract infections . A clarification has been added that the investigator will be responsible for managing COVID -19 infected subjects , and that the decision to continue or interrupt IMP for subjects with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID -19 infection i s at the investigator’s discretion. Guidance for reporting of suspected and confirmed COVID -19 cases in randomized subjects has been added . Applicable Section s: Section 4.1.2 Guidance for Dose Modification in Case of Adverse Events Section 4.4 Potential Risks and Benefits Section 4.5.2 Exclusion Criteria Exclusion criterion 5 was modified to clarify that subjects are permitted to take stable doses of immunosuppressive medication for reasons other than treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) . The rationale is to ensure that subjects who are on immunosuppressives due to conditions other than IPF (such as post solid organ transplants and inflammatory bowel disease) are not excluded from the study. Applicable Section: Section 4.5.2 Exclusion Criteria If a randomized subject is not able to attend a scheduled study visit on site for any COVID -19 related reason, IMP and other supplies can be shipp ed via DTP s hipment to the study subject when required due to the COVID -19 situation as per ICH -GCP principles.

INTRODUCTION For details of GLPG1690 , refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) (Edition 6, 28-Jun-2019 ) and any relevant updates/addenda /errata . This clinical study will be conducted in accordance with the current International Council for Harmoni sation of Technical Requirements for Pharmace uticals for Human Use - Good Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP) Guideline E6 (see also Section 10). Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, severely debilitating, and ultimately lethal lung disease predominantly affecting elderly male smokers or ex -smokers with a median age of 65 to 70 years [ 5]. The disease is characterized by progressive worsening of dyspnea and lung function and is associated with a poor prognosis (i.e. median survival of 2-5 years following diagnosis) [ 4, 12, 14, 18, 28]. The estimated IPF prevalence ranges from 14.0 to 27.9 cases per 100,000 population in the United States and from 1.3 to 23.4 cases per 100,000 population in Europe (data from 1990 -2011). The estimated IPF incidence in these studies ranges from 6.8 to 8.8 cases per 100,000 population in the United States and from 0.2 to 7.4 cases per 100,000 population in Europe [ 8, 22, 31, 38]. Over the past decade, extensive research has been conducted to address the unmet medical need for effective IPF treatment. Two treatments (pirfenidone and nintedanib), targeting the biologi cal processes that drive fibrosis, are currently approved in the European Union , the United States , and other regions around the world . Consequently, these treatments are standard of care for many patients . Pirfenidone (antifibrotic, anti -inflammatory, and antioxidant treatment marketed as e.g. Esbriet®; indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate IPF), was the first drug to be licensed specifically for IPF. Phase 3 studies demonstrated that the drug improved progression -free survival and slow ed the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC). Moreover, pirfenidone may have a mortality benefit [ 13, 23, 34, 37]. The drug was approved in th e European Union in 2011 and in the United States in 2014. Nintedanib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor marketed as e.g. Ofev®; indicated in adults for the treatment of IPF), was initially developed as an anticancer agent. In Phase 3 studies, it significantly red uced the decline in FVC compared with placebo. A trend towards a reduced death rate was also observed; however, the studies were not designed to detect differences in mortality [ 32]. The drug was approved in the United States in 2014 and in the European Union in 2015. Both treatments appear to slow disease progression but are frequently associated with side effects pote ntially limiting their use in clinical practice [ 7, 24, 29]. There thus remains a considerable unmet medical need for the investigation and development of novel IPF treatments targeting disease -relevant pathways. The sponsor is current ly pursuing the development of GLPG1690, a small -molecule autotaxin (ATX) inhibitor targeting disease -relevant signal transduction pathways, for the treatment of IPF."
30,page_30,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 31/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information Mode of Action GLPG1690 is a novel, potent, and selective small -molecule inhibitor of ATX . ATX, also known as ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (ENPP2) or lysophospholipase D (LPD), is a ~120 kDa protein that belongs to the ENPP family of enzymes. ATX is the only ENPP enzyme with LPD activity and is responsible for the hydroly sis of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to produce the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The term LPA covers several chemical species able to activate LPA receptors depending on the nature of the fatty acid side chain on the glycerol backbone. The most abundant LPA species in human plasma is LPA C18:2 with a fatty acid side chain of 18 carbon atoms including two unsaturated bonds [ 2]. Literature data have identified the ATX/LPC axis as the main source of LPA in blood [ 36, 39]. Several publications suggest a role for ATX in the control of disease -affected lung function through effects on lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells [ 17]. In general, inflammatory conditions in the lung are often described as associated with increased ATX and LPA levels. Studies related to IPF indicated an increase in LPA levels in the br onchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients [ 35], an increase of ATX levels in human fibrotic lung [ 25], and an elevation of LPA C22:4 in exhaled breath condensate of patients [ 20]. Further, LPA1 knock -out and inhibitor studies revealed a key role for LPA in fibrotic processes in lung and were complemented by studies using cell -specific knock -out mice lacking ATX in bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages. These mice were shown to be less sensitive to models of lung fibrosis [ 25]. The role of LPA in lung remodeling relates to the effects of LPA on both lung fibroblasts (through LPA1) and epithelial cells (through LPA2). It has been demonstrated th at LPA2 plays a key role in the activation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) in epithelial cells under fibrotic conditions [ 40]. Available literature and preclinical pharmacology data generated by the sponsor , suggest that interventions targeting the ATX/LPA pathway could lead to a new class of therapy for IPF. 2.1. BACKGROUND - NONCLIN ICAL STUDIES 2.1.1. Physical, Chemical, Pharmaceutical Properties, and Formulations The chemical name of GLPG1690 (international nonproprietary name ziritaxestat) is 2-[[2- ethyl -6-[4-[2-(3-hydroxyazetidin -1-yl)-2-oxoethyl]piperazin -1-yl]-8-methylimidazo[1,2 - a]pyridin -3-yl](methyl)amino] -4-(4-fluorophenyl) -1,3-thiazole -5-carbonitrile . The clinical formulation used in this study is a film -coated tablet. 2.1.2. Pharmacology 2.1.2.1. Primary and Secondary Pharmacology GLPG1690 is an ATX inhibitor ( 50% inhibitory c oncentration [IC 50] of 131 nM and 224 nM in biochemical assays with human enzyme and mouse enzyme, respectively). The LPA production after human plasma incubation was inhibited by GLPG1690 with an IC 50 of 242 nM, demonstrating the low impact of plasma prot ein binding on the activity of the compound. The compound was selective over related enzymes like ENPP1, phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 and PDE5, and phospholipase A (PLA) and phospholipase C (PLC). Moreover,"

32,page_32,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 33/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information After oral administration, drug -related material is excreted mainly in feces in rat (about 90% or greater). In bile duct -cannulated rats, about 50% of orally administered radioactivity was recovered in bile. Upon repeated once daily (q.d.) oral dosing of GLPG1690, no significant accumulation was observed in plasma, except in male rats (20 mg/kg/day) and dogs (50/65 mg/kg/day at Week 39). Gender differences in PK profiles were observed in rats b ut not in dogs. The total plasma clearance of GLPG1690 was low in mice, rats, monkeys, and dogs, ranging between 3% and 23% of the hepatic blood flow. Therefore, GLPG1690 is expected to undergo a low first -pass effect after oral dosing. The primary cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme involved in GLPG1690 metabolism was CYP3A4. In vitro metabolism studies in hepatocytes revealed 26 potential metabolites. Metabolites formed in human hepatocytes were all present to a similar or higher extent in rat and/or dog hepatocytes, the animal species selected for toxicity studies. An in vitro study with GLPG1690 in human hepatocytes showed no clinically relevant induction of human CYP2B6 and CYP2C enzymes. Regarding CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, weak induction cannot be excluded at a GLPG1690 dose of 600 mg q.d. in human, with a maximal decrease of around 30% in the exposure of a sensiti ve probe substrate for both CYP enzymes . An in vitro study with GLPG1690 in human liver microsomes indicated no clinically relevant inhibition of the majority of CYP enzymes . Weak competitive reversible inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5 cannot be excluded at a GLPG1690 dose of 600 mg q.d. in human, with a maximal increase of approximately 1.7- and 1.5-fold, respectively, in the exposure of a sensitive probe substrate. In addition, GLPG1690 demonstrated a strong time -dependent, irreversible inhibition potential against CYP2C8 -mediated metabolism. This could likely lead to a pronounced interaction with a sensitive CYP2C8 probe substrate (increased exposu re) if co-administered with a GLPG1690 dose of 600 mg q.d. in human. No interaction by GLPG1690 is expected for renal uptake transporters organic cation transporter (OCT)2, organic anion transporter (OAT)1 and OAT3 and hepatic efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). For the hepatic uptake transporters organic anion transporter polypeptide OATP) OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1, and efflux transporters MATE1 (hepatic/renal) and MATE2K (renal) a clinical interaction with GLPG1690 cannot be ruled out ; however substantial interactions are not anticipated. For the intestinal efflux P -gp and BCRP transporters and the hepatic efflux bile salt export pump (BSEP) transporters an interaction cannot be ruled out. 2.1.4. Toxico logy 2.1.4.1. General Toxicology A comprehensive toxicology program has been conducted with GLPG1690. This program includes Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) oral repeat -dose toxicity studies of up to 26 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in dogs, embryofetal development stud ies in rats and rabbits, fertility studies in male and female rats, non -TgrasH2 mice preliminary studies, preliminary carcinogenicity"
33,page_33,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 34/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information studies, and in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies. Additional toxicology studies conducted include phototoxicity stud ies and dose -range finding studies in rats and dogs. In rats, no GLPG1690 -related mortality was observed. The dose -limiting adverse effects consisted of reduced food consumption (FC) and markedly decreased body weight (BW) gain at 1,000 mg/kg/day in the 4 -week toxicity study, histopathological changes in the testes with reduced sperm parameters at ≥130 mg/kg/day in the 13 - and 26 -week GLP studies, and the presence of vacuolated alveolar macrophages, with alveolar amorphous material and perivascular inflamma tory cell infiltration in the lungs of females in the 26 -week GLP study. The no observed adverse effects level (NOAEL) values in rats were set at 40 and 130 mg/kg/day in males and females, respectively, in the 26 -week GLP study. In repeat oral dose toxici ty studies in dogs, the dose-limiting effects consisted of decreased white blood cell (WBC) count and FC, emesis and BW loss, associated with poor clinical conditions at doses ≥100 mg/kg/day in the 13 - and 39 -week GLP studies, respectively. . QT prolongati on, which was considered non -adverse, was also observed in repeat oral dose toxicity studies in dogs (4 -, 13-, and 39 -week studies). . Additional findings in dogs consisted of adverse altered sperm parameters and inflammatory cell infiltrates in the liver a nd minimal bile duct hyperplasia at 150/100 mg/kg/day (in the 13 -week GLP toxicity study). The safety margins obtained from the mean (AUC) exposures at the NOAEL for dogs in the 39 -week study when compared with the highest clinical dose currently being tes ted in healthy subjects (600 mg q.d. Study GLPG1690 -CL-116) was 31 -fold. Male and female fertility studies in rats showed that there were no effects of GLPG1690 on mating performance, fertility, or reproduction in either male or female rats at the differe nt dose levels tested. As the effects on sperm and testis proved reversible and had no functional impact on animal fertility parameters, the risk of an impact on male fertility in adult subjects is considered low. In males, the no observed effect level (NO EL) for mating performance and fertility was set at 400 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL for sperm changes was determined at 40 mg/kg/day; the latter is in line with previous studies (i.e., 13 week rat study). In females, the NOEL for mating performance and fertili ty was considered to be 120 mg/kg/day. In reproductive embryofetal development studies with GLPG1690 in rats and rabbits, major external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities were seen in fetuses of both species as well as increased incidences of postimpla ntation losses. In rats, the maternal and developmental NOAELs were determined at 60 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. In rabbits, the maternal and developmental NOAELs were determined at 15 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day. GLPG1690 showed no genotoxic effects in vitro or in vivo. GLPG1690 showed a phototoxic potential in vitro. However, this potential has not been confirmed in a rat in vivo study, investigating the phototoxic effects on the eyes and the skin in female pigmented Long -Evans rats. No evide nce of cutaneous or ocular phototoxicity was noted at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg."

Clinical Safety As of the safety data cut -off date of IB Edition 6, in clinical pharmacology studies, GLPG1690 had been administered to 85 heal thy subjects as single doses (dose range: 20 to 1500 mg), to 96 healthy subjects in repeated doses (dose range: 100 to 1000 mg for either 7 or 14 days) . Administration of GLPG1690 was considered safe and well tolerated during the se studies. No deaths, serious treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), or TEAEs leading to investigational medicinal product (IMP) discontinuation were reported after d osing with GLPG1690 . All GLPG1690 TEAEs were at most moderate in severity. In Study GLP G1690 - CL-109, one SAE (ECG repolarization abnormality) was reported after a single dose of nintedanib, but before dosing with GLPG1690 (IMP) . The safety profile of single doses of nintedanib and pirfenidone in Study GLPG1690 -CL-109 both alone and in combin ation with GLPG1690 was consistent with the respective nintedanib and pirfenidone prescribing information. An additional DDI study (GLPG1690 -CL-113) evaluated the effect of multiple oral doses of GLPG1690 on the safety and tolerability of nintedanib 150 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) under different dosing conditions; i.e. the GLPG1690 dose and the timing of GLPG1690 administration versus the nintedanib morning intake. Subjects received 150 mg nintedanib b.i.d. on Days 1 and 7, and GLPG1690 200 mg q.d. 0 (i.e. con comitantly) or 2 hours after nintedanib morning intake time, or 600 mg q.d. 0, 2, or 4 hours after the nintedanib morning intake time on Days 3 to 9. Cohorts 1 and 2 evaluated the morning and evening PK of nintedanib (150 mg b.i.d.) when administered alone and when the morning dose was administered simultaneously with GLPG1690 200 mg (in Cohort 1) or 600 mg (in Cohort 2). Cohorts 3 and 4 evaluated the morning and evening PK of nintedanib 150 mg b.i.d. when administered alone and in combination with GLPG1690 200 mg or 600 mg administered 2 h or 4 h after the nintedanib morning dose (i.e., 600 mg 2 h [Cohort 3a]; 600 mg 4 h [Cohort 3b] or 200 mg 2 h [Cohort 4a]). There were no serious adverse events and all TEAEs were at most moderate in severity. There was one TEAE (herpes zoster) that led to discontinuation of treatment in the cohort that received GLPG1690 200 mg at the same time as the nintedanib morning dose. G LPG1690 at doses of 200 mg and 600 mg q.d. was well -tolerated. The frequency of TEAEs was generally similar between cohorts and treatments. The frequency of diarrhea adverse events was higher in most cohorts after nintedanib alone than after GLPG1690 alone . In contrast to the previous DDI study (GLPG1690 -CL-109), the incidence of diarrhea events did not increase when nintedanib was administered with GLPG1690 . Administration of oral doses of GLPG1690 600 mg q.d. for 12 weeks in 17 subjects with IPF was well tolerated (Phase 2a study GLPG1690 -CL-202). No deaths were reported. Serious TEAEs were experienced by one subject in the GLPG1690 600 mg q.d. group (cholangiocarcinoma, led to permanent discontinuation) and by two subjects in the placebo group (atrioventr icular block second degree in one subject, led to permanent discontinuation; and lower respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and acute kidney injury in the other subject). None of these serious TEAEs were considered related to IMP according to the investigator. No notable differences were observed in the incidences of treatment -emergent"

The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. 2.2.2. Clinical Pharmacokinetics Single (up to 1,500 mg) and multiple ascending oral doses of GLPG1690 (up to 1,000 mg q.d.) for 14 days were assessed in healthy male subjects under fed conditions. GLPG1690 was rapidly absorbed with a median time to maximum plasma c oncentration (t max) of 0.5 -2 h. Steady state exposure of GLPG1690 increased approximately in proportion with the dose between 300 to 1,000 mg total daily. Excretion of unchanged GLPG1690 in human urine was low (<1.8% in 24 hours [h] based on unchanged GLPG 1690 ) and rapid. There was no impact on the urinary 6β-OH-cortisol/cortisol ratio after repeated dosing suggesting a lack of CYP3A4 induction by GLPG1690 . The PK of GLG1690 was similar between Caucasian and Japanese healthy male subjects. The PK of GLPG16 90 in subjects with IPF was not markedly different from those observed in healthy subjects at the same dose level. Food decreased the rate of absorption of GLPG1690 given as tablet (as expected by delay in gastric emptying), but there was no clinically rel evant difference in the bioavailability of GLPG1690. A higher between -subject variability was observed in fasted state, with 4 subjects out of 12 having 5 - to 10 -fold lower exposure than the other subjects. The rate of elimination was not impacted by food. The mean terminal half -life (t 1/2) after a single 600 mg dose as tablets was approximately 11 h. After q.d. dosing with the strong CYP3A4/potent P -gp inducer rifampin for 10 days, GLPG1690 (600 mg q.d.) exposure was decreased (by 6.0 - and 9.3 -fold for maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 h [AUC 0-24h], respectively) without any significant change in the apparent rate of elimination. Exposure of GLPG1690, as measured by area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity ( AUC 0-∞), was 3 - and 4 -fold greater when administered in combination with itraconazole and voriconazole, respectively, than when GLPG1690 was administered alone. Maximum exposure (C max) of GLPG1690 increased slightly following administration of GLPG1690 in combination with itraconazole or voriconazole compared with administration of GLPG1690 only (C max values were 1.4 -fold greater following administration in combination with itraconazole or voriconaz ole). This increase is unlikely to be clinically significant. GLPG1690 can therefore be classified as a moderately sensitive substrate of CYP3A4 as it demonstrated an increase in AUC of ≥2 to <5 -fold with strong index inhibitors. Comparison of the plasma p rofiles showed no impact on the apparent rate of elimination of GLPG1690 . The potential impact of GLPG1690 600 mg on the PK of single doses of pirfenidone and nintedanib was evaluated. Exposure of pirfenidone and its metabolite 5 -carboxypirfenidone, as measured by C max, AUC 0-∞, and terminal elimination half -life (t1/2) was not affected when administered in combination with GLPG1690, compared to when pirfenidone was administered alone . Exposure of nintedanib, as measured by C max, AUC 0-∞ was approximately 2 -fold greater when administered in combination with GLPG1690, than when GLPG1690 was administered alone. Nintedanib t1/2 was not affected by co administration of GLPG1690."

Guidance on continuation of IMP and requirements for assessments conducted during the COVID -19 pandemic are provided in Section 6.1.1 . 4.2. CLINICAL STUDY RATIO NALE Since 2010, disease -modifying drugs such as pirfenidone and nintedanib are indicated for patients with IPF and available in most parts of the world. These dru gs have been shown to have a beneficial effect on the rate of decline in lung function (as measured by FVC over 1 year) and show a trend in favor of a reduction in mortality [ 32]. Both drugs have received conditional recommendation for use in the American Thoracic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory Society (ERS) / Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) / Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) 2015 guidelines [ 29]. However, the residual decline of FVC over 1 year remains substantial, with a further decline of FVC over 52 weeks of 125 mL and 114 mL in INPULSIS I and II (nintedanib) [ 33], respectively, and around 200 mL in the ASCEND study (pirfenidone) [ 13]. Additional therapies targeting different disease pathways could potentially prove to be more effective by further preventi ng the decline in FVC with an acceptable safety profile [ 41]. In the proof -of-concept Phase 2a study GLPG1690 -CL-202, FVC values remained stable in the majority of subjects on GLPG1690 600 mg q.d. (+8 mL mean change from baseline ). Moreover, 12 weeks of treatment with GLPG1690 600 mg q.d. was generally well tolerated (refer to Section 2.2.1 ). The current Phase 3 study is a next step in the clinical development of GLPG1690, evaluating the efficacy and safety of two doses of orally administered GLPG1690 (200 mg q.d. and 600 mg q.d.) compared to placebo in subjects with IPF in addition to local standard of care. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of GLPG1690 in addition to local standard of care on the rate of decline of FVC over a period of 52 weeks. FVC has been accepted as a clinically relevant efficacy measure in IPF, as a benefit in terms of FVC decline showed a trend toward decreased mortality [ 11]. Key secondary objective s are to evaluate the effect o n disease progression defined as deterioration of FVC (expressed as categorical decline of ≥10% predicted FVC) or all-cause mortality , respiratory -related hospitalizations , and quality of life as measured by SGRQ total score. All-cause and respiratory -related mortality have been chosen as other secondary objectives to provide supportive evidence that the treatment affects the disease. The effect on acute IPF exacerbation and patient -related outcomes such as quality of life , cough -related outcomes , and hospi talizations will also be evaluated .

This clinical study protocol contains specific precautions and exclusions to manage use of GLPG1690 on top of standard of care (pirfenidone and nintedanib). The plasma concentrations of GLPG1690, pirfenidone and nintedanib will be collected . The potential for increased exposure to nintedanib when co -administered with GLPG1690, can be managed by separating the intake times of the morning dose of nintedanib and the IMP daily dose . It is therefore recommended that all subjects on nintedanib take IMP at or after lunch (approximately 4 hours after nintedanib morning intake); refer to Section 5.2. Additionally all subjects taking nintedanib will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events and managing them according to the guidance in the nintedanib prescribing information . Management of adverse events For the management of AEs, guidance for the investigator should be followed , as described in Section 4.1.2 . As noted above, t he investigator needs to evaluate the potential of increased exposure to nintedanib when co administered with IMP by monitoring adverse events and managing them according to the guidance in the nintedanib prescribing information and the guidance provided in this protocol. Details for capture of the suspected and confirmed cases of COVID -19 based on the symptoms and the confirmatory test, respectively, have been provided in da ta entry guidance issued to the sites, and will be included in the CRF completion guidelines. All these cases, whether suspected or confirmed, should be documented in the CRF . Clinical studies GLPG1690 has been evaluated in several Phase 1 studies and in the GLPG1690 -CL-202 study with patients. Administration of GLPG1690 was generally safe and well tolerated. In the GLPG1690 -CL-202 study, FVC values remained stable in the majority of subjects on GLPG1690 600 mg q.d. (+8 mL mean change from baseline ) when a dministered for 12 weeks (refer to Section 2.2.1 ). Special populations As there is limited clinical experience with GLPG1690 so far, the IMP should not be administered to subjects with severe renal impairment or with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.

Precautions for Sexual Intercourse Highly effective contraceptive measures for both males and females of childbearing potential must be documented in the source documents. 4.5.3.1.1. Female Subject s In line with the Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA) ’s Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) recommendation [ 3], female subject s are considered of non -childbearing potential if they meet one of the following criteria: − No menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause . A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women n ot using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient . − Permanently surgically sterile (bilateral oophorectomy [i.e. surgical removal of ovaries], bilate ral salpingectomy, or hysterectomy [i.e. surgical removal of uterus])."

They must use one of the following hi ghly effective methods of birth control from the time of signing of the ICF, during the clinical study , and for at least 30 days after the last dose of IMP: − Combined (estrogen - and progesterone -containing) (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) hormonal contra ception associated with inhibition of ovulation plus a barrier method1. − Progesterone -only hormonal (oral, injectable, implantable) contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation plus a barrier method1. − Intrauterine device . − Intrauterine hormone -releasing system. − Bilateral tubal occlusion. − Sexual abstinence defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of ris k associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject . Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, symptothermal, po st-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a clinical study, withdrawal , spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not accept able as methods of contraception. In case a woman of childbearing potential has a vasectom ized partner, provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of surgical success, then she is not required to use an additional form of contraception. Within these limit s, the specific forms of contraception employed are left to the discretion of the subject , the investigator, and/or the subject ’s physician. Female subject s of childbearing potential will be requested to do a monthly urine pregnancy test during the study. The monthly pregnancy test outcome must be documented on the subject diary card and at the next visit in the source and case report form (CRF ). In case of a positive urine pregnancy test at home, the subject should immediately contact the clinical study c enter and the investigator must report this immediately, and under no circumstances later than 24 hours after being made aware. The safety of GLPG1690 during breastfeeding is unknown. Women who are nursing are not allowed to take part in this clinical stu dy. Pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant during the study are not allowed to take part in this study. 4.5.3.1.2. Male Subject s Men should be advised not to father a child while receiving treatment and must use effective contraception during and up to 9 0 days after treatment. Male subjects intending to father a child, should discontinue treatment with IMP and wait for at least 90 days before stopping the contraceptive measures detailed in this section . 1 As there are no current data available regarding potential interactions between IMP and hormonal contraceptives, female subjects who use hormonal contraception should supplement this with a barrier m ethod (preferably male condom)."

Sexual abstinence defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments is considere d a highly effective contracepti ve measure. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, symptothermal , post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a clinical study, withdrawal , spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. In a case where the female partner of a male subject has undergone documented surgical sterilization that was performed more than 1 year before screening, then the subject is not required to use an additional form of contraception. Vasectomized male subject s with female partners of childbearing potential are not required to use an additional form of contraception , provid ed that surgical sterilization has been successful (documented azoospermia by semen analysis). Male subjects with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner should use a condom to prevent exposure through seminal fluid . No sperm donation is allowed from the first dose of the IMP until 90 days after the last dose. 4.5.3.2. Prior and Concomitant Medications Prior therapy Prior therapy taken up to 12 weeks prior to and during the screening period , and pirfenidone and nintedanib taken any time prior to and during the screening period will be recorded after signing of the ICF, at Visit 1. Concomitant therapy Should any treatment other than the IMP be used during the course of the study, the name of the therapy, the dosage, the route, the reason for therapy, and the start and stop dates of administration must be recorded until the last visit. For subject s receiving oxygen, the volume administered per minute will also be recorded at each visit. Concomi tant therapies taken for the long -term treatment of pre -existing conditions can continue during the study , provided they are in accordance with the in - and exclusion criteria (see Section s 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 , respectively). It is required that the use of these medications should"

For nintedanib and pirfenidone, subjects need to have received a stable dose for at least two months prior to screening and during screening; stable being defined as the highest dose tolerated by the subject during those two months . In case additional concomitant medication needs to be administered or dose adjustments for pre-existing conditions need to be performed during the study, the benefit -risk to the subjec t should be carefully assessed and consideration given to the timing of any necessary introduction of new medications. The following therapies are prohibited during the course of the study and within 4 weeks prior to screening, because of lack of benefit o r suggestion of harm in IPF: warfarin, imatinib, ambrisentan, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, bosentan, methotrexate, sildenafil (except occasional use), prednisone at steady dose >1 0 mg/day or equivalent . If during the study, the subject ’s condition necessitates the use of one of the above mentioned medications (excluding high -dose steroids) , the use of IMP should be interrupted until resolution or stabilization of this condition , preferably after consultation with the CRO medical monitor ( as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available). Precaution s with concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval The use of medication known to prolong QT interval during the study needs to be based on a benefit -risk evaluation by the investigator , e.g. in the case of atrial fibrillation . In certain other situations (e.g. the initiation of macrolides or fluoroquinolones in case of a lower respiratory tract infection ), when the benefit -risk evaluation neces sitates the administration of medication known to or potentially prolonging QT, IMP can be interrupted as evaluated by the investigator after clinical assessment of the subject ’s profile , including the baseline QTcF and how this has changed over time for t his specific subject . If the investigator elects to continue IMP, additional monitoring will be performed as per investigator’s judgment. A non -exhaustive list of medication known to prolong QT interval is provided in Appendix 7. Precautions with other concomitant medications At dose levels of 600 mg q.d., GLPG1690 has the potential to influence substantially the metabolism of substrates of CYP2C8 and to potentially be influenced by known strong CYP3A4/ potent P-gp inducers/inhibitors. • GLPG1690 demonstrated a strong time -dependent inhibition potential against CYP2C8 -mediated metabolism . Consequently , GLPG1690 should not be used concomitantly with medicat ions primarily or solely metabolized via CYP2C8 (see Appendix 3). For other medications involving part of their metabolism pathway via CYP2C8, caution should be applied on a case -by-case basis taking into consideration the benefit/risk ratio. Statins such as fluvastatin and pitavastatin are metabolized to some degree by CYP2C8, and need to be used with caution. Other statins such as simvastatin, lovastat in, and atorvastatin are theoretically less metabolized by CYP2C8. Monitoring of LFTs and creatine kinase is implemented during the study, and guidance to the subject aligned with guidance for statins in clinical practice is therefore strongly recommended. Loperamide is also a substrate of CYP2C8, and special caution should be applied in alignment with clinical practice."
57,page_57,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 58/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information • GLPG1690 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P -gp, and could therefore be influenced by their respective inhibitors and inducers. GLPG1690 exposu re is reduced up to 90% by the strong CYP3A4/ potent P-gp inducer rifampin. As a consequence, strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P -gp are part of the exclusion criteria and should be avoided during the study to ensure proper exposure to GLPG1690 (see Appendix 4). For inhibition, strong CYP3A4 and dual strong 3A4 and potent P -gp inhibitors have shown that GLPG1690 exposure increased by 3 to 4 fold when co administered therefore use of known strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors and potent P-gp inhibitors is prohibited during the study (see Appendix 5 and Appendix 6). Antibiotics from the macrolide therapeutic class are excluded , unless they are used for the short -term treatment of a lower respiratory tract infection with interruption of IMP , which is restarte d as soon as possible after the completion of the treatment with macrolides . It is highly recommende d that the CRO medical monitor (as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available) are consulted before the initiation of medication known to prolong QT interval, to be a CYP2C8 substrate , or to inhibit or induce P -gp/CYP3A4 . In certain situations, when the benefit -risk evaluation necessitates the administration of medication excluded fr om use during the study, IMP should be interrupted and restarted as soon as possible. As a rule, i nclusion of subject s with stable chronic illness on stable medications which are metabolized/transported by the abovementioned CYP/transporter enzymes should be decided on a case -by-case basis if not excluded or prohibited , taking into account the medical history , concomitant medication of the subject , the therapeutic index of the medication, and safety profile . As indicated in the study contact list, t he CRO medical monitor should be contacted, or the sponsor’s study physician in case the former is not available (when deemed necessary by the investigator ), specifically for medication with a narrow therapeutic index and/or a risk of (un)predictable AEs. Rescue medication If the subject shows a worsening of his/her IPF disease condition (e.g. acute IPF exacerbation), all treatment options are allowed at the investigator’s discretion. The decision to continue the IMP should be taken on a case -by-case basis by the investigator and in case of doubt can be discussed with the CRO medical monitor (as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available) . 4.5.3.3. Food and Beverage Restrictions The use of St -John’s Wort, a strong CYP3A4 in ducer, is prohibited during the study. Double -strength grapefruit juice is potentially a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and therefore should be avoided during the study. 4.5.3.4. Other Prohibitions and Restrictions Not applicable."

Treatment Discontinuation, Subject Withdr awal, and Study Termination All subjects will continue on IMP until the last subject reaches 52 weeks into the study (Visit 12) (for details, please refer to Section 4.1 and to Section 6.1 “Specific study visits when the last subject reaches 52 weeks into the study (Visit 12)”). Subjects will be informed prior to clinical study entry that they are allowed to withdraw from the clinical study. At any time and for any reason, a subject’s participation in the clinical study may terminate at his/her request, without prejudice to his/her future medical care. The subject will be encouraged to share the reason(s) for withdrawal so this can be documented in the source documents. Subjects who choose to withdraw from study participation will be asked if they are prepared to complete a last visit. In this case, either the EoST or EoSA visit should be performed. The subjects’ vital status information will be collected at the time of the EoST/EoSA visit of the last subject who reaches 52 weeks in the study (Visit 12), according to national, ethical, and regulatory guidelines, and as per the subjects’ confirmation in the signed main ICF. If t he subject initially confirmed no vital status information to be collected, but reconsiders at the time of actual withdrawal of consent, the subject has to re -consent for this in writing. Subjects who withdraw from the clinical study without contacting the clinical study center (lost to follow -up) should be contacted by the clinical study center so that their health status can be assessed and documented in the source documents. The clinical study center should make every effort to understand whether the sub ject is alive, including checking the medical records, contacting general practitioner or relatives, if necessary. All attempts must be documented in the source documents. Subjects who discontinue IMP early (ETD), with the exception of patients who withdr aw consent and patients lost to follow -up, will be encouraged to complete all following visits and evaluations as originally planned per protocol (see below, “Procedures in case of early treatment discontinuation (ETD)”). The sponsor has the right to termi nate the clinical study at any time in case of safety concerns or if special circumstances concerning the IMP or the company itself occur, making further treatment of subjects impossible. In this event, the subjects, investigator(s), and relevant authoriti es will be informed of the reason for clinical study termination. Discontinuation of IMP Treatment with IMP will be discontinued by the investigator (preferably after discussion with the CRO medical monitor, who may consult and must inform the sponsor’s st udy physician) for any of the following reasons: − Life-threatening AE or a serious adverse event (SAE) that places the subject at immediate risk. − Confirmed pregnancy: if a subject becomes pregnant during the study (to be confirmed by local serum pregnancy t est; central measurement will also be performed ), the IMP has to be stopped immediately and the subject has to be followed up until birth or otherwise termination of pregnancy. The subject needs to be unblinded immediately and repeat counsel ing on birth defect risk must be offered in case she was on active drug."

If the abnormal recording is discovered after the visit, the recording should be confirmed as soon as possible. In case of an abnormal ECG on both of these two recordings is confirmed , the investigator needs to send an immediate alert to the central reade r for confirmation as well as to the CRO medical monitor (as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available) . If the ECG abnormality is before IMP intake , IMP administration will be withheld until the central reader ha s reviewed the ECG registration. In case of confirmation of the ECG abnormality, IMP will be discontinued for this subject . Only in case a response of the central reader is not available within the timeframe of the visit, the investigator can proceed to di scontinue the treatment of the subject .

The subject should be asked to return to the site within a 48 -hour window from awareness of the result. − An assessment of other concomitant medications and S oC should be made. The investigator should consider whether is in the best interest of the subject to interrupt concomitant medications and SOC treatment. − A detailed history including relevant information on alcohol use, recreational drug use, supplement consumption, any herbal remedies, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced subject, surgery, occupational history, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and any other potential causes of a liver insult should be collected. − A detailed assessment of the subject’s clinical condition and repeat laboratory tests for LFT, including albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin (direct and indirect), GGT, I NR and alkaline phosphatase should be done − Further testing for Hepatitis A, B, and C , and for autoimmune hepatitis should be done . Other causes of viral hepatitis (CMV or EBV etc) should be excluded. Liver imaging should be considered . − Referral to a hep atologist or gastroenterologist should be considered. − All these cases should be reported as SAEs . Every effort should be made to keep subjects in the study and on treatment. However, the investigator can consider stopping treatment with IMP, preferably a fter consultation with the CRO medical monitor (as per study conta ct list ) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available ), in case of concerns about the subject’s safety, major protocol noncompliance, serious or severe AEs or worsening of th e disease condition, which in the investigator’s opinion needs an alternative treatment approach not being covered in the clinical study (e.g. rescue medication). − At Visit 3: as the blood sample is taken before first IMP intake and the results are only available after first IMP intake , the investigator needs to justify continuation of IMP in writing for abnormal results (based on the exclusion criteria) for: • Creatinine clearance • Hb The reason(s) for stopping the IMP will be docu mented in the CRF. Procedures in case of early treatment discontinuation (E TD) Subjects who discontinue IMP early will complete an ETD visit.

In case the subject discontinues IMP on a scheduled visit, that visit should be completed and, in addition, the assessments from the E TD vis it that are not part of the scheduled visit should be performed. If the subject is not able or not willing to come back for a n ETD visit, the investigator will contact the subject by phone, and if the subject has agreed to this in the ICF, may consult the subject ’s medical record and/or contact the subject ’s general practitioner or relatives, if necessary, to obtain the needed information. 4.6. MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS 4.6.1. Randomization At screening, subject s will be assigned a subject identification number. When a subject is confirmed to be eligible for the clinical study, he/she will be randomized. A total of approximately 750 subject s will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive GLPG1690 600 mg q.d., GLPG1690 200 mg q.d., or matching placebo for at least 52 weeks. Allocation of each subject to a given treatment will be described in a randomization list prepared by a CRO. This randomization list will be stratified in a balanced manner for background local standard of care for treatment of IPF (nintedanib, pirfenidone, or neither). Recruitment may stop earlier in one or more strata to maintain the balance as indicated, while the other strata(s) continue to recruit . Upon qualification for the study, allocation of each subject to a given treatment will be done using a centralized electronic system (interactive web response system [IWRS]) with permuted blocks . For each subject at each visit, the clinical study center will contact the IWRS for the appropriate treatment number to be assigned . Each medication kit w ill contain the relevant IMP for the period until the next visit. Subject s and study personnel will be blinded to the treatment assignment. Additional details on blinding and unblinding are provided in Section 4.6.2 . 4.6.2. Blinding and Unblinding This is a randomized, double -blind clinical study. The subject and the entire clinical study team, including the investigators, clinical study coordinators , and sponsor personnel are blinded to treatment assignment, except for situations described in the last paragraph of this section. Blinded and packaged medication will be provided to the clinical study center. All IMP formulations will be packaged in the proper proportion to as sure desired dosages and maintenance of the blinding. In case of down -titration, interruption, or re -escalation, a sham dose level is available for the treatment allocation arm of GLPG1690 200 mg in order to ensure the same number of steps as the other treatment allocation arms and to ensure blinding (for details, refer to Sections 4.1 and 5.2). The different steps are blinded for treatment allocation but not for dose level. The blind ca n be broken only if the investigator deems it necessary for the safety of a subject . The investigator is encouraged to discuss considerations to break the blind with the CRO"

However, the responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situations resides solely with the investigator. The investigator is not required to discuss unblinding beforehand if he/she feels rapid emergency unblinding is necessary, but is required to inform the CRO medical monitor and sponsor in a timely fashion after unblinding has occurred. The blind can be broken by the investigator via the IWRS. If the blind is broken for any reason during the course of the study, the moment on which the subject ’s data were unblinded and all other relevant information will be documented by the clinical study center, the CRO, and other sponsor designees, as appropriate. The reason for breaking the blind will be indicated and justified in the source documentation and in the CRF. Code -break information (via IWRS vendor/randomization list) will be provided to the bioanalytical laboratory responsible for plasma drug determination sampl e analysis and to the sponsor pharmacovigilance lead for SAE reporting purposes. The IDMC will have access to unblinded data (for details, refer to Section 8.1). 5. INVESTIGATIONAL MEDI CINAL PRODUCT 5.1. IDENTITY OF THE INVE STIGATIONAL MEDICINA L PRODUCT The IMPs (GLPG1690 and placebo) will be supplied to the clinical study center, by and under the responsibility of the sponsor, who will also provide the investigator with European Union Qualified Person release documents.

Subjects will be instructed to swallow the tablets as a whole with a glass of water and to not chew the drug prior to swallowing. On visit days, subjects will be instructed to take their IMP at the clinical study center, to allow for predose (i.e. before IMP intake) assessments to be completed. At Visits 3, 9, and 12, the subject will be asked to take pirfenidone or nintedanib (if applicable) at the clinical study center. If a subject misses a dose (e.g. because he/she forgot to take the medication), he/she should take the missed dose within 12 hours after the planned intake time and within 2 hours of food intake. If the IMP is not taken within 12 hours after the planned time, the missed dose should be skipped. The IMP is to be taken q.d. at the same time every day with food (e.g. breakfast, small meal, or a snack) or after food intake, taking into account the timing of the planned visits, with a maximum of 2 hours between the food intake and IMP intake . For subjects w ho are taking nintedanib as standard of care medication at screening or randomization or who start nintedanib during the study, it is recommended to take the IMP at or after lunch (approximately 4 hours after nintedanib morning intake) . 5.3. PACKAGING, LABELIN G, AND DISTRIBUTION The film-coated tablet for oral use will be packaged in blisters. All manufacturing, packaging, and labeling operations will be performed according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for Medicinal Products and the relevant regulator y requirements. Each medication kit will be identified with a unique kit number. A multiple of kits will be provided to the subject at each visit , providing the subject with sufficient tablets to cover the period until the next scheduled visit. The distri bution to the clinical study center will only occur after all required documentation is obtained including clinical study approval by Competent Authorities and the IECs/IRBs,"

The IMP is to be dispensed according to the protocol. In case study subjects cannot attend site visits, due to any COVID -19-related reason, direct-to- patient (DT P) shipment of IMP has been implemented and can be used to ensure the dosing regimen per protocol requirement can be maintained . DTP should only be used in case of emergency where on -site I MP dispensing is not possible, and if allowed per local regulations. Local guidelines must be followed and regulatory approval or notification of authorities may be required . The DTP process used will be reviewed and approved by the sponsor . If the DTP shipments originate from the investigational site (s), their coordination will be ensured by the investigational site(s) in collaboration with the CRO to ensure clinical integrity without the involvement of the sponsor. Detailed guidance on the shipment has been provided to the sites in COVID -19 guidance documents. Consent of the subject s to receive I MP at home is required prior to the shipment of I MP, and should be documented in the source data . Return shipment of unused IMP from the subject s to the site may be implemented if allowed per local regulations. 5.4. STORAGE Clinical study centers are to store all drug supplies in a secure , locked area with limited access below 30°C, protected from light, until dispensed . Clinical study centers will be required to monitor the storage temperature by using at least a calibrated minimum -maximum temperature -recording device and to keep a minimum to maximum temperature log , which must be completed each working day in order to establish a record of compliance with these storage conditions. The investigator will instruct subject s on h ow the IMP should be stored at home . 5.5. TREATMENT COMPLIANCE AND DRUG ACCOUNTABI LITY For each dose taken at home , the date and number of tablets taken should be recorded on the subject diary card (see Section 6.4 for additional information). A new diary card will be provided together with each new medication kit. Any interruption or change in treatment (together with the reason for change) should be d ocumented on the subject diary card. The investigator or designated clinical study personnel will maintain a log of the total amount of IMP received at the clinical study center, amount dispensed to the subject , and the amount of IMP returned by the subjec t to the clinical study center. IMP supplies for each subject will be inventoried and accounted for throughout the clinical study . These records will be checked against the inventory by the study monitor on a regular basis . All clinical supplies will be st ored in locked facilities. Subject s will return any unused IMP and empty IMP packages at each study visit. Missed doses should be discussed to try to ascertain the reason(s). Every effort should be made to ensure proper subject dosing. Subject s with poor c ompliance will be re -trained by the clinical study center. Treatment compliance will be assessed by the investigator or designee. At each visit, clinical study center staff will review treatment compliance by assessing the number of returned IMP."

Note: If needed, an HRCT needs to be planned and performed during the screening period before Visit 2. This can be done during an unsc heduled visit in the screening period. A repeat HRCT is only allowed to be performed once for study eligibility; if the HRCT is >12 months old; or if the available historic HRCT cannot be evaluated. As soon as possible after signing the ICF, the investigat or will transmit the HRCT images and the LB specimens (if available) for review (for details, refer to Section 6.3 and Appendix 1 ). Subjects can only proceed to Visit 2 if the diagnosis of IPF is confirmed by central reading of the chest HRCT and (if available) LB, and if all other test results with the exception of ECG (if a retest is needed) allow the subject to proceed .

The visit windows for Visits 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 may be increased to ±7 days and the visit windows for Visit 9 and Visit 12 may be increased to ±28 days. At each visit, the subject will continue the intake of IMP (if confirmed by the responsible investigator or delegate, as detailed below) and will be supplied with IMP to cover the extended visit windows (as described in Section 5.3). Urine pregnancy tests (if applicable) and subject diary cards may also be supplied to the subject’s home. Assessments and Activities to be performed at remote and on -site visits For Visit 4 and all visits thereafter , if a randomized subject is not able to attend a scheduled study visit on site and a phone/televisit is conducted instead , then the study assessments should be conducted according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 6.11) as much as possible , in particular for Visits 9 and 12. If possible and available , trained study staff or trained personnel are encouraged to carry out study assessmen ts at the subjec t’s home or another remote location (i.e. conduct phone call first, then conduct home/remote location visit). Sites should assess risk to subjects’ safety incurred by home (or other remote location) visits and ensure that the staff sent to the subject ’s home do not pose a risk of infection to the subject or vice versa. At the phone/ televisits or home (or other remote location) visits, the investigator should collect information on adverse events (changes of ongoing or new events), changes i n concomitant medications or standard of care, and enquire about ongoing IMP intake (completion of subject diary cards). At the home (or other remote location) visits, the following assessments should be performed (if appropriate as per Schedule of Activi ties, Section 6.11). If it is not possible to perform all assessments, every effort should be made to complete the assessments indicated with an asteri sk (*) − physical examination (including weight) * − vital signs assessment * − safety blood sample collection for central laboratory assessment where possible or local laboratory assessment (if sampling conditions as per lab oratory manual cannot be ensured) * − spirome try (using the study device) * − 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) using the study device if possible or local assessment * − electronic clinical outcome assessment (eCOA) collection using the tablet device provided for the study * − − urine pregnancy test (if applicable ) * In addition, all efforts should be made to review and collect the subject diary card s and perform drug accountability as well as retrieving the (un)used IMP blisters."

Blood samples for PK, should not be collected at home visits. Additional guidance for on -site visits If an on -site visit for randomized subjects is feasible , all assessments for the applicable visit should be performed according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 6.11). However, if it is not possible to conduct all the assessments, then the following assessments/activities should be prioritized : − adverse events (changes of ongoing or new events) as well as information on hospitalization between visits − changes in concomitant medications or standard of care, enquiring about ongoing IMP intake (completion of subject diary cards), as well accountability and return of (un)used IMP blisters − vital signs − safety blood sample collection (for central lab oratory ) − spirometry and ECG (using the study devices) − eCOA (using the table t device provided for the study) − 6MWT − DLCO − Urine pregnancy test ( if applicable) Guid ance on continuation of IMP during the COVID -19 pandemic The ultimate decision to continue or interrupt IMP remains with the investigator except when three consecutive on-site visits have been missed and could not be replaced by phone/televisits, home (or other remote location) visits, and/or local lab assessments , or if the safety assessments could not be performed within the indicated time periods . In these cases, IMP should be interrupted. In general, t he decision on IMP continuation shall depend on the investigator’s assessment of the subject’s clinical condition, and on the occurrence and severity of adverse events and the results of laboratory assessments. Timely ( in accordance to adjusted visit windows ) local safety lab oratory assessment and home/local ECG ( if possible), are strongly recommended to support the decision regarding continuation of IMP. If these assessments are not feasible, then the investigator shoul d collect minimal assessments, such as physical condition, adverse events, and concomitant medi cation to help decide on the subject’s continuation of IMP. If only phone/televisit s are possible, the decision to continue IMP may be based on this information. The following criteria should be adhered to when making the decision on continuation of IMP and every effort should be made to capture safety assessments to ensure IMP can be continued . The recommendations are specific to the study phase:"
71,page_71,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 72/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information First phase: In case of missing visits between Visit 4 to Visit 8 (Week 2 to Week 18) , safety assessments must be performed within an 8 -week timeframe . Second phase: In case of missing visits between Vis it 9 to Visit 12 (Week 26 to Week 52) , safety assessments must be performed within a 12 -week timeframe. Third phase: After Visit 12 (Week 52 to End of Study) , safety assessments must be performed within a 16 -week timeframe. If during any of these phases, safety assessments at home or at an other remote location are not feasible, then at a minimum, local lab oratory evaluation s are needed to evaluate if the subject can continue IMP. ECG alternatives are to be discussed with the medical mo nitor. If IMP was interrupted , once safety assessments as specified above have been performed , the investigator may consider the re-start of IMP. 6.2. UNSCHEDULED VISITS Additional visits can be performed at other time points for any safety assessment if clinically indicated. If local regulations allow, home visits can be performed for safety la boratory sampling at the investigator’s discretion. These unscheduled visits and outcomes of additional assessments need to be recorded in the source and , if performed before the subject’s last visit per protocol, also in the CRF . 6.3. INITIAL SUBJECT AND DISEA SE CHARACTERISTI CS Subject s will be asked to attend the clinical study center for two screening visits, after giving written informed consent. The subject can only proceed to Visit 2 (screening visit 2) if the diagnosis of IPF is confirmed by central reading of the chest HRCT and by central review of the available LB, if required (according to the criteria in Appendix 1), and if all other te st results of Visit 1 allow the subject to proceed . Retesting of individual screening assessment(s) that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, with the following exceptions AND only in case it is still possible to randomize the subject withi n the per protocol defined screening period of 28 days: − Laboratory values for LFTs, creatinine clearance, and Hb can be retested once − Lost or invalid blood or urine samples Rescreening: in case of screening failure, subjects are allowed to be rescreened a maximum of two times, with an interval taking into account the eligibility cri teria at the investigator’s discretion . When in doubt, the investigator can discuss rescreening with the CRO medical monitor (as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physic ian (if the former is not available), on a case -by-case basis. Rescreening with the purpose to repeat a HRCT scan, is not allowed. If rescreened, the subject must be reconsented. The subject will be assigned a new subject number which will be linked to the first screening number."

Central reading will be performed by two readers for the confirmation of the IPF diagnosis through: − Central review of chest HRCT, with adjudication by a third reader, if necessary − Central review of LB (if available) will be performed by one reader Note that both the chest HRCT and LB (if available) need to be sent to central r eview as soon as possible after signing the ICF to allow for central reading and confirmation of IPF diagnosis before Visit 2. Additional details are provided in Appendix 1. If needed, an HRCT needs to be planned and performed during the screening period before Visit 2. If an historical LB is available it can be used for the assessment of eligibility, but no new biopsy is required. For subjects on ninte danib, the time of last nintedanib intake on the day of Visit 1 will be verified by the investigator, and subjects will have blood samples taken for PK at Visit 1 between 2 -4 hours; and 5 -10 hours after the intake of nintedanib. In addition, at the first s creening visit, information on demographics (age, sex, and race) and medical history (including the multidisciplinary diagnosis of IPF at the clinical study center if present, the duration of disease, disease progression prior to screening [inclusion crite rion], prior [up to 12 weeks] and concomitant medications [for IPF and other co -morbidities], contraception, alcohol consumption, and smoking habits) will be collected. A full physical examination will take place (including measurement of height and weight ) and vital signs, , triplicate ECG, clinical laboratory assessments (including serology, FSH [if applicable]), serum pregnancy test (if applicable), spirometry , DLCO , 6MWT , and EQ -5D, SGRQ, LCQ, K -BILD, VAS Cough and Urge to Cough questionnaires will be conducted to determine the subject ’s eligibility for study participation. Visit 2 At Visit 2, a second spirometry will be performed, as well as and the oxygen titration test for the 6MWT test . For the oxygen titration test , resting SpO 2 should be ≥88% with maximum 6 L O 2/minute . During the walk, SpO 2 should be ≥83% with maximum 6 L O2/minute or ≥88% with 0, 2, or 4 L O 2/minute . During the screening period, two spirometry measurements will be performed on different visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2) . Both measurements need to meet acceptability and repeatability criteria as specified by the most recent ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines [ 19]. If repeat values are within the acceptability criteria and completed within the screening window for the two scre ening visits, the subject is eligible for the study. At the screening visits, central review of the spirometry will be performed as much as possible during the visit. In case the acceptability and repeatability criteria as specified by ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT gu idelines are not met, a repeat spirometry should be performed during the same visit , ideally within 1 hour time.

Pulmonary Function 6.5.1.1. Spirometry Spirometry will be performed at the clinical study center before IMP intake and repeated after IMP intak e if indicated (see below) to assess pulmonary function at the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 6.11) and according to t he sequence of study assessments described in Section 6.1. Clinical study centers will be provided with spirometers to be used for all study spirometry assessment s. Spirometry devices will not be used for other purposes than this study. The clinical study center -based spirometry must meet the criteria for acceptability and repeatability as defined in the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines [ 19] for screening , and will be based on ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines after randomization."
74,page_74,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 75/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information Pulmonary function will be measured in a standardized manner and results should be transmitted electronically during the visit immediately after performing the spirometry and evaluated by a central reader. In case the acceptability and repeatability criter ia as specified by ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines are not met, a repeat spirometry should be performed during the same visit of the screening period. After randomization, a repeat spirometry should be performed during the same visit, based on the ATS/ERS/JRS/ ALAT guidelines [19]. Timing of spirometry The spirometry test is to be performed preferably at approximately the same time every visit. All spirometry evaluations should be performed pre -bronchodilator. Pre -bronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for a subject who has: − withheld their short -acting β -agonist (e.g. albuterol) or anticholinergic (e.g. ipratropium bromide) for >6 hours prior to the spirometry assessment AND − withheld their long -acting bronchodilator (e.g. salmeterol, formoterol) for ≥12 hours and other longer -acting agents (e.g. indacaterol, tiotropium) for ≥24 hours prior to the spirometry assessment In case the subject is on bronchodilators, he/she can use the bronchodilator at the end of the visit, after acceptability and repeatability as specified by or based on ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines [19] has been confirmed by the central reader for the spirometry test. In case the subject has taken a bronchodilator before spirometry, the visit should be re -scheduled within the foreseen timeframe to allow spirometry assessment without bronchodil ator. Spirometry parameters and calculation of predicted values The following parameters will be measured or calculated as part of the spirometry assessment: − FVC (mL) and %FVC − FEV 1 (mL) and percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%FEV 1) − FEV 1/FVC ratio − Forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of exhaled volume (FEF 25-75) The ‘2012 Global Lung Function Initiative Equations’ will be used to calculate the predicted values [ 27]. If subjects, due to any COVID -19-related reason, cannot attend visits on site, see Section 6.1.1 . 6.5.1.2. DLCO The DLCO test, correct ed for Hb, w ill be performed according to local practice at the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 6.11). Each DLCO test should be performed using the same equipment. If subjects, due to any COVID -19-related reason, cannot attend visits on site, see Section 6.1.1 ."

The SGRQ is a 50 -item questionnaire split into three domains: symptoms (assessing the frequency and severity of respiratory symptoms), activity (assessing the effects of breathlessness on mobility and physical activity) , and impact (assessing the psychosocial impact of the disease). Scores are weighted such that every domain score and the total score range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicat ing a poorer health -related quality of life. The K -BILD health status questionnaire is a 15 -item questionnaire split into three domains: psychological, breathlessness and activities, and chest symptoms. Scores are weighted such that every domain score and the total score range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better health status. Subject s with IPF commonly present with a (severe) non -productive cough. Cough will be evaluated using the LCQ. The LCQ is a 19 -item questionnaire split into three domains: physical, psychological, and social. Scores are calculated by domain (range from 1 to 7) and then added to obtain the total score (range from 3 to 21, with higher scores indicating a better health status). VAS Cough and Urge to Cough will use a V AS of 100 mm with extremes “no cough” to “worst possible cough”, and “no ur ge” to “highest urge to cough”. These questionnaires will be completed electronically, using a tablet device at the clinical study center. Subject s must be able to read and complete the EQ -5D, SGRQ, K -BILD questionnaire, LCQ , and VAS Cough and Urge to Cough by themselves. They should not receive any help from anyone (such as family and friends or study staff) in interpreting or responding to the questions and need to complete the que stionnaires in a quiet environment at the clinical study center. If subjects, due to any COVID -19-related reason, cannot attend visits on site, see Section 6.1.1 . 6.5.4. Functional Exercise Capacity Testing: 6MWT A 6MWT will be performed at the clinical study center to assess pulmonary function at the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities (Secti on 6.11), and according to the manual provided . The 6MWT measures the distance that a subject can walk at his/her pace on measured, flat hard surface in a period of 6 minutes. The 6MWT has been established as the walk test of choice in cardiorespiratory diseases. The change in 6 -Minute Walk Distance has been found to be highly predictive of mortality [ 6]. Also, the Minimal Clinical Important Difference (MCID) has been validated [ 21]. The 6MWT will be performed based on the ATS recommendations [ 1] . The subject should not have a contra indication to perform the 6MWT at any visit during screening and during the treatment period. Contraindications for performing the 6MWT are provided in Appendix 10."

The use of a cane is allowed , the use of a stroller is not allowed at all for any conditi on. The test is performed under the usual conditions for the patient, with or without oxygen as applicable . At Visit 2, an oxygen titration test will be performed, according to the manual description. The subject should not have a contra indication to perfo rm the 6MWT. For the oxygen titration test , resting SpO 2 should be ≥88% with maximum 6 L O 2/min. During the walk, SpO 2 should be ≥83% with maximum 6 L O 2/minute or ≥88% with 0, 2 or 4 L O 2/minute. A subject will not be eligible if these criteria are not met. For each following visit, the subject should not have a contra indication to perform the 6MWT. At Visit 3, 6MWT will be performed before IMP intake. For all visits after Visit 3 (Visit s 9 and 12, and every 24 weeks thereafter), 6MWT will be performed a fter IMP intake. The 6MWT will be done under the same oxygen requirements as the final result in the oxygen titration period (Visit 2).

Clinic al Laboratory Evaluations Blood samples will be collected before IMP intake by venipuncture (or indwelling catheter) at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities provided in Section 6.11 (see also Section 6.1). In addition, urine samples for the clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected. Subject s do not need to be fasted at the time of sampling , unless specifically indicated . Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed by the central laboratory. Blood and urine samples will be collected for the following clinical laboratory safety tes ts: - Hematology : hematocrit , mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin ( MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) , Hb, red blood cell count, white blood cell (WBC) count, WBC differential count (absolute and relative), and plat elets. - Coagulation : activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time , INR . - Clinical chemistry : random glucose, urea, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, phosphorus, AST, ALT, GGT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, total serum bile acid, albumin, total proteins, triglycerides, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, amylase, lipase, and creatine kinase (CK) (CK- muscle/brain [CK -MB] to be performed if CK is elevated) . - Urinalysis : • Dipstick: pH, glucose, proteins, blood, leucocytes; • Microscopic examination of the sediment (cylinders, erythrocytes, leucocytes), if indicated. - Serology : hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody, and HIV 1 and HIV 2 antibodies onl y at screening. Positive hepatitis and HIV results should be reported by the investigator as required by local law. To assess eligibility, a positive hepatitis C antibody test should be confirmed by hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA test. - FSH test for females at screening to confirm menopause, if applicable. - Urine pregnancy tests will be performed (only for WOCBP ) on a monthly basis at home or at the clinical study center , with one additional test at the clinical study center at Visit 4. At screening, a serum pre gnancy test (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) will be performed. A positive urine pregnancy test needs to be confirmed a s soon as possible by a serum pregnancy test (local sample; central sample to be sent as well). Reference ranges will be supplied by t he central laboratory. Clinical laboratory values outside the normal range will be flagged and clinical relevance will be assessed by the investigator. Clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities as judged by the investigator should be recorded as AEs. More frequent sampling as well as additional tests may be performed as deemed necessary by the investigator to follow up and resolve any safety concerns. In some circumstances, local laboratory results are allowed to be used ( e.g. positive urine pregnancy test, abnormal liver function tests) for diagnosis of decision, but a central sample should also be collected and analyzed . The details of sample collection, handling, storage, and shipment instructions will be provided in a separate laboratory m anual."

Physical Examination Physical examinations (including weight) will be conducted by a physician, trained physician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner (as acceptable according to local regulations) before IMP intake at visits specified in the Schedule of Activities in Section 6.11 (see also Section 6.1). At screening, height will be measured as well. The person conducting the physical examinations will document this in the subject ’s medical records. Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as AEs . 6.6.4. Vital Signs Vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, SBP and DBP, and body temperature) will be recorded before IMP intake in a standardized manner (i.e. after the subject has rested in a supine position for 5 minutes) at visits specified in the Schedule of Activities in Section 6.11 (see also Section 6.1). Vital sign parameter normal ranges are presented in Appendix 8. Clin ically significant abnormal values should be recorded as AEs. 6.6.5. Electrocardiogram At the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities ( see Section 6.11 and also Section 6.1), an ECG will be recorded. Triplicate ECGs will be performed at Visit 1 and at Visits 3 and 4 (before and 2-3 hours after IMP intake ). At all other time points, a single ECG will be performed before IMP intake (or irrespective of IMP intake at the E TD [if applicable] and EoST /EoSA visits ). In addition, a single ECG will also be performed between 2 to 3 hours after IMP intake at Visits 5, 7, and 10. Central reading will be performed for all ECGs at all time points. The ECG must be taken after subject s rested for at least 5 minutes in the supine position. Triplicate ECGs will be taken within preferably 6 minutes, with an approximate 2 -minute interval between ECGs. Each ECG will be interpreted by the investigator for clinical significance at the moment of the measurement. In case of abnormal findings, even if not clinically significant, a repeat ECG will be performed as soon as possible aft er the original abnormal recording within the same visit (if possible) and interpreted by the investigator. If the abnormal recording is discovered after the visit, the recording should be confirmed as soon as possible . For Visit 3, triplicate abnormal QTcF >450 msec (as described in exclusion criterion 8) predose readings (and confirmatory repeat as soon as possible after the abnormal recording within the same visit if possible ) need to be transmitted immediately to the central reader for review before IMP intake by the subject . The result of the review will be transmitted to the investigator and preferably the CRO medical monitor (as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available) . The decision to dose the subject will be taken by the investigator, after consultation with the CRO medical monitor (as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available). In case a timely response from the central reader is not available, the investiga tor will decide whether to dose the subject or not. If the QTcF at Visit 3 predose is reported during the visit as normal, but the overread by the cardiologist reports a QTcF >450 ms, then the recording should be confirmed as soon as possible and the inves tigator needs to justify the continuation of IMP documenting this in the source and continue to monitor the patient . At Visit 3 (after IMP intake) and Visit 4 (before and after IMP intake) , abnormal triplicate ECGs and their confirmatory repeat reading wil l be transmitted to the central reader for expedited review. Refer to Section 4.5.4 for details on abnormal ECG readings."
80,page_80,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 81/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information For other time points with abnormal ECG r eading, the investigator should alert the central reader. In that case, the ECG will be reviewed as soon as possible on the same day. The conclusion/evaluation of the central cardiologist reader will overrule the reading of the ECG device . At other time po ints with normal ECG reading , the standard review times will be adhered to. In case an indwelling catheter is used, ECGs may be recorded after blood sampling, provided that there is at least 30 minutes between catheter insertion and the ECG recording. When catheter insertion would fail, the ECG needs to be taken before the venipun cture and at least 30 minutes after the failed attempt. ECG parameters to be recorded include the following: heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, uncorrected QT interval, QTc, morphology, and rhythm. QTcF will be considered as normal if ≤450 ms. A prolo ngation of QTcF to >500 ms or an increase from baseline of >60 ms will be considered a threshold of concern and the subject should be discontinued (for details, refer to Section 4.5.4 ). Normal ranges for ECG are provided in Appendix 8. ECG abnormalities will be interpreted by the investigator for clinical signifi cance. Clinically significant abnormal values should be recorded as AEs. If subjects, due to any COVID -19-related reason, cannot attend visits on site, see Section 6.1.1 . 6.7. PHARMACOKINETIC ASSE SSMENTS PK assessments will include concentration analysis of GLPG1690 , pirfenidone and nintedanib . Plasma concentrations of GLPG1690 , pirfenidone or nintedanib will be measured using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) method and will be performed by the bioanalytical laboratory in charge of these analyses (A RDENA Biochemical Laboratory). To be able to investigate the potential interactions between GLPG1690 and pirfenidone or nintedanib , the following samples will be collected to measure levels of GLPG1690 and pirfenidone or nintedanib (also see Table 1, and Schedule of Activities in Section 6.11). For subjects taking neither pirfenidone nor nintedanib, the samples need to be collected in relation to the specified IMP intake. − At Visit 1 (screening), f or patients on nintedanib, the time of morning nintedanib intake will be verified by the investigator. Blood samples will be taken between 2 -4 hours; and 5-10 hours after the morning intake of nintedanib. − At Visits 3, 9, and 12, samples will be collected before IMP and pirfenidone or nintedanib morning intake. At these visits, the subject needs to take pirfenidone or nintedanib (as applicable) at the clinical study center. − For subjects taking nintedanib at screening and randomization, until they stop taking nintedanib: • At Visit 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, samples will be collected 2 -6 hours after the morning nintedanib intake and before IMP intake.

STATISTICAL METHODS All statistical methods shall be detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) that will be finalized prior to the database lock and unblinding. Data collected in this clinical study will be documented using summary tables, figures, and subject data listings, as appropriate. All statistical analyses will be performed by the CRO using the SAS (Version 9.1.3 or higher) software for statistical computations and SAS or R Studio for graphical purposes. Any deviations from the statistical analyses pl anned in this protocol will be documented in the SAP. A protocol deviations plan will include the definition of major and minor protocol deviations and the identification of major protocol deviations which will be excluded from the per -protocol analysis. T he assessments of protocol deviations (major/minor) will be done prior to database lock and unblinding. 7.1. DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE To account for multiple testing due to multiple doses, a Bonferroni approach [9] will be applied to the alpha level with higher priority given to the high -dose group. The primary endpoint will be tested at a 4% level when comparing GLPG1690 600 mg to placebo and a 1% level for GLPG1690 200 mg group versus placebo. Denoting ∆ 600 and ∆ 200, the true treatment differences of the two GLPG1690 treatment group s with placebo, and assuming a common standard deviation (SD) on the 52 weeks decline in FVC of 275 mL, the probabilities that 0, 1, or 2 treatment comparisons with placebo are statistically significant, are presented in Table 2. The family -wise error rate is protected at 5% using the Bonferroni proce dure. The so -called disjuncture power of the study is the probability that 1 or 2 hypotheses are rejected and is displayed in the right -most column of Table 2. A meta -analysis of the seven placebo -controlled studies that have been conducted on nintedanib, pirfenidone, and pamrevlumab has revealed that the treatment effect at 52 weeks is estimated to be approximately 119 mL in a treatment -naïve population, the effect observed with nintedanib alone is similar (112 mL) [32]. Little information is available on the expected treatment effect of GLPG1690 in addition to pirfenidone or nintedanib . Table 2 gives an overview of the power for different scenarios for the overall tr eatment effect in the population of subjects on standard of care ( either pirfenidone or nintedanib, or neither pirfenidone nor nintedanib). Since the linear -slope model on the annual rate of decline in FVC accounts for missing data, the number of subjects randomized and the number of subjects included in the model is expected to be equal. An equal number of 250 subjects will be randomized to each treatment group to have at least 80% power to show a significant effect assuming the 600 -mg group has a treatme nt effect of at least 80 mL in the overall population of treatment -naïve and patients on standard of care."

General Statistical Considerations Summary tabulations will be presented and will display the number of observations, mean, SD or standard error, as appropriate, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, and the number and percentage per category for categorical data. In addition to tabulated descriptive statistics, graphical data displays may be used to summarize the data. Unless otherwise noted, inferential statistics will be interpreted at the two -sided 5% level. 7.3.2. Interim Analysis An IDMC will review the data of this study and the identical ly designed GLPG1690 -CL-304 study on a regular basis . An interim analysis to assess futility will be performed when a reasonable number of subject s have completed 52 weeks of t reatment ( e.g. at least 25% subjects from the two studies combined ). No interim analysis for early termination for efficacy will be performed and therefore no adjustment of the alpha level is necessary. Details on the IDMC are given in Section 8.1 and in the charter. 7.3.3. Analyses of Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Summary statistics (mean, median, SD, minimum, maximum, number of available observations) will be provided by treatment group for continuous demographic variables (e.g. age, height, weight). Categorical endpoints will be presented by number and percentage of subject s per category. Results will be presented for the full analysis set (FAS). Subject disposition (including reasons for early discontinuation), protocol deviations, demographics, baseline characteristics, medical history, prior and concomitant ther apies, and use of IMP will be analyzed descriptively by treatment group and/or listed. No statistical inference will be performed. Medical history terms will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and presented by the number of subject s with at least one event by System Organ Class, Preferred Term, and treatment group. Prior and concomitant medications will be coded by the sponsor according to the World Health Organization (WHO) drug code and the Anatomical Therapeutic Classi fication (ATC) class code and tabulated by the number and percentages of subject s with a medication per ATC code and treatment group. 7.3.4. Analyses of Efficacy Parameters Multiplicity Adjustment To account for the multiple testing due to two doses being compare d to placebo, a Bonferroni approach [9] will be used with higher priority given to the high -dose group. The primary endpoint will be tested at a 4% level when comparing GLPG1690 600 mg to placebo and a 1% level for GLPG1690 200 mg group versus placebo."

Efficacy Analyses All efficacy parameters ( e.g. spirometry, clinical endpoints, quality of life) will be analyzed descriptively and FVC and %FVC will also be analyzed for a series of subgroups (such as baseline characteristics , back ground treatment , and stratum ). The primary analyses will be conducted on the FAS population. Spirometry Data − The primary time point will be Week 52. Analyses at the end of the study are secondary . − The rate of decline in FVC will be analyzed using a random coefficient regression model (linear slope model) including sex, age, height, and stratification factor as covariates and a random intercept and slope. The treatment effect is determined by using esti mated average slopes for each treatment group on the basis of the treatment*time interaction term from the above mixed model, with time as a continuous factor and treatment as a categorical factor . All available FVC values from baseline to Week 52 will primarily be used, including those from the E TD visit for subjects who discontinued early and do not complete their study visits up to Week 52. − As a secondary analysis , the same model will be fit using all data until the end of the study . − The proportion of subjects who have an absolute decline ≥10% in %FVC at least once during the study or who die will be analyzed using logistic regression including sex, age, height, and stratum as factors using data up to Week 52. − In addition, the same will be presented us ing all data up to the end of the study . A time-to-event analysis may also be used to analyze the composite endpoint of %FVC decline and mortality up to the end of the study. − The %FVC change from baseline will be analyzed using a similar random coefficient regression model (linear slope model) as FVC in mL. − Other spirometry endpoints will be summarized descriptively, similar to FVC."

CLINICAL ENDPOINT AD JUDICATION COMMITTEE The CEAC will consist of an independent group of experts that reviews and adjudicates clinical endpoints (see Section 6.5.2 ), as defined by the charter, in a blinded manner. Thi s objective data adjudication will reduce variation in outcome reporting and observer bias. 8.3. ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL INDEPENDENT REVIEW O F SAFETY DATA Selected safety data associated with liver function test (with or without symptoms) may be subjected to revie w in blinded manner by an independent expert panel as needed . 9. SAFETY REPORTING 9.1. DEFINITIONS OF ADVER SE EVENTS, SERIOUS A DVERSE EVENTS , AND SPECIAL SITUAT IONS 9.1.1. Adverse Events An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, new or worsening of any preexisting condition, in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily ha s to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related. AEs may also include pre - or posttreatment complication s that occur as a result of protocol -specified procedures, worsening of the targeted disease, overdose, drug abuse/misuse reports, or occupational exposure. Preexisting conditions that increase in severity or change in nature during or as a consequence of participation in the clinical study will also be considered AEs. 9.1.2. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is defined as an AE that results in the following: - Death. - Life-threatening (Note: the term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were m ore severe). - In-subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. - Persistent or significant disability/incapacity. - A congenital anomaly/birth defect."
103,page_103,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 104/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information - Medically significant (medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious such as important medical events that might not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the subject or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above). 9.1.3. Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information An AE is considered unlisted if the nature or intensity is not consistent with the applicable product reference safety information. For a n IMP, the expectedness of an AE will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the reference safety information part of the IB ( Edition 6, 28 - Jun-2019 ) and any relevant updates/addenda. 9.1.4. Adverse Events of Special Interest Not applicable. 9.1.5. Clinical Laborat ory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance based on the investigator’s judgment, are not considered AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities (e.g . clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) or other abnormal (clinical study -specific) assessments (e.g. ECG, radiography, vital signs) that require medical or surgical intervention, are associated with signs and/or symptoms, or lead to IMP interrup tion, modification, or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition as described in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 , respectively. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, the syndrome or diagnosis is to be reported (e.g. anemia instead of decreased Hb). The following liver enzyme elevations should be reported as SAEs : − AST or ALT ≥8xULN − AST or ALT ≥3xULN with signs of severe liver damage (i.e. with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia [>5%], and/ or total bilirubin ≥1.5xULN or INR >1.5) 9.1.6. Special Situations Special situations are situations that have a possible impact on the safe use of IMP. These situations might be or might not be associated with AEs. The investigator must report the following special situations within 24 hours of becoming aware , as indicated on Page 2 under “Emergency Contact Information”: − Pregnancy − Abuse or misuse of study drug • Abuse of study drug is defined as the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study drug, which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects. • Misuse of study drug is defined as a situation where the study drug is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the product information."
104,page_104,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 105/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information − Drug interaction or food interaction with study drug • A drug interaction with study drug is defined as a situation in which there is evidence or a suspicion that the study drug interacts with another drug when both are administered together. • A food interaction with study drug is d efined as a situation in which there is evidence or a suspicion that the study drug interacts with a food when taken together. − Medication error with study drug • A medication error with study drug is defined as an unintended failure in the drug treatment pro cess that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient. − Occupational exposure to study drug • Occupational exposure with study drug is defined as an exposure to the study drug as a result of one’s professional or non -professional occupation . − Overdose with study drug • An overdose of study drug is defined as the administration of a quantity of the study drug given per administration or cumulatively, which is the intake of more than three tablets/day . − Product complaint or quality defect of study drug • Product complaint or quality defect of study drug is defined as complaints or defects of the study drug arising from potential deviations in the manufacture, packaging, or distribution of the study drug. 9.2. ASSESSMENT OF ADVERS E EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVER SE EVENTS The investigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for causality and severity. This is the basis for the sponsor’s final review and confirmation of accuracy and completeness of event information and causality assessments. 9.2.1. Assessment of Ca usality The investigator is responsible for assessing the causal relationship to IMP administration or study procedures (e.g. invasive procedures such as venipuncture) based on her/his clinical judgment. The following decision choice will be used by the investigator to describe the causality assessment between the reported event or labora tory test abnormality and the IMP. - Unrelated : − Relationship in time to IMP intake is improbable. Related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or subject 's clinical state. - Unlikely : − Relationship in time to IMP intake is improbable (but not impossible). Concomitant disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations. - Possible : − Relationship in time to IMP intake is reasonable. Event or laboratory test abnormality, could also be explained by disease or other dru gs. Information on IMP withdrawal may be lacking or unclear."
105,page_105,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 106/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information - Probable : − Relationship in time to IMP intake is reasonable. Unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs. Response to withdrawal is clinically reasonable and rechallenge not req uired. - Certain : − Relationship in time to IMP intake is plausible. Cannot be explained by concomitant disease or other drugs. Response to withdrawal is plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically). Event definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically (i .e. an objective and specific medical disorder or a recognized pharmacological phenomenon). Rechallenge satisfactory, if ethical and necessary. It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment (worsening of the disease) should not be considered as causal ly related in the context of AE reporting. 9.2.2. Assessment of Severity The severity of AEs should be graded using the CTCAE version 5.0 . If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate) , Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life -threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency with the CTCAE, these intensity grades are defined in Table 3. Table 3: Grading of AE Severity Grade Adjective Description Grade 1 Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated Grade 2 Moderate Local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL* Grade 3 Severe Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling ; limiting self -care ADL** Grade 4 Life-threatening Urgent intervention indicated Grade 5 Death Death -related AE * Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. ** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. For AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions; this may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality. This is upon the investigator’s assessment. If there is a change in intensity (worsening or improvement) of a n AE, it must be recorded. 9.2.3. Outcome Each AE must be rated by choosing among: − Recovered /resolved ; − Recovered /resolved with sequelae; − Recovering /resolving ; − Not recovered /not resolved ;"
106,page_106,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 107/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information − Fatal; − Unknown. 9.3. INVESTIGATOR REQUIRE MENTS AND INSTRUCTIO NS FOR REPORTING ADV ERSE EVENTS / SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS /PREGNANCIES AND OTHER SPECIAL S ITUATIONS TO THE SPONSOR 9.3.1. Adverse Events The AE reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject signs the ICF and ends at the subject ’s last follow -up visit (the last foll ow-up visit after the last dose of IMP). In this period, all new AEs , regardless of cause or relationship, derived by spontaneous, unsolicited reports of subject s, by observation, and by routine open questioning (such as “How do you feel?”) need to be reco rded in the source and in the CRF. In case an AE is ongoing at the time of the last follow -up visit, the investigator needs to follow the subject until AE resolution or reasonable stabilization and to document in the subject ’s source documentation. No rel ated updates or additional data on the AE should be reported in the CRF. If a subject is documented as lost -to-follow -up, ongoing or unknown outcome AEs will not be followed up. If the AE meets the criteria for seriousness, the SAE form must be completed and sent to the sponsor within 24 hours (see Section 9.3.2 ). 9.3.2. Serious Adverse Events Subject s experiencing an SAE or an emergency situation will be examined by a physician as soon as possible. The subject will remain under observation as long as medically indicated. Appropriate laboratory tests will be performed until all parameters return to normal or are otherwise explained or stable. All SAEs, whether or not deemed IMP-related, must be recorded in the CRF and on the SAE form. The investigator must report each SAE immediately, and under no circumstances should this exceed 24 hours following the knowledge of the SAE, as is indicated on page 2 under “Emergency Contact Information”. The SAE form should at least contain identifiers of the subject and the reporter, SAE term, and statement of relatedness to the IMP, and at a later stage if not yet available within 24 hours, the form needs to be completed with a clearly written narrative describing signs, sympto ms, and treatment of the event, diagnostic procedures, as well as any relevant laboratory data and any sequelae. Follow -up and outcomes should be reported and documented in the source documents for all subject s that experience an SAE. It is important that the information provided on the SAE form matches the information recorded on the CRF for the same event. Copies of additional laboratory tests, consultation reports, post -mortem reports, hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents should be sent when requested and available."
107,page_107,"Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) GLPG1690 -CL-303 Page 108/132 Version 7.00, Final, 8 -Jun-2020 Confidential Information Only subject identifiers (subject number) should appear on the copies, and all names and initials should be blackened and rendered illegible. Follow -up reports relative to the subject ’s subsequent course must be submitte d until the event has subsided or, in case of permanent impairment, until the condition stabilizes. Any SAEs that occur after the posttreatment follow -up visit but within 30 days of the last dose of IMP, regardless of causality, should also be reported (Emergency Contact Information on page 2) . Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after the protocol -defined follow -up period. However, if the investigator is informed about an SAE that occur s at any time after the subject’s posttreatment follo w-up visit and the event is deemed relevant to the use of IMP(s), he/she should promptly document and report the event to the sponsor by using the SAE form. 9.3.3. Pregnancy All initial reports of pregnancy in female subject s and pregnancies in partners of male subject s included in the clinical study must be recorded and documented in the source documents and on the pregnancy form. The investigator must report each pregnancy immediately, and under no circumstances should this exceed 24 hours following the knowledg e of the pregnancy, as is indicated on Page 2 under “Emergency Contact Information”. All pregnancies should be followed up until delivery or pregnancy interruption. The investigator will contact the subject /partner of the subject at the expected time of de livery for follow -up and for information regarding the outcome of the newborn. Abnormal pregnancy and/or abnormal newborn outcomes are considered SAEs and must be reported using the SAE form. 9.3.4. Reporting of Special Situations (Other Than Pregnancy) and Assoc iated Adverse Events In case a special situation is not associated with an AE, the special situation should be reported within 24 hours by using the Special Situations form. In case a special situation is associated with an AE, the special situation should be reported within 24 hours by using the Special Situations form and the associated AE should be reported as specified in Section 9.3.1 . In case a special situation is associated with an SAE, the special situation should be reported within 24 hours by using the SAE form (and not the Special Situations form) and the associated SAE should be reported as specified in Section 9.3.2 . 9.4. SPONSOR REPORTING RE QUIREMENTS Depending on relevant local legislation or regulations, including the applicable United States Federal Drug Administration Code of Federal Regu lations, the European Union Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) and relevant updates, and other country -specific legislation or regulations, the sponsor may be required to expedite to worldwide regulatory agencies reports of SAEs, serious adverse drug r eactions, or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). The sponsor or a specified designee will notify worldwide regulatory agencies and the relevant IEC/IRB in concerned Member States of applicable SUSARs as outlined in current regulations."

Informed Consent The investigator or designated personnel must explain the clinical study and the implications of participation (e.g. objectives, methods, anticipated benefits, and possible risks) to potential subject s according to applicable regulations prior to any clinical study -related activity. Subject s will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the clinical study at any time. They will be informed that choosing not to participate o r to withdraw from the clinical study will not have an impact on the care the subject will receive for the treatment of his/her disease. In case the subject is unable to read and /or write, oral consent in the presence of at least one impartial witness who was also included when the affected person was being informed may be given. The witness may not be anyone working at the trial site nor a member of the investigating team. The orally given consent shall be documented in writing, dated and signe d by the witness. The subject will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and to ask additional questions. After this explanation and before entry in the clinical study, consent should be appropriately recorded by means of the subject 's personally dated signature (or, if applicable, by the signature of an independent witness who certifies the subject 's consent in writing) and by the investigator’s signature. After having obtained the consent, a copy of the signed and dated ICF must be given to the subjec t. If new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject ’s willingness to participate in the clinical study, the subject will be informed in a timely manner by means of an updated ICF. This amended ICF will be signed and dated by the subject (or, if applicable, by an independent witness) and the investigator to document the willingness of the subject to continue with the clinical study. This signed and dated amended version will be filed together with the initial signed and dated ICF. Additional consent needs to be obtained from the subjects to allow collection of the evaluation if approved by the local IEC/IRB (see also Section 6.9.2 ). A pregnant partner, who agrees that information will be gathered about her pregnancy, will sign a specific ICF to participate in the data collection. Data about the health of the baby will be collected if the parents agree with the data collection and sign the specific ICF."

The diagnostic criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, published as the Fleis chner Society White Paper [ 15], will be used to determine eligibility of the subject for the trial. In case a historical LB is available, this will be used as comple mentary information and will allow confirmation of UIP -IPF in certain cases. An algorithm to be used by the radiologists and the histopathologist to determine eligibility is available in the relevant manual. After central review of the HRCT, subjects will be considered eligible if: − The majority of the central readers evaluate the HRCT as showing a typical and/or probable IPF pattern, unless a historical LB, if available, is not in accor dance with this diagnosis (i.e. is most consistent with an alternative diagnosis) − The majority of the central readers evaluate the HRCT as showing a pattern indetermined for IPF and/or a pattern most consistent with non -IPF diagnosis, but an available historical LB, shows a definite UIP -IPF pattern. The LB will not be evaluat ed if both 2 initial central reviewers evaluate the HRCT as showing the following pattern: − Typical UIP -IPF pattern + Typical UIP -IPF pattern − IPF pattern most consistent with Non -IPF diagnosis + IPF pattern most consistent with Non-IPF diagnosis"
