A total of 366 subjects with PAD Fontaine Stage IIB will be enrolled in approximately 17 to 25 sites in 3 countries (Russia, Kazakhstan, and Georgia,). The study will consist of a 1- to 2-week Screening Period, Random izatio n, 12-week Treatment Period, and 12-week Follow -up Period.Theoverall study duration willbe25to26weeks. Subjects will enter a 1- to 2-week Screening Period during which, thestability ofthesubject’s conditio nwillbe verified, a diagnosis of PAD will be confirmed, and subjects with high variability in the absolute claudication distance (ACD) will be detected and excluded. For this purpose, 2treadmill tests will beperformed within a time interval of ≥1week (ie, 7 day s). Subjects havingachange ofmorethan 25% intheACD during theScreening Period willbeexcluded. Subjects with a confirmed history of stable intermittent claudication with symptoms that have been present continuously for at least 6 months at the time of Screening will be eligible for inclusion. Adiagnosis ofPAD (initial claudication distance [ICD] of<200 meters) willbeconfirmed by ultrasound color duplex imaging andtreadmill test. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either actovegin or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The treatment period will include 2 weeks ofintravenous (IV) infusions of actovegin (deproteinized hemoderivate) atadose of1200 mg/day , followed by 10 weeks of oral treatment in tablets at a dose of 1200 mg/day (two 200 mg ta blets 3 times daily [TID]). Matched placebo (solution forinfusion 0.9% NaCl andplacebo tablets) willbeused throughout thetreatment period to maintain blinding. Theoverall treatment duration willbe12weeks. A 12 -week follow -upperiod with no investigational medicinal product (IMP) treatment willfollow the12-week treatment period toexamine sustained efficacy after treatment aswell assafety once actovegin treatment hasstopped. During the active treatment period and follow -upperiod, patients will be allowed to receive other specific therapy for PAD with the exception of prohibited medications. Primary Objectives: The primary objective is to investigate the efficacy of actovegin for the symptomatic treatment of PAD Fontaine Stage IIB. Secondary Objectives: To investigate the effect of actovegin in sustained improvement in claudication distance of subjects with PAD Fontaine Stage IIB. To investigate the effect of actovegin on patients’ quality of life. Toevaluate thesafety ofactovegin compared toplacebo.

Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses: The primary endpoint is the percent change in ICD from Baseline to12weeks. The secondary endpoints are: The percent change in ICD from Baseline to 2and24weeks. The change in ACD from Baseline to 2, 12,and 24 weeks. Proportio n of patients having rest pain at 12 and 24 weeks. Proportio n of patients having revascularization procedures at 24 weeks. Change in 36 -item ShortForm Survey (SF-36) at12and24weeks. Statistical Considerations: The primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed in randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Percent change from Baseline in ICD and change from Baseline in SF -36 will be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) analysis of covariance with treatment, center, sex, age group, visit, treatment -by- visit interaction as fixed effects, Baseline as covariate, and subject as a random effect. Comparisons between actovegin and placebo will be performed on all assessment points. Based on a missing at random assumption, this analy sis will be performed using observed case data only. The effect at each time point for each treatment is allowed to vary freely and an unstructured covariance matrix is assumed. Proportio n of subjects having rest pain and proportion of patients having revascularization procedures will be analy zed at all time points by logistic regression adjusting for tre atment. Sample Size Justification: Assuming astandard deviation of85% forthepercent change fromBaseline inICD anda 20% drop -outrate, atotal of366subjects (183 per treatment group) is sufficient to achieve at least 80% power to detect a 28% diff erence in percent change from Baseline inICD between actovegin andplacebo by a 2-sample t-test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. The sample size justification is based on published data for the ICD for naftidrofuryl, for which the difference in percent change from Baseline in ICD between naftidrofuryl and placebo is approximately 28%, while the corresponding pooled standard deviation is approximately 85%.

PAD affects approximately 202 millio nadults worldwide [2]. The prevalence of PAD increases withage and the number of vascular risk factors (eg, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, hypercho lesterolemia, age, sex, family history) [1,3] . More importantly, it isamarker ofatherosclerotic disease burden, andisassociated withincreased mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular causes [1,3]. The decreased blood flow to the legs caused by PAD may be mild or severe, resulting ina broad range of symptoms. Patients may not suffer recognizable limb symptoms, or they may experience intermittent claudication (IC), or manifest symptoms of severe limb ischemia. IC, the most common symptom ofPAD, is defined as fatigue, cramping, or overt pain ofthegluteal,thigh,or calf muscles, thatisconsistent lyprovoked by exercise and that is reproducibly relieved by r est. Patients withIC are often limited in their daily activit ies owing to their walking impairment and inturn experience adiminished qualit yof life. With continued exposure to atherosclerotic risk factors, PAD mayprogress tocriticallimb ischemia, which portends asevere diminution inqualit y oflife,and is associated with ahigh rate of amputation and amarked increase in short term mortality. Thus, PAD isacommo n manifestation of atherosclerosis that is associated with arange ofsymptom s,avariable impact onquality oflife,andaheightened riskofcardiovascular ischemic events [ 1]. Actovegin is adeproteinized hemoderivate fromcalfblood thathasbeen made freeofpyrogens and ant igens through a stepwise ultrafiltration production process. Actovegin contains physio logicalblood components, including vitamins, amino acids, lipids, oligosaccharides and oligopeptides, nucleosides, intermediate products of carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism, as well as const ituents of cellular membranes, such as glycosphingolipids. It haspleiotropic metabolic,neuroprotective, and regenerative properti es [4]. Experimental studies have shown thatactovegin improves oxygen utilizati on and uptake, as well as energy metabolism andglucose uptake [ 5 -7].Actovegin has been shown to possess neuroprotective effects and to increase neuronal survival under ischemic conditions [8].It also reduces amylo idbeta-induced apoptosis alongwithdecreasing reacti veoxygenspeci esformation [9],modulates nuclear factor kappa Bactivity [10],andinhibits thenuclear enzyme poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase, which canalsopartially explain itsneuroprotective properties [ 11]. Actovegin exerts positive effects on microcirculation and microvascular endothelium, increasing capillary blood flowrate andreducing pericapillary zone and arteriolovenular shunt ingofblood flow [12]. Clinical efficacy data for actovegin provide evidence for thetreatment of disturbances of the cerebral circulationincluding dement ia [13,14] andpoststroke cognitiveimpair ment [14].Several rando mized controlled tri als and many uncontrolled studies have been conducted for these indications. Available clinical data alsosupport theuse of actovegin for the treatment of diabetic Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"

The efficacy data arealso supportive for peripheral perfusion disorders with positivestudy outcomes for maximal and pain -free walking distance in PAD and healing time invenous ulcer disease [ 16-20] . Actovegin received its first marketing authorization intheFederal Republic of Germ anyin1976 andremains on themarket in more than 20 countries (eg,in several countries in the Commonwealth ofIndependent States and in afew countries in Europe andAsia region). It exi sts in different formulations fororal, intravenous (IV), andintramuscula rusage. Actovegin has been approved for the following indications (which vary amongcountries): Symptom atictreatment of cogni tive impairment including post - stroke cognitiveimpairment and dement ia. Symptom atictreatment ofperipheral perfusion disorders and their sequelae. Symptom atictreatment of diabetic polyneuropathy. Actovegin has been used clinically for over 40years. Due toitscomposition ofbiological constituents present under normal physio logicalcondit ionsand stringent production process, the drug has an excellent safet yprofile, reflected by clinical experience equivalent to an exposure to the drug of more than 1,200,000 patient years (Periodic Safety Update Report [PSUR] 2014 submitted to the Austrian Agency forHealthandFood Safety). The profile o f adverse drug reacti ons(ADRs) has been consistent across PSURs without particular target organ toxicity. 4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study Actovegin has been used since the 1970s for the treatment of PAD of varying degrees of severit y. Several trialshave evaluated theefficacy ofactov egin (IV) inpatientswithmainlyFontaine Stage II and III PAD. Arandomized, open -label, 8-week study hasbeen conducted to investigate the effect of actovegin onischemic syndro meof the lower extrem itiesinpatientswith type 1andtype2diabetes, in comparison withsulodexi de [16].Patients were randomized toreceive eitherIVinfusions of actovegin (2000 mg once daily; n=12) or sulodexide (1200 lipasemic units [LSU] per day; n=14) for 2weeks followed byoraladministration ofthe 2drugs forafurther 6weeks (1200 mg/day and 1000 LSU perdayrespectively). Both treatments increased maximum pain-freewalkingtimeafter 8weeks of treatment (p<0.05). However, actovegin treatment significantly increased maximum pain-free walki ngtime after 2weeks of treatment versus Baseline (p<0.05), whereas treatment withsulodexide didnot.Additionally, therelative increment inpain-freewalking timewasgreater in the actovegin group compared with the sulodexide group (95.1% versus 38.1% respectively; p<0.05). Arandomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study including 60patients with Stage IIPAD was conducted [17].Allpatientstook partinaregular physical training program for 12 weeks, at least 4weeks before randomizat ion.Patients then received daily IVinfusions of actovegin 20% (250 mL/day) orplacebo (saline 250mL/day) for aperiod of4weeks.

The difference between the 2groups was statistically significant (p<0.001). Asimilar result was obtained with maximum walking distances (+25% versus -10.4% for actovegin and placebo, respectively; p<0.01). Horsch etal.conducted a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study including 138 patients withStage IIPAD [18]. Actovegin 20% (250 mL) and matching placebo were administered asdaily IVinfusions over a 3-week period. Efficacy was evaluated by means of a responder analysis where response was defined as a35% increase from Baseline inpain -free walking distance measured on a treadmill. There were 57% responders in the actovegin group compared with 33% intheplacebo group (p=0.01). In another double -blind study ,Müller -Bühl et al.evaluated theefficacy andcompatibilit yof actovegin 20% infusio n(250 mL) versus placebo (0.9% saline 250 mL) inpatients withStage II PAD [19].Inthisstudy ,actovegin and placebo were administered intra-arterially into the femoral artery ofthewalkingdistance -limitingleg;patients were required tohave asteady state inwalking distance before they were rando mized to receive either actovegin (n=40) or placebo (n=40). Infusions were administered daily, except for weekends, for aperiod of 4weeks and training was ceased withthe commencement of the treatment phase. Actovegin therapy resul tedin an increase ofpain-freewalking distance from 112to162meters(49%) andmaximum walking distance from 171to266meters(59%). In the placebo group, pain -free walking distance increased from114 to 135meters(23%), andmaximum walkingdistance from 176 to201meters(17%). Thedifferences between the 2groups were significant forbothparameters (p<0.05). Following thediscontinuation ofactovegin treatment andplacebo, an 8-week follow-up showed that the walking distance fell markedly intheplacebo group, compared with patients previously treated with actovegin. Arandomized, single-blind study hasalsobeen perform edtocomparetheefficacy ofactov egin and bencyclane in Stage III PAD [20].Fifty -eightpatients were randomized toreceive either actovegin 20% infusion (20intra-arterial infusions) or 250 mgbencyclane in250mLsaline 0.9% over aperiod of4weeks. Endpoint analyses revealed that after 4weeks, 23.1% of patients treated withactovegin experienced pain at night compared with 61.5% of pat ientstreated with bencyclane (p<0.05). Nopatients treated with actovegin reported permanent pain after 4weeks, whereas 16% of patients treated with bencyclane did (p<0.05). Analgesic use at 4weeks was also lowerin pat ientstreated with actovegin compared with those treate d with bencyclane (28.7% versus 42.3% respectively; p<0.05). Finally, both treatments increased pain-freewalking distances (29.2±14.6 metersand 25.8±18.7 metersforthe actovegin and bencyclane groups respectively) but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2groups. In summary, IVtreatment withactovegin has been shown to increase init ial walking distance and relieve pain symptoms in patients with PAD insmall, doubl e-blind, controlled trials.To date, no large -scale rando mized placebo -controlled trials have been undertaken tosupport this observation. Thiswill be the first large -scale study to provide data insupport oftheuseof actovegin (IVandoral)in the treatment of patients withPAD.

Several smallrandomized, controlled, clinical studi eshave evaluated the efficacy ofactovegin in patients with PAD, mainlyinFontaine Stages II (mild (a), moderate, severe (b) claudication) and III (ischemic pain at rest). Although someactovegin studi eswere performedbefore implementation ofcurrent clinical invest igation guidelines, such as the European Commit tee for Propri etary Medicinal Produ cts(CPMP)/ EWP/714/98 “Note for guidance on clinical investigat ion of medicinal products for treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease,” moststudies used theprimary endpoints recommended intheEuropean guidelines (eg,walking distance for PAD Stage II). As summarized in Section4.2results oftheserandomized, controlled trials showed short -term benefit in initial walking distance and pain symptoms withactovegin solutionforinfusio nin populations withPAD. The safet yandtolerabilit yof actovegin in clinical trials was broadly similar to that observed following placebo administrati on. Thefollowing undesirable effects are reflected in the Com pany Core Data Sheet for actovegin (2016) in accordance with the classification of the frequency ofanADR based on the Council for International Organizations ofMedical Sciences guidelines: Immune system disorders: allergic react ions(hypersensit ivity,drug fever, shock symptoms). Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, flush. The frequency of these ADRs has been classified as rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000). The safet yprofile for actovegin suggests that it is well tolerated in all approved indicat ionsand theknown riskscanbemitigated by the appropri ate use of the product, as directed by the label. This includes the monitoring for hypersensit ivityreacti onsand adherence to sterile practi ceson handling and administrating the intravenous product. Overall, afavorable benefit -riskprofile hasbeen established to support the clinical use of actovegin. Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"

Thelocationof arteri alnarrowing andocclusion willalso be ident ified, and an aortoiliac or femoropopliteal lesion will be docum ented in the pati ent’s m edical chart and case report form. The examinat ion will be carried out on certifie d equi pment by a qualified specialist of ultrasonic diagnost ics in accordance with the generally accepted methodology . The examinat ion will be perform ed according to local routine pract ice. Results (at a minimum, paper conclusio n) should be stored together with other source documents. Ultrasound dupl ex imaging of the lower limb vessels is to be performed by the standard method. Speci al precondi tioning of the subject is not required. The subject will remove clothing from the lower limbs and then will be pla ced on the bed in the supine posit ion. The subject should be advised to wear an underwear which opens inguinal fo lds, which is where the duplex imaging begins.

Both legs will be examined individually. If necessary , the subject m ay be asked to stand up to continue examinat ion in the upright posit ion. Besides the standard parameters, the level (segment) of the vessel lesio n (aortoiliac or femoropopliteal ) and the l esion type (occl usion or stenosi s) will be recorded. The ankle brachial index (ABI) assessment will be performed by measuring the systolic blood pressure (BP) from both brachial arteries, posterior tibial arteries, and both dorsalis pedis arteri es. Smoking and alcoho lic or soft drinks are not allowed for patients during at least 2 hours before the procedure. The subject should be physically and emotionally relaxed for at least 30 minutes before the procedure. The measurement is to be performed in the supine posit ion after the rest in this posi tion for 10 minutes. The blood pressure cuff should be placed as fo llows: ri ght arm , left arm , then both l ower limbs in any o rder. The l ower edge of the cuff should be at 3 to 5 cm superior to the elbow bend or 3 to 5 cm superi or to the ankle -joint. The cuff should be inflated to stop the blood flow in the brachial artery or in the tibia, respectively . The cuff shoul d then be sl owly deflated and the pressure recorded when the first pulse wave appears. The systolic blood pressure of the artery at the appearance of the first pulse will then used for calculat ions. The systolic blood pressure from upper and lower limbs should be mea sured by a hand- held Doppl er probe on 5 -10 MHz. ABI shoul d be calculated using the fo llowing formul a: ABI = ankle sBP/ brachial sBP Ankle sBP is defined as the higher of two sy stolic BPs from a lower limb. Systolic BP of the postural tibial artery shoul d be compared to sy stolic BP of the dorsalis pedis artery of the same leg, the highest value should be used for calculat ions. This will be repeated to determine the value for the opposite leg. As a result, 2 ankle systolic BPs will be provided for ABI calcul ations. Brachial sBP is defined as the higher of systolic BPs fro m both upper limbs. As a result, one brachial systolic BP will be provided for ABI calculat ions. Blood pressure shoul d be m easured on both arm s because of possible lesio ns of clavicular or axillary arteri es in pat ients with PAD. ABI calculat ions should yield in 2 values rounded to 2 decimal places. The worst (the lowest) ABI shoul d be chosen for further invest igations.

In addit ion,theymust be advised nottodonate sperm during this period. Females ofchildbearing potential who are partners of male subjects are also advised to use additional contracepti on as shown in the list of highly effect ive/effect ivecontraception (Section 9.1.12.3 ). 9.1.12.2 Female Subjects and Their Male Partners From thesigning of the informed consent, throughout the duration of the study or for 30 day s afterthelast dose of study drug (in case of early study terminat ion),female subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually activewithanonsteri lized male partner must use a highly effective /effective method of contraception (Section 9.1.12.3 ) . Inaddition, theymust be advised not to donate ova during this period. 9.1.12.3 Definitions and Procedures for Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance The followingdefinitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures. A postm enopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternat ive medical cause. A high fo llicle stimulat ing horm one (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range (FSH >40IU/L) may be used to confirm a post- menopausal state in y ounger wom en (eg, those <45year old) or women who are not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replace ment therapy . However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Sterilized males should beatleast 1year post-bilateral vasectomy and have confirmed that theyhave obtained documentation of the absence of sper m in the ejaculate or have had bilateral orchidectomy. The followingprocedures apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance. 1.Highly effect ivemethods of contraception are defined as those, aloneor in co mbinat ion, that result inalowfailure rate(ie,lessthan 1% failure rate per year when used consistent lyand Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"
