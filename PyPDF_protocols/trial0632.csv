Subjects who received placebo (Study CL04041022 and CL04041023 ) or adalimumab (Study CL04041023) in the core study in which they participated will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to OKZ 64 mg q2w or OKZ 64 mg q4w regimens in the OLE study . For the first 12 weeks of the OLE, all subjects will be required to remain on a s table dose of background MTX at 15 to 25 mg/week (or ≥10 mg/week if there is documented intolerance to higher doses) with a stable route of administration (oral, SC, or intramuscular [IM ]). After 12 weeks ( Visit 4 [Week 36 ] of the OLE study ), the Investigator may adjust the MTX dosage and route, per local guidelines. Methotrexate may be adjusted only for safety reasons according to Investigator discretion before Visit 4 (Week 36) of the OLE study. Subjects who are on rescue disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) during the core studies will be asked to continue these medications for the first 12 weeks of the OLE study . The Investigator can adjust these background medications if deemed appropriate after Visit 4 ( Week 36 ) of the OLE study . Background rescue therapy may be adjusted only for safety reasons according to Investigator discretion before Visit 4 (Week 36) of the OLE study. Throughout the study, concomitant treatment with folic acid ≥5 mg per week or equivalent is required for all subjects. Subjects will return to th e study site periodically for safety and response assessments as per the Schedule of Events . The last dose of open -label study treatment in the OLE study will be administered at Week 104 for all subjects . After completion of the 82-week open -label Treatment Period , subjects will enter the 20-week Safety Follow -Up Period . During the Safety Follow -Up Period , subjects will return for 3 visits at +4, +8, and +22 weeks after the last dose of study treatment . Subjects who discontinue the open -label treatment prematurely will be required to come for the EoT Visit 2 weeks after the last study treatment administration and then return for the 3 Safety Follow -Up Visit s +4, +8, and +22 weeks after the last study trea tment administration. Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study period and evaluated using the Common Technology Criteria version 4.0 (CTCAE v 4.0). There will be ongoing monitoring of safety events, including laboratory findings by the Sponsor or its designee . In addition, safety will be assessed throughout the study by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Planned number of subjects: Approximately 1880 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups ( the OKZ 64 mg q4w treatment group or the OKZ 64 mg q2w treatment group ). Treatment population: Subjects with moderately to severely active RA who previously completed 24 weeks of double -blind treatment in the core studies . Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: 1. Subjects willing and able to sign informed consent. 2. Subject must have completed the 24 -week double -blind Treatment Period in the core study . 3. Subject must have maintained their stable dose (and route) of MTX 15 to 25 mg/week (or ≥10 mg/week if there is documented intolerance to higher doses) during the core study and plan to maintain the same dose and route of administration for ≥12 additional weeks.

Analysis Populations  Safety population: The Safety population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment during the OLE study . Subjects in the Safety population will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT) population: The mITT population will include all subjects who sign an Informed Consent for participation in the OLE study , are randomized in the OLE study , and receive at least 1 dose of study treatment in the OLE study . Subjects will be analyzed according to the study treatment group to which they are randomized in the OLE study . The mITT population will be the primary efficacy analysis population.  Per Protocol (PP) population: The PP population will include all mITT subjects who do not have any major protocol violations . Subjects will be analyzed according to the study treatment group to which they are randomized . The PP pop ulation will be used for supportive analyses selected efficacy endpoints. Safety Analysis The main components for the safety analysis will include:  All AEs (and SAEs) will be solicited at every study visit, recorded, and coded according to the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  Vital signs and physical examination findings  Laboratory parameters  Electrocardiogram (ECG) and other specialized test findings Changes from OLE Baseline value in safety parameters will be summarized based on the definition of OLE Baseline value as the last available measurement prior to the first OLE dose of study treatment . Additionally, changes from Core Baseline will be summarized based on the baselin e value from the core study (i.e., the last available measurement prior to the first dose of study treatment in the core study). For subjects from Study CL04041025 who initiate OKZ treatment at Week 16 of the core study after having completed 16 weeks of placebo treatment, changes from the last pre -OKZ value will also be summarized. All AEs will be analyzed in terms of descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis . Adverse events will be summarized in terms of incidence during the OLE study , as well as overall during the core studies and the OLE study . Adverse events will be listed for each subject and summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to the most recent version of the MedDRA . In addition, summaries of AEs by severity and relationship to study treatment will be presented . Follow -up-adjusted incidence rates and event rates per 100 subject -years of follow -up over the course of the core study and the OLE will be summarized by treatment group for SAEs and AESIs . All safety and tolerability data recorded during the study will be listed and summarized by treatment group in both the core study and the OLE, and over time, as appropriate. The above collected clinical database will be summarized and presented with particular focus on the following safety concerns identified as AESIs based either upon the safety data available to date ( refer to the most recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure) for OKZ or drug class -related events f or a biologic, including IL-6 inhibitor s:  Infections (particularly serious infections), tuberculosis, opportunistic infections  Malignancies - The Investigator will be asked to provide relevant medical information/documentation (e.g., pathology/histology repo rts) on all the malignancies cases, whether considered serious or not, as these cases will be recorded in the safety database.  Elevation of blood lipids (e.g. , hypercholesterolemia, blood cholesterol increased, blood"

The following approach is proposed to fully assess the CV risks associated with OKZ:  Potential MACE will be adjudicated by an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CVAC ) according to a predefined charter . The charter will define the criteria, data, and source documentation required to adjudicate all MACE .  Baseline ( of the core study) CV risks including individual risk factors (e.g., tobacco use, presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lipid profile ) will be assessed.  Known CV risk factors will be monitored and assessed to detect any trends over long -term exposure. Time from first exposure to OKZ treatment (either in the core study or OLE study ) to first adjudicated MACE event will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier methodology by treatment group. Efficacy Analysis Efficacy analyses will be conducted using the mITT population . Changes from OLE Baseline value in efficacy parameters will be summarized based on the definition of OLE Baseline value as the last available measurement prior to the first OLE dose of study treatment . Additionally, changes from Core Baseline will be summarized based on the basel ine value from the core study (i.e., the last available measurement prior to the first dose of study treatment in the core study) . For subjects from Study CL04041025 who initiate OKZ treatment at Week 16 of the core study after having completed 16 weeks o f placebo treatment, changes from the last pre -OKZ value will also be summarized. There will be no inferential comparisons between treatment groups for efficacy assessments. Descriptive summaries will be provided for each efficacy parameter over time by treatment group. Assessment of Nonresponders Starting at Visit 4 ( Week 36) and then at all onsite visits until the end of the open -label Treatment Period, all subjects will be assessed for response to treatment , with no nresponders defined as subjects who d o not improve by at least 20% in swollen and tender joint counts (66 -68 joint assessment ) from the Core Baseline assessment . Investigators will be requested to review carefully the response status at these time points and make appropriate actions based on local guidelines regarding management of the subjects, including possible adjustments in background therapy or withdrawal from the study. Safety Follow -up Assessments Given the long half -life of OKZ (approximately 31 days), a 2 -step approach to fully capt ure the safety data after subjects discontinue treatment is proposed . First, this Phase III study requires a full safety assessment at the EoT Visit, which will take place 2 weeks after the last dose of study treatment . For subjects remaining on open -label therapy until the last scheduled dose of study treatment , Visit 10 (the EoT Visit) will take place at Week 106. For subjects who discontinue treatment prematurely , the EoT Visit will take place 2 weeks after the"

Second, subjects will also be followed up for approximately 5 OKZ half-lives (i.e., 22 weeks) after the final dose of study treatment . Specifically, a fter the EoT Visit, all subjects will be scheduled for extended Safety Follow -Up Visit s at +4, +8, and +22 weeks after the last dose of study treatment . Subjects will be reminded of study contact information to report potential SAEs and are to inform the Investigator if they experience such events during the Safety Follow -Up Period."

INTRODUCTION 2.1 Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune/inflammatory disease characterized by persistent synovitis, with synovial cell proliferation and destructive changes in bone and cartilage of multiple joints . Untreated, RA can lead to destruction, deformation, and dysfunction of affected joints, which may result in significant morbidity, and accelerated mortality ( Jacobsson et al, 2007 ). Moderately to severely active RA is often treated with disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), with methotrexate (MTX) being the most commonly used conventional DMARD (cDMARD) . For patients with an inadequate response to cDMARDs, biologic agents (i.e., biologic DMARDs [bDMARDs]) are the next step, and include, but are not l imited to, tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF -α) inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin -6 (IL-6) receptor (IL -6R) antagonists, and T -cell co -stimulation modulators . Among these, TNFi, especially in combination with MTX, are used most often (Smolen et al, 2014 ). Despite early treatment with cDMARD and/or bDMARD therapy, approximately 30% to 40% of patients with established RA fail to respond and 50% to 60% of patients fail to achieve a major clinical American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response or good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response (Marchesoni et al, 2009 ; Rubbert -Roth and Finckh, 2009 ; Cohen et al, 2008 ). Even among responders, the majority do not achieve remission . Thus, there continues to be an unmet medical need for new therapeutic approaches in the RA patient population. One such therapeutic approach is to target IL-6 directly instead of indirectly via a receptor antagonist . Interleukin -6 is a pleiotropic, pro -inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including lymphocytes, monocytes, and fibroblasts . It is involved in multiple immunologic processes such as T -cell activation, B -cell proliferation , initiation of acute -phase response, stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell growth, differentiation and trafficking, as well as osteoclast differentiation , which subsequently contributes to joint destruction . Due to the key role played by IL -6 in se veral RA mechanisms, targeting IL -6 is considered an attractive therapeutic option. 2.2 Study Treatment 2.2.1 Olokizumab Olokizumab (OKZ; CDP6038 ; L04041 ) is being developed by R-Pharm International for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA . Olokizumab was previously developed by UCB Pharma SA, and was transferred to R-Pharm International for further global development."
22,page_22,"R-Pharm International CL0404102 4: Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 4 Olokizumab Amendment 2 : 06 March 2019 23 Confidential Olokizumab is a humanized (complementarity determining region [CDR] -grafted) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) of immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa i sotype, developed as an antagonist of IL -6 that is anticipated to have utility in a wide range of autoimmune/inflammatory conditions. Interleukin -6 is a multifunctional cytokine that has been shown to play a central role in immune regulation, inflammation, hemopoiesis, and oncogenesis, and has been linked to a wide range of human diseases . It is a glycoprotein of 184 amino acids that is produced by a wide range of cell types including monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, vascular en dothelial cells, renal mesangial cells, glial cells, chondrocytes, T and B cells, and some tumor cells . Stimuli of IL -6 production include TNF -α, lipopolysaccharides, and viral infections; inhibitors of IL -6 production include glucocorticoids . Within the context of an immune and inflammatory response, IL -6 has been shown to exert a wide range of effects, such as those described below:  Induction of antibody production by B cells  Important role in the generation of a subpopulation of T -helper cells, Th17 ce lls, which may play an important pathogenic role in a number of autoimmune diseases  Key driver of the acute phase response (the increased production, mainly by the liver, of soluble factors, such as C -reactive protein [CRP] and serum amyloid A [SAA], durin g inflammation) In developing an antagonist mAb to IL -6, potential therapeutic strategies include inhibition of nonsignaling IL-6R receptor alpha chain (gp80), which gives the IL -6 family members their specificity, and the IL-6R signal -transducing subunit (gp130) . The identification of the optimum epitope to target on IL -6 (binding IL -6 in a region that is predicted to be involved with gp80 or gp130) was conducted using antibodies with similar affinities , but different binding axes, as determined by surfac e plasmon resonance ( BIAcore ). Antibodies directed against mouse or human IL -6 that targeted the gp130 axis were more potent than those that targeted the gp80 axis in inhibiting IL -6-dependent phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcri ption 3 in in vitro cell -based assays and in inhibiting the secretion of the acute phase protein SAA in vivo. Olokizumab binds to a region of IL -6 involved with gp130 binding . The epitope recognized by OKZ was initially established by BIAcore and confirm ed by nuclear magnetic resonance studies . Olokizumab has been shown to have a high affinity for human IL -6 as determined using BIAcore analysis . In vitro whole blood and cell line assays as well as animal studies have shown that OKZ potently neutralizes IL-6-mediated effects in vitro and in vivo, respectively . Data suggest that OKZ neither significantly binds to nor affects the function of other IL -6 family members, nor does it appear to activate the IL -6 signaling pathway under a range of conditions tested."
23,page_23,"R-Pharm International CL0404102 4: Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 4 Olokizumab Amendment 2 : 06 March 2019 24 Confidential Currently, patients with moderately to severely active RA are often treated with cDMARDs , with MTX being the most commonly used. For patients with an inadequate response to cDMARDs, biologic agents that inhibit TNF -, especially in combination wit h MTX, are indicated (Smolen et al, 2014 ). Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of patients receiving biologics (i .e., approximately 40% to 50% of those receiving TNFi therapy ) have inadequate response to such treatment ( Marchesoni et al, 2009 ; Rubbert -Roth and Finckh, 2009 ; Cohen et al, 2008 ). Thus , there is an unmet need for new therapeutic approaches utilizing alternative modes of action in this patient population. Olokizumab is being developed to address the unmet needs of patients with these severe, progressive, and debilitating disorders through a different therapeutic approach, utilizing an alternative mode of action . Within the class of therapeutic antibodies targeting the IL-6 pathway, OKZ is anticipated to be more potent because of its high affinity for IL -6 and its axis of intervention (inhibiting the interaction between IL -6 and gp130) . Also, since OKZ is of the I g G4 isotype, it would not be expected to mediate significant levels of antibody -mediated complement fixation or cell -mediated cytotoxicity. Olokizumab is being developed for the treatment of RA to reduce signs and symptoms of disease and improve physical functioning . The proposed indication for OKZ is to be used in combination with MTX for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA in adult patients who have been inadequately controlled by MTX treatment or previous TNFi treatment . Refer to the most recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information on OKZ , including:  In vitro activity  Nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) and product metabolism  Nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology  Pharmacokinetics , efficacy, and safety profile in clinical studies 2.2.2 Nonclinical Development Nonclinical studies have shown that inhibition of IL -6 signaling does not result in any life-threatening effects either in animal models or formal toxicology studies. There is no evidence from in vitro and in vi vo nonclinical data to suggest that there is a risk of OKZ inducing an uncontrolled biological cascade. All nonclinical data generated to date are consistent with OKZ functioning as an effective antagonist of the IL-6 pathway. Cellular in vitro assay dat a suggest that OKZ neutralize s the biological effects of IL-6 in both humans"

Therefore , the cynomolgus monkey is considered an appropriate species to evaluate the potential toxicity of OKZ. Due to the lack of activity of OKZ on IL-6 in rats and mice, the toxicology program was restricted to using a single non -rodent species, the cynomolgus monkey. Olokizumab is well tolerated in the cynomolgus monkey, with a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 200 mg/kg /week and 50 mg/kg/week after intravenous ( IV) and subcutaneous ( SC) administration , respectively . In a study aimed at assessing the effects of OKZ on prenatal and postnatal development in the cynomolgus monkey, the treatment was well tolerated during the pregnancy and had no abortifacient effect. However, some OKZ -treated females experienced dystocia and placental retention, sometimes associated wi th significant urogenital bleeding, which resulted in some deaths. Given similar human and cynomolgus monkey physiology and the risk of dystocia and hemorrhage at parturition, inhibition of IL -6 signaling during pregnancy is not recommended . Taken togethe r, the currently completed nonclinical studies support continued clinical development for marketing approval of OKZ. 2.2.3 Summary of Clinical Experience Nonclinical data were deemed sufficient to support clinical development of OKZ in humans for the treatment o f moderately to severely active RA (lead indication), other auto -immune inflammatory diseases, and oncological diseases with IL -6 pathophysiology. The safety, efficacy, and PK of OKZ have been investigated in 3 Phase I clinical studies (RA0001, RA0010, and RA0074) and 2 Phase II clinical studies (RA0056 and RA0083) . The safety and efficacy of OKZ were also studied in long -term open -label extension (OLE) studies for both Phase II studies (RA0057 and RA0089). The information in this section of the protocol regarding clinical studies with OKZ is current as of 29 January 2016 (for updated information on results of clinical studies , refer to the most recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure ). 2.2.3.1 Summary of Studies in the Olokiz umab Clinical Program Study RA0001 Study RA0001 was a Phase I, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -escalating, first-in-human study that investigated the safety and tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of IV OKZ in 67 healthy Caucasia n male subjects (33 on active drug and 34 on placebo) with a 99 -day follow -up."

The overall incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was slightly higher in the placebo group overall (18 subjects [52.9%]; 35 events) than in the OKZ treatment groups overall (11 subjects [33.3%]; 26 events) . No increase in the incidence of TEAEs was o bserved with increasing dose of OKZ. The most commonly reported TEAEs were in the system organ classes (SOCs) of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, general disorders, and infections and infestations . The incidence of GI disorders was similar in both the OKZ group overall (12.1%) and the placebo group overall (11.8%); however, at the preferred term (PT) level, abdominal distension (1 subject [3.0%]), abdominal pain (1 subject [3.0%]), and vomiting (2 subjects [6.1%]) were only seen in the OKZ group . The most frequently reported TEAEs (occurring in ≥3% of subjects in any treatment group) by PT were influenza -like illness (11.8% placebo, 6.1% OKZ), headache (11.8% placebo, 3.0% OKZ), nasopharyngitis (8.8% placebo, 3.0% OKZ), rhinitis (8.8% placebo, 0.0% OKZ), d iarrhea (5.9% placebo, 3.0% OKZ), and vomiting (0.0% placebo, 6.1% OKZ). For the majority of hematology and clinical chemistry parameters there were no clinically significant differences in mean actual values between the placebo group and OKZ treatment groups, and no clinically significant fluctuations in mean actual values over time. Study RA0010 There were no deaths during Study RA0010 . Two subjects (1 subject in the placebo IV + MTX group and 1 subject in the OKZ 1 mg/kg SC + MTX group) experienced SAEs : Bowen’s disease and worsening of RA, respectively . Neither event was considered by the Investigator to be related to the study treatment .

The incidence of TEAEs was higher in the OKZ groups compared with the placebo group . In the placebo group, 50% of subjects (2 of 4) had TEAEs ( 6 events), compared with 75% of subjects (3 of 4) in the OKZ 3 mg/kg treatment group (11 events), and 100% of subjects (4 of 4) in each of the OKZ 0.3 mg/kg (16 events), OKZ 1 mg/kg (25 events), and OKZ 6 mg/kg (24 events) treatment groups . The incidence of TEAEs did not appear to be related to the dose of OKZ administered. The most commonly reported TEAEs were within the SOCs of general disorders and administration site conditions ; investigations ; GI disorders ; infections and infestations ; respiratory, th oracic and mediastinal disorders ; and skin and SC tissue disorders . Events occurring in >20% of subjects in the OKZ overall group, by PT, included injection site hematoma (31.3%), abdominal pain (25.0%), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (25.0%) . The overall incidence of TEAEs in the OKZ -treated groups was higher than in the placebo -treated group, but given the small number of subjects in each treatment group , it is not possible to make any meaningful conclusions. In Studies RA0001, RA001 0, and RA0074, OKZ was tolerated at doses of up to 3 mg/kg SC (all studies), 6 mg/kg SC ( Study RA0074 only), and 10 mg/kg IV ( Study RA0001 only) . There were no deaths in any of these studies and only 2 SAEs in Study RA0010 . One subject in Study RA0010 discontinued the study early due to an AE (exacerbation of RA symptoms), but no subjects withdrew from Study RA0001 or Study RA0074 due to TEAEs. Study RA0056 In Study RA0056, OKZ was well tolerated at doses of up to 240 mg q2w . Serious AEs were reported by 6 subjects in the OKZ groups and 3 subjects in the placebo groups . A total of 11 subjects in the OKZ and placebo groups discontinued due to TEAEs (10 subjects in the OKZ group and 1 subject in the placebo group ). Overall, 10 subjects in the OKZ groups reported 13 TEAEs leading to discontinuation, with the most subjects discontinuing due to TEAEs in the OKZ 60 mg q4w group (5 subjects [22.7%] compared with 2 subjects [10%] in the OKZ 60 mg q2w group, 1 subject [4.5%] in the OKZ 120 mg q2w group, and 2 subjects [8.7%] in the OKZ 240 mg q2w group) . One subject (4.5%) in the placebo q2w group also discontinued due to TEAEs . No TEAE PT leading to discontinuation was reported by more than 1 subject in any treatment group.

An indication of the efficacy of OKZ was obtained in the subpopulation of subjects with a baseline DAS28 (CRP) of >3.2 (i.e., those with moderate to high disease activity) . Although the number of subjects falling into this moderate to high category was small, improvements in DAS28 (CRP) were seen following OKZ + MTX administration, especially in the OKZ 1 mg/kg SC + MTX group. Study RA0056 In Study RA0056, a greater improvement in least squares (LS) mean DAS28 (CRP) from baseline at Week 12 was observed across all OKZ treatment groups compared with the placebo groups, with the greatest improvement observed in th e OKZ 240 mg q2w group . The overall dose -response trend (across the q4w and q2w dosing frequencies) was statistically significant (p<0.0001) . Comparisons of dosing frequency (q2w versus q4w) and dose-by-dose frequency interactions (q2w trend versus q4w t rend) were not statistically significant . The secondary efficacy variables were ACR 20% (ACR20), 50% (ACR50), and 70% (ACR70) response criteria at Week 12 for the OKZ and placebo treatment groups . The ACR20 and ACR50 estimated response rates at Week 12 were higher in all OKZ treatment groups compared with the placebo groups . Very few subjects in any treatment group were ACR70 responders; however, those subjects that were ACR70 responders were all in the OKZ treatment groups.

Sparse sampling following repeated administration of OKZ was performed in non-Asian and Asian subjects with RA in Studies RA0056 and RA0083, respectively . Exposure to OKZ following single dose administration appeared to be similar in non-Asian and Asian volunteers . Following SC administration, maximum plasma concentrations were generally re ached between approximately 4 days (in Study RA0074, 6 mg/kg SC) and 14 days (in Study RA0001, 1 mg/kg SC) . Over the 0.3 to 6 mg/kg SC dose range evaluated in Studies RA0001 and RA0074, the median terminal half -life ranged from 30.1 to 39.6 days. The PK profile of OKZ in Study RA0010 (non-Asian RA volunteers) was similar to that seen in healthy volunteers in Study RA0001 for the same doses . The maximum concentration of OKZ following SC administration was achieved within a median of 7 to 13 days following 3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg dosing, respectively . The estimate of terminal half -life across doses and routes of administration was 31 days (median range : 12 to 63 days). Pharmacokinetic bioavailability of OKZ via SC administration was estimated to be 63% across the 3 studies evaluated ( Studies RA0001, RA0010, and RA0056) . Population PK analysis utilizing sparse plasma concentration versus time data collected in RA0056 along with intense PK data collected in Studies RA0001 and RA0010 indicated similar PK charact eristics of OKZ in subjects with moderately to severely active RA and in healthy subjects . Body weight was found to be the only “statistically significant” covariate on volume of distribution. 2.2.4 Rationale for Dose Selection The dose regimens of OKZ to be ev aluated in this Phase III study are 64 mg q2w and 64 mg q4w. These are the same doses investigated in the 3 core studies (CL04041022, CL04041023, and CL04041025). The rationale for selecting these dose regimens is provided below. In the Phase II studies , RA0056 and RA0083, the primary efficacy variable was met in all OKZ treatment groups, demonstrating improvement compared with placebo groups and a statistically significant overall dose -response trend as evidenced by the change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) . Study RA0001 demonstrated that OKZ was pharmacologically active at"
36,page_36,"R-Pharm International CL0404102 4: Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 4 Olokizumab Amendment 2 : 06 March 2019 37 Confidential all doses tested . This finding was supported by the PD and clinical findings of the subsequent Phase I/IIa study , RA0010, conducted in subjects with mild to moderate RA . The data from these studies highlight the potency of OKZ as well as the existence of dose-response dependence, shown by the results of the concentration effect relationship evaluation for efficacy outcomes . The relatively flat concentration -effect relationship for safety outcomes and the dose -dependent occurrence of injection site reactions for the OKZ 240 mg dose regimen, in contrast to the modest efficacy gains versus the 120 mg dose regimens, led to the exclusion of the 240 mg dose regimen from further evaluatio n in the Phase III program . This decision was further supported by the inconvenience of administering 2 injections of 120 mg OKZ in order to achieve the 240 mg dose level even with the new 160 mg/m L formulation . In a thorough dose -response analysis using the combined database from the 2 Phase II studies, it was confirmed that a plateau of efficacy was reached at a cumulative monthly dose of 120 mg. The 60 mg monthly dose seemed to have slightly lower efficacy in the modeling analysis ; however , in both Pha se II studies that were conducted in relatively difficult to treat population of subjects resistant to 1 or more TNFi biologics, the 60 mg monthly treatment groups showed statistically significant efficacy . While there was not a detectable increase in safety events observed with doses above 120 mg monthly, there also did not seem to be a substantial gain in efficacy with higher doses . Thus, the 120 mg monthly dose, administered as either 60 mg q2w or 120 mg q4w, seemed to be associated with optimal eff icacy/safety ratio. The lower 60 mg monthly dose was also efficacious with a potential for a safety advantage, especially over the long -term treatment. Due to an increase in the concentration of the formulation subsequent to Phase II, it should be noted t hat the lowest volume that can be used in Phase III (0.4 mL) results in a nominal dose of 64 mg rather than 60 mg . Consequently, using the primary efficacy outcomes from individual Phase II studies, and additional dose -response analysis performed on a comb ined database derived from these studies, 2 OKZ dose regimens were selected for further investigation : 64 mg SC q2w and 64 mg SC q4w since the totality of the data strongly suggested that both of these dose regimens could potentially be successful in a la rge Phase III program. 2.3 Rationale for the Study The multicenter , open -label design used in this study is consistent with the precedent set for Phase III OLE trials of other biologics and is in accordance with health authority guidelines . The goal of this Phase III study is to evaluate the long-term safety , tolerability , and efficacy of OKZ in subjects with moderately to severely active RA w ho previously completed"

The study is expected to provide long-term safety information in a large group of subjects treated with OKZ for up to 106 weeks . All subjects in this study will rec eive the first dose of OKZ at Week 24. For subjects transitioning from the adalimumab treatment group (core study CL04041023), there will be no additional time added for wash out of adalimumab other than the 2 weeks between the last dose of adalimumab in the core study (Week 22) and first dose of OKZ in the OLE study (Visit 1 [Week 24 ]). Similar approaches have been implemented in a number of other clinical studies involving adalimumab and other biologics or kinase inhibitors, and such a switch from on e biologic to another is commonly observed in clinical practice without significant safety concerns (Bykerk et al, 2012 ; Furst et al, 2007 ; Schiff et al, 2009 ; Wollenhaupt et al, 2014 ). Despite this , the possibility for an increased risk of AEs, including infections , cannot be excluded (Humira® [adalimumab] Prescribing Information ). This potential risk will be mitigated by close ly monitoring all subjects throughout the OLE study . It is possible that subjects assigned to the adalimumab treatment group in core study CL04041023 might achieve remission or a decrease in disease activity while being treat ed with adalimumab and switching to another biological treatment may lead to undesirable results for such subjects. H owever, it will not be known at the completion of the 24 -week double -blind Treatment Period whether a subject was assigned to the adalimum ab treatment group . Therefore, f ollowing a subject’s completion of the core study and prior to enrollment in the OLE study, the Investigator and subject will decide jointly whether the subject will continue with the open -label administration of OKZ in this OLE study or exit the study . 2.4 Benefit/Risk Assessment Olokizumab has undergone extensive nonclinical testing , and 7 clinical studies have been completed . In the difficult -to-treat population of RA patients who previously failed TNFi therapy, OKZ has demonstrated efficacy in 2 Phase II studies (Study RA0056 [extended with Study RA0057] in 221 subjects and Study RA0083 [extended with Study RA0089] in 119 Asian subjects) using the doses of OKZ that are proposed for this Phase III study ; at higher doses, the safety profile was similar . Bioavailability of OKZ via SC administration was estimated to be 63% across 3 studies evaluated ( Studies RA0056, RA0001, and RA0010) . The clinical program to date suggests that OKZ is effective in reducing disease symptoms in subjects with RA , and that OKZ is generally well tolerated (for further efficacy and safety information , refer to the most recent version of the Investigator ’s Brochure) . The safety profile of OKZ is consistent with the known effects of IL -6 blockers. Overall, the"
38,page_38,"R-Pharm International CL0404102 4: Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 4 Olokizumab Amendment 2 : 06 March 2019 39 Confidential benefit /risk profile for subjects in the proposed study is favorable . The study will provide valuable information on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of OKZ in subjects with RA, which may subsequently help to address the unmet medical needs for this patient population. The design of this study contains adequate measures to mitigate risk factors and adequate safety monitoring to protect the subjects. All subjects will be eligible for modification of background therapy (i.e., MTX for all subjects, sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine for subjects assigned rescue medication in the core studies , and oral corticosteroids [if applicable] ), adm inistration of parenteral corticosteroids, and modification of non -steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs ) after 12 weeks of open -label treatment (see Section 6.13.3), according to Investigator discretion and local practice . In addition, all subjects will be assessed at Visit 4 ( Week 36) and then at all onsite visits until the end of the study treatment administration for response to treatment , with nonresponders defined as subjects who do not improve by at least 20% in swollen and tender joint counts (66 -68 joint assessment ) from the Core Baseline assessment . Investigators will be requested to review carefully the response status at these tim e points and make appropriate actions based on local guidelines regarding management of the subjects, including possible adjustments in background therapy or withdrawal from the study. In the context of the progressive, severe, and debilitating nature of R A, the balance between risks that have been identified from cumulative safety data for OKZ and the anticipated efficacy/benefit remains favorable."

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 5.1 Summary of Study Design This is a multicenter , open -label , Phase III study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of OKZ in subjects with moderately to severely active RA who previously completed 24 weeks of double -blind treatment in Study CL04041022, CL04041023, or CL04041025 . This study will be conducted at approximately 250 global sites across Russia, Belarus, the US, Europe , the United Kingdo m (UK), Asia, and Latin America. It is est imated that approximately 1880 subjects will be enrolled . Subjects will be assessed for eligibility to enter the study at Visit 1 (which is the same visit as the Week 24 visit of the core studies ), and eligible subjects will be assigned to 1 of 2 dosing frequencies (q2w or q4w) of 64 mg OKZ as described in Section 5.2. The study will consist of a n 82-week open -label Treatment Period , with t he last dose of OKZ being administered at Week 104. After completion of the open -label Treatment Period , subjects will come to Visit 10 (End of Treatment [EoT]/Week 106) 2 weeks after the last dose of OKZ for scheduled safety and efficacy assessments . After Visit 10 (EoT/Week 106) , subjects will be scheduled for Safety Follow -Up Visit s SFU-1 (Week 108), SFU-2 (Week 112), and SFU-3 (Week 126) to perform adequate safety assessments . The total amount of time to complete the OLE study will be approximately 102 weeks (inclusive of the open -label Treatment Period and the Safety Follow -Up Period). The total amount of time to complete both the core study and the OLE study will be approximately 130 weeks (2.5 years) (inclusive of the Screening , double -blind Trea tment Period, open -label Treatment Period , and Safety Follow -Up Period ). Subjects who discontinue treatment prematurely will be required to come to Visit 10 (EoT/Week 106) 2 weeks after the last dose of study treatment for scheduled efficacy and safety assessments . These subjects will subsequently be followed for an additional 20 weeks (i.e., 22 weeks after the final dose of study treatment ) during a Safety Follow -Up Period. A schematic of the study design is presented in Figure 1. The Schedule of Events to be conducted during the 82-week open -label Treatment P eriod ( Week 24 through Week 106) and the Safety Follow -Up Period (Week 106 through Week 126) is presented in Table 1."

The Investigator may , at their discretion and based on local practice , adjust therapy a fter Visit 4 (Week 36 ) (see Section 6.13.3 ), which may include adjustments to background therapy (i.e., MTX for all subjects, sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine for subj ects assigned rescue medication in the core studies , and oral corticosteroids [if applicable ]), parenteral corticosteroids , and modification of NSAIDs. Dose tapering of oral corticosteroids or NSAIDs is permitted according to Investigator discretion before Visit 4 (Week 36 ) (see Section 6.13.3 ). Subjects will return to the study site periodically for safety and response assessments as per Table 1. Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study period and evaluated using the CTCAE version 4.0. The last dose of open -label study treatment in the OLE study will be administered at Week 104. After completion of the 82-week , open -label Treatment Period , subjects will enter the 20-week Safety Follow -Up Period . During the Safety Follow -Up Period , subjects will return for 3 visits at +4, +8, and +22 weeks after the last dose of study treatment . Subjects who discontinue study treatment prematurely will be required to come to Visit 10 (EoT/Week 106) 2 weeks after the last dose of the study treatment for scheduled assessments . These subjects will subsequently be followed for an additional 20 weeks (i.e., 22 weeks after the final dose of study treatment ) for a Safety Follow -Up Period . There will be ongoing monitoring of safety events, including laboratory findings, by R- Pharm Internati onal or its designee . In addition, safety will be assessed throughout the study by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) (see Section 7.4.4 for further details). 5.2.1 Cardiovascular Risk Assessment The RA population is known to have an increased risk of cardiovascular ( CV) events . In order to fully assess the CV risks associated with OKZ, the following approach will be implemented:"

Potential MACE will be adjudicated by an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee ( CVAC ) according to a predefined charter . The charter will define the criteria, data, and source documentation required to adjudicate all MACE . 2. Baseline (of the core study) CV risks including individual risk factors (e.g., tobacco use, presence of hy pertension, diabetes mellitus, and lipid profile ) will be assessed . 3. Known CV risk factors will be monitored and assessed to detect any trends over long-term ex posure . A CV risk assessment will be performed at OLE Baseline and at Visits 6 (Week 52) , 8 (Week 76) , and 10 (EoT/Week 106) . The CV risk assessment includes :  Alcohol use with evaluation of average number of drinks consumed weekly  Tobacco use with evalua tion of average number of tobacco products consumed daily  Central obesity  Use of any lipid -lowering medication or any other CV agents  Prior history of CV events and diabetes  Family history of premature CV disease (age of diagnosis <55 years for males and <65 years for females )  Other risks Cardiovascular risk assessment data will be provided to the CVAC for review and adjudication of MACE (see Section 7.4.4.2 ). 5.2.2 Safety Follow -up Assessments Given the long half -life of OKZ (approximately 31 days), subjects will be followed up for approximately 5 OKZ half -lives (i.e., 22 weeks) after the final dose of study treatment . For subjects remaining on randomized therapy until the last scheduled dose of study treatment , Visit 10 (EoT Visit) will be performed at Week 106 and extended Safety Follow -Up procedures will be performed at visits scheduled +4, +8, and +22 weeks after the last dose of study treatment (i.e., Visits SFU-1 [Week 108], SFU-2 [Week 112], and SFU-3 [Week 126], respectively).

The HAQ -DI assesses the degree of difficulty experienced in 8 domains of daily living activities using 20 questions . The domains are dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip , and common daily activities, and each domain (activity) consists of 2 or 3 items . For each question , the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 where 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do . Each category is given a score by taking the maximum score of each question (i.e., question in each category with the highest score f or that category). If the maximum score is 0 or 1, but a device related to that category is used, or help from another person is provided for the category, then the category score is increased to 2 . If the category score is already a 2 (or above), the sco re in that category remains 2 with or without any aids or device use . If the subject does not provide an answer for any questions within a category, no score will be provided for that category . The HAQ -DI will be calculated by dividing the sum of the cat egory scores by the number of categories with at least 1 question answered . If fewer than 6 categories have responses, no disability score will be calculated. The HAQ -DI will also include patient assessments of pain and health on a scale of 0 to 100 . 7.1.10.2 Short Form -36 The SF -36 health survey is a patient -reported survey of health; it is commonly used in health economics as a variable in the quality -adjusted life year (QALY) calculation to determine the cost-effectiveness of a health treatment . The SF -36 consists of 8 scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section . Each scale is directly transformed into a 0 to 100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight . The lower the score the more disability . The higher the score , the less disability (i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability)."

The concept of health in EQ -5D also encompasses both positive aspects (well -being) and negative aspects (illness). The EQ -5D consists of a questionnaire and a VAS and is a self -rated health status . The EQ-5D records the subject’s perceptions of their own current overall health, and can be used to monitor changes with time . The self -assessment questionnaire is a description of 5 dimensions (i.e., mobility, self -care, usual activiti es, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) . The subject is asked to grade their own current level of function in each dimension into 1 of 5 degrees of disability ( extreme, severe, moderate , slight, or none) . The combination of these with the conditions “death” and “unconscious” enables a description of 3127 different health states . Each health state can be ranked and transformed as a single score called the utility . The EQ -5D health states may be converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that attaches values to each of the levels in each dimension . The index can be calculated by deducting the appropriate weights from 1, the value for full health (i.e., state 11111) . Value sets have been derived for EQ -5D in several countries usin g the European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions Visual Analog Scale (EQ -5D VAS) valuation technique or the time trade -off valuation technique."

The Investigator will also collect completed pages of the Subject Diary (see Section 5.5) at Visits 2 (Week 26) through 10 (EoT/Week 106) , and t he Investigator will review any complaints, signs, or symptoms experienced by the subject in association with administration of study tr eatment . Completed pages of the Subject Diary will serve as source documents, and information will be recorded on the appropriate pages of the eCRF. The Subject Diary will not be used during the Safety Follow -Up Period. Further routine medical assessmen ts in addition to those specified in Table 1 may take place during the study as clinically indicated (e.g., chest X -rays to investigate lung lesions, ECG, etc). Safety measures in this study include, but are not limited to , SAEs, AEs, vital signs, body weight, and laboratory evaluations , and if required, this information must be present in the AE/SAE report made by the Investigator. 7.4.1 Adverse Events For t he purposes of this study, an AE will be define d as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE c an therefore be any of the following:  Any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product .  If the Investigator determines a laborator y abnormality to be clinically significant, it is considered a laboratory AE; however, if the abnormal laboratory value is consistent with a current diagnosis (or signs or symptoms if a diagnosis is not possible) and is not a clinically significant worseni ng from the baseline laboratory parameter , it should be documented accordingly without being reported as a separate laboratory AE.  Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condi tion). The Investigator is responsible for recording all AEs observed during the study starting at Visit 1 (OLE Baseline /Week 24) . All AEs are recorded throughout the study until the last visit of the subject . The Investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of the subjects during the entire study."

Causality Assessment The Investigator is responsible for making an assessment of the causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE . Investigators should use their knowledge of the subject, the circumstances surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an AE is consid ered to be related to the study treatment . The causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE must be characterized as “related” or “not related” . The following guidance should be taken into consideration:  Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of the study treatment .  Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of the study treatment , or reintroduction of the study treatment .  Known association of the event with the study treatment , or with similar treatments .  Known association of the event with the disease under study ."

The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the description of event on the SAE page in the eCRF . General ly, only 1 such event leading to death should be reported . The use of the term “ sudden death ” as the description of an event should be used , for example, in case of p resence of such cardiovascular diagnosis in the source documents or occurrence of an unexpected cardiac death within scenarios as described in Potential MACE Reporting Site Manual . If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “ unexplained death ” should be recorded on the SAE page as the description of the event in the eCRF . If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be replaced by the established cause of death. 7.4.2.1 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of R heumatoid Arthritis Medical occurrences or symptoms of deterioration that are anticipated as part of RA should be recorded as an AE if judged by the Investigator to have unexpectedly worsened in severity or frequency or changed in nature at any time during the study . When recording an unanticipated worseni ng of RA on the AEs eCRF page, it is important to convey the concept that the condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “accelerated RA”) . Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease , as determined by the Investigator , should not be recorded as AEs ; these data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only . Every effort should be made to document progression using objective criteria . If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is an AE or due to disease progression, it should be reported as an AE . Any worsening of RA that meets the criteria for seriousness should be reported as an SAE. 7.4.2.2 Overdose Study treatment overdose is the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount higher than the dose being studied . An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not an AE unless it results in untoward medical effects .

All of the events listed above will be analy zed as AESIs ; some of these events are further detailed below . 7.4.3.1 Infections Frequency, duration, and severity of infectious complications along with those r equiring treatment (e.g., antibiotic, antiviral, etc) will be monitored and evaluated. Investigators will also educate subjects, parents, and/or caregivers about the symptoms of infections and will provide instructions on dealing with these infections . Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of OKZ in subjects with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes) that may predispose subjects to infections. Study Treatment should not be administered to subjects with active or clinically significant infection. Vigilance for timely detection of serious infection is recommended for subjects receiving biologic agents for treatment of RA, as signs and symptoms of acute inflamma tion may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase reaction. Subjects must be instructed to contact their physician immediately when any symptom suggesting infection appears, in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment. The Inve stigator may be asked to provide relevant medical information/documentation (e.g., result of bacterial examination or cultures). Any infection that meets the criteria for seriousness should be reported as an SAE. 7.4.3.2 Systemic Injection Reactions , Including Ana phylaxis A systemic injection reaction is any untoward medical hypersensitivity -like event, other than injection site reactions, occurring during or after study treatment administration that can be at least possibly attributed to the study treatment . Syst emic injection reactions are further classified as acute and delayed based on timing and presentation of symptoms typical for hypersensitivity reactions. Acute and delayed reactions to the study treatment should be reported according to the judgment of the Investigator, based on the typical clinical features. Any systemic allergic reaction that meets the criteria for seriousness should be reported as an SAE.

For injections administered by the subject (or caregiver, if applicable) , subjects will record in the Subject Diary (see Section 5.5) any complaints, signs, or symptoms that occur during or after the injection. S ubjects will be asked to contact the Investigator if any significant reactions occur within the 2 hours followi ng study treatment injection. Acute injection reactions are usually defined as at least 1 of the following signs or symptoms occurring during or within 2 hours of the study treatment injection:  Hypotension  Urticaria  Flushing  Facial or hand edema  Throat tig htness, oral cavity, or lip edema  Headache  Shortness of breath . The Investigator should report any AE of acute systemic injection reaction as “anaphylaxis” if it meets the Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis, as specified in Appendix 3 (Section 13.3). The study site must have adequate arrangements to manage anaphylactic reactions . Delayed injection reactions are usually defined as at least 2 of the following 4 signs or symptoms occurring within 1 day to 14 days following the injection:  Rash  Fever (more than 100°F [38°C])  Polyarthralgias  Myalgias . 7.4.3.3 Gastrointestinal Perforation Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment may reduce the potential for complications of diverticulitis and thus reduce the risk of GI perforations .

Permanent d iscontinuation of OKZ is required for subjects who develop diverticulitis and/or GI perforation . Any GI perforation or diverticulitis that meets the criteria for seriousness should be reported as an SAE . 7.4.3.4 Hepatotoxicity The Investigator will be asked to provide relevant medical information/documentation (e.g., laboratory test results) for all serious and non -serious cases of potential hepatotoxicity . Potential hepatotoxicity is defined as laboratory resul ts that fulfill any of the following criteria (in all cases, AST may be substituted for ALT if ALT results are not available):  ALT >3× to ≤5× ULN  ALT >5× ULN  ALT >3× ULN and total bilirubin >2× ULN Laboratory results that satisfy any of the criteria for potential hepatotoxicity should be followed by a repeat test within 72 hours , which must include total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase ( GGT ), INR, alkaline phosphatase, creatine phosphokinase, and hematology assessment. After that, testing should be repeated at least weekly and followed until resolution, stabilization, or return to baseline values. Additional testing may be limited to ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin if all other laboratory results are wit hin normal limits. The number of LFTs included in each repeat testing may be further reduced to include only those param eters which remain abnormal (i.e., abnormalities that stabilize, resolve, or return to within baseline values do not require repeat testing). Potential hepatotoxicity events that fulfill any of the following criteria must also be recorded as SAEs in the eCRF (in all cases, AST may be substituted for ALT if ALT results are not available):  ALT >3× ULN and total bilirubin >2× ULN  ALT >8× ULN at any time, regardless of total bilirubin or accompanying symptoms  ALT >5× ULN for ≥2 weeks, regardless of total bilirubin or accompanying symptoms .

Work -up includes, but is not limited to:  Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and herbal/dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets.  Ruling out acute viral hepatitis (types A, B, C, D, and E), cytomegalovirus, Epstein -Barr virus, autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy, and biliary tract disease.  Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  Obtaining addi tional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct bilirubin, biliary tract ultrasonography/imaging results, liver biopsy).  Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. All additional investigations should be rec orded i n the eCRF via the EDC system, and all records should be kept as source documents at the study site. 7.4.3.5 Injection Site Reactions An injection site reaction is any untoward medical event occurring at the injection site during or after study treatment administration that can be at least possibly attributed to the study treatment (i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out) . An assessment of pain, redness, swelling, induration, hemorrhage, and itching at the injection site will be performed. At all spe cified visits (see Table 1), the assessment of injection site reactions that have occurred since the previous visit will be made by the Investigator prior to any admi nistration of study treatment.

All local reactions that are obser ved will be monitored until they resolve. 7.4.4 Study Committees An independent DSMB and CVAC will be established for this study . Members of the DSMB and CVAC will consist of at least 3 independent experts appointed by R-Pharm International based on their expertise . Committee members will not be Investigators in the study, nor will they have any conflict of interest with R-Pharm International or its designee . Members of the DSMB and CVAC will only serve on their appointed committee . Furthe r details (e.g., frequency of data reviews and study committee composition and membership) will be provided in the predefined DSMB Charter and a separate CVAC Charter . 7.4.4.1 Data Safety Monitoring Board The independent DSMB members will perform ongoing safety su rveillance and provide recommendations to R-Pharm International regarding study conduct . These recommendations will be based mainly on the review of data for AEs and lab oratory parameters. Members of the DSMB will be partially blinded: they will be awar e of which subjects are in the same treatment group, but they will not be aware of the treatment assigned to each group. Members of the DSMB can request full unblinding of safety data if they consider it necessary. 7.4.4.2 Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee The CVAC will be responsible for evaluating MACE and will remain blinded to treatment assignment . The importance of the CVAC is to ensure that all potential MACE that have been reported are judged uniformly by a single group, using the same adjudication criteria . Data on the following fatal and nonfatal potential MACE ( as further defined in the CVAC Charter) will be collected and the events will be adjudicated by the CVAC (as well as assessed by the DSMB) :  Death  Non-fatal myocardial infarction  Non-fatal stroke of all classifications  Transient ischemic attack"

Ongoing AEs (i.e., AEs that started during the core study) should be recorded as an AE in the OLE study only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the OLE study . When recording such events on the AEs eCRF page, it is important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g ., “more frequent headaches”) . All AEs related to protocol procedures must be reported to R-Pharm International ’s designee . Investigators will seek informatio n on AEs at each subject contact .

All AEs, whether reported by the subject or noted by study site staff, will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AEs eCRF page. All AEs that occur at or after Visit 1 (OLE Baseline /Week 24) , regardless of severity, are to be recorded on the appropriate AE pages in the eCRF (either serious or nonserious) . The Investigator should complete all the details requested including dates of onset, severity, action taken, outcome, and relationship to study treatment . Each ev ent should be recorded separately. Investigators will be instructed to report to R-Pharm International ’s designee their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure and/or study treatment via the eCRF. Study site staff will reco rd any dosage of study treatment that exceeds the assigned dosage in the protocol via eCRF. Any clinically significant findings from laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, other procedures, etc. should be reported to R-Pharm International ’s desi gnee via eCRF, EDC, and/or designated data transmission methods . Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs on the AEs eCRF page, avoiding colloquialisms and abbreviations . Only 1 AE term should be recorded in the event field on the AEs eCRF page . For AEs other than injection -related reactions, a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the AEs eCRF page rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases) ."

If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by 1 AE report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom o f the eventual diagnosis. Each AE is to be evaluated for date and time to onset, duration, severity, seriousness, and potential relatedness to the study treatment and/or study procedure (i.e., any procedure required by the study protocol) . The action take n and the outcome must also be recorded in the AE page of the eCRF. 7.4.5.1 Patient -Reported Outcome Data Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data. However, if any subject responses suggestive of a possible AE are identified during study site revie w of the PRO questionnaires, study site staff will alert the Investigator, who will determine if the criteria for an AE have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the subject's medical record per study site practice. If the event me ets the criteria for an AE, it will be reported on the AEs eCRF. Information contained within the subject diary (see Section 5.5) will not be considered PRO data. 7.4.5.2 Reporting of S erious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur at or after Visit 1 ( OLE Baseline /Week 24) , regardless of the Investigator’s assessment on causality , must be recorded on the relevant pages of the eCRF and reported to R-Pharm International according to protocol requirements. Investigators must report the SAE within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the event . All SAEs must be reported via the EDC sys tem by completing the relevant eCRF pages in English . In the event that the EDC system is not functioning, SAEs must be reported within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the event using the back -up paper SAE report form (instructions provided in the Investigator binders) . Once the EDC system is operating normally again, Investigators must enter the SAE in the eCRF pages . All SAEs should be followed up as detailed in Section 7.4.5.5 , and t he timelines and procedure for follow -up reports are the same as those for the initial report.

Any SAE with a start date after the Follow -Up Period is not required to be reported unless the Investigator thinks that an event may be r elated to either the study treatment , study treatment administration, or a protocol procedure. 7.4.5.3 Reporting of S erious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and Investigators R-Pharm International ’s designee will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, ethics committees, and Investigators, in accordance with national regulations in the countries where the study is conducted . Relative to the first aware ness of the event by/or further provision to R-Pharm International ’s designee , SUSARs will be submitted within 7 days for fatal and life -threatening events and 15 days for other SUSARs, unless otherwise required by national regulations . R-Pharm Internatio nal’s designee will also prepare an expedited report for other safety issues where these might materially alter the current benefit -risk assessment of OKZ or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the study treatment administration or in the overa ll conduct of the study . The study site will also forward a copy of all expedited reports to the relevant Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with national regulations. 7.4.5.4 Follow -up of A dverse Events Any AEs that occur at or after Visit 1 ( OLE Baseline /Week 24) until the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period (i.e., 22 weeks after the last dose of study treatment ) will be followed up to resolution. Resolution means that the subject has returned to a baseline stat e of health, the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE, or the subject is lost to follow -up. The Investigator should follow each SAE until the event is resolved or returned to the baseline , the event is assessed as st able by the Investigator, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the subject withdraws consent. For AEs with a causal relationship to the study treatment , R-Pharm International or its designee must concur with the Investigator’s assessment. For SAEs, nonser ious AESIs , and pregnancies, R-Pharm International ’s designee may follow -up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant"

The Investigator should follow each SAE until the event has resolved to the baseline grade or better, the event i s assessed as stable by the Investigator, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the subject withdraws consent . If the subject is lost to follow -up, the SAE will be categorized based on the Investigator’s last assessment . Every effort should be made to fol low all SAEs considered to be related to OKZ or study -related procedures until an outcome can be reported. During the study, resolution of SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the SAE page of the eCRF and in the subject’s medical record to facilitate source data verification . If, after follow -up, return to the baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an explanation should be recorded on the SAE page of the eCRF. All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnanc y outcome. 7.4.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations Clinical laboratory tests will be reviewed for results of potential clinical significance at all time points throughout the study . The Investigator will evaluate any change in laboratory values . If the Investiga tor determines a laboratory abnormality to be clinically significant, it is considered a laboratory AE; however, if the abnormal laboratory value is consistent with a current diagnosis (or signs or symptoms if a diagnosis is not possible) and is not a clin ically significant worsening from the baseline laboratory parameter , it should be documented accordingly without being reported as a separate laboratory AE. The central laboratory will analyze the samples . Further details of the procedures to be followed for sample collection, storage, and shipment will be documented in a Laboratory Manual . Additional and repeat laboratory testing not specified in Table 1 may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator to ensure that the safety of subjects is protected. 7.4.6.1 Laboratory Parameters Unless otherwise noted, t he central laboratory will be used in this study to analyze routine blood samples .
