Key secondary objectives are an arm- to-arm comparison of the following: !Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response !Time to a first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) Additional Secondary Objectives: !Safety and tolerability of 177Lu-PSMA-617 !Health-related quality of life (HRQoL; EQ-5D-5L, FACT-P and Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form (BPI-SF)) !Health economics !Progression-free survival (PFS) (radiographic, clinical, or prostate-specific antigen [PSA] progression-free survival) !Biochemical response as measured by PSA. Alkaline phosphatase [ALP]levels and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels will also be measured. Study design: Patients with PSMA positive scans will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus best supportive/best standard of care or to receive best supportive/best standard of care only. Best supportive/best standard of care will be determined by the treating physician/investigator but will exclude investigational agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes, and hemi-body radiotherapy. Novel androgen axis drugs [NAADs] (such as abiraterone or enzalutamide) are allowed. The care of cancer patients must include cancer specialists accomplished in the care of patients with advanced prostate cancer, (e.g., medical, radiation oncologists) with a clear understanding of the PCWG3 2+2 rules for progression, management of adverse events (AEs) related to the natural course of the disease, as well as pre-existing AEs and study-related AEs. The study is open-label and patients will be monitored throughout the 6 to 10-month treatment period for survival, disease progression, and adverse events. rPFS will be analyzed in these patients once 364 events have accrued. At time of the rPFS primary analysis, there will also be an interim analysis of OS. Before final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS: When a patient discontinues from the treatment portion of the study, they will have an end of treatment visit and will then continue to be followed in long-term follow-up. A long-term follow-up period will incl ude the collection of rPFS survival and information about new treatments, along with the patient’s response to these treatments, adverse events assessment, and hematology and chemistry testing. During follow-up, patients will be contacted every 3 months (±1 month) via phone, email, or letter for up to 24 months or until 508 deaths have occurred.Patients who withdraw their consent to participate in the treatment portion of the study or come off the treatment portion of the study for any reason other than Printed on: 28 Apr 2021, 04:22:46 pm; Printed by:"

These patients will be asked to sign a separate consent detailing what kind of long- term follow-up assessments and study updates they will agree to. They will also be able to designate a contact person (e.g. study doctor, local doctor, friend or family member) who may be contacted on their behalf to obtain follow-up status updates. After final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS: All randomized patients on the active part of the study after the final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS will have an EOT visit at the next planned visit after implementation of V5.0 of the protocol and will move into long-term follow-up. All patients in long-term follow-up will con tinue to be followed for up to 12 months after V5.0 of th e protocol is implemented at the site, until death or until withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. The long-term follow-up period will include the collection of survival and new treatment information, adverse events assessment for renal toxicity and secondary malignancies, and results of hematology and chemistry testi ng. During follow-up, patients will be followed for safety and survival. They will be seen or contacted by a clinician every 3 months (±1 month) via phone, in person or via telemedicine visit, email or letter for up to 12 months after V5.0 of the protocol is implemented at the site, until death or until withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. The planned enrollment for this study is 814 patients. Study population: The study population includes patients with progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC who received at least one novel androgen ax is drug [NAAD] (such as enzalutamide or abiraterone) and were previously treated with 1 to 2 taxane regimens. Patients treated with only 1 prior taxane regimen are eligible if the patient is unwilling or the patient’s physician deems the patient unsuitable to receive a second regimen. Investigational product: Patients randomized to receive the investigational product will receive 7.4 GBq (±10%) 177Lu-PSMA-617 intravenously every 6 weeks (±1 week) for a maximum of 6 cycles. After 4 cycles, patients will be assessed for (1) evidence of response, (2) residual disease, and (3) tolerance to177Lu-PSMA-617. If the patient meets the criteria above and agrees to continue with additional treatment of 177Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy, the investigator may administer 2 additional cycles. Amaximum of 6 cycles of radioligand therapy is allowed. After the last cycle of 177Lu- PSMA-617, patients can continue best supportive/best standard of care alone. If the patient does not meet all of the criteria or does not agree to additional 177Lu- PSMA-617 treatment, then no additional doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 will be administered after Cycle 4. These patients can continue on best supportive/best standard of care alone after Cycle 4. Assessment schedule: Radiographic imaging will be done every 8 weeks (±4 days) during the first 24 weeks of treatment and every 12 weeks (± 4 days) thereafter, regardless of treatment delays, through the End of Treatment visit. The previous 2 PSA values will be noted before randomization. Serum/plasma testosterone and PSA levels will be measure d up to 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle. Hematology and chemistry will be done weekly during Cycle 1 (up to 3 days prior to each time point) and up to 3 days prior to Days 1, 15, and 29 in Cycles 2 to 6 (i.e. every two weeks). After Cycle 6, hematology and chemistry will be done every 12 weeks (±4 days) until the patient starts long-term follow-up. Patients will complete the BPI-SF, EQ-5D-5L and FACT-P questionnaires about their pain level and HRQoL during screening and prior to treatment on Day 1 of each cycle and through the End of Treatment visit. Patients will be monitored throughout the study for SSEs. Printed on: 28 Apr 2021, 04:22:46 pm; Printed by:"

Long-term follow-up will be extended for up to an additional 12 months from the time V5.0 of the protocol is implemented at the site. Statistical m ethodology: Subsequent to the implementation of measures to minimize early dropouts from the best supportive/best standard of care alone arm, the primary analysis of rPFS will focus on patients randomized on or after March 5th, 2019; rPFS will be analyzed in these patients once 364 events have accrued and the alpha level applied will be 0.004 1-sided. At time of the rPFS analysis, there will be an interim analysis of OS and the alpha level applied will be 0.001 1- sided; unlike rPFS, the analysis of OS will include all randomized patients (i.e., including those randomized before March 5 th, 2019). Following the analysis of rPFS and the interim analysis of OS, a final analysis of OS will be performed when 508 deaths have accrued and the alpha levelapplied will be 0.02 1-sided. This trial has at least 90% overall power and an overall Type I error rate of at most 0.025 1-sided. After the final analysis of OS is performed, additional analyses of the primary endpoints will be presented descriptively without statistical inference and at the same nominal alpha level used for the primary analysis for each endpoint. Duration of Study: Total duration of the study will be up to approximately 54 months. Printed on: 28 Apr 2021, 04:22:46 pm; Printed by:"

Almost 70% of the cases are diagnosed in more developed regions due to the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, but ther e is only modest variat ion in mortality rates globally which is driven by metastatic, and often cas tration-resistant disease (Ferlay et al 2013, Bray et al 2012). There is an urgent need for more effective treatments to improve outcomes for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate can cer (mCRPC). Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortality in Un ited States (US) men (Siegel et al 2017), driven by prostate cancer patients who no longer respond to hormonal therapy. Once patients reach the mCRPC stage, their expected overall survival is low as was seen in the randomized phase 3 study of cabozantinib vs prednisone in men with mCRPC who had received prior docetaxel and abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide; the median overall survival of the prednisone control arm was 9.8 months (Smith et al 2016). Post-doc etaxel mCRPC patients have an annual death rate of 73% (Scher et al 2015). The median age at diagnosis of mCRPC is 70 years (Flaig et al 2016). Metastatic prostate cancer has a predilection for bone. As a result, approximately 90% of mCRPC patients develop bone metastases (Kirby et al 2011), and 49% of them will develop a serious skeletal event within 2 years (Saad et al 2004). Commo n presentations include bone pain, bone marrow failure, fatigue, or complications such as fractures a nd cord compression. These presentations typically require radiation or bone surgery, which can significantly impair physical, emotional, and functional well-being (Weinfurt et al 2005). These pati ents, many of whom are elderly, can be extremely symptomatic and at risk of se rious oncological complicatio ns. They can be a considerable challenge in the clinic due to the symptoms of metastatic soft tissue and visceral disease, general frailty, bone marrow impairment, and because they have exhausted approved Printed on: 28 Apr 2021, 04:22:46 pm; Printed by:"

In mCRPC patients facing advanced illness with little hope for a cure, the focus of treatment shifts from active anti-cancer treatment to palliative care for relief of physical symptoms, maintaining function, and attempting to improve their health-related quality of life (Cella et al 2009). Therefore, in addition to tr acking essential clinical outcomes, it is also important to assess and evaluate changes in HRQoL of such fragile patients as they receive treatment. Several agents have been approved for the treatment of mCRPC, and NCCN, ASCO, ESMO, and APCCC guidelines provide some consensus and guidance for their use. Regardless, none of these therapies are proven to prolong survival after enzalutamide or abiraterone. In practice, abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide are often used in the first-line mCRPC setting; Sipuleucel-T is best used in mildly asymptomatic small volume disease; and 223Radium is used to treat men with bone-only disease. Taxane-based chemotherap y is most often used today after abiraterone or enzalutamide and for symptomat ic patients, particularly with visceral disease. Docetaxel is used more commonly that cabazitaxel. Because bot h agents have a typical chemotherapy side effect profile, they are often not considered for patients due to comorbid ity, poor hematological reserve, or patient refusal (Zielinski et al 2014). Six small published series with a total of 499 patients have examined the efficacy of either abiraterone or enzalutamide in men previously exposed to a taxane and either abiraterone or enzalutamide. These modern hormonal agents produced only modest activity, including PSA decline >50% in 4% to 22% of patients, a median PFS of 2.7 to 4.6 months and a median OS of 7.2 to 12.2 months (Azad et al 2015, Cheng et al 2015, Badrising et al 2014, Brasso et al 2015, Loriot et al 2013, Noonan et al 2013). It’s important to note that this is in contrast with the level of anti-tumor activity demonstr ated in the pivotal clinical trials for these agents that led to approval. In that setting, patients had only received prior docetaxel and had not been exposed to prior therapy with either abiraterone or enzalu tamide. As these modern hormonal agents have been used in earlier lines of therapy, the use of a second agent following docetaxel has resulted in diminished efficacy, likely due to cross resistance. Therefore, there are limited options available to patients who fail or refuse taxane-based chemotherapy, particularly if alternative agents currently approved in this setting (abiraterone and enzalutamide) have been used earlier in the disease. Prostate-specific membrane antigen Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane protein, also known as folate hydrolase or glutamate carboxypeptid ase II. PSMA is highly overe xpressed in nearly all prostate cancers, but has restricted, and several hundred- fold lower, expression in some normal tissues such as the duodenal mucosa, proximal renal tubules, and salivary glands (Bostwick et al 1998, Ghosh and Heston 2004, Mannweiler et al 2009). Additionally, PSMA overexpression also correlates with advanced, high-grade, metasta tic, androgen-independent disease (Ross et al 2003). The differential expression of PSMA from tumor to non-tumor tissue has resulted in numerous targeted strategies involving both disease localization using radioactive imaging as well as therapeutic intervention, and therefore may be an attractive target for men with mCRPC. In addition to the expression pattern, the f unctionality of PSMA plays an equally important role in its value as a tumor-specific targeting mechanism. Specifically, the binding of a high affinity Printed on: 28 Apr 2021, 04:22:46 pm; Printed by:"

This functional feature of PSMA allows for the development of low-molecular-weight ta rgeted radiopharmaceut icals with favorable pharmacokinetic and tumor penetration properties, rather than being restricted to antibody-based targeting strategies (Haberkorn et al 2016). The result of both selective expression and ligand-based uptake using PSMA as a target is a reduction in background uptake and off-target toxicities as well as an increase in the amount of radioactivity that localizes at the tumor site. 177Lu-PSMA-617 mechanism of action The novel PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy 177Lu-PSMA-617 consists of the PSMA-binding ligand 177Lu-PSMA-617 exhibits high PSMA binding affinity and internalization, prolonged tumor retention, and rapid kidney clearance (Benešová et al 2015). PSMA-617 was uniquely developed for both imaging and radioligand therapy of prostate cancer and can be radiolabeled with gallium-68 ( 68Ga), lutetium-177 (177Lu), indium-111, copper-64, scandium-44, actinium-225, or yttrium-90 (90Y). 177Lu, the radioactive cargo being delivered by PSMA-617, has physical properties that make it an ideal radionuclide for the treatment of mCRPC. 177Lu is a medium- ‐energy β ‐-emitter (490 keV) with a maximum energy of 0.5 MeV a nd a maximal tissue penetration of <2 mm. The shorter β‐range of 177Lu provides better irradiation of small tumors, in contrast to the longer β-range of 90Y (Emmett et al 2017). The shorter path length also acts to direct the energy within the tumor rather than in the surrounding normal tissues, while the path length is still sufficient to create bystander and crossfire e ffects within the tumor lesion. 177Lu has a relatively long physical half -life of 6.6 days that combines with the intratumoral retention of 177Lu-PSMA-617 to reduce the necessary dosing frequency. It is these physical properties, and the benefit of PSMA- targeting, that allow for the deliv ery of effective activities of 177Lu to prostate cancer cells. 177Lu-PSMA-617 for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer The novel therapeutic drug 177Lu-PSMA-617 was developed by the German Cancer Research Center, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) in collaboration with University Hospital Heidelberg for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer (Kulkarni et al 2018 Kulkarni HR, Langbein T, Atay C, Singh A, Schuchardt C, Lehmann C, Pomper M, Pienta KJ, Baum RP.

Based on preclinical data that demonstrated high PSMA binding affinity and compound internalization, prolonged tumor uptake, rapid kidney clearance, and high tumor-to-background ratio, 177Lu-PSMA-617 proceeded into clinical development at investigative sites in Germany.

Dosimetry data suggest that 177Lu-PSMA-617 is targ eted to PSMA-expressing tissue, which may include the salivary glands, kidneys, and small and large bowel. The highest exposure is to salivary glands, however in the prospective study xerostomia appears low grade and occurs at a rate of approximately 87% in tr eated patients. Clearance of 177Lu PSMA-617 from the kidney occurs rapidly. To date nephrotoxicity has not b een notable in any safety series. There are no reports of Grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity in the literature. The exposure to normal bone marrow tissue is predictably low as it does not express PSMA and corresponds with normal plasma clearance. There was some evidence of reversible hematological toxicity that occurred following 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment that manifested as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, with rates of 0 to 40% and 4% to 67% respectively. The first published clinical series of 177Lu-PSMA-617 consisted of 10 patients (Ahmadzadehfar et al 2015) treated between November 2013 a nd January 2014, with 5. 6 GBq/150mCi (4.1–6.1 GBq/110–165 mCi). PSA decline >50% occurred in 50% of subjects, which increased to 60% after 2 cycles of 6 GBq/160 mCi (4.1–7.1 GBq/110–190 mCi). The level of PSA decline >50% (most commonly used to assess tumor response in these studies) has remained remarkably consistent across several clinical series when 2 or more doses of ≥6 GBq/160 mCi are given. Hofman presented the first prospective open-label, single-arm, non-randomized Phase 2 study of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in 50 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients dosed with up to 4 cycles of 4–8 GBq/110–220 mCi administered ever y 6 weeks (Hofman et al 2018, Hofman et al 2019). The primary endpoints of this study were to evaluate both safety and efficacy, as measured by PSA response, bone pain score, quality of life measurements, imaging response and survival. Of the screened patients, 70% were identified as PSMA-positive via PET imaging and eligible for treatment. Most subjects had been exposed to at least 1 taxane chemotherapy and either abiraterone or enzalutamide in the mCRPC setting. In this heavily pre-treated patient population with few therapeutic alternatives, 64% of patients on 177Lu-PSMA-617 showed a PSA response defined by a reduction in PSA of at least 50%, and 44% had a reduction of PSA of 80% or more. In 27 patients with measurable disease, the objective response rate in measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) crite ria was 56% (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]). Median overall survival was 13.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.5-18.0). Therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-617 was well tolerated. These safety and efficacy data also translated into significantly improved quality of life scores and reduction in pain scores. In summary, over 40 compassionate use publications and prospective Phase 2 clinical trial data describe the use of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in patients who have been exposed to approved agents. In the post-taxane, post-androgen axis inhibitor setting 177Lu-PSMA-617 has demonstrated a well- established, predictable, well tolerated safety profile .

Efficacy has been demonstrated on multiple clinically significant endpoints, including PSA respons e, soft tissue lesion response measured by RECIST, PFS, OS, pain and quality of life. No standard dose and schedule have been developed. The preliminary clinical evidence indicates177Lu-PSMA-617 may demonstrate clinical benefit in patients with mCRPC in a setting where patients had been exposed to chemotherapy and NAADs and there is no recommended standard of care. This Phase 3 study will assess the efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC by measuring overall survival and rPFS in a randomized, prospective, open-label trial. 1.2 Summary of nonclinical studies with clinical significance In vitro PSMA affinity and internalization studies According to Benešová et al, the results of the binding assay of PSMA-617 in PSMA-positive LNCaP cells demonstrated a very high binding affinity, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K i) value of 2.34 ± 2.94 nM. The internalization of PSMA-617 is highly e ffective with an internalized fraction of 17.51 ± 3.99 pe rcent of the added activity/106LNCaP cells (n = 3) at 37°C (Benešová et al 2015). Organ distribution in mice bearing PSMA-positive LNCaP tumors The organ distribution with 177Lu-PSMA-617 in mice showed a high specific uptake in LNCaP tumors and in the murine kidneys, as exp ected. Importantly, the high initial kidney uptake is almost completely cleared within 24 hours whereas the tumor uptake remained high or even tended to slightly increase during that time frame. Other organs such as the liver, lung and spleen demonstrated low uptake at 24 hours after injection (Benešová et al 2015). Biodistribution in Wistar rats Pharmacokinetic evaluation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in normal healthy male Wistar rats exhibited major renal clearance with no significant uptake in any of the major organ/tissue (Das et al 2016). More than 80% of the injected activity was excreted within 3 hours post-in jection. Retention of residual activity was observed in intestine, liver, kidneys and skeleton at 24 hours post-administration. However, uptake in these organs, except skeleton, was observed to gradually decrease with the time. Repeat-dose toxicity in Wistar rats The toxicity of non-radioactive PSMA-617 admin istered once weekly by intravenous (IV) administration to male Wistar rats over 22 days was tested in a toxicology study. The animals were treated with 40, 160, or 400 μg PSMA-617/kg b.w. by IV bolus injection on test days 1, 8, 15, and 22. The control group was treated with physiological saline. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level was found to be above 400 μg PSMA-617/kg body weight administered once weekly by IV bolus injection (Leuschner 2016). The es timated mass of the PSMA-617 precursor which is applied per treatment cycle is likely to be approximately 150 to 250 μg. Using the NOAEL for repeat dosing of PSMA-617 of 400 μg/kg in rats, this accounts for a safety margin of approximately 16-27-fold, assuming that the average patient has a body surface are of 1.7 m 2.

Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2017 Jun;44(6):1014-1024. Ferdinandus et al 2017, Rahbar et al 2016b, Yadav et al 2017).Dosimetry studies have confirmed that 177Lu PSMA-617 is targeted and normal tissues that express PSMA are exposed to radiation (Delker et al 2016). These tissues are salivary glands, renal, and small and large bowel. Renal absorbed dose is cleared rapidly, and exposure appears similar to that seen with 177Lu-DOTATATE. The exposure to normal bone marrow tissue should be low and correspond with normal plasma clearance. Nephrotoxicity has not been notable in any safety series. There are no reports of Grade 3/4 nephrotoxicity in the literature. There was some evidence of reversible hematological toxicity that occurred following 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment that manifested as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, with rates of 0 to 40% and 4% to 67% respectively. Rahbar (2017) reported 177Lu-PSMA-617 was associated with asymptomatic Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia in 3%, 10%, 4%, respectively. Mild reversible xerostomia occurred in 8% of subjects. No significant diarrhea or renal impairment were reported from a retrospective review of doctor reports (Rahbar et al 2017). Dr. Hofman recently presented results from the first prospective clinical trial with 177Lu-PSMA-617 (Hofman et al 2019). In the trial, 50 mCRPC patients were dosed with up to 4 cycles of 4–8 GBq. Prospective common toxicity cri teria for adverse events (CTCAE) v4 safety data was defined. He found his regimen to be well-tolerated. The most common non- hematological toxicities attributed to 177Lu-PSMA-617 occurring in >25% of patients included transient G1-2 dry mouth (66%), G1-2 nausea (48%), G1-3 fatigue (38%), and G1-2 vomiting (26%). The most common hematological toxicities attributed to 177Lu-PSMA-617 occurring in >25% of patients included G1-3 lymphocyt openia (72%), G1-4 throm bocytopenia (38%), G1-3 neutropenia (30%) and G1-3 anemia (28%). G3-4 toxicities attributed to 177Lu-PSMA-617 were infrequent with lymphocyt openia (32%), thrombocyt openia (10%), anaemia (10%), neutropenia (6%) and fatigue (2%). Potential risks of 177Lu-PSMA-617 include the effects of radiological toxicity, namely xerostomia, fatigue, myelosuppression and mild nausea and vomiting.

If the patient meets all of the criteria a bove, and agrees to continue with additional tr eatment of 177Lu-PSMA-617, the investigator may administer a further 2 cycles. A maximum of 6 cycles of radioligand therapy is allowed. If the patient does not meet any of the criteria or does not agree to additional 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment, then no additional doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 will be administered after Cycle 4. After the last cycle of 177Lu-PSMA-617, patients can continue best supportive/best standard of care alone. Best supportive/best standard of care for each patient will be selected at the discretion of the patient’s physician, prior to randomization and will be administered per the physician’s orders and continued until the patient comes off the treatment part of the study and enters the long-term follow-up stage. A patient may choose to discontinue randomized tr eatment part of the study at any time. Before final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS: If a patient chooses only to discontinue from the randomized treatment in the study for a reason other than radiographic progression, the patient will be asked to confirm if they consent to continue to be follo wed for long-term safety, rPFS, and survival follow-up. The patient will continue to be followed for long-term follow-up unless they specifically withdraw consent from long-term follow-up of the study. An End of Tr eatment (EOT) visit should occur once a patient discontinues randomised treatment for any reason (patient or investigator decision, going on to long-term follow-up, etc.). The EOT visit should occur approximately 30 days from the last dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 or the date of the best supportive/best standard of care end of treatment decision (whichever occurs later), but before the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer treatment, outside of what is allowed on study. If a patient discon tinues ra ndomized tr eatment for any reason other than radiographic progression, they will be asked for permission to continue co llecting radiographic images (bone scans and CT scans and/or MRIs) for the purpose of continuing to assess rPFS.After the EOT visit, patients will enter the long-term follow-up period. The long-term follow-up period will include the collection of rPFS (if discontinuing for reasons other than radiographic progression), survival and information about new trea tments, along with the patient’s response to these treatments, adverse events assessment, an d results of hematology and chemis try testing. During follow-up, patients will be followed for safety and survival. They will be contacted every 3 months (±1 month) via phone, email, or letter for up to 24 months or until 508 deaths have occurred. Patients who withdraw their consent to participate in the study for any reason other than radiographic disease progression will be asked fo r permission to continue long-term status updates which may include, in addition to the above, collection of radiographic images (bone scans and CT scans and/or MRIs).

For any of these patients who are unable to sign the second consent (i.e. does not return to the site, etc.) every effort will be made to documen t the extent of long-term follow-up they will agree to. This will be documented in their source records. After final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS : All randomized patients on the active part of the study, after the final analysis of the OS primary endpoint will have an EOT visi t at the next planned visit after implementation of V5.0 of the protocol at the site a nd will move into long-term follow-up. All patients in long-term follow-up will continue to be followed for up to 12 m onths after implementation of V5.0 of the protocol at the site, until d eath or until withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. The long-term follow-up period will include the collection of survival and new treatment information, adverse events assessment for renal toxicity and secondary malignancies, and results of hematology and chemistry testing. During follow-up , patients will be followed for safety and survival. They will be seen or contacted by a clinician every 3 months (±1 month) via phone, in person or via telemedicine visit, email or letter for up to 12 months after implementation of V5.0 of the protocol at the site, until death or until withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. This study will enroll approximately 814 patien ts involving about 110 sites worldwide. 3.1.1 Study design update The trial was originally designed to randomize 750 patients, targeting the primary analysis of rPFS with 457 events, an interim analysis of OS, to be conducted contemporaneously with the primary analysis of rPFS, and a final analysis of OS with 489 deaths. However, shortly after commencement of the trial, a high, early dropout rate amongst those randomized to BS/BSC only became evident with the majority of these dropouts withdrawing consent to follow-up. This meant that rPFS data could not be collected for these patients which consequently could result in bias in the analysis of rPFS. Remedial measures to curtail this phenomenon were implemented and made effective on March 5 th, 2019. As part of the plan to address the early withdrawal of consent in the BS/BSC-only arm, the primary analysis of rPFS was altered to focus on patients prospectively randomized on or after March 5 th, 2019; therefore, rPFS will be analyzed in these patients once 364 events have accrued. At time of the rPFS primary analysis, there will also be an interim analysis of OS; this OS analysis will be on an intent to treat (ITT) basis and will include all randomized patients (i.e., including those randomized before March 5 th, 2019). Following the analysis of rPFS and the interim analysis of OS, a final ITT analysis of the OS primary objective will be performed when 508 deaths have accrued. To achieve these analyses, the total number of subjects randomized into the trial was increased from N=750 to N=814. The revisions described do not alter the hypothesized treatment effects for rPFS and OS upon which the study was originally powered. 3.2 Rationale for the study design The primary objective of this study is to compare the two alternate endpoints of rPFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC who receive 177Lu-PSMA- Printed on: 28 Apr 2021, 04:22:46 pm; Printed by:"

The statistical design of the study is such that, to be declared positive, the study would be required to reach statist ical signif icance on either rPFS orOS at the respective allocated alpha level; it is not required to statistically meet both rPFS and OS to be declared a positive study. Secondary endpoints have been defined by PCWG3 as well as FDA and EMEA guidance. In view of the highly symptomatic nat ure of advanced mCRPC both validated pain (BPI-SF) and HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L and FACT-P) measurements will be collected using various questionnaires. 3.3 Measures taken to minimize/avoid bias Patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Randomization will be stratified to avoid bias in treatment selection (S ection 3.4.3). Treatment will be open-label. Reading of the baseline 68Ga-PSMA-11 P ET/CT scan will be done by central readers for consistency. 3.4 Description of the clinical trial 3.4.1 Description of investigati onal medicinal product The 68Ga-PSMA-11 radiopharmaceutical will be administered intravenously at a dose of 111 - 185 MBq (3 - 5 mCi). For background and additional details on 68Ga-PSMA-11, refer to the 68Ga-PSMA-11 Investigator’s Brochure. Refer to the Fendler et al 2017 publication “68Ga-PSMA PET/CT: Joint EANM and SNMMI procedure guideline for prostate cancer imaging: version 1.0 guideline” for an overview of 68Ga- PSMA-11 recommendations. Details of the patient preparation and administration can be found in the Imaging Manual. The 177Lu-PSMA-617 solution for injection consists of a sterile solution in glass vials containing 7.4 (±0.74) GBq of 177Lu-PSMA-617 at time of injection. Refer to the 177Lu-PSMA-617 IB for additional details of the investigational medicinal product including the pharmacological class and action, the dosage form including excipients, and any available packaging and labelling. 3.4.2 Dosage and r ationale for dose selection In the investigational arm, patients will receive best supportive/best standard of care regimen and IV 7.4 GBq (±10%) 177Lu-PSMA-617 once every 6 weeks (±1 week) for a maximum of 6 cycles. After 4 cycles patients will be reassessed to determine if a further 2 cycles can be given for a maximum of 6 cycles (Section 3.1). The basic principle of 177Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy is to systemically deliver low dose rate radiation specifically to multiple PSMA pos itive prostate cancer lesions, while sparing normal tissues. To date, 11 dos imetry studies have been conducted and published in over 100 patients. The results are consistent across the studies and demonstrate exposure that correlates well with the expected rapid clearance of a small molecule, and the limited distribution pattern of a PSMA-targeted radionuclide. The primary sites of non-tumor uptake were the salivary glands, lacrimal glands, and kidneys, with excretory mechan isms contributing to exposure in the kidneys Printed on: 28 Apr 2021, 04:22:46 pm; Printed by:"

PSMA-negative tissues like the bone marrow, are exposed transiently to 177Lu-PSMA-617 while in circulation, however this exposure is minimized due to its rapid elimination. 177Lu-PSMA-617 is well tolerated according to the clinical experience that has been documented in 42 publications, summarizing the safety and or efficacy information from over 800 subjects. Across these studies doses have ranged from 1.1-12.0 GBq, and schedu les have typically followed an administration schedule of once every 4 to 12 weeks, for 1-9 cy cles. The majority of these publications have used a regimen of 4 cycles of 6 GBq every 8 weeks, as published by the German Radiopharmaceutical Society in 2015. Howeve r, efficacy and safety information from the prospective phase 2 study suggested that dosing of 6-8 GBq every 6 weeks for 4 cycles was well tolerated and efficacious (Hofman et al 2018). Clinical series now show reports of more than 4 cycles of 177Lu PSMA-617 being administered safely as a means to maximize the benefit to the patient (Rahbar et al 2018, Kulkarni et al 2018, Bräuer et al 2017, Yordanova et al 2017). In addition, a recent review suggests optimal dosing of 6 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 administered every 6 weeks in a decreasing scale reaching a total cumulative absorbed dose of 44 GBq (Emmett et al 2017). Six fractions of 7.4 GBq, delivers a similar total dose of 44.4 GBq. In the ANZUP1603 study in 200 Australian patients (NCT03392428), which is comparing 177Lu- PSMA-617 with cabazitaxel, the dose starts at 8.5 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617 and reduces by 0.5 GBq per cycle, i.e. 8.5, 8, 7.5, 7, 6.5, 6 (cycle #6). A maximum of 6 cycles given every 6 weeks is what is being evaluated, which equates to a cumulative dose that is similar to that for this proposed st udy. The clinical safety review and detailed analyses of the radiation exposure support the intended dose and frequency of 177Lu-PSMA-617 administration in this clinical trial. 3.4.3 Subject alloc ation to treatment Patients will be randomized by an interactive response system in a 2:1 ratio to the investigational treatment arm ( 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus best supportive/best standard of care) or the best supportive/best standard of care-only arm u sing a permuted block scheme. Rando mization will be stratified by the following factors: !LDH (≤260 IU/L vs. > 260 IU/L) !Presence of liver metastases (yes vs. no) !ECOG score (0 or 1 vs. 2) !Inclusion of NAAD in best supportive/best standard of care at time of randomization (yes vs no) 3.4.4 End of treatment visit An EOT visit should occur once a patient disc ontinues the treatment part of the study for any reason (patient or investigator decision, going on to long-term follow-up, etc.).

As per the patient’s physician, when the participant requires care that is not allowed on study, the participant will discontinue treatment and enter the long-term follow-up period. While the patient and/or physician may decide prematurely to cease taking randomized therapy at any time, full follow-up of all randomized patients for the intended duration of the trial is planned by design for the collection of rPFS and OS data. It is anticipated that it will take approx. 14 months to randomize the required 814 patients in the study. After the last patient is randomized patients will be followed for up to 24 months or at least until 508 deaths have occurred. The maximum duration of the study, from first date of randomization to last follow-up, will there fore be approximately 38 months. After final analysis of the OS primary endpoint, lo ng-term follow-up will be extended for up to an additional 12 months after implementation of V5.0 of the protocol at the site, until p atient death or un til patient withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. The maximum duration of the study, from first date of rando mization to last follow- up, will therefore be up to approximately 54 months. 3.5 End of trial definition The trial and long-term follow-up procedures are expected to continue at least until 508 deaths have occurred. Long-term follow-up for safety and survival will continue for up to an additional 12 months after implementation of V5.0 of the protocol at the site. For timing of the rPFS and OS analyses and any rules for early statistical curtailment, refer to Section 8.1. 4. SELECTION AND DISCONTINUATION OF SUBJECTS Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any study-related procedures. The Investigator will ensure that the participant is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risks and benefits of the study as well as the participant’s financial responsibility. While full follow-up is intended in the ITT population for the planned duration of the trial, participants must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time. The participant will be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided.

Nausea and vomiting Mild nausea and vomiting may occur without prophyl actic therapy and antiemetic treatment is recommended. Oral or IV ondansetron (or equivalent) and/or dexamethasone or equivalent institutional anti-emetic regimen s hould be administered on the day of 177Lu-PSMA-617 administration. If oral administration is give n, it should occur at least 30 minutes before dosing and, if by injection, at least 15 minutes prior to infusing 177Lu-PSMA-617. Additionally, dexamethasone and domperidone/metoclopramide or institutional anti-emetic regimen may be administered on Days 2 and 3 of each cycle if required at the discretion of the investigator. Other anti-emetics should be used as required as per sta ndard clinical practice. Additional suggested treatment guidelines A listing of additional suggested treatment guidelines can be found in Appendix 2. These are to be used at the discretion of the investigator. 5.1.4 Management of toxici ty adverse events: dosing delays and modification Within the first few days of treatment the most common adverse events (AEs) are general fatigue and an increase in bone pain. Symptomatic hematologic toxicity may occur but is not common. Every effort should be made to keep the treatment cycle of 6 weeks ( ±1 week) at the prescribed doses. Physical exams , assessment of toxicities, along with hematology and chemistry results must all be assessed prior to dosing with 177Lu-PSMA-617. At the discretion of the investigator, a dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 may be delayed or reduc ed. Table 1 provides dose modification recommendations. Only one reduction in administered activity is permitted. If a patient has further toxicity that would require an additional reduction in administered activity, treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 must be discontinued. Once a dose is reduced, treatment with 177Lu- PSMA-617 should not be re-escalated. If a treatment delay due to adverse event or toxicity management persists for >4 weeks, treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 must be discontinued. If treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 is discontinued due to an AE, abnormal laboratory value, or toxicity, treatment with best supportive/best standard of care may continue at the discretion of the investigator if the patient has not radiographically progressed as measured by PCWG3 criteria.

Periodic radiographic imaging will include both: !CT with contrast/MRI imaging !Bone scans with technetiu m-99m labeled diphosphonates CT with contrast/MRI tumor assessments should include evaluations of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Disease progression by bone scan will be defined as at least 2 new bone lesions at the first post- treatment scan, with at least two additional lesions on the next (confirmatory) scan (2+2 PCWG3 criteria, Scher et al 2016). For scans after the fi rst post-treatment scan, at least two new lesions relative to the first post-treatment scan confirmed on a subsequent scan (2+2 PCWG3 criteria).

The Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form will be used as part of this study to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions. Full details regarding the BPI-SF, its validation and clinical application are available in the Brief Pain Inventory User Guide (Cleeland 2009). A copy of the BPI-SF questionnaire is provided in Appendix 8. 6.2.6 Health-related quality of life The ECOG Performance Status scale will be used to assess patients’ ability to perform daily living tasks and their range of basic physical abilit y. A copy of the EC OG scale is provided in Appendix 4. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will also be administered as a part of this study to assess HRQoL. EQ-5D is an international, validated, standardized, generic questionnaire for describing and valuing HRQoL (Rabin 2001). EQ-5D was develo ped by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of h ealth for clinical and economic appraisal (EuroQoL Group 1990). This instrument generates a preference-based healt h-state utility score (EQ-5D utility index) and an overall health-state score based on a visual analogue scale (EQ-5D VAS). EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by respondents and is ideally suited for use in clinics and face-to-face interviews. It is cognitively undemanding, taking only a few minutes to complete. Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire. The most recent version of EQ-5D is the EQ-5D-5L, which was developed to improve the instrument’s sensitivity and to reduce ceiling effects. The number of dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) has not changed, however the new version includes five levels of severity in each of the existing dimensions in place of t hree (EuroQoL Group 2015). Full details regarding the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, including references, are available at the EQ-5D website: https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-5l-about.

The FACT-P is made up of 2 parts: the FACT-G (general) questionnaire with 27 questions, and the Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) with an additional 12 questions. The FACT-G (Function al Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General) questionnaire is one of the most widely used HRQoL instruments and measures HRQoL in four different domains: Physical well-being, Functi onal well-being, Emotional well-being, and Social/Family well-being (Cella et al 1993). The PCS is designed specifically to measure prostate cancer-specific quality of life. Each item in both the FACT-G and PCS is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain, as well as global quality of life score with higher scores representing better QoL. The FACT system has a number of advantages as a method of measuring QoL: !Questionnaires have been developed to reflect patients’ concerns !Measurements are reliable, reproducible, and have been validated in numerous studies (Cella et al 1993, Esper et al 1997) !Available in over 45 different languages !Designed for patient self-administration, but can also be administered by interview format (Webster et al 2003) Full details regarding the FACT-P questionnaire, including references, are available at the FACIT website: http://www.facit.org/FACITOrg/Questionnaires. A copy of the questionnaire (FACT-P version 4) is provided in Appendix 10. HRQoL will be periodically assessed at baseline, prior to administration of each cycle of 177Lu- PSMA-617, and through the End of Treatment visit. 6.2.7 Health Economics A health ec onomics (HE) sub-study will be performed. Core health resource use information will be collected, using case report forms (CRFs) on days in hospital and any outpatient visits. Data collected on concomitant medication may also be used in the economic analysis. For the economic modelling, costs will be imputed on the basis of representative country unit costs at the point of analysis using standard fee schedules. Health outcomes will be assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Quality adjustments will be based on patients’ responses to the EQ-5D health status measure which will be administered at baseline, before each cycle of therapy, and each point of follow-up as part of the QoL questionnaire. 6.2.8 Clinical progression Clinical progression will be assessed by the investigator. The following criteria should be used to determine when a patient has met the standard for unequivocal evidence of clinical progression: !Marked escalation in cancer-related pain that is assessed by the investigator to indicate the need for other systemic chemotherapy Printed on: 28 Apr 2021, 04:22:46 pm; Printed by:"

Hematology and chemistry blood work results will al so be collected. Patients who withdraw their consent to participate in the treatment portion of th e study or come off the treatment portion of the study for any reason other than radiographi c disease progression will be asked for permission to continue long-term status upd ates which may include, in addition to the above, collection of radiographic images (bone scans and CT scans and/or MRIs). These patients will be asked to sign a separate consent detailing what kind of long-term follow- up assessments and study updates they will agree t o. They will also be able to designate a contact person (i.e. study doctor, local doctor, friend or family member) who may be contacted on their behalf to obtain follow-up status updates. For any of these patients who are unable to sign the second consent (i.e. does not return to the site, etc.) every effort will be made to documen t the extent of long-term follow-up they will agree to. This will be documented in their source records.

ADVERSE EVENTS 7.1 Adverse event definitions The following definitions comply with the ICH E2A guidance, Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expe dited Reporting, and the safety definitions of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Drug Monitoring Center. Term Definitionsa Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Progression of disease is not considered an AE or SAE for this study. Adverse Drug Reaction For an investigational medicinal product all noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Adverse Drug ReactionA serious adverse event or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: !results in death; except for deaths due to progression of disease !is life-threatening; !requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; !results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or !is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. NOTE: The term ""life-threatening"" in the definition of ""serious"" refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction bAn adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (i.e., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved investigational medicinal product). aICH E2A, Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting. bAlso referred to as a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR). AE = adverse event; SAE = serious adverse event 7.2 Evaluating and recording adverse events Before final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS: All AEs will be graded according to CTCAE v5.0. All AE monitoring and SAE recording and reporting will begin at the time of consent and will continue up to and including 30 days after the last dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 or the date of best supportive/best standard of care end of treatment decision, whichever is later. For patient s that are not randomized, AE monitoring will continue up to and including 6 days after administration of 68Ga-PSMA-11. All AEs and abnormal test findings, regardless of suspected causal relationship to 68Ga-PSMA- 11, 177Lu-PSMA-617, and/or best supportive/best standard of care, will be recorded in the patients’ case histories.

AEs or abnormal test findings felt to be associated with 68Ga-PSMA-11, 177Lu-PSMA-617, and/or best supportive/best standard of care will be followed until the event or its sequelae or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator. The investigator will promptly review AEs and abnormal test findings to determine if: 1) the abnormal test finding should be classified as an A E; 2) there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by 68Ga-PSMA-11, 177Lu-PSMA-617, and/or best supportive/best standard of care; and 3) the AE meets the criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE). If the final determination of causality is “unknown and of ques tionable relationship to the study drug” the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the study drug for reporting purposes. If the final determination of causality is “unknown but not related to the study drug” the determination and rationale will be documented in the patient’s case history. After final analysis of alternate primary endpoint OS: All AEs will be graded according to CTCAE v5.0. All AE monitoring and SAE recording and reporting will begin at the time of consent and will continue up to and including 30 days after the last dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 or the date of best supportive/best standard of care end of treatment decision, whichever is later. In addition, SAE recording and reporting will be continued in the long-term follow-up period. During long-term follow-up, SAEs are to be reported only if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study treatment. SAEs experienced after the 30-day period following the last administration of randomizedtreatment, including during long-term follow-up, should be reported to Novartis Safety if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study treatment. During long-term follow -up, for all renal toxi cities, secondary m alignancies and all SAEs, sufficient information will be obtained to permit an adequate determination of the outcome of the event and an assessment of the casual relationship between the AE and 177Lu-PSMA-617, and/or best supportive/best standard of care. SAEs, renal toxicities and secondary malignancies felt to be associated with 177Lu-PSMA-617, and/or best supportive/best standard of care will be followed until the event or its sequelae or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator. The investigator will promptly review AEs and a bnormal test findings to determine if: 1) the abnormal test finding should be classified as an AE ; 2) there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by, 177Lu-PSMA-617, and/or best supportive/best standard of care; and 3) the AE meets the criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE). If the final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the study drug” the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the study drug for reporting purposes. If the final determination of causality is “unknown but not r elated to the study drug” the determination and rationale will be documented in the patient’s case history. Renal toxicities and secondary malignancies will be recorded as AEs. Any AE determined to meet the criteria for a serious adverse event and considered related to the study drug (even a questionable relationship) should be recorded as an AE and reported as an SAE.

STATISTICS This section outlines the general study design, study endpoints, and statistical analysis strategy for the study. All statist ical analyses will be carried out using SAS version 9.4 (or la ter). The SAP will be written and finalized prior to the first planned analysis and without knowledge of any by-treatment group accumulated data. The SAP will provide a detailed and expanded description of the statistical methods outlined in this protocol. Additional analyses, such as important subgroups, will be described. After the final analysis of OS is performed, addi tional analyses of the primary endpoints will be presented descriptively without statist ical inference and at the s ame nominal alpha level used for the primary analysis for each endpoint. Final safety analyses will be performed when the last patient is followed for up to 12 months, dies or withdraws consent, whichever occurs first. 8.1 Revision to the protocol and statistical analyses of rPFS and OS The trial was originally designed to randomize 750 patients, targeting the primary analysis of rPFS with 457 events with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.001, an interim analysis of OS with a 1- sided alpha level of 0.001, to be conducted contemporaneously with the primary analysis of rPFS, and a final primary analysis of OS with 489 deaths with a 1-sided alpha of 0.023. However, shortly after commencement of the trial, a high early dropout rate amongst those randomized to BS/BSC-only arm became evident with the majority of these dropouts withdrawing consent to follow-up. This meant that rPFS data could not be collected for these patients which consequently could result in bias in the analysis of rPFS. Remedial measures to curtail this phenomenon were implemented and made effective on March 5th, 2019. As part of the plan to address the early withdrawal of consent in the BS/BSC-only arm, the primary analysis of rPFS was altered to focus on patients prospectively randomized on or after March 5 th, 2019; therefore, rPFS will be analyzed in these patients once 364 events have accrued with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.004. At time of this rPFS primary analysis, there will be an interim analysis of OS with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.001; this OS analysis will be on an ITT basis and will include all randomized patients (i.e., including those randomized before March 5 th, 2019). Following the analysis of rPFS and the interim analysis of OS, a final ITT primary analysis of OS will be performed when 508 deaths have accrued with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.020. To achieve these analyses, the total number of subjects randomized into the trial was increased from N=750 to N=814. The revisions described do not alter the hypothesized treatment effects for rPFS and OS upon which the study was originally powered. 8.2 Revisions to planned analyses Subsequent to the protocol revision, if further changes are made to primary and/or key secondary hypotheses, or the statistical methods related to those hypotheses, then the protocol will be further amended (consistent with ICH Guidelin e E9). Any changes to exploratory or non- confirmatory analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, along with an explanation as to when and why they occurred, will be listed in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). |Any post hoc exploratory analyses will be clearly identified in the CSR.

Planned enrollment for this study is approximately 814 subjects. Under the null hypothesis for survival, median survival is assumed to be 10 months on 177Lu PSMA-617 and best supportive/best standard of care (active) for a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00. Under the alternative hypothesis, median overall survival on active is assumed to be 13.7 months for a HR of 0.7306. Under the null hypothesis for rPFS, median rPFS is assumed to be 4 months on 177Lu-PSMA-617 and best supportive/best standard of care (active) for a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.00. Under the alternative hypothesis, median rPFS on active is assumed to be 6 months for a HR of 0.67. Based on a non-linear patient accrual profile over 14 months, a total of 814 patients randomized and followed on an ITT basis for a minimum of 13 months is expected to yield 508 deaths. This number of events provides at least 90% power to test the hypothesis that the HR for OS is 0.7306 or better with a 1-sided alpha level of at least 0.020. For rPFS, a total of approximately 557/814 patients are expected to be randomized on or after 5 March 2019, these being the patients to be included in the primary analysis of rPFS; with a minimum of approximately 6 months follow-up, these patients are expected to yield 364 rPFS events which will be sufficient to provide 84% power to test the hypothesis that the HR of rPFS is or 0.67 or better with a 1-sided alpha level if 0.004. At the time of this rPFS analysis, 341 deaths are expected amongst all randomized patients. These interim OS data will be analyzed with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.001. Central independent assessments will be used to determine rPFS events. The alpha level applicable to OS in the final analysis will depend upon the earlier rPFS and interim OS results: !if p<0.004 1-sided is achieved for rPFS and p<0.001 1-sided is achieved for interim OS, then the alpha level for the final analysis of OS will be raised to 0.025 1-sided. !if p<0.004 1-sided is achieved for rPFS but p<0.001 1-sided is not achieved for interim OS, then the alpha level for the final analysis of OS will be 0.024 1-sided. !if p<0.004 1-sided is not achieved for rPFS but p<0.001 1-sided is achieved for interim OS, then the alpha level for the final analysis of OS will be raised to 0.021 1-sided. !if p<0.004 1-sided is not achieved for rPFS and p<0.001 1-sided is not achieved for interim OS, then the alpha level for the final analysis of OS will remain at 0.020 1- sided. This design provides at least 90% power for OS and 84% power for rPFS; with an overall Type I error rate ≤0.025 1-sided. The observed HRs that will meet p<0 .004 for rPFS and the interim analysis of OS are 0.745 and 0.701 respectively; and the observed HR that will meet p<0.020 to p<0.025 in the final analysis of OS are 0.824 to 0.823.

OS will be assessed on an ITT basis and related data will be summarized by randomized treatment. !PFS Analysis Set (PFS-FAS) : All patients randomized on or after March 5th, 2019. The primary analysis of rPFS will be based on this dataset on an ITT basis and related data will be summarized by randomized treatment. !Response Evaluable Analysis Set : The subset of patients in the PFS-FAS with evaluable disease by RECIST at baseline. Soft tissu e response as measured by RECIST will be assessed in this dataset. !Safety Analysis Dataset : There will be two safety datasets oThe subset of patients who received as least one dose of 68Ga-PSMA-11. oThe subset of patients in the FAS who received as least one dose of randomized therapy. Patient safety data in this dataset will be summarized by treatment received. 8.5 Demographics and baseline disease characteristics Demographic and baseline disease characterist ic data will be summarized in the FAS and PFS- FAS for each treatment with frequency distributions and/or descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, range, and/or relevant percentiles). Formal statistical tests comparing treatment groups will not be provided. 8.6 Patient disposition All patients who discontinue from the study will be identified, and the extent of their participation in the study will be reported. This will be done for the FAS and the PFS-FAS. If known, a reason for their discontinuation will be given. Reporting of patient disposition will include: !A summary of data on patient discontinuation !A summary of data on overall qualification status of all patients !An account of all significant protocol deviations All patients enrolled in the study will be acc ounted for in the summation.

The primary analysis of rPFS will be based upon the PFS-FAS and will take place once 364 rPFS events have been reached. The allocated alpha level for the rPFS analysis is 0.004 1-sided. Patients who are alive without radiographic progressi on at the analysis data cut-off or are lost to follow-up at the time of analysis will be censored for rPFS at the time of their last radiographic assessment or at the data cut-off date. r PFS data will be displayed using Kaplan Meier curves from which median rPFS times will be estimated for both treatment arms. A stratified log-rank test model will be the primary statist ical methodology used to analyze rPFS in the PFS-FAS dataset, stratified for the randomization stratification factors.Supportive analyses of rPFS will be performed in terms of (i) a stratified Cox regression model on the PFS-FAS dataset with a single covariate for randomized treatment, and stratifying again for the randomization stratification factors; and (ii) the same as (i) but based upon the FAS dataset. The HR and CI from (i) will be used as an adjunct to the primary stratified log rank test p-value to provide the quantif ication of the tr eatment effect on rPFS. 8.7.1.2 OS Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause and will be assessed in the FAS. A formal interim analysis of OS is planned to occur at the time of the rPFS analysis (with 364 rPFS events in PFS-FAS); it is anticipated that approximately 341 deaths will have accrued in the FAS at the time of the rPFS analysis in the PFS-FAS. The allocated alpha level for OS in this interim analysis is 0.001 1-sided. The final analysis of OS is event driven and will take place once 508 deaths have occurred in the FAS. As described in Section 8.3, the allocated alpha level for the final OS analysis will be between 0.020 and 0.025 1-sided, depending on the results of the earlier primary rPFS analysis and interim OS analysis. Patients who are lost to follow-up or are alive at the time of the OS analysis (for both interim and final analyses) will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive or at the date of event cut-off for the OS analysis. OS data will be displayed using Kaplan Meier curves from which median OS will be estimated for both treatment arms. OS will be analyzed using the same statist ical methodology as described for the primary analysis of rPFS. Supportive analyses of OS will be performed at the interim and final in terms of Cox regression model on the FAS dataset with a single covariate for randomized treatment, stratifying for the randomization stratification factors. The HR and CI from these analyses be used as an adjunct to the primary stratified log r ank test p-values to provide the quantif ication of the treatment effect on OS. 8.7.1.3 Statistical Interpretation of Alternate Primary Endpoints The statistical design of the study is such that, to be declared positive, the study would be required to reach statist ical signif icance on either the primary analysis of rPFS orOS at the Printed on: 28 Apr 2021, 04:22:46 pm; Printed by:"

Note, this applies to OS assessed at either the interim or the final analysis, i.e. for the study to be declared statistically positive requires rPFS to meet its allocated alpha level or OS to meet its allocated alpha level at either (i) the formal OS interim analysis (conducted at the time of the rPFS analysis) or(ii) at the final OS analysis with 508 deaths. Alpha allocation and recycling are used to ens ure control of the overall Type I error rate as described in Section 8.3. 8.7.2 Secondary efficacy analyses Key secondary endpoints Key secondary endpoints will be subject to Type I error control. These endpoints are: 1. RECIST ORR and DCR 2. Time to SSE The primary evaluation of these endpoints will be assessed in the PFS-FAS dataset. Time to SSE will be anal yzed using a Cox regression model with a single covariate for randomized treatment, stratifying for the randomization stratification factors. ORR and DCR will be analyzed using logistic regression with a single covariate for randomized treatment and stratification for the randomizatio n stratification factors. The odds ratio (active: control), its 95% confidence interval and associated 2-sided p-value will be presented. The DOR for binary response endpoint ORR will also be summarized and presented using Kaplan-Meier curves. To control the overall Type I error rate, if either alternate primary endpoint is met, then the key secondary endpoints will be assessed using the Hochberg closed test procedure at the alpha level applicable to the successful alternate primary e ndpoint. This procedure is reasonable given the positive correlation between the two key secondary endpoints. Supportive analyses of ORR, DCR and time to SSE will be performed in the FAS dataset using the same methods as described for the primary evaluation of these endpoints. Additional Secondary Endpoints Additional Secondary Endpoints will be assessed at the nominal 5% level, i.e. there will be no alpha control applied. These endpoints will be a ssessed in PFS-FAS with the exception of safety which will be assessed using the Safety analysis sets and are: 1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 177Lu-PSMA-617 2.

Proportion of subjects who are PSA responders, defined as a patient who has achieved a ≥50% decrease from baseline that is confirmed by a second PSA measurement ≥4 weeks. e. Alkaline phosphatase [ALP] and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels will also be collected. Event-free survival endpoints (e.g., PFS, time to pain worsening) will be analyzed using a Cox regression model in the same manner as described for time to SSE except using a 2-sided p- value. DCR will be analyzed in the same manner as ORR and HRQoL will be analyzed in the same manner as pain score over time. Time to pain improvement response after initial pain worsening will be analyzed using mixture distribution methodology akin to that described by Ellis et al 2008. 8.8 Safety analyses All safety evaluations will be based on the Safety Analysis Set. 8.8.1 Extent of exposure The duration of exposure and dose intensity will be calculated. The relationship between dose intensity, duration of exposure, and frequency and severity of adverse events will be explored by data tabulation. 8.8.2 Analysis of adverse events The frequency of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and SAEs w ill be tabu lated by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term and system organ class. The maximum NCI CTCAE grade and frequency of AEs will be summarized. A 68Ga-PSMA-11 TEAE is defined as an AE that was not present prior to dosing with 68Ga-PSMA-11 but appeared following dosing or was present at time of initial dosing but worsened during or after dosing. The treatment-emergent period will be defined as the period from the date of 68Ga-PSMA-11 dosing up to 6 days after the date of68Ga-PSMA-11 dosing as long as prior to the first dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 for the investigational arm and Cycle 1 Day 1 for the best supportive/best standard of care-only arm. Adverse events reported as “possibly”, “probably”, or “definitely” related to 68Ga-PSMA-11 that occur beyond the 6-day re porting window but occur before the initiation of randomized treatment are also 68Ga-PSMA-11 TEAEs. Unrelated 68Ga-PSMA-11 adve rse events that occur beyond 6 days will not be TEAEs. A randomized treatment TEAE is defined as an AE that was not present prior to initiation of randomized treatment, defined as first dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 for the investigational arm and Cycle 1 Day 1 for the BS/BSC arm, but appeared following treatment, or was present at treatment initiation but worsened during treatment. An AE that was present at treatment initiation but resolved and then reappeared while the patient was on treatment is a TEAE (regardless of the intensity of the AE when the treatment wa s initiated). The treatment-emergent period will be defined as the period from the initiation of randomized treatment up to 30 days after the date of the last dose or intervention of randomized treatment or the day prior to the initiation of subsequent anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first.

Abnormal findings from physical examinations will be assessed for clinical significance which will be included in the AE listings and summaries. 8.9 IDMC and Interim Data Evaluation 8.9.1 IDMC An IDMC will be convened to review accumulating safety and safeguard patient interest in the study. Safety data monitoring will be conducted quarterly by the IDMC. These safety reviews will commence following the completion of the first three months of study accrual. In addition, a summary of efficacy data will also be provided to the IDMC at the time of routine safety data reviews; these efficacy data will be provided for information only, no statist ical analyses will be conducted. The only analyses of efficacy data are thos e formally planned for rPFS in the PFS-FAS at 364 events, interim OS (in the FAS) at the time of the rPFS analysis and final OS (in the FAS) with 508 deaths. The IDMC will review these formal efficacy analyses. The IDMC may recommend early curtailment of trial on the basis of meeting one of the preplanned formal efficacy analyses or due to the emergence of an unforeseen safety concern placing patient safety at risk. An IDMC Charter will be approved and finalized by the IDMC members prior to the initiation of any formal efficacy analysis. The IDMC can recommend a course of action, but the sponsor will make the final decision regarding whether or not to continue or stop the trial, based on any analysis for reasons related to safety or efficacy. 8.9.2 Formal Interim Analysis of OS As described above in Section 8.3, one formal interim analysis is planned for OS in the FAS to take place at the time of the primary rPFS analysis in the PFS-FAS. The allocated alpha level for the interim OS analysis is 0.001 1-sided. Regardless of whether a positive result is attained at this time, for either rPFS or interim OS, patient follow-up will continue until 508 OS events have accrued in the FAS at which time a final OS analysis will be performed.

The sponsor’s (or designee’s) audit reports will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law. Th e investigator must notify Endocyte promptly of any inspections scheduled by regulatory authori ties and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to Endocyte. The investigator agrees to promptly take any reasonable steps that are requested by Endocyte as a result of monitoring or auditing activities to address deficiencies in study conduct or documentation. In the event that Endocyte is unable to secure comp liance with the Statement of investigator or study protocol and pre maturely terminates a trial site, Endocyte will notify the FDA (as required by 21 CFR § 312.56) the site’s IRB/IEC/REB, and other regulatory authorities, as required. 12. DATA HANDLING, RECORD KEEPING, AND COMPLIANCE 12.1 Investigational medicinal product accountability At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliat ion of drug shipped, drug consumed, and drug destroyed. 12.2 Breaking the blind Not applicable. 12.3 Data collection forms and source document identification All source data will be retained by the trial site to ensure that, if requested, a monitor, auditor, or regulatory agency has access to the source documents. Source data are the clinical findings and observations, laboratory and test data, and other information contained in source documents. Source documents are the original records (and certified copies of original records) including, but not limited to, hospital medical records, physician or office charts, physician or nursing notes, participant diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, x-rays, biopsy reports, ultrasound reports, pharmacy records, or any other similar reports or records of any procedures performed in accordance with the protocol. Sour ce documentation may also include any sponsor CRF when source data is recorded directly onto a CRF. The health-related quality of life questionnaires will utilize electronic Clinical Outcome Assessments (eCOA) technology for direct entry of the patient’s responses. The eCOA will serve as source data. A CRF will be completed for each participant enrolled into the clinical study. Patients are to be identified by, year of birth, patient screening number and patient enrollment number. Information recorded on the CRF must match the source data recorded on the source documents. The investigator will review, approve, and sign /date completed CRFs. Thei r signature serves as attestation ensuring that all clinical and laboratory data entered on the CRF are complete, accurate, and authentic.

It is based on the PCWG3 recommendations. Please note that not all the recommendations listed below are applicable to this patient population or to the specifics of this study. Variable PCWG3 (2016) PSA ! Recognize that a favorable effect on PSA may be delayed for 12 weeks or more, even for a cytotoxic drug ! Monitor PSA by cycle but plan to continue through early rises for a minimum of 12 weeks unless other evidence of progression ! Ignore early rises (prior to 12 week s) in determining PSA response For control/relieve/eliminate endpoints: ! Describe absolute changes in PSA over time from baseline to best response For delay/prevent endpoints: Decline from baseline: ! Record time from start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥25% and≥2 ng/mL above the nadir, and which is confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later (ie, a confirmed rising trend) No decline from baseline: ! PSA progression ≥25% and ≥2 ng/mL after 12 weeks Soft-tissue lesionsFor control/relieve/eliminate end points: Use Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) with caveats: ! Record up to 5 lesions per site of disease ! Record changes in nodal, lung, liver adrenal an d central nervous system (CNS) sites separately ! Only report changes in lymph nodes that were ≥1.5 cm in diameter in short axis at baseline ! Record changes in pelvic (regional) nodes vs extrapelvic (distant/metastatic) nodes separately ! Only report changes in visceral lesions (liver, lung, adrenal, CNS) that were ≥1.0 cm in the longest dimension ! Record complete elimination of disease at any site separately ! Confirm favorable change with second scan ! Record changes using waterfall plot For delay/prevent end points: ! Record changes in nodal and visceral disease separately ! Record up to 5 lesions per site of spread ! Use RECIST 1.1 criteria for progression, but clearly record type of progression (growth of existing lesions vs development of new lesio ns) separately by site. With additional requirement that progression at first assessment be confirmed by a second scan 6 or more weeks later.(Particularly important when anticipated effect on PSA is delayed or for biologic therapies) ! Previously normal (<1.0 cm) lymph nodes must have grown by ≥5 mm in the short axis from baseline or nadir and be ≥1.0 cm in the short axis to be c onsidered to have progressed. Nodes that have progressed to 1.0 to less than 1.5 cm are pathologic, subject to clinical discretion, and nonmeasurable. For existing pathologic adenopathy ( ≥1.5 cm), progression is defined per RECIST 1.1 Printed on: 28 Apr 2021, 04:22:46 pm; Printed by:"

Version no.: 5.0 26 April 2021 This information is confidential or privileged information and trade ndocyte, Inc.BoneFor control/relieve eliminate end points: ! Record outcome as new lesions, no new lesions or resolved lesion ! First scheduled reassessment: o No new lesions: continue therapy o New lesions: perform a confirmatory scan 6 or more weeks later ! Confirmatory scan: o No new lesions: continue therapy o Additional new lesions: progression ! Subsequent scheduled reassessments: o No new lesions: continue o New lesions: progression ! Changes in intensity or uptake do not constitute regression or progression For prevent/delay end points (progression): ! Exclude pseudoprogression in the absence of symptoms or other signs of progression ! At least two new lesions on first post-treatment scan, with at least two additional lesions on the next scan (2+2 rule) ! If at least two additional new lesions are seen on the next (confirmatory) scan, the date ofprogression is the date of the first post-treatment scan, when the first two new lesions were documented ! For scans after the first post-treatment scan, at least two new lesions relative to the first post-treatment scan confirmed on a subsequent scan ! Date of progression is the date of the scan that first documents the second lesion ! Changes in intensity of uptake alone do not constitute either progression or regression ! Report the proportion of patients who have not progressed at fixed time intervals (6 and 12months) Symptoms Pain palliation assessment requires a patient population with clinically meaningful pain at baseline (eg, ≥4 on a 10-point pain intensity scale) and respons e defined as a clinically meaningful score improvement at a subsequent time point (eg, a 30% relative or 2-point absolute improvement from baseline at 12weeks, confirmed at least 2 weeks later, without an overall increase in opiate use). For control/relieve eliminate end points: ! Serial (eg, daily x 7 days) assessments at each time point can improve the stability of values Principles may be extended for any PRO for which a clinically meaningful baseline PRO score has been determined together with a responder definition that is based on a sustained clinically meaningful score improvement. For delay/prevent end points: Patients with any level of baseline pain, including no pain, are eligible to be evaluated for prevent/delay end points; those without pain are followed for development of pain, whereas those with baseline pain are followed for progression (eg, a 2-point increase without an overall decrease in opiate use). Pain assessment should be administered at treatment discontinuation and once again if feasible (eg, 2 to 4 weeks later). Time to deterioration of physical function and/or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores should also be included, with a priori thresholds defining clinically meaningful deterioration score changes that are based on prior published data for the selected questionnaire.
