SYNOPSIS Name of Sponsor/Company: Ichnos Sciences SA Name of Study Drug : ISB 830 Title of Study: A Randomized, D ouble -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Parallel- Group Study of GBR 830 in Adult Subjects with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis IND no: 126820 EudraCT no: 2018- 000783- 29 Phase of development: 2b Indication: Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis Objectives: Primary: • To characterize the efficacy of ISB 830 monotherapy in adults with moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) compared to placebo as measured by percentage change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI) score at Week 16 . Secondary: • To evaluate safety, tolerability , pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of ISB 830 in adults with moderate -to-severe AD . • To measure the effect of ISB 830 on disease activity in adult subjects with moderate- to-severe AD, as measured by validated tools ( such as Investigator’s Global Ass essment [IGA], EASI response, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis [SCORAD]). Exploratory: • To evaluate pharmacodynamics (PD) of ISB 830 in adults with moderate -to-severe AD . Study population: Adult males and females (≥18 years of age) with moderate -to-severe AD whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment is medically inadvisable (eg, intolerance, other important side effects or safety ris ks in the opinion of the I nvestigator). Moderate- to-severe AD is defined by an IGA score of 3 or higher at screening and baseline, consistent with the categories of moderate (IGA=3) and severe (IGA= 4); and an EASI score of 12 or higher at screening or 16 or higher at baseline."

The study will be conducted in 4 phases: a screening phase, a blinded treatment phase, an open -label treatment phase, and a follow -up phase. Subjects will participate in a 54- week treatment period (including 52 weeks of study drug administration) with 12 weeks follow -up at end of the treatment phase from Week 54 to W eek 66. T he study will be conducted in 2 P arts, with dosing G roups 1 -4 comprising P art 1, and dosing Groups 5- 6 comprising P art 2. The blinded treatment phase consists of a randomized, placebo -controlled treatment with ISB 830 for 16 weeks at different dose levels (see below). The open -label treatment phase consists of a 38 -week treatment phase where ISB 830 will be administered every other week (q2w) subcutaneously (SC). The primary endpoint of the study will be assessed at the end of the blinded treatment period at Week 16. Subject eligibility will be assessed during screening, which will occur within 28 days prior to randomization. During the screening period, treatments for AD will be withdrawn or modified for the subject as defined in the protocol (Table 5). Subjects may be re- screened once ( within or outside of the screening period) if they fail the screening evaluation. All screening procedures will be repeated during rescreening. Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria will undergo Day 1/baseline (predose) assessments and will be randomized to equal groups of approximately 78 subjects each. Subjects will receive SC injections of ISB 830, or corresponding placebo. A total of 2 7 doses ( ISB 830 or placebo) will be administered q2w. During the blinded treatment phase e ach subject will receive a dose on Day 1 and q2w starting from Day 15 through Week 14, according to the following treatment assignment and table below: Study Part 1: • Group 1: D ose of ISB 830 (2 SC injections each containing volume) on Day 1, followed by q2w dos ing of ISB 830 (1 SC injection containing volume), starting at D ay 15 (Week 2) . • Group 2: D ose of ISB 830 (2 SC injections each containing volume) on Day 1, followed by dosing every 4 week s (q4w) of ISB 830 (1 SC injection containing volume) starting at D ay 29. In order to maintain blinding, placebo (1 SC injection of ) will b e administered q4w starting at D ay 15 (Week 2) . • Group 3: D ose of ISB 830 (2 SC injections each containing volume) on Day 1, followed by q4w dos ing of 75 mg ISB 830 (1 SC injection containing volume) sta rting at Day 29. In order to maintain blinding, placebo (1 SC injection of will be administered q4w starting at D ay 15 (Week 2) . • Group 4: D ose of placebo (2 SC injections of volume) on Day 1, followed by q2w dosing with placebo (1 SC injection of ) starting at D ay 15 (Week 2) . Study Part 2: • Group 5: ISB 830 (4 SC injections each containing volume) on Day 1, followed by q2w dosing of ISB 830 (2 SC injections containing volume), starting at Day 15 (Week 2). • Group 6: D ose of placebo (4 SC injections of volume) on Day 1, followed by q2w dosing with placebo (2 SC injections of starting at Day 15 (Week 2). During the blinded treatment phase all subjects in Groups 1 through 4 will r eceive a loading dose consisting of 2 SC injections, followed by 7 maintenance doses consisting of 1 SC injection per dose. For Groups 5 and 6, all subjects will receive a loading dose consisting of 4 SC injections, followed by 7 maintenance doses consist ing of 2 SC injection s per dose, as described above and in protocol Section 10.1, Table 6. During the open- label treatment phase each subject will receive 19 doses of ISB 830 SC injection ) q2w (consisting of 1 to 2 SC injection s per dose, respectively) from Wee k 16 to Week 52 or until subject withdrawal, as described above and in protocol Section 10.1, Table 6.

An e xperimental population PK design will be used for the PK blood sampling. The subjects in the rich PK group will have additional blood sampling between Days 1 to 8 (Week 1) , and Days 85 to 92 (Week 12) compared to the sparse PK group . The subjects in the sparse PK group will have widespread sampling with fewer time points for each subject (compared to the rich PK group) . Approximately 80 rich PK subjects will be randomized ( in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to treatment groups 1-4 and approximately 40 rich PK subjects will be randomized (in a 1:1 ratio) to treatment groups 5 and 6. T he remaining subjects in the study will be included in the sparse PK group . Blood samples will be collected from the rich and sparse PK subjects according to the respective schedule described in Table 8 of the protocol. End-of-treatment (EOT) visits will be conducted on Day 113 (Week 16) for the blinded treatment phase and at Day 379 ( Week 54 ) for the open- label treatment phase for all subjects. Subjects should continue into the follow - up period and will have a follow -up phone call 4 and 8 weeks after the last EOT visit [ Day 407 ( Week 58 ) and Day 435 ( Week 62 ) respectively ] and a final clinic visit 12 weeks after the EOT [ Day 463 ( Week 66 )] visit. Subjects who withdraw consent from the blinded treatment phase prior to Week 16 will undergo the blinded treatment phase EOT visit procedures and enter the follow -up period . Subjects who withdraw consent from open- label treatment phase prior to Week 52 will undergo the open -label treatment phase EOT visit procedures and enter the follow -up period. All s ubjects continuing in the follow -up period will have a follow -up phone call 4 and 8 weeks after the last EOT visit and a final clinic visit 12 weeks after the EOT visit as described in the Table 3 follow -up period. Subjects will be clinically monitored for safety throughout the study , including anaphylactic reactions and/or injection site reactions (ISRs), with monitoring at the study site for 2 hours after the first dose on Day 1 (in the blinded treatment phase) and on Day 113 ( Week 16 ) (first dose in open -label treatment phase) and for 1 hour after dosing at all other visits.

Dosage for open- label treatment phase: Not applicable . Mode of Administration: SC injection Criteria for evaluation: Efficacy Assessments : • The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical studies to assess the severity and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics will be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head/neck, trunk (including genital area), upper limbs, and lower limbs (including buttocks), and converted to a score of 0 to 6 (Hanifin et al, 2001). • The I GA is an assessment scale used in clinical studies to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment based on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). • The SCORAD is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and intensity of AD. The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD calculation). The intensity of 6 specific symptoms of AD is assessed using the following scale: absenc e (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3), (for a maximum of 18 total points, assigned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calculation) . Subjective assessment of pruritus and sleep -loss is recorded for each symptom by the subject or relative on a visual analogue scale (VAS), where 0 is no pruritus (or sleep -loss) and 10 is the worst imaginable pruritus (or sleep -loss), with a maximum possible score of 20. This parameter is assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculation. The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C (Kunz et al, 1997 ). • Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS): Subjects will respond to the following question, “On a scale of 0 – 10, with 0 being no itch and 10 being the worst itch imaginable, how would you rate your worst degree of itch during the previous 24 hours?” The Pruritus NRS will be assessed b y the subject once per day in the morning, ideally at the same time; recorded by the subject after each assessment , and reviewed by study staff at each clinic visit. • DLQI : The DLQI is a subject -administered, 10 -question, validated, quality -of-life questi onnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work, and school and personal relationships and treatment. Response categories include “ a little ,” “a lot,” and “very much” with corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3 , respectively ; “not at all,” “not relevant” responses"

The HADS consists of 14 items, 7 each for anxiety and depression symptoms; possible scores range from 0 to 21 for each subscale. The following cut -off scores are recommended for both subscales: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression. • POEM: The POEM is a 7 -item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease s ymptoms in children and adults ( Charman et al, 2004 ). The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease -related morbidity . • EQ-5D: The EQ -5D is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQOL Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ - 5D consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQVAS). The EQ - 5D descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: m obility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels of perceived problems: “no problem” (level 1), “some problems” (level 2), “extreme problems” (level 3). • ACQ -5: The ACQ -5 is a 5- question version of the Juniper ACQ and is a validated questionnaire to evaluate asthma control. The questionnaire will be administered only to the subset of subjects with a medical history of asthma. • SNOT -22: The SNOT -22 is a validated questionnaire to assess the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis on quality of life . The questionnaire will be administered only to a subset of subjects (eg, with chronic rhinitis/ rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, allergic rhinitis) . • Patient Global Assessment of Disease: Subjects will rate their overall well -being based on a 5 -point Likert scale from poor to excellent. Subjects will be asked: “Considering all the ways in which your eczema affects you, indicate how well you are doing.” Response choices are: “Poor”; “Fair”; “Good”; “Very Good”; “Excellent.” • Patient Global Assessment of Treatment: Subjects will rate their satisfaction with the study treatment based on a 5 -point Likert scale from poor to excellent. Subjects will b e asked: “How would you rate the way your eczema responded to the study medication?” Response choices are: “Poor”; “Fair”; “Good”; “Very Good”; “Excellent .” • Assessment of Sick Leave and/or Missed School Days: Subjects who are employed or enrolled in schoo l will be asked to report the number of sick leave and/or missed school days due to atopic dermatitis (eg, vs due to an accident) in the last 4 weeks. Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Blood samples will be collected from both rich and sparse PK groups at appropriate time points defined in Table s 2 and 3, and Table 8 in the protocol. The serum concentrations of ISB 830 in these samples will be quantified using a validated enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method . Serum concentration data from bot h rich PK and sparse PK group from the blinded treatment phase will be used to derive PK parameters, as appropriate."
14,page_14,"Version 10.0 Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Date: 05-May-2020 Ichnos Sciences CONFIDENTIAL Page 14 of 103 Immunogenicity Assessments: Blood samples will be collected at appropriate time points defined in Table s 2 and 3, and Table 8 in the p rotocol to detect the presence of anti -drug antibodies ( ADA) to ISB 830, as per procedures similar to collection of PK samples . The presence or absence of ADA in these samples will be determined using a validated Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method. Pharmacodynamic ( Biomarker ) Assessments: Blood samples, including plasma, serum, whole blood, viably frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (vfPBMCs) and/or cell subsets will be collected from subjects randomized in the study at appropriate time points as defined in Table 2 and Table 8 in the protocol. Biomarker assessments to be performed on collected samples may include but not limited to : • Leukocyte sub-population cell counts by flow cytometry • Cytokines • Biomarker in peripheral blood • Total immunoglobulin E ( IgE) • Serum soluble OX40 l igand (OX40L) and serum soluble OX40 • Epigenetics Exploratory Photographs: Subjects, who agree to participate in the main study, also agree to allow photography of their skin (excluding pictures of the subject’s face) during study participation at specified time points as per Table 2 and Table 3. Photographs of the subject’s skin (with the exception of the face) may also be taken at additional time points, as per in vestigator judgment. The photographs may be used to examine disease activity, autoimmunity/inflammation, ISB 830 mechanism of action, and/or the effect of the study drug(s) on the course of disease. Details of photograph collection, processing, shipping and storage will be provided to the study sites in a separate manual. Optional Genetic Research/Pharmacogenomics Assessments: Subjects who provide written consent for Optional Genetic Research agree to provide a blood sample (one sample may be collected at any visit during the study) to evaluate genetic sequences that may be involved in disease activity, inflammation, study drug mechanism of action, PK/metabolism, and/or the effect of the study drug(s) on the course of disease. Subjects may decline this op tional research without effect on their participation in the main study. Safety Assessments : Safety and tolerability of ISB 830 will be assessed based on adverse events (AEs) , including anaphylactic events and ISRs; SAEs ; vital signs; physical examinations; ECGs; and clinical laboratory parameters. Subjects will be clinically monitored for safety throughout the study, including anaphylactic reactions and/or ISRs, with special monitoring at the study site for 2 hours after the first dose on Day 1 (in the blinded treatment phase) and on Day 113 (Week 16) (first dose in open -label treatment phase) and for 1 hour after dosing at all other visits. Guidance will be given to the investigator for the criteria to be used to assess anaphylaxis (Sampson et al, 2006) . Injection site reactions will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 that was published 14- Jun-2010 by the US Department of Health and Human Services (National Institute s of Health [NIH] and National Cancer Institute [NCI]). Pandemic Related Safety Assessments: To ensure the ongoing safety of subjects during the p andemic, study subjects who miss or are unable to attend scheduled clinic visits will be contacted by the site via a safety phone call that includes the collection of AEs/SAEs and concomitant medications. This phone call is to be performed for every missed visit that occurs during the pandemic. If the subject meets other criteria, eg, for withdrawal /discontinuation of the study drug, the site is to follow the protocol in regard to those criteria."

The model will adjust for study treatment, baseline, randomization stratification factors, visit as well as baseline- by-visit and treatment -by-visit interaction s. The continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the MMRM model as performed for the primary endpoint. The Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by randomization strata (region, disease severity) will be used to analyze the categorical secondary endpoints. For Part 2 of the study , Group 5 will be compared to the corresponding placebo arm (Group 6) using the same statistical method used in the analysis of the first part of the study. To assess the robustness of the results in the Part 2 of the study, the analyses on p rimary endpoint and secondary endpoints (IGA, EASI -75) will also be conducted excluding subjects who withdraw from the study or miss 2 or more consecutive doses prior to Week 16 or miss any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16 due to the pan demic. Parts 1 and 2 are two independent parts of the study protocol and will th erefore be analyzed separately. That is, upon completion of the double -blind period of Part 1, the database will be partially locked . The data will be analyzed and the t oplin e results (TLR) determined . Similar activities will take place upon the completion of the double -blind period of Part 2. The efficacy results from these 2 parts of the study will be kept separate. H owever, the safety results will be presented side by sid e. Details of efficacy, safety and PK analyses will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and included in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). Population pharmacokinetic and exposure -response modeling will be described in a Modeling Plan and data will be published in a separate report. Biomarker analyses will not be part of the CSR and will be described separately. Study Populations: Full Analysis Set: The Full Analysis Set ( FAS) consists of all subjects who are randomized and received at least 1 dose of study medication. Based on the intent -to-treat principle, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment group assigned . Per Protocol Set: The Per Protocol Set ( PPS) consists of all FAS subjects who have no major protocol deviations of eligibility or on-treatment study conduct. Safety Analysis Set : The Safety Analysis Set ( SAS) consists of all subjects who were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study medication. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set: The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set ( PKAS ) consists of the subset of the SA S population who received ISB 830 and for whom sufficient serum concentration data are available to facilitate derivation of PK parameters, do not have any major protocol deviation , and for whom the time of dosing and the time of sampling are known. Additional subjects may be excluded from the PKAS at the discretion of the pharmacokineticis t. Any formal definitions for exclusion of subjects or time points from the PKAS will be documented in the SAP."
16,page_16,"Version 10.0 Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Date: 05-May-2020 Ichnos Sciences CONFIDENTIAL Page 16 of 103 Determination of Sample Size: Efficacy Analyses: The primary efficacy analysis will be the percentage change from baseline in EASI score, and the secondary efficacy analysis will be the IGA and EASI 75 (subjects achieving 75% reduction from baseline in EASI score) . The IGA is an assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD globally, based on a 5 - point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The EASI and IGA scores will be assessed at time points described in the Schedule of Assessments. To test the robustness of the MMRM for the primary endpoint, sensitivity analyses using the tipping point approach will be conducted . In addition, the primary endpoint will be analyzed using the complete dataset (subjects who complete the week 16 and had EASI measurements). Detailed statistical methods, including methods for the multiplicity adjustment, the handling of missing data for the analysis of the primary as well as secondary and exploratory endpoints and the exploratory anal yses on biomarkers will be described in the SAP and the Biomarker Analyses Plan. Pharmacokinetic Analyses: The PKAS will be used for the PK analyses. Pharmacokinetic parameters ( Cmax, tmax, AUC 0-tau, AUC 0-t, and other related parameters) will be estimated using data from the rich PK group from the blinded treatment phase. Estimates of C trough will be derived using the data from both rich PK group and sparse PK group from the blinded treatment phase. The PK parameters will be summarized in tabular and graphic form. Details of the PK analysis will be specified in the SAP. The serum concentration data from both rich and sparse PK group may be used for the population PK analysis and will be reported separately . Immunogenicity Analyses: The number and percent incidence of positive and negative ADA status of subjects by treatment, and time points will be provided. Titers and neutralizing potential of confirmed positive samples will be reported. Details will be provided in the SAP. Pharmacodynamic ( Biomarker ) Analyses: Summary statistics will be provided for PD biomarkers. Biomarker analyses will not be part of the CSR and will be described separately. Safety Analyses: Adverse events will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term. Subjects will be counted only once for each preferred term, system organ class, and by the highest severity of an event. Laboratory evaluations will be summarized with descriptiv e statistics at each visit, and change from baseline summarized for each post - baseline visit. Laboratory measurements will also be summarized based on the number and percentage of subjects above or below a pre -specified threshold for each test. AEs will be coded using MedDRA . Details will be presented in the GBR 830- 204 SAP."

The DSM B will be constituted prior to the randomization of the first subject . The DSMB will monitor subject safety by formally reviewing accumulated safety data by treatment group three times during the study . This includes but does not limit the role of the D SMB to evaluate these data and to provide recommendations to the sponsor to continue or modify the follow -up phase of the study as outlined in the DSM B charter. It is expected that the D SMB will consist at a minimum of 2 physicians with appropriate disease area qualifications and 1 statistician. There will be a meeting with t he DSMB describing their roles and responsibilities and discussing potential data format and process issues prior to the finalization of D SMB charter. Interim analyses: No interim analyses are planned."

Secondary O bjectives • To evaluate safety, tolerability, PK and immunogenicity of ISB 830 in adults with moderate- to-severe AD . • To measure the effect of ISB 830 on disease activity in adult subjects with moderate- to-severe AD, as measured by validated tools (such as IGA, EASI response, SCORAD). 6.3. Exploratory Objective To evaluate pharmacodynamics (PD) of ISB 830 in adults with moderate -to-severe AD . 7. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN 7.1. Overall Study Design This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study will be conducted in 4 phases: a screening phase, a blinded treatment phase, an open- label treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. S ubjects will participate in a 54- week treatment period (including 52 weeks of"

The study will be conducted in 2 Parts, with dosing Groups 1-4 comprising Part 1, and dosing Groups 5-6 comprising Part 2. The blinded treatment phase consists of a randomized, placebo controlled treatment with ISB 830 for 16 weeks at different dose levels (see below). The open- label treatment phase consists of a 38- week treatment phase where ISB 830 will be administered every other week (q2w) subcutaneously (SC). The primary endpoint of the study is assessed at the end of the blinded treatment period at Week 16. Subject eligibility will be assessed during screening, which will occur within 28 days prior to randomization. During the screening period, treatments for AD will be withdrawn or modified for the subject as defined in Table 5. Subjects may be re-screened once (within or outside of the screening period) if they fail the screening evaluation. All screening procedures will be repeated during rescreening. Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria will undergo Day 1/baseline (predose) assessments and will be randomized to equal groups of approximately 78 subjects each. Subjects will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of ISB 830, or corresponding placebo. A total of 27 doses ( ISB 830 or placebo) will be administered q2w. During the blinded treatment phase each subject will receive a dose on Day 1 and q2w starting from Day 15 through Week 14, according to the following treatment assignment below: Study Part 1: • Group 1: Dose of ISB 830 (2 SC injections each containing volume) on Day 1, followed by q2w dos ing of ISB 830 (1 SC injection containing volume), starting at Day 15 (Week 2). • Group 2: Dose of ISB 830 (2 SC injections each containing volume) on Day 1, followed by dosing every 4 weeks (q4w) of ISB 830 (1 SC injection containing volume) starting at Day 29. In order to maintain blinding, placebo (1 SC injection of ) will be administered q4w starting at Day 15 (Week 2). • Group 3: Dose of ISB 830 (2 SC injections each containing volume) on Day 1, followed by q4w dos ing of ISB 830 (1 SC injection containing volume) starting at Day 29. In order to maintain blinding, placebo (1 SC injection of ) will be administered q4w starting at Day 15 (Week 2). • Group 4: Dose of placebo (2 SC injections of volume) on Day 1, followed by q2w dosing with placebo (1 SC injection of ) starting at Day 15 (Week 2). Study Part 2: • Group 5: Dose of ISB 830 (4 SC injections each contai ning volume) on Day 1, followed by q2w dosing of ISB 830 (2 SC injections containing volume), starting at Day 15 (Week 2)."

During the blinded treatment phase all subjects in Groups 1 through 4 will receive a loading dose consisting of 2 SC injections, followed by 7 maintenance doses consisting of 1 SC injection per dose. For Groups 5 and 6, all subjects will receive a loading dose consisting of 4 SC injections, followed by 7 maintenance doses consisting of 2 SC injection per dose, as described above and in Section 10.1, Table 6. During the open- label treatment phase each subject will receive a dose of ISB 830 SC injection ) q2w (consisting of 1 to 2 SC injection per dose , respectively ) from Week 16 to Week 52 or until subject withdrawal, as described above and in Section 10.1, Table 6. All subjects in Groups 1-4 in the open- label treatment phase will receive q2w. All subjects in Groups 5-6 in the open- label treatment phase will receive q2w. Safety assessments, clinical laboratory assessments, vital sign assessments, PK sampling, immunogenicity sampling, and clinical efficacy assessments (IGA and EASI) will be performed by the blinded Investigator and blinded study staff as defined in Table 2 of the protocol (Schedule of Assessments), or until the subject discontinues from the study. Study assessments will be performed at baseline (Day 1) and every week until Week 16. An e xperimental population PK design will be used for the PK blood sampling. The subjects in the rich PK group will have additional blood sampling between Days 1 to 8 (Week 1), and Days 85 to 92 (Week 12), compared to the sparse PK group. The subjects in the sparse PK group will have widespread sampling with fewer time points for each subject, compared to the rich PK subjects. Approximately 80 rich PK subjects will be randomized ( in a 1:1:1:1 ratio ) for Groups 1-4, and approximately 40 rich PK subjects will be randomized (in a 1:1 ratio) to Groups 5 and 6. The remaining subjects in the study will be included in the sparse PK group. Blood samples will be collected from the rich and sparse PK subjects according to the respective schedule described in Table 8 of the protocol. End-of-treatment visits will be conducted on Day 113 (Week 16) for the blinded treatment phase and at Day 379 (Week 54) for the open- label treatment phase for all subjects. After the EOT visit, subjects should continue into the follow-up period and will have a follow -up phone call 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the EOT visit and a final clinic visit 12 weeks after the EOT visit. Subjects who withdraw consent from the blinded treatment phase prior to Week 16 and are not continuing with treatment and/or entering the open -label treatment phase of the study will undergo the blinded treatment phase EOT visit procedures and enter the follow-up period for the GBR 830-204 study. Subjects who withdraw consent from open- label treatment phase prior to Week 52 wi ll undergo the open- label treatment phase EOT visit procedures and enter the follow -up period for the GBR 830-204 study. All s ubjects continuing in the follow-up period will have a follow-up phone call 4 and 8 weeks after the EOT visit and a final clinic visit 12 weeks after the EOT visit as described in the Table 3 follow-up period. Subjects will be clinically monitored for safety throughout the study , including anaphylactic reactions and/or injection site reactions (ISRs) , with monitoring at the study site for 2 hours after"

This duration will consist of the screening period of up to 4 weeks, the blinded treatment period of up to 16 weeks (14 weeks of treatment, with a loading dose on Day 1 followed by maintenance dosing from Day 15 [Week 2] until the last dose at Week 14), the open- label treatment period of up to 38 weeks, and the follow-up period of 12 weeks starting at the end of the open- label treatment period. Subjects who consent to participate in the open- label treatment phase of the study after they completed the GBR 830-204 study , and require a modified screening visit would have a study participation duration of up to 86 weeks. 7.1.4. Number of Subjects (Planned) For Groups 1 through 4, a sufficient number of subjects will be screened to randomize 312 eligible subjects in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. For Group 5 and 6, a sufficient number of subjects will be"

T he randomization will be stratified by disease severity (moderate or severe, as assessed by IGA) , geographic region (North America vs European Union), and subjects consenting to rich PK sampling (Yes/No). The actual number of subjects randomized in Groups 5 and 6 may be different than initially planned due to the impact of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID -19 pandemic (see Section 8.3.4). 7.2. Treatment Assignment Study participation begins (ie, the subject is enrolled in the study) once written informed consent is obtained (see Section 18.3 for details). Once informed consent is obtained at Screening , the subject will be assigned a subject screening number using the interactive voice response system /interactive web response sys tem (IVRS/IWRS), and the screening evaluations may begin to assess study eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria. The subject screening number will be used to identify the subject during the screening process. A subject who fails screening (ie, do es not meet eligibility criteria) will be given a new screening number if he/she is re- screened for the study . The subject’s original screening number will not be re-assigned to another subject. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized on Day 1 using the IVRS/IWRS system and allocated a randomization number prior to receiving the first dose of study drug. Randomized s ubjects will be stratified by the IVRS/IWRS based on disease severity, geographic region , and subjects consenting to rich PK sampling (Yes/No) to ensure balance of treatment groups within each stratum. For the open -label treatment phase, the first dose will be administered 2 weeks after the last dose in the blinded treatment phase to maintain the dosing regimen. Subjects in Groups 1-4 will receive and subjects in Groups 5- 6 will receive SC doses of ISB 830 q2w until study completion, discontinuation or withdrawal. Randomized subjects who terminate their study participation for any reason, regardless of whether study drug has been taken or not, will retain their randomization number. To allow subjects access to the open -label treatment phase of the study, subjects who have completed the GBR 830-204 study prior to implementation of the open-label protocol amendment or who are in the follow- up phase of the study at the time of implementation of the open- label protocol amendment, may be eligible to participate in the open -label treatment phase of this study. These subjects will be assigned a new screening number. Subjects who have completed the study prior to implementation of the open- label protocol amendment must undergo a modified Screening visit (as per Table 2 ), and if eligibility criteria are met (with the exception of inclusion criteria 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and exclusion criteri a 1 and 5), will undergo study assessments as per Table 3. This includes a complete washout of any concomitant medications and therapies received (as per Table 5 ) prior to starting the open- label treatment phase of the study. Subjects who are in the follow-up period of GBR 830- 204 at the time the open -label protocol amendment is implemented, must complete their follow -up period and then must unde rgo a modified Screening visit (as per Table 2), and if eligibility criteria are met (with the exception of"

This includes a complete washout of any concomitant medications and therapies received (as per Table 5) prior to starting the open- label treatment phase of the study. 7.3. Dose Adjustment Criteria No dose modifications for a subject are allowed in the blinded treatment phase. See Section 8.3.1 for criteria regarding temporary discontinuation of study drug. 7.4. Criteria for Study Termination The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for medical reasons or any other reason at any time. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor will promptly inform the Investigators/Institutions and regulatory authorities of the termination or suspension and the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. The Institutional Review Board (IRB)/independent Ethics Committee (IEC) will also be informed promptly and provided the reason(s) for the termination or suspension by the Sponsor or by the Investigator/Institution, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). The Investigator reserves the right to discontinue his/her participation in the study should his/her judgment so dictate. If the Investigator terminates or suspends his/her participation in the study without prior agreement of the Sponsor, the Investigator should inform the Institution where applicable, and the Investigator/Institution should promptly inform the Sponsor and the IRB/IEC and provide the Sponsor and the IRB/IEC with a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension. Study records must be retained as noted above. 7.5. End of the Study The end of the study (study completion) is defined as the date of the last protocol- specified visit/assessment (including telephone contact) for the last subject in the study. Materials or supplies provided by the Sponsor may be returned to the Sponsor or designee upon study completion, as directed by the site monitor. The Investigator will notify the IRB/IEC when the study has been completed. 8. SELECTION AND WITHDR AWAL OF SUBJECTS 8.1. Subject Inclusion Criteria 1.

Administration of ISB 830 may be resumed after the appropriate washout period, ( as per Table 5) following discussion, and upon obtaining written approval from the Sponsor’s medical monitor. 2. Subjects must be temporarily discontinued from study drug dosing in the event of: • Grade 3 neutrophil count (<1000- 500/μL, per the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI) -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 ( CTCAE v4.03, 2010). • Grade 2 platelet count ( <7.5 – 5.0 X 104/μL, per NIH/NCI -CTCAE). • Fever (>100.4°F or >38°C), suspected infection, or infection requiring oral antibiotics. If temporarily discontinued from study drug dosing, a subject may resume dosing when the abnormal values are within normal reference ranges. The decision to discontinue dosing a subject due to an AE will be made on the basis of clinical severity and relatedness to the study drug. It is recommended that the Investigator consult with the Sponsor’s medical monitor before removing the subject from the study. 8.3.2. Lost to F ollow- up A subject will be considered lost- to-follow-up only if no contact has been established by the time the study is completed such that there is insufficient information to determine the subject’s status . Subjects refusing to return to the site or to continue participation in the study when contacted , should be documented as “withdrawal of consent” rather than “lost to follow-up.” Investigators should document attempts to re- establish contact with missing subjects throughout the study period. If contact with a missing subject is re -established, the subject should not be considered lost- to-follow-up and any evaluations should resume according to the protocol (ie, the subject should continue to the next scheduled visit relative to their Day 1 visit). 8.3.3. Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug A subject w ho is permanently discontinued from further receipt of study drug, regardless of the reason (withdrawal of consent, due to an AE, other reason ), will be identified as having permanently discontinued treatment. A subject who is permanently discontinued from receiving study drug during the blinded or open- label treatment phases will be asked to complete all procedures scheduled for the EOT visits (Week 16, or Week 54, respectively ). A subject who is withdrawn from study drug treatment should continue to the follow-up period, unless the subject withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up, or is enrolled in another clinical study. 8.3.4. Enrollment of Additional Subjects Special considerations have been added to the protocol based on the issues arising from the SARS -CoV- 2/COVID -19 pandemic.

For each of these cases, a new subject may be screened and randomized, to allow an evaluable number of subjects for the Week 16 primary endpoint. T he new subjects in screening will receive new subject numbers and new treatment assignment s as per the current randomization schedule in the protocol. Additional subjects will only be added in response to the number of subjects who meet the above criteria, as a result of pandemic- related issues . Randomized subjects who discontinue study participatio n or miss consecutive doses or the Week 16 primary endpoint assessments for non- pandemic related reasons, or who have study drug or study visit issues after completing their Week 16 visit, will not trigger the screening of additional subjects . 9.

Other concomitant medications that the subject receives on a regular basis may continue, if in the opinion of the Investigator, it does not put the subject at undue risk or does not interfere with the study evaluations. All subjects who require rescue therapy are considered as treatment failures. Subjects who receive topical medication as rescue treatment will continue study treatment. Subjects who receive rescue treatment with systemic corticosteroids or non -steroidal systemic immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, etc.) or biologics ( eg, dupilumab) will be immediately discontinued from study drug treatment and will continue with all other study assessments as per Table 2. A dministration of ISB 830 may be resumed after the appropriate washout period (4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) and following discussion and upon obtaining written approval from the Sponsor’s medical monitor. 9.2.3. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Therapies All the medications and therapies listed ab ove in Table 5 are prohibited for the entire duration of the study beginning from the time indicated before the baseline visit (Day 1) , unless they are required, in the opinion of the Investigator, for the treatment of an AE.

After treatment with these medications is completed, treatment with study drug may be re-instituted after a washout period and deemed appropriate after discussion with the medical monitor and Sponsor, however study drug may not be re- instituted earlier than 5 times the half -life of the medication. Please refer to the st udy reference manual for more details regarding minimum washout periods. 9.2.4. Lifestyle and/or Dietary Restrictions Subjects will be requested to adhere to the following restrictions: • Subject must be willing to use a highly effective form of contraception, as described in Section 8.1. • Abstain from regular use (>2 visits/week) of a tanning booth/parlor within 4 weeks prior to baseline and during the study, through Week 66. • Topical steroids will be prohibited during the study through Week 66. • Emollients may be used during the study. Subjects may continue use of these emollients during the study if using stable doses of such emollients, and if treatment was initiated before the screening visit. However, emollients containing additives listed in Exclusion criterion 5 ( eg ceramide, hyaluronic acid, urea, or filaggrin degradation products) may not be initiated during the screening period or at any time during the study. Antihistamines may be used during the study, including use in the follow-up period. 9.3. Treatment Compliance Treatment compliance will be measured by the designated person (see Section 10.5) at the clinical study site . Records of drug administration and drug accountability must be maintained to document compliance of treatment administration for each subject and will be review ed by the unblinded clinical monitor. 9.4. Randomization and Blinding See Section 7.2 regarding randomization and allocation to treatment groups. 9.4.1. Blinding and Unblinding Procedures This is a double-blind study in which ISB 830 and placebo are not indistinguishable in appearance and viscosity. Fo r the blinded treatment phase, neither the subject/legal representative nor any of the Investigator or Sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received . Since ISB 830 and placebo are not indistinguishable, the study drug will be handled/prepared by a designated unblinded study drug administrator (eg, unblinded pharmacist or designee) at the site and will be administered by a designated unblinded study team member who will not be involved in the management of study subjects . An unblinded clinical monitor (Clinical Research Associate [CRA] ) will perform study drug accountability."
57,page_57,"Version 10.0 Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Date: 05-May-2020 Ichnos Sciences CONFIDENTIAL Page 57 of 103 To enable the bioanalysis of ISB 830 in serum samples only from the active treatment groups, the randomization codes will be shared with a designated person at the bioanalytical site. It will be ensured that this will not unblind the subject, investigators or sponsor staff involved in the study. For the blinded treatment phase, i n the event that the treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the Investigator or other study staff involved in the management of study subjects, or needs to be known to treat an individual subject for an AE, the medical m onitor must be notified immediately by the Investigator and if possible, before unblinding. For the open -label treatment phase, drug preparation and administration should be handled by the same unblinded personnel as for the blinded treatment phase. In special circumstances (eg, during SARS -CoV- 2/COVID -19 pandemic, which may prevent the subject from presenting to the site), the handling, preparation, and administration of the study drug (during blinded or open-label periods of the study) may be performed by an unblinded, qualified health care provider who is not involved in study management, such as a home- visit nurse contracted by the Sponsor (if such service is available at the time and where permitted by local regulations) (see Section 10.5). 9.4.2. Unblinding in the Event of a Medical Emergency In the event of a medical emergency during the blinded treatment phase, the Investigator may unblind an individual subject’s study drug allocation. In such emergencies, the investigator may contact the Sponsor’s medical monitor for drug specific input prior to disclosure of the treatment allocation. However, the Investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment. Instructions for unblinding an individual subject’s study drug allocation are contained in the IVRS/IWRS manual. In general, unblinding should only occur if management of the medical emergency would be different based on the subject having received IP. In the majority of cases, the management of a medical emergency would be the same whether or not IP was r eceived by the subject . If this was the case, the study drug allocation should not be unblinded. In the event of unblinding, the following minimum information will be recorded in a memo to file and signed by the Investigator. The information will be repo rted in the CSR. - Date of unblinding. - Identification of person(s) requesting the unblinding. - Reason for unblinding. If the breaking of the blind was due to an AE, the subject should be followed up until the AE has resolved or stabilized. Unblinding is not applicable for the open- label treatment phase of the study. 9.5. Subject Completion An individual subject will be considered to have completed the study if the subject completed the End of Study visit, with a minimum of 1 dose of study drug received."

Study Drug Packaging and Labeling The final container used for dosing of ISB 830 will be labeled in full regulatory compliance according to the participating country. The label text is translated into the local language . Details on packaging will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 10.3. Study Drug Storage 10.4. Study Drug Preparation Appropriate aseptic technique should be used while preparing and administering the injection. The designated , trained, unblinded pharmacist (or designee) will prepare and dispense study drug for each subject according to the subject’s IWRS/IVRS assignment. In special circumstances , (eg, during SARS -CoV- 2/COVID -19 pandemic, which may prevent the subject from presenting to the site) , an unblinded, qualified healthcare provider may prepare study drug for injection (see Section 10.5). Detailed instructions will be provided in the pharmacy manual. 10.5. Administration The day of administration of the first dose of study drug ( ISB 830 or placebo) is considered Day 1. Appropriate aseptic technique should be used while preparing and administering injections. Designated, trained, unblinded personnel (pharmacist or designee) will administer prepared study drug (see Section 10.4) to maintain the blind. The monitoring following dosing will be conducted by blinded study personnel. In special circumstances, (eg, during SARS -CoV- 2/COVID -19 pandemic, which may prevent the subject from presenting to the site), subjects may receive ‘at home’ dosing, performed by an unblinded, qualified healthcare provider (if such service is available at the time and where permitted by local regulations) who w ill perform vital sign measurements (ie, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [mmHg], pulse rate [beats per minute], respiratory rate [per minute] and oral or tympanic temperature [degrees in Celsius]) by standard methods prior to dosing, and who"

Women of childbearing potential will also be administered a monthly urine pregnancy test by the unblinded, qualified healthcare provider, and must have a negative pregnancy result prior to dosing. Additional details will be provided in the pharmacy manual and in a separate home healthcare provider manual. Subcutaneous injection sites should be alternated among the different quadrants of the abdomen (avoiding navel and waist areas), upper thighs, and upper arms, so that the same site is not injected for 2 consecutive dosing visits for doses requiring only a single injection. For doses involving more than a single injection, if it is not possible to alternate quadrants, a different site within the same quadrant may be used as long as areas of erythema and induration are avoided (injection sites should be at least 2 -3 cm apart for consecutive dosing visits). To allow for adequate assessment of possible ISRs, study drug should be administered only into areas of normal-looking skin. As with any antibody/medication, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. Therefore, appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. 10.6. Study Drug Accountability The designated unblinded pharmacist (or designee) is responsible for study drug ( ISB 830 or placebo) accountability at the clinical site and its documentation. Preparation, dispensing and recording of study drug is to done only by authorized unblinded personnel. A designated unblinded clinical study monitor will perform drug accountability at the site. The study drug records must be readily available for inspection by the unblinded clinical study monitor and/or auditor/regulatory agency personnel. Detailed instructions will be provided in the pharmacy manual. 10.7. Study Drug Handling and Disposal No medication (new or used) can be returned to the Sponsor or dispos ed of at the clinical study site until the Sponsor’s clinical monitor has verified/reconciled the accuracy of the study medication records at the clinical site and indicated whether the medication should be destroyed at the clinical study site or returned to the Sponsor. Detailed instructions including drug return or other disposition details will be provided in the pharmacy manual. 11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 11.1. Eczema Area and Severity Index The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical studies to assess the severity and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics will be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head/neck, trunk (including"
62,page_62,"Version 10.0 Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Date: 05-May-2020 Ichnos Sciences CONFIDENTIAL Page 62 of 103 genital area), upper limbs, and lower limbs (including buttocks), and converted to a score of 0 to 6 (Hanifin et al, 2001). 11.2. Investigator’s Global Assessment The IGA is an assessment scale used in clinical studies to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment based on a 5- point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) as shown in Table 7. Table 7: Investigator’s Global A ssessment Scores and Definitions IGA Score Definition 0 = Clear No inflammatory signs of atopic dermatitis 1 = Almost clear Just perceptible erythema, and just perceptible papulation/infiltration Barely perceptible erythema and/or minimal lesion elevation (papulation/infiltration) 2 = Mild disease Mild erythema and mild papulation/infiltration Visibly detectable, light pink erythema and very slight elevation (papulation/infiltration) 3 = Moderate disease Moderate erythema and moderate papulation/infiltration Dull red, clearly distinguishable erythema; clearly perceptible elevation (papulation/infiltration), but not extensive 4 = Severe disease Severe erythema and severe papulation/infiltration Deep/dark red erythema; marked and extensive elevation (papulation/infiltration) 11.3. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis Assessment The SCORAD is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and intensity of AD. The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD calculation). The intensity of 6 specific symptoms of AD is assessed using the following scale: absence (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3), (for a maximum of 18 total points, assigned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calculation). Subjective assessment of pruritus and sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the subject or relative on a visual analogue scale (VAS), w here 0 is no pruritus (or sleep- loss) and 10 is the wors t imaginable pruritus (or sleep loss), with a maximum possible score of 20. This parameter is assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculation. The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C (Kunz et al, 1997). 11.4. Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale For the Pruritus NRS , subject s will respond to the following question, “On a scale of 0 – 10, with 0 being no itch and 10 being the worst itch imaginable, how would you rate your worst degree of itch during the previous 24 hours?” The Pruritus NRS will be assessed and recorded by the subject once per day, in the morning ideally at the same time, and reviewed by study staff at each clinic visit. Baseline Pruritus NRS average score for maximum itch intensity will be determined based on the average of daily Pruritus NRS scores for maxim um itch intensity (the daily score ranges from 0"

A minimum of 3 daily scores out of the 7 days is required to calculate the baseline average score. For subjects who do not have at least 4 dai ly scores reported during the 7 days immediately preceding the planned randomization date, randomization should be postponed until this requirement is met, but without exceeding the 28-day maximum duration for screening). 11.5. Dermatology Life Q uality Index The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a subject -administered, 10-question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. Response categories include “a little,” “a lot,” and “very much” with corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3, respectively ; “not at all”, “not relevant” responses are scored as “0.” Totals range from 0 to 30 ( ie, from less to more impairment) and a 5 -point change from baseline is considered clinically relevant ( Finlay and Khan, 1994; Basra et al, 2008 ). 11.6. Global Individual Signs Score For the Globa l Individual Signs Score (GISS), individual components of the AD lesions (erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriations, and lichenification) will be rated globally (ie, each assessed for the whole body, not by anatomical region) on a 4-point scale (from 0=none to 3=severe) using the EASI severity grading criteria. 11.7. Body Surface Area Involvement of Atopic Dermatitis Body surface area (BSA) affected by AD will be assessed for each section of the body (the possible highest score for each region is: head and neck [9%], anterior trunk [18%], back [18%], upper limbs [18%], lower limbs [36%], and genitals [1%]) and will be reported as a percentage of all major body sections combined. 11.8. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HA DS) is an instrument for screening anxiety and depression in non-psychiatric populations; repeated administration also provides information about changes to a patient’s emotional state ( Zigmond and S naith , 1983; Herrmann, 1997). The HADS consists of 14 items, 7 each for anxiety and depression symptoms; possible scores range from 0 to 21 for each subscale. The following cut- off scores are recommended for both subscales: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression. 11.9. Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM is a 7 -item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease s ymptoms in children and adults ( Charman et al , 2004 ). The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease- related morbidity."

EuroQol -5D The EuroQol- 5D (EQ -5D) is a standardi zed measure of health status developed by the EuroQOL Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ -5D consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQVAS) . The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels of perceived problems: “no problems ” (level 1), “some problems” (level 2), “extreme problems” (level 3). The VAS scale is a 100 -point scale with endpoints ranging from 100 – “best imaginable health state” to 0 – “worst imaginable health state”. 11.11. Asthma Control Questionnaire -5 The ACQ- 5 is a 5-question version of the Juniper ACQ is a validated questionnaire to evaluate asthma control. The questionnaire will be administered only to the subset of subjects with a medical history of asthma. 11.12. Sino -nasal Outcome Test The Sino- nasal Outcome Test (SNOT -22) is a validated questionnaire to assess the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis on quality of life (QOL). The questionnaire will be administered only to the subset of subjects with chronic inflammatory conditions of the nasal mucosa and/or paranasal sinuses (eg, chronic rhinitis/ rhinosinusitis, nas al polyps, allergic rhinitis). 11.13. Patient Global Assessment of Disease Subjects will rate their overall wellbeing based on a 5 -point Likert scale from poor to excellent. Subjects will be asked: “Considering all the ways in which your eczema affects you, indicate how well you are doing.” Response choices are: “Poor”; “Fair”; “Good”; “Very Good”; “Excellent.” 11.14. Patient Global Assessment of Treatment Subjects will rate their satisfaction with the study treatment based on a 5 -point Likert scale from poor to excellent . Subjects will be asked: “How would you rate the way your eczema responded to the study medication?” Response choices are: “Poor”; “Fair”; “Good”; “Very Good”; “Excellent”. 11.15. Assessment of Sick Leave and/or Missed School Days Subjects who are empl oyed or enrolled in school will be asked to report the number of sick leave and/or missed school days due to atopic dermatitis (eg, vs due to an accident) in the last 4 weeks ."

Safety Parameters Safety and tolerability of ISB 830 will be assessed, including AEs; SAEs; TE AEs; anaphylactic events; ISRs ; vital signs; physical examinations; electrocardiograms (ECGs) ; and clinical laboratory parameters, as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 and Table 3). Guidance will be given to the investigator for the criteria to be used to assess anaphylaxis (Sampson et al , 2006) , see Section 13.2.1.4. Injection site reactions will be assessed according to the CTCAE v4.03 ( CTCAE v4.03, 2010). Pandemic Related Safety Assessments: To ensure the ongoing safety of subjects during the pandemic, study subjects who miss or are unable to attend scheduled clinic visits will be contacted by the site via a safety phone call that includes the collection of AEs/SAEs and concomitant medications. This phone call is to be performed for every missed visit that occurs during the pandemic. I f the subject meets other criteria, eg, for withdrawal/discontinuation of the study drug, the site is to follow the protocol in regard to those criteria. Subject withdrawal /discontinuation criteria are outlined in Section 8.3. In case of premature discontinuation, the reason must be documented. All appropriate assessments should be conducted at the EOT visit. If the withdrawal is due to an AE, the AE should be monitored until it is resolved, stabilizes or has returned to a status that was prior to the AE (see Section 13.4.1). 13.1.1. Demographic/ Medical History Subject demography information will be collected at the Screening visit. Demography information includes date of birth, sex, and race/ethnicity. Medical and surgical history, current medical conditions and smoking status will be recorded at the Screening visit. 13.1.2. Vital Signs Examination of vital signs will be performed as designated on the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 and Table 3). Vital sign measurements (ie, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [mmHg], pulse rate [beats per minute], respiratory rate [per minute] and oral or tympanic temperature [degrees in Celsius]) will be obtained at the visits designated on the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 and Table 3) by standard methods. Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured after the subject has been supine for 5 minutes. All blood pressure measurements should be performed on the same arm , as much as possible. 13.1.3. Weight and Height Body weight (in kg), height (in cm) and body mass index (BMI) will be assessed at the Screening visit. Body weight will be assessed at the final Follow-up visit."
71,page_71,"Version 10.0 Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Date: 05-May-2020 Ichnos Sciences CONFIDENTIAL Page 71 of 103 Body mass index will be calculated as weight ( in kg)/height ( in m2). 13.1.4. Physical Examination Physical examinations (comprehensive or symptom directed/targeted examination) will be performed as designated on the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 and Table 3). A comprehensive physical examination will include head, eyes, ears, nose and throat (HEENT), cardiovascular system, respiratory system, musculoskeletal system, skin (non- atopic dermatitis related), gastrointestinal system, genitourinary system, and a brief neurological examination. Sign/symptom-directed examination might be performed as per the Investigator’s discretion. Documentation of the physical examination will be included in the so urce documentation at the site. Significant findings at the Screening Visit will be recorded on the Medical History CRF. Changes from screening physical examination findings that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded on the Adverse Events e CRF. 13.1.5. Electrocardiogram Electrocardiograms (single 12- lead ECGs) will be obtained as designated on the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2). A central ECG vendor will be used. Subjects must be in a supine or recumbent position for a period of 5 minutes prior to the ECG. A physician will have to perform a clinical assessment of each 12 -lead ECG. PR, QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals, QRS duration and pulse rate will be recorded. The QT interval will be corrected for pulse rate (QTc) using Frideric ia’s formula. A copy of the ECG tracing has to be stored as source data. The following ECG parameters will be recorded: heart rate (HR), RR inte rval (RR), PR interval, QRS -duration, QT interval, QT interval corrected for HR (QTc) corrected according to Fridericia’s formula (QTcF), QTc corrected according to Bazett’s formula (QTcB), and the Investigator’s conclusion on the ECG profile. Fridericia’s formula (QTcF): (observed QT interval divided by cube root of RR interval, in seconds) Bazett’s formula (QTcB): (observed QT interval divided by square root of RR interval, in seconds) Abnormalities in an ECG will be assessed as “clinically significant” or “not clinically significant.” An ECG abnormality may meet the criteria of an AE as described in this protocol (see Section 13.2.1). For ECG abnormalities meeting criteria of an SAE (see Section 13.2.1.3, the site must fax or email the SAE report including the ECG report (with Subject ID only, and subject’s name masked) to the Sponsor using the SAE form (see Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs [see Section 13.5])."

A central laboratory should usually be used to measure laboratory parameters that are to be assessed as part of the sa fety analyses for the Clinical Study Report ( CSR) . Local laboratories may be used in cases of a safety concern during the study, in which case the blood sample would be split (or 2 samples collected) to allow both a local laboratory and a central laborato ry analysis. In such cases, the local laboratory result(s) will be considered part of the source documentation only and the central laboratory result will be entered into the clinical database. Local laboratory reports from non- split samples generated to follow safety concerns will be contained in the source documentation. Any abnormal clinical laboratory test results (hematology, blood chemistry , or urinalysis) that worsen from baseline and considered to be clinically significant in the medical and scien tific judgment of the Investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. 13.1.6.1. Virus Serology Serology will be performed for HBsAg, anti- HBcAg, anti -HCV, and HIV at screening only. 13.1.6.2. Pregnancy Testing For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) , a urine pregnancy test may be performed at the initial screening visit, at the Investigator’s discretion. Serum beta -human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) is required within 7 days prior to randomization and at the end of study follow-up visit; all other visits may be urine pregnancy tests. The pregnancy test on Day 1 must be negative prior to randomization. If a serum pregnancy test is performed on Day 1, it is not necessary to perform a urine pregnancy test the same day. For postmenopausal women only, FSH screening will be performed at screening to confirm non-childbearing potential (FSH ≥40 IU/L). FSH testing, and serum pregnancy and urine pregnancy testing will be performed by a central laboratory. Screening pregnancy testing required within 7 days prior to randomization , will be performed by a central laboratory and may be performed by a local laboratory if timing necessitates . 13.1.6.3. Confirmation of Medical Care by Another Physician The Investigator will instruct subjects to inform clinical site personnel when they are planning to receive medical care by another physician. At each visit, the Investigator will ask the subject whether he/she has received medical care by another physician since the last visit or is planning to do so in the future. When the subject is going to receive medical care by another physician, the Investigator, with the consent of the subject, will inform the other physician that the subject is participating in the clinical study."

Estimate of Volume of Blood to be Collected The estimated am ount of blood to be collected for clinical safety lab tests including pregnancy testing and FSH testing is 7 mL per visit, the estimated amount of blood to be collected for each PK blood draw per visit is 3.5 mL and the estimated amount of blood to be coll ected for each immunogenicity blood draw is 5 mL. The estimated amount of blood to be collected for each biomarker analysis is 23.5 mL, including blood for vfPBMCs. The total maximum amount of blood that may be collected per subject in the study, including all safety labs, immunogenicity, rich PK and biomarker samples, and optional PG blood sample over 70 weeks is approximately 538 mL. 13.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events The Investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. The reference safety information for this study is the current GBR 830/ISB 830 IB. 13.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events 13.2.1.1. Adverse Event An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered study drug that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally as sociated with the use of the study drug, whether or not related to the study drug. An AE includes any event, regardless of the presumed causality between the event and the study drug. Events that, while not necessarily meeting the definition of AEs, should be treated as such because they may be reportable to Regulatory Authorities according to AE reporting regulations, whether or not considered causally associated with IP, include the following: • Study drug overdose, whether accidental or intentional. • Study drug abuse. • An event occurring from study drug withdrawal. • Any failure of expected pharmacological action . • Inadvertent or accidental study drug exposure (eg, product leaking or being spilled onto a subject or care- giver) . • Medication errors (ie, incorrect route of administration, incorrect dosage, use of incorrect product). Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include: • Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE."

Note that significant worsening of symptoms (ie, requiring systemic steroids, antibiotics, or hospitalization ) will be reported as an AE. For guidance on hospitalization, including planned hospitalization, emergency department visits, and prolongation of existing hospitalization, please refer to Section 13.2.1.3. 13.2.1.2. Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events The severity of AEs is classified ( Table 9 ) according to the CTCAE v4.03 that was published 14- Jun-2010 by the US Department of Health and Human Services (National Institutes of Health [NIH] and National Cancer Institute [NCI]). Table 9: Classification of Severity of Adverse E vents (CTCAE v 4.03) Grade 1 Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age - appropriate instrumental activities of daily living1 (ADL). Grade 3 Severe Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL2. Grade 4 Life-threatening Urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death Death related to AE. ADL = activities of daily living; AE = adverse event; CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events . 1 Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, et c. 2 Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. Source: CTCAE v4.03, 2010 The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness (see Serious Adverse Events [see Section 13.2.1.3] for the definition of an SAE). 13.2.1.3. Serious Adverse Event s A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: • Results in death • Is life -threatening"
75,page_75,"Version 10.0 Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Date: 05-May-2020 Ichnos Sciences CONFIDENTIAL Page 75 of 103 − NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. • May result in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Hospitalization is defined as any inpatient admission (even if less than 24 hours). Inpatient admission does not include the following: − Emergency Room department visits − Outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures/observation/short- stay units − Hospice facilities/respite care − Rehabilitation facilities − NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for ob servation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting . Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. • Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. • A hospitalization planned prior to study enrollment is to be considered a therapeutic intervention and not the result of a new SAE. If the planned hospitalization or procedure is executed as planned, it will be recorded in the subject’s medical history or procedures. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it must be reported as an AE. • Emergency room visits that do not result in a hospital admission should be evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes (eg, life- threatening; requir ed intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; other serious medically important event). • Results in disability/incapacity − NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life - threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Exa mples of such events are invasive or"

Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis Clinical criteria to be used for diagnosing anaphylaxis ( Sampson et al , 2006) are shown i n Table 10. The Investigator should also use these criteria when reporting the event. Table 10: Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled: 1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours): a. Involvement of the skin -m ucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips -tongue - uvula) b. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, cramp y abdominal pain, vomiting) 3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP * b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline BP = blood pressure; PEF = peak expiratory flow. *Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as: less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year; less than (70 mm Hg + [2 x age]) from 1 to 10 years; and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years. Source: (Sampson et al , 2006) , Table 1. 13.3. Relationship to Study Drug The relationship of AEs to study medication is classified as follows: • Not Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is not a reasonable possibility • Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is a reasonable possibility Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are: • Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment • The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable • Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar treatments • The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the event"

For each AE, the Investigator should answer the following question with Yes or No: • Was there a reasonable possibility (evidence) that the drug caused the AE? − A reasonable possibility means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. − NOTE: For subjects who have not started receiving study medication, or run-in phase medications , the answer must be no. 13.4. Recording Adverse Events 13.4.1. Collection of Adverse Events The Investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. AEs will be collected from the time of signing the ICF until the final Follow -up visit. SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs . Any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (eg, study drug, protocol mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a concomitant medication that is a Ichnos Sciences product, will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow-up contact. All SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours, as indicated in Section 13.5. The Investigator will enquire about the occurrence of AEs/SAEs at every visit throughout the study (including Follow-up and Early Withdrawal visits where applicable), by asking the following non-leading verbal question of the subject (or care-giver, where appropriate): • “Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?” All AEs not resolved by the end of the study or that have not resolved upon the subject’s discontinuation in the study must be followed until the event resolves, the event stabilizes or the event returns to baseline if a baseline value is available. 13.4.2. Recording of Adverse Events All AEs, regardless of the seriousness, severity or relationship to the study medication must be recorded on the AE e CRF. Adverse events that meet the definition of an SAE must be reported on the SAE Form provided for this study. Adverse events must be documented in clear, unambiguous medical language. Do not use abbreviations or acronyms. For each AE record only the diagnosis, do not report the characteristic signs and symptoms of the diagnosis as additional AEs."

In general , abnormal findings at screening should be recorded in the subject’s Medical History or in the Concurrent Conditions section in the eCRF. However, if in the Investigators opinion, the finding is clinically significant and represents a condition that was not present at signing of informed consent, then the finding must be reported as an AE. 13.5. Reporting Adve rse Events Prompt notification of SAEs by the Investigator to the Sponsor is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects are met. The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC and Investigators. All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor immediately or within 24 hours of the Investigator or their staff becoming aware of them. Reporting should be performed by recording as much information as is available at the time on the SAE Form and sending it to the contact information provided below: When further information becomes available, the SAE Form should be updated with the new information and reported immediately via the same contact information. Follow -up reports must be submitted to the Sponsor until the event resolves, the event stabilizes or the event returns to baseline if a baseline value is available. Additional information will be requested by the Sponsor as necessary. 13.5.1. Pregnancy The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a male study subject who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. The Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor within 2 weeks of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported. Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported to the Sponsor, using a clinical trial preg nancy form, immediately or within 24 hours of the Investigator learning of its occurrence. The report should contain as much information as possible and should be sent to:"

The Pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome (including premature terminatio n) and status of mother and child, and this information must be sent to the Sponsor as above. Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE . Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE. Additional information will be requested by the Sponsor as necessary. Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the Investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study and considered by the Investigator as possibly related to the study drug, must be promptly reported to the Sponsor. 14. TIMING OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS Study procedures and assessments are summarized across all study visits within the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 and Table 3). Pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, and biomarker blood sampling time points and allowed windows are described in Table 8. Patient reported assessments should be completed before investigator assessments. If assessments are planned for the same scheme time, the order of the assessments should be performed in the following order: vital signs, ECG, PK and immunogenicity blood sampling, AD photography, and study drug dosing. PK blood sampling should occur exactly on time. Samples collected outside the window period will be reported as protocol deviations. Irrespective of whether the PK samples were collected within the allowed window period or outside the allowed window period, the actual time point of sa mpling will be recorded (in the eCRF) and this time point will be used for the calculation of PK parameters. Blood samples will be collected as per routine phlebotomy procedures at time points specified in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 8. 14.1. Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1) Screening should be conducted within the 28 days before the randomization to study treatment (Day 1 ). Before performing any procedures or assessments, the nature of the study and the potential risks associated with the study must be explained to all subjects and written informed consent must be obtained. An electronic subject diary device will be given to each subject at the screening visit. The subject will be trained on the use of the device. This device will be used for the P ruritus NRS scale and other observations required for screening (see Table 2, Schedule of Assessments) . The subject will be instructed to enter the data every morning at a designated time and how to record them. A minimum of 3 days of diary must be recor ded in the week prior to randomization. The subject must enter data into the electronic subject diary every day from start of screening period to Day 113 (Week 16). Once informed consent for the study (and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] authorization or other locally required documentation, as applicable) has been"

At the discretion of the Investigator, 1 re-test will be allowed at screening for laboratory investigations other than viral serology , to confirm findings for clinical conditions that are considered to be acute, reversible, and non-serious. Subjects who have completed the study or are in follow- up at the time the open-label protocol amendment is implemented and provide written informed consent to participate in the open- label treatment phase of the study, will undergo a modified screening visit which includes, Informed Consent, Medical History, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (with the exception of Inclusion Criteria 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and Exclusion Criteria 1 and 5), Prior and Concomitant Medication Evaluation, Vital Signs, Physical Examination (Comprehensive), Weight, 12- Lead ECG, Clinical Laboratory Assessments, Serology, TB Testing, Urine Pregn ancy Test, ACQ-5, Immunogenicity blood samples, PK blood samples IGA/EASI (Investigator completed), and Adverse Event Assessment. 14.2. Treatment Period At each visit, the procedures and evaluations described for the visit in the SoA are to be performed (Table 2 and Table 3). 14.2.1. Blinded Treatment Phase The blinded treatment phase consists of following visits. • Day 1 (Baseline and Randomization) • Day 2 to Day 6 (Rich PK Group) : Blood samples will be collected as per r outine phlebotomy procedures and at time points specified in Table 2 and Table 8. • Non-Dosing Day Visits : Day 8 (Week 1) • Dosing Days : Day 15 ±1 (Week 2) , Day 29±1 (Week 4) , Day 43±1 (Week 6) , Day 57±1 (Week 8) , Day 71±1 (Week 10), Day 85 (Week 12), Day 99±1 (week 14) • Days 85 (Week 12) to Day 92 (Week 13) (Rich PK Group only) • Blinded End of Treatment/Early Discontinuation: Day 113±1 (Week 16) 14.2.2. Start of Open -label Treatment Phase: Day 113 All blinded EOT treatment phase assessments must be completed prior to open- label treatment dosing. Note: The subset of subjects who have completed the GBR 830-204 study prior to implementation of the open- label protocol amendment and provide informed consent to participate in the open -label treatment phase of the study, will undergo the modified screening assessments on Day 113. Modified Screening Visit includes informed consent, m edical history, eligibility for inclusion/exclusion c riteria (with the exception of inclusion criteria 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and exclusion c riteria 1 and 5), prior and c oncomitant medications, vital signs, comprehensive"

Open -label Treatment Phase /Long- term Assessments The open- label treatment phase consists of the following visits: • Dosing Days: Day 113 (Week 16) to Day 364 (Week 5 2): The window period for each visit during this period is ±2 days except the visit on Day 113±1. • Open -label End of Treatment Phase/Early Discontinuation : Day 379 (Week 54) 14.3. Follow -up Period : Week 58, Week 62 and Week 66 The follow up period will consist of a phone call 4 weeks and 8 weeks, and a final 12 week follow up clinic visit after last EOT . Weeks 58 and 62 will be phone contacts only. Week 66 will be an in -person clinic visit. Refer to Section 8.3 i f at any time point a subject is withdrawn from the study . In the event of early withdrawal, assessments will be performed as soon as possible after a subject withdraws from the study. A subject, who has completed blinded or open-label study drug treatment, will be asked to complete all procedures scheduled for the EOT visits at time of completion (Day 113 [Week 16], or Day 379 [Week 54], respec tively) . The subject should continue to the follow-up period for a phone call 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the EOT visit and a final follow up visit 12 weeks after the EOT visit, unless the subject withdraws consent or is lost to follow-up. After the end of participation in the study, the subject will be treated, as needed, at the discretion of the Investigator. Every effort should be made to contact the subject for a follow-up if the subject has not returned to the clinic for s cheduled visits (lost- to-follo w-up subject) to ensure the safety of the subject. 15.

Continuous demographic and baseline variables include age, height and body weight, and BMI; categorical variables in clude gender, race, and ethnicity. 15.6. Efficacy Analyses The primary efficacy analysis will be the percentage change from baseline in EASI score, and the secondary efficacy analysis will be the IGA and EASI 75 (subjects achieving 75% reduction from baseline in EASI score). T he IGA is an assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD globally, based on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The EASI and IGA scores will be assessed at time points described in the Schedule of Assessments. The primary efficacy analyses will be conducted for all subjects in the FAS using the treatment arm as assigned . In addition, the efficacy analyses for the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints (IGA, EASI -75) will be conducted usin g the PPS. For both Part 1 and Part 2 of the study, the primary endpoint (percentage change from baseline in EASI score at Week 16) will be analyzed using a MMRM model. The model will adjust for study treatment, baseline, randomization stratification factors, visit as well as baseline -by-visit and treatment -by-visit interactions. The continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the MMRM model as performed for the primary endpoint. The Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by randomization strata (region, disease severity) will be used to analyze the categorical secondary endpoints. To test the robustness of the MMRM model for the primary endpoint, sensitivity analyses using tipping point approach will be conducted. In addition, the primary endpoint will be analyzed using the complete dataset (subjects who complete the week 16 and had EASI measurement). For Part 2 of the study, Group 5 ( loading q2w maintenance) will be compared to the corresponding placebo arm (Group 6) using the same statistical method s used in the analysis of the first part of the study. To assess the robustness of the results in the Part 2 of the study, the analyses on primary endpoint and secondary endpoints (IGA, EASI-75) will also be conducted excluding subjects who withdraw from the study or miss 2 or more consecutive doses prior to Week 16 or miss any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16 due to the pandemic. Parts 1 and 2 are two independent parts of the study protocol and will therefore be analyzed separately. That is, upon completion of the double-blind period of Part 1, the database will be partially locked . The data will be analyzed and the t opline results (TLR) determined. Similar activities will take place upon the completion of the double-blind period of Part 2. The efficacy results from these 2 parts of the study will be kept separate. H owever, the safety results will be presented side -by-side."

Data Safety Monitoring Board This study will institute a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) which will function independently of all other individuals associated with the conduct of this clinical trial, including the site investigators participating in the study. The DSMB will be constituted prior to the randomization of the first subject. The DSMB will monitor subject safety by formally reviewing accumulated safety data by treatment group at least twice during the study, but may require additional review as per DSMB charter . This includes but does not limit the role of the DSMB to evaluate these data and to provide recommendations to the sponsor to continue or modify the follow-up phase of the study as outlined in the DSMB charter. It is expected that the DSMB will consist at a minimum of 2 physicians with appropriate disease area qualifications and 1 statistician. There will be a meeting with the DSMB describing their roles and responsibilities and discussing potential data format and process issues prior to the finalization of DSMB charter. 16. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 16.1. Study Monitoring Before an investigational site can enter a subject into the study, a representative of the Sponsor will visit the investigational study site to: • Determine the adequacy of the facil ities • Discuss with the Investigator and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives. This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. During the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or representative will have regular contacts with the investigational site, for the following: • Provide information and support to the Investigator • Confirm that facilities remain acceptable • Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately recorded in the eCRF, and that IP accountability checks are being performed • Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs with the subject’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each subject (eg, clinic charts). • Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor. • Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on e CRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to the Sponsor and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB."

Key: Bold: Newly added text Strikethrough text: Deleted text from the previous version of the protocol. A. Details of Substantial Changes to the Protocol, from Version 9.0, Amendment 8 to Protocol Version 10.0, Amendment 9 From Protocol Version 9.0 (Amendment 8) 28-Jan-2020 To Protocol Version 10.0 (Amendment 9) 05-May -2020 Rationale for Amendment 1. Synopsis, Section 7.1.4 Number of Subjects (Planned) Used to read: For Groups 1 through 4, a sufficient number of subjects will be screened to randomize 312 eligible subjects in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. For Group 5 and 6, a sufficient number of subjects will be screened to randomize 156 eligible subjects in a 1:1 ratio to either ISB 830 or Placebo, therefore a total of 468 subjects are planned to be randomized in this study. The randomization will be stratified by disease severity (moderate or severe, as assessed by IGA), geographic region (North America vs European Union), and subjects consenting to rich PK sampling (Yes/No). Now reads: For Groups 1 through 4, a sufficient num ber of subjects will be screened to randomize 312 eligible subjects in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. For Group 5 and 6, a sufficient number of subjects will be screened to randomize 156 eligible subjects in a 1:1 ratio to either ISB 830 or Placebo, therefore a total of approximately 468 subjects are planned to be randomized in this study. The randomization will be stratified by disease severity (moderate or severe, as assessed by IGA), geographic region (North America vs European Union), and subjects consenting to rich PK sampling (Yes/No). The actual number of subjects randomized in Groups 5 and 6 may be different than initially planned due to the impact of the SARS -CoV-2 /COVID- 19 pandemic (see Section 8.3.4). Enrollment of additional subjects is now allowed due to pandemic - related discontinuation or withdrawal up to Week 16 in part 2 only. 2. Section 8.3.1 Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug Used to read: Subjects must be temporarily discontinued from study drug dosing in either event of: •Grade 3 neutrophil count (<1000- 500/μL, per the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI) -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03, 2010). Now reads: Subjects must be temporarily discontinued from study drug dosing in either event of: •Grade 3 neutrophil count (<1000- 500/μL, per the National Institu tes of Health/National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI) -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 (CTCAE v4.03, 2010).

Section 8.3.4 Enrollment of Additional Subjects Used to read: Section 8.3.4 Replacement of Subjects Not applicable. Now reads: Section 8.3.4 Replacement of Subjects Enrollment of Additional Subjects Not applicable. Special considerations have been added to the protocol based on the issues arising from the SARS -CoV- 2/COVID- 19 pandemic. During the blinded dosing period for Part 2 (ie, prior to completion of the Week 16 visit), any randomized subject who terminates study participation or who misses 2 or more consecutive doses of study drug (even if continuing with study participation) or misses any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16, as a result of pandemic - related reasons, may not be counted against the total number of subjects targeted (N=156 for Part 2 of the study). For each of these cases, a new subject may be screened and randomized, to allow an evaluable number of subjects for the Week 16 primary endpoint. The new subjects in screening will receive new subject numbers and new treatment assignments as per the current randomization schedule in the protocol.

Secondary: • To evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of ISB 830 in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. • To measure the effect of ISB 830 on disease activity in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe AD, as measured by validated tools (such as Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA], EASI response, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis [SCORAD]). Exploratory: • To evaluate pharmacodynamics (PD) of ISB 830 in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Study population: Adult males and females (≥18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment is medically inadvisable (eg, intolerance, other important side effects or safety risks in the opinion of the Investigator). Moderate-to-severe AD is defined by an IGA score of 3 or higher at screening and baseline, consistent with the categories of moderate (IGA=3) and severe (IGA=4); and an EASI score of 12 or higher at screening or 16 or higher at baseline."

An experimental population PK design will be used for the PK blood sampling. The subjects in the rich PK group will have additional blood sampling between Days 1 to 8 (Week 1), and Days 85 to 92 (Week 12) compared to the sparse PK group. The subjects in the sparse PK group will have widespread sampling with fewer time points for each subject (compared to the rich PK group). Approximately 80 rich PK subjects will be randomized (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to treatment groups 1-4 and approximately 40 rich PK subjects will be randomized (in a 1:1 ratio) to treatment groups 5 and 6. The remaining subjects in the study will be included in the sparse PK group. Blood samples will be collected from the rich and sparse PK subjects according to the respective schedule described in Table 8 of the protocol. End-of-treatment (EOT) visits will be conducted on Day 113 (Week 16) for the blinded treatment phase and at Day 379 (Week 54) for the open-label treatment phase for all subjects. Subjects should continue into the follow-up period and will have a follow-up phone call 4 and 8 weeks after the last EOT visit [Day 407 (Week 58) and Day 435 (Week 62) respectively] and a final clinic visit 12 weeks after the EOT [Day 463 (Week 66)] visit. Subjects who withdraw consent from the blinded treatment phase prior to Week 16 will undergo the blinded treatment phase EOT visit procedures and enter the follow-up period. Subjects who withdraw consent from open-label treatment phase prior to Week 52 will undergo the open-label treatment phase EOT visit procedures and enter the follow-up period. All subjects continuing in the follow-up period will have a follow-up phone call 4 and 8 weeks after the last EOT visit and a final clinic visit 12 weeks after the EOT visit as described in the Table 3 follow-up period. Subjects will be clinically monitored for safety throughout the study, including anaphylactic reactions and/or injection site reactions (ISRs), with monitoring at the study site for 2 hours after the first dose on Day 1 (in the blinded treatment phase) and on Day 113 (Week 16) (first dose in open-label treatment phase) and for 1 hour after dosing at all other visits.

The HADS consists of 14 items, 7 each for anxiety and depression symptoms; possible scores range from 0 to 21 for each subscale. The following cut-off scores are recommended for both subscales: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression. • POEM: The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease symptoms in children and adults ( Charman et al, 2004 ). The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease-related morbidity. • EQ-5D: The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQOL Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQVAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels of perceived problems: “no problem” (level 1), “some problems” (level 2), “extreme problems” (level 3). • ACQ-5: The ACQ-5 is a 5-question version of the Juniper ACQ and is a validated questionnaire to evaluate asthma control. The questionnaire will be administered only to the subset of subjects with a medical history of asthma. • SNOT-22: The SNOT-22 is a validated questionnaire to assess the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis on quality of life. The questionnaire will be administered only to a subset of subjects (eg, with chronic rhinitis/ rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, allergic rhinitis). • Patient Global Assessment of Disease: Subjects will rate their overall well-being based on a 5-point Likert scale from poor to excellent. Subjects will be asked: “Considering all the ways in which your eczema affects you, indicate how well you are doing.” Response choices are: “Poor”; “Fair”; “Good”; “Very Good”; “Excellent.” • Patient Global Assessment of Treatment: Subjects will rate their satisfaction with the study treatment based on a 5-point Likert scale from poor to excellent. Subjects will be asked: “How would you rate the way your eczema responded to the study medication?” Response choices are: “Poor”; “Fair”; “Good”; “Very Good”; “Excellent.” • Assessment of Sick Leave and/or Missed School Days: Subjects who are employed or enrolled in school will be asked to report the number of sick leave and/or missed school days due to atopic dermatitis (eg, vs due to an accident) in the last 4 weeks. Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Blood samples will be collected from both rich and sparse PK groups at appropriate time points defined in Tables 2 and 3, and Table 8 in the protocol. The serum concentrations of ISB 830 in these samples will be quantified using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Serum concentration data from both rich PK and sparse PK group from the blinded treatment phase will be used to derive PK parameters, as appropriate. Immunogenicity Assessments: Blood samples will be collected at appropriate time points defined in Tables 2 and 3, and Table 8 in the protocol to detect the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to ISB 830, as per procedures similar to collection of PK"
118,page_118,"Version 6.0 Date: 21-Sep-2021 Statistical Analysis Plan Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Ichnos Sciences Confidential Page 13 of 68 samples. The presence or absence of ADA in these samples will be determined using a validated Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method. Pharmacodynamic (Biomarker) Assessments: Blood samples, including plasma, serum, whole blood, viably frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (vfPBMCs) and/or cell subsets will be collected from subjects randomized in the study at appropriate time points as defined in Table 2 and Table 8 in the protocol. Biomarker assessments to be performed on collected samples may include but not limited to: • Leukocyte sub-population cell counts by flow cytometry • Cytokines • Biomarker in peripheral blood • Total immunoglobulin E (IgE) • Serum soluble OX40 ligand (OX40L) and serum soluble OX40 • Epigenetics Exploratory Photographs: Subjects, who agree to participate in the main study, also agree to allow photography of their skin (excluding pictures of the subject’s face) during study participation at specified time points as per Table 2 and Table 3. Photographs of the subject’s skin (with the exception of the face) may also be taken at additional time points, as per investigator judgment. The photographs may be used to examine disease activity, autoimmunity/inflammation, ISB 830 mechanism of action, and/or the effect of the study drug(s) on the course of disease. Details of photograph collection, processing, shipping and storage will be provided to the study sites in a separate manual. Optional Genetic Research/Pharmacogenomics Assessments: Subjects who provide written consent for Optional Genetic Research agree to provide a blood sample (one sample may be collected at any visit during the study) to evaluate genetic sequences that may be involved in disease activity, inflammation, study drug mechanism of action, PK/metabolism, and/or the effect of the study drug(s) on the course of disease. Subjects may decline this optional research without effect on their participation in the main study. Safety Assessments: Safety and tolerability of ISB 830 will be assessed based on adverse events (AEs), including anaphylactic events and ISRs; SAEs; vital signs; physical examinations; ECGs; and clinical laboratory parameters. Subjects will be clinically monitored for safety throughout the study, including anaphylactic reactions and/or ISRs, with special monitoring at the study site for 2 hours after the first dose on Day 1 (in the blinded treatment phase) and on Day 113 (Week 16) (first dose in open-label treatment phase) and for 1 hour after dosing at all other visits. Guidance will be given to the investigator for the criteria to be used to assess anaphylaxis ( Sampson et al, 2006 ). Injection site reactions will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 that was published 14-Jun-2010 by the US Department of Health and Human Services (National Institutes of Health [NIH] and National Cancer Institute [NCI]). Pandemic Related Safety Assessments: To ensure the ongoing safety of subjects during the pandemic, study subjects who miss or are unable to attend scheduled clinic visits will be contacted by the site via a safety phone call that includes the collection of AEs/SAEs and concomitant medications. This phone call is to be performed for every missed visit that occurs during the pandemic. If the subject meets other criteria, eg, for withdrawal/discontinuation of the study drug, the site is to follow the protocol in regard to those criteria."
119,page_119,"Version 6.0 Date: 21-Sep-2021 Statistical Analysis Plan Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Ichnos Sciences Confidential Page 14 of 68 STATISTICAL METHODS: For both Part 1 and Part 2 of the study, the primary endpoint will be analyzed using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model will adjust for study treatment, baseline, randomization stratification factors, visit as well as baseline-by-visit and treatment-by-visit interactions. The continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the MMRM model as performed for the primary endpoint. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted by randomization strata (region, disease severity) will be used to analyze the categorical secondary endpoints. For Part 2 of the study, Group 5 ( loading dose/ q2w maintenance) will be compared to the corresponding placebo arm (Group 6) using the same statistical method used in the analysis of the first part of the study. To assess the robustness of the results in the Part 2 of the study, the analyses on primary endpoint and secondary endpoints (IGA, EASI-75) will also be conducted excluding subjects who withdraw from the study or miss 2 or more consecutive doses prior to Week 16 or miss any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16 due to the pandemic. Parts 1 and 2 are two independent parts of the study protocol and will therefore be analyzed separately. That is, upon completion of the double-blind period of Part 1, the database will be partially locked. The data will be analyzed and the topline results (TLR) determined. Similar activities will take place upon the completion of the double-blind period of Part 2. The efficacy results from these 2 parts of the study will be kept separate. However, the safety results will be presented side by side. Details of efficacy, safety and PK analyses will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and included in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). Population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response modeling will be described in a Modeling Plan and data will be published in a separate report. Biomarker analyses will not be part of the CSR and will be described separately. Study Populations: Full Analysis Set: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all subjects who are randomized and received at least 1 dose of study medication. Based on the intent-to-treat principle, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment group assigned. Per Protocol Set: The Per Protocol Set (PPS) consists of all FAS subjects who have no major protocol deviations of eligibility or on-treatment study conduct. Safety Analysis Set: The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) consists of all subjects who were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study medication. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set: The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS) consists of the subset of the SAS population who received ISB 830 and for whom sufficient serum concentration data are available to facilitate derivation of PK parameters, do not have any major protocol deviation, and for whom the time of dosing and the time of sampling are known. Additional subjects may be excluded from the PKAS at the discretion of the pharmacokineticist. Any formal definitions for exclusion of subjects or time points from the PKAS will be documente d in the SAP. Determination of Sample Size:"
120,page_120,"Statistical Analysis Plan Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Version 4.0 Date: 06-Mar-2020 Ichnos Sciences Confidential Page 15 of 68 Efficacy Analyses: The primary efficacy analysis will be the percentage change from baseline in EASI score, and the secondary efficacy analysis will be the IGA and EASI 75 (subjects achieving 75% reduction from baseline in EASI score). The IGA is an assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD globally, based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The EASI and IGA scores will be assessed at time points described in the Schedule of Assessments. To test the robustness of the MMRM for the primary endpoint, sensitivity analyses using the tipping point approach will be conducted. In addition, the primary endpoint will be analyzed using the complete dataset (subjects who complete the week 16 and had EASI measurements). Detailed statistical methods, , the handling of missing data for the analysis of the primary as well as secondary and exploratory endpoints and the exploratory analyses on biomarkers will be described in the SAP and the Biomarker Analys es Plan. Pharmacokinetic Analyses: The PKAS will be used for the PK analyses. Pharmacokinetic parameters (C max, tmax, AUC 0-tau, AUC 0-t, and other related parameters) will be estimated using data from the rich PK group from the blinded treatment phase. Estimates of C trough will be derived using the data from both rich PK group and sparse PK group from the blinded treatment phase. The PK parameters will be summarized in tabular and graphic form. Details of the PK analysis will be specified in the SAP. The serum concentration data from both rich and sparse PK group may be used for the population PK analysis and will be reported separately. Immunogenicity Analyses: The number and percent incidence of positive and negative ADA status of subjects by treatment, and time points will be provided. Titers and neutralizing potential of confirmed positive samples will be reported. Details will be provided in the SAP. Pharmacodynamic (Biomarker) Analyses: Summary statistics will be provided for PD biomarkers. Biomarker analyses will not be part of the CSR and will be described separately. Safety Analyses: Adverse events will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term. Subjects will be counted only once for each preferred term, system organ class, and by the highest severity of an event. Laboratory evaluations will be summarized with descriptive statistics at each visit, and change from baseline summarized for each post-baseline visit. Laboratory measurements will also be summarized based on the number and percentage of subjects above or below a pre-specified threshold for each test. AEs will be coded using MedDRA. Details will be presented in the GBR 830 -204 SAP. Data Safety Monitoring Board: This study will institute a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) which will function independently of all other individuals associated with the conduct of this clinical study, including the site investigators participating in the study. The DSMB will be constituted prior to the randomization of the first subject. The DSMB will monitor subject safety by formally reviewing accumulated safety data by treatment group three times during the study. This includes but does not limit the role of the DSMB to evaluate these data and to provide recommendations to the sponsor to continue or modify the follow-up phase of the study as outlined in the DSMB charter. It is expected that the DSMB will consist at a minimum of 2 physicians with appropriate disease area qualifications and 1 statistician. There will be a meeting with the DSMB describing their roles and responsibilities and discussing potential data format and process issues prior to the finalization of DSMB charter. Interim analyses: No interim analyses are planned."

INTRODUCTION The purpose of this statistical analysis plan (SAP) is to provide details of the planned statistical methodology for the analysis of the study data. The SAP also outlines the statistical programming specifications for the tables, listings and figures. This SAP is based on study protocol GBR 830-204 Version 10.0, Amendment 9. It describes the study endpoints, derived variables, anticipated data transformations and manipulations, and other details of the analyses not provided in the study protocol. This SAP therefore outlines in detail all other aspects pertaining to the planned analyses and presentations for this study. Details of efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses will be specified in this SAP and included in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). Detailed statistical methods, including methods for the handling of missing data for analyzing the primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints will be described in this SAP. This SAP was developed in accordance with ICH E9 guideline. All decisions regarding final analysis, as defined in this SAP document, will be made prior to Database Lock (unblinding) of the study data. The reader of this SAP should also read the clinical protocol, and other relevant documents for details on the planned conduct of this study. Operational aspects including the protocol Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 and Table 3 in the protocol) related to collection and timing of planned clinical assessments are not repeated in this SAP unless relevant to the planned analyses. Population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response modeling will be described in a Modeling Plan and data will be published in a separate report. Biomarker analyses will not be part of the CSR and will be described separately. 3. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 3.1. Study Objectives 3.1.1.

OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Summary of Study Design This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study will be conducted in 4 phases: a screening phase, a blinded treatment phase, an open-label treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. Subjects will participate in a 54-week treatment period (including 52 weeks of study drug administration) with 12 weeks follow-up from the end-of-treatment (EOT) visit (Week 54 to Week 66). The study will be conducted in 2 Parts, with dosing Groups 1-4 comprising Part 1, and dosing Groups 5-6 comprising Part 2. The blinded treatment phase consists of a randomized, placebo-controlled treatment with ISB 830 for 16 weeks at different dose levels (see below). The open-label treatment phase consists of a 38-week treatment phase where ISB830 will be administered every other week (q2w) subcutaneously (SC). The primary endpoint of the study will be assessed at the end of the blinded treatment period at Week 16."

Definition of Study Drugs Table 4 in the protocol provides a description of the study drug (double-blind ISB 830 and placebo) to be used in the study. 4.3. Sample Size Considerations 4.3.1. Sample Size Justifications 4.3.2. Sample Size Re-estimation No sampl e size re-estimation is planned for this study. 4.3.3. Enrollment of Additional Subjects Special considerations have been added to the protocol based on the issues arising from the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. During the blinded dosing period for Part 2 (ie, prior to completion of the Week 16 visit), any randomized subject who terminates study participation or who misses 2 or more consecutive doses of study drug (even if continuing with study participation) or misses any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16, as a result of pandemic-related reasons, may not be counted against the total number of subjects targeted (N=156 for Part 2 of the study). For each of these cases, a new subject may be screened and randomized, to allow an evaluable number of subjects for the Week 16 primary endpoint. The new subjects in screening will receive new subject numbers and new treatment assignments as per the current randomization schedule in the protocol. Additional subjects will only be added in response to the number of subjects who meet the above criteria, as a result of pandemic-related issues. Randomized subjects who discontinue study participation or miss consecutive doses or the Week 16 primary endpoint assessments for non- pandemic related reasons, or who have study drug or study visit issues after completing their Week 16 visit, will not trigger the screening of additional subjects."

Randomization Randomization numbers will be issued centrally using interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS). Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized on Day 1 using the IVRS/IWRS system and allocated a randomization number prior to receiving the first dose of study drug. Randomized subjects will be stratified by the IVRS/IWRS based on disease severity (moderate/severe), geographic region (North America (NAm)/European Union (EU)) as prognostic factors, and subjects consenting to rich PK sampling (Yes/No) to ensure balance of treatment groups within each stratum. Randomized subjects who terminate their study participation for any reason, regardless of whether study drug has been taken or not, will retain their randomization number. The randomization scheme will be stored within the IVRS/IWRS database until unblinding of this study is requested. The randomization scheme and identification for each subject will be included in the final clinical study report for this study. 4.5. Clinical Assessments 4.5.1. Efficacy Assessments  The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is a validated measure used in clinical practice a nd clinical studies to assess the severity and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics will be assessed for severity by the Investigator or designee on a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head/neck, trunk(including genital area), upper limbs, and lower limbs (including buttocks) and converted to a score of 0 to 6 ( Hanifin et al, 2001). The EASI will be collected in the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) and EASI score will be calculated in the eCRF as follows: Body Region EASI Score Head/Neck (H) (E + I + Ex + L) x Area x 0.1 Upper limbs (UL) (E + I + Ex + L) x Area x 0.2 Trunk (T) (E + I + Ex + L) x Area x 0.3 Lower limbs (LL) (E + I + Ex + L) x Area x 0.4 EASI score Sum of the above 4 body region scores The degree of severity of each sign (E = erythema, I = induration/papulation, Ex = excoriation, L = lichenification) in each of the 4 body regions is evaluated based on a scale ranging from 0 to 3 (0: none; 1: mild; 2: moderate; 3: severe), with half points allowed. Area (the affected body area) is defined as follows: 0= 0%; 1=1-9%; 2=10-29%; 3=30-49%; 4=50-69%; 5=70-89%; 6=90-100%. Among the 4 zones, trunk includes the genital area, and lower limbs include the buttocks.  The IGA is an assessment scale used in clinical studies to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The IGA will be collected in the eCRF. IGA Score Definition 0 = Clear No inflammatory sign of atopic dermatitis"
138,page_138,"Version 6.0 Date: 21-Sep-2021 Statistical Analysis Plan Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Ichnos Sciences Confidential Page 33 of 68 1 = Almost clear Just perceptible erythema and just perceptible papulation/infiltration; Barely perceptible erythema and/or minimal lesion elevation (papulation/infiltration) 2 = Mild disease Mild erythema and mild papulation/infiltration; Visible detectible, light pink erythema and very slight elevation (papulation/infiltration) 3 = Moderate disease Moderate erythema and moderate papulation/infiltration; Dull red, clearly distinguishable erythema; clearly perceptible elevation (papulation/infiltration), but not extensive 4 = Severe disease Severe erythema and severe papulation/infiltration; Deep/dark red erythema; marked and extensive elevation (papulation/infiltration)  The SCORAD is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and intensity of AD. The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD calculation). The intensity of 6 specific symptoms of AD is assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3), (for a maximum of 18 total points, assigned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calculation). Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the subject or relative on a visual analogue scale (VAS), where 0 is no pruritis (or sleep-loss) and 10 is the worst imaginable pruritis (or sleep-loss). This parameter is assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculation. The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C ( Kunz et al, 1997) and the maximum of SCORAD score is 103. The SCORAD will be collected in the eCRF. If SCORAD uses a non-10cm VAS scale line, the measurement will be converted to 10cm VAS scale line using a standard ratio.  For Pruritus NRS subjects will respond to the following question, “On a scale of 0 – 10, with 0 being no itch and 10 being the worst itch imaginable, how would you rate your worst degree of itch during the previous 24 hours?”. The Pruritis NRS will be assessed and recorded by the subject once per day in the morning, ideally at the same time; and reviewed by study staff at each clinic visit. Baseline Pruritus NRS average score for maximum itch intensity will be determined based on the average of daily Pruritus NRS scores for maximum itch intensity (the daily score ranges from 0 to 10) during the 7 days immediately preceding) randomization. A minimum of 3 daily scores out of the 7 days is required to calculate the baseline average score. For subjects who do not have at least 4 daily scores reported during the 7 days immediately preceding the planned randomization date, randomization should be postponed until this requirement is met, but without exceeding the 28-day maximum duration for screening).  The DLQI is a subject-administered, 10-question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work, and school personal relationships and treatment. Response categories include “a little,” “a lot,” and “very much” with corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3, respectively; “a little ,” “not relevant” responses are scored as “0.” Totals range from 0 to 30 (i.e., from less to more impairment), and a 5point change from baseline is considered clinically relevant ( Finlay and Khan, 1994; Basra et al, 2008).  For GISS individual components of the AD lesions (erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriations, and lichenification) will be rated globally (i.e., each assessed for the whole"
139,page_139,"Version 6.0 Date: 21-Sep-2021 Statistical Analysis Plan Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Ichnos Sciences Confidential Page 34 of 68 body, not by anatomical region) on a 4-point scale (from 0=none to 3=severe) using the EASI severity grading criteria. The GISS will be collected in the eCRF.  Body Surface Area (BSA) affected by AD will be assessed for each section of the body (the possibl e highest score for each region is: head and neck [9%], anterior trunk [18%], back [18%], upper limbs [18%], lower limbs [36%], and genitals [1%]), and will be reported as a percentage of all major body sections combined. The BSA will be collected in the eCRF.  The HADS is an instrument for screening anxiety and depression in non-psychiatric populations; repeated administration also provides information about changes to a patient’s emotional state ( Zigmond and Snaith, 1983 ; Hermann, 1997). The HADS consists of 14 item s, 7 each for anxiety and depression symptoms; possible scores range from 0 to 21 for each subscale. The following cut-off scores are recommended for both subscales: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression. At a given visit, there must be responses to at least 6 out of 7 questions within each sub-scale of anxiety and depression. If fewer than 6 responses, then the sub-scale will be set to missing  The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to asse ss disease symptoms in children and adults ( Charman et al, 2004 ). The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency during the past week (i.e., 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease-related morbidity.  The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQoL Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQVAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels of perceived problems: “no problem” (level 1), “some problems” (level 2), “extreme problems” (level 3). The VAS scale is a 100-point scale with endpoints ranging from 100 – “best imaginable health state” to 0-“worst imaginable health state”.  The ACQ-5 is a 5-question version of the Juniper ACQ that is a validated questionnaire to evaluate asthma control. The questionnaire will be administered only to the subset of subjects with a medical history of asthma. The ACQ-5 will be collected in the eCRF.  The SNOT-22 is a validated questionnaire to assess the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis on quali ty of life (QoL). The questionnaire will be administered only to a subset of subjects with chronic inflammatory conditions of the nasal mucosa and/or paranasal sinuses (eg, with chronic rhinitis/ rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, allergic rhinitis).  For Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Disease subjects will rate their overall wellbeing based on a 5-point Likert scale from poor to excellent. Subjects will be asked: “Considering all the ways in which your eczema affects you, indicate how well you are doing.” Response choices are: “Poor=1”; “Fair=2”; “Good=3”; “Very Good=4”; “Excellent=5.”  For Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Treatment subjects will rate their satisfaction with the st udy treatment based on a 5-point Likert scale from poor to excellent. Subjects will be"

Pharmacokinetic Assessments Blood sa mples (3.5 mL each) will be collected from both rich and sparse PK groups at appropriate time points defined in Table 2 and 3, and Table 8 in the protocol. Serum concentrations of ISB830 in these samples will be quantified using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Serum concentration data from both rich PK and sparse PK group from the blinded treatment will be used to derive PK parameters, as appropriate. In the blinded phase of the study, only the serum sample from subjects, belonging to treatment arms that received ISB830 will be analyzed. In open-label phase of the study, PK samples from all subjects will be analyzed. 4.5.3. Immunogenicity Assessments Blood sa mples (5 mL) will be collected from all subjects at appropriate time points defined in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 8 in the protocol, to detect the presence of ADA to ISB830, as per procedures similar to collection of PK samples. Antibodies generated against ISB830 will be detected and confirmed using a validated ECLIA method. Details of sample collection, processing and storage and shipment to the bioanalytical laboratory will be outlined in a separate laboratory manual. 4.5.4. Safety Assessments Saf ety and tolerability of ISB 830 will be assessed, including adverse event (AE); SAEs; TEAE; anaphylactic events and injection site reactions (ISR); vital signs; physical examinations; electrocardiograms (ECGs); and clinical laboratory parameters, as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 and Table 3) of the protocol. Guidance will be given to the investigator for the criteria to be used to assess anaphylaxis (Sampson et al, 2006 ). Injection site reactions will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03, 2010). Stopping/discontinuation/withdrawal criteria are listed in Section 8.3 of the protocol. In case of premature discontinuation, the reason and their cause must be documented. All appropriate assessments should be conducted at the EOT visits. If the withdrawal is due to an adverse event (AE), the AE should be monitored until it is resolved, stabilizes or has returned to a status that was prior to the AE. 4.6. Changes in the SAP Compared to the Study Protocol  For the efficacy endpoints (EASI-75 and IGA) stated below, “secondary efficacy endpoints” have been changed to “key secondary efficacy endpoints” - Proportion of subjects with EASI-7 5 (≥75% improvement from baselin e) at Week 16"

PLANNED ANALYSES 5.1. Interim Analyses No interim analyses are planned for this study. 5.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board This study will institute a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) which will function independently of all other individuals associated with the conduct of this clinical trial, including the site investigators participating in the study. The DSMB will monitor subject safety by formally reviewing accumulated safety data by treatment group at least twice during the study but may require additional review as per DSMB charter. The blinded and unblinded outputs will be submitted to the DSMB as outlined in the DSMB charter. 5.3. Primary Analyses All planned analyses will be carried out once the clinical database lock (DBL) has taken place. Once this has been achieved, unblinding will occur and the analyses will be performed. Parts 1 and 2 are two independent parts of the study protocol and will therefore be analyzed separately. That is, upon completion of the double-blind period of Part 1, the database will be partially locked. The data will be analyzed and the topline results (TLR) will be determined."

Analysis Populations Study population is adult males and females (≥ 18 years of age) with moderate-to-severe AD whose dise ase cannot be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment is medically inadvisable (e.g. intolerance, other important side effects or safety risks). 6.5.1. Full Analysis Set The F ull Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all subjects who are randomized and received at least 1 dose of study medication. Based upon the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) principle, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment group assigned. The efficacy summaries and analyses will be based on the FAS population. In the event that a subject is allocated the incorrect study treatment as per the study randomization list, subjects will be summarized and analyzed ‘as randomized’ (i.e., by randomized treatment group). In the event that a subject is stratified incorrectly, ‘randomized stratum’ will be used rather than ‘actual stratum.’ 6.5.2. Per-Protocol Set The P er Protocol Set (PPS) consists of all FAS subjects who have no major protocol deviations of eligibility or on-treatment study conduct. For the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, analysis will be performed on the PPS to assess the robustness of the study conclusions to the choice of analysis population. Subjects will be included in the analysis according to the treatment ‘as randomized’. 6.5.3. Safety Analysis Set The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) consists of all subjects who were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study medication. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received. Randomized subjects will only be excluded if there is clear, documented evidence that the subject did not receive any study drug injection."

Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set The P harmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS) consists of the subset of the SAS population who received ISB 830 having no major protocol deviation affecting PK and for whom at least one sample with detectable plasma concentration data is available and for whom the time of dosing and the time of sampling are known. Additional subjects may be excluded from the PKAS at the discretion of the pharmacokinetist. 6.5.5. Subjects Not Impacted by the Pandemic The subj ects not impacted by the pandemic excludes subjects who withdraw from the study or miss 2 or more consecutive doses prior to Week 16 or miss any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16 due to the pandemic. This subset will be analyzed for Part 2 of the study. 6.6. Baseline Definition Baseline is defined as the last non-missing result prior to administration of the first dose of study medication during blinded treatment phase. The Baseline value for primary and secondary efficacy evaluations, laboratory data, physical examination, and vital signs will be defined as the visit of Day 1 measurement. If this measurement is not available, the visit of D-28 to D-1 measurement will be used as the baseline value (including the assessment performed in the unscheduled visits). Baseline pruritus NRS average score for maximum itch intensity will be based on the average of daily NRS scores for maximum itch intensity ≥ 3 over the previous 24 hours (the daily score ranges fr om 0 to 10). A minimum of 3 daily scores out of the 7 days is required to calculate the baseline average score. For subjects who do not have at least 4 daily scores reported during the 7 days immediately preceding the planned randomization date, randomization should be postponed until this requirement is met, but without exceeding the 28-day maximum during for screening. 6.7. Derived and Transformed Data The derived and transformed data are provided as follows.  Treatment duration of study drug exposure in days will be derived as:  Duration = date of the last dose - date of the first dose + 1  S tudy day will be derived as follows: - If the date of interest occurs on or after the randomization date: Study day = date of interest – randomization date + 1"

Other non-diary data, such as IGA, EASI, BSA, SCORAD, GISS, POEM, DLQI, HADS, EQ5D, missed work/school day, vital signs, body weight, clinical laboratory assessments will be analyzed according to actual scheduled visits. For efficacy and safety data (except clinical laboratory assessments), where two or more assessments (include both scheduled and unscheduled assessments) are available for the same visit interval, the one closest to the target visit date will be used for the summary and analyses. For clinical laboratory assessments, if repeated measurements are taken for either time point (scheduled visit), then the last measurement will be used for the value for that time point. 6.7.2. Unscheduled Assessments Unsche duled assessments (laboratory data, ECG or vital signs associated with non-protocol clinical visits or obtained in the course of investigating or managing AEs) will be included in listings, but not in summaries. 6.7.3. Visit Re-mapping Asse ssment reported in End of treatment (EOT) blinded or open-label visits for early discontinued subjects only will be mapped to the next closest scheduled visit according to protocol (Table 2 or 3). Some assessments follow the midpoint algorithm visits re-mapping while others do not. 6.7.3.1. Algorithm The ‘ midpoint algorithm’ was used as per scheduled protocol visit for the corresponding assessment as per SoA (protocol Table2 and Table3). Find the mid-point between two scheduled protocol visits. If the date of assessment is before the mid-point, map to the earlier visit; otherwise map to the later visit. Unless, the earlier scheduled protocol visit is present, then map it to the next scheduled protocol visit. The different assessments as per their scheduled protocol visits (SoA) are presented:  DLQI, PATIENT-ORIENTED ECZEMA MEASURE, EQ-5D-3L, HADS, GLOBAL IND IVIDUAL SIGNS SCORE, INVESTIGATOR'S GLOBAL ASSESSMENT FOR SKIN LESIONS, BODY SURFACE AREA IN ATOPIC DERMATITIS, ECZEMA AREA AND SEVERITY INDEX, SCORING OF ATOPIC DERMATITIS  VS, PE  LB  GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE  GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF TREATMENT  ASSESSMENT OF SICK LEAVE OR MISSED SCHOOL DAYS  IS (Immunogenicity)"

The midpoint between Week 12 Day 85 and Week 16 Day 113 is (113+85)/2=99. If we have x<99 then we will map it to week12 Day 85; if we have x>=99 then we will map it to week 16 Day 113. Since 96<99 so we will remap it to week 12 for EASI. Unless, the earlier scheduled protocol visit is present (week 12), then map it to the next scheduled protocol visit (week 16). For ACQ, SNOT (CHRONIC RHINITIS/RHINOSINUSITIS) and ECG assessments, midpoint algorithm will not be used since these assessments only have Day1 and Day113 protocol scheduled visits. PK domain will also not use midpoint algorithm because they are not by visits but are by time point (Table 8 of the protocol). End of Study Visit is assigned as “Day 463 (Week 66)” for completers. Early discontinued subjects will not be re-mapped.

Add one week by 7 days. 6.8. Handling of Missing Data 6.8.1. Missing Primary and Secondary Endpoints To test the robustness of Mixed-effect Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) model for the primary endpoint, sensitivity analyses using tipping point approach will be conducted. In addition, the primary endpoint will be analyzed using the complete dataset (patients who"

To assess the robustness of the results in the Part 2 of the study, the primary endpoint analysis using sensitivity analyses tipping point and complete dataset will be conducted excluding subjects who withdraw from the study or miss 2 or more consecutive doses prior to Week 16 or miss any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16 due to the pandemic. Sensitivity Analyses using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method and Observed Data approach will be used for key secondary endpoints (EASI-75 and IGA), analyzed using CMH test. Also, the sensitivity analyses for key secondary endpoints will be conducted on the subjects not impacted by the pandemic. 6.8.2. Missing Start and Stop Dates for Prior and Concomitant Medication For t he purpose of inclusion in prior and/or concomitant medication tables, incomplete medication starts and stop dates will be imputed as follows:  If year and month are present and day is missing, then set day to first day of month for star t date and set day to last day of month for end date.  If year and day are present and month is missing, then set month to January for start date, and set month to December for end date.  If year is present and month and day are missing, then set month and day to January 1 for start date and set month and day to December 31 for end date.  Completely missing date will not be imputed. The partial dates will be provided as such in the subject data listings (with the imputed dates). When imputing a start date, ensure that the new imputed date is sensible i.e. it is before the end date of prior and concomitant medications. 6.8.3. Missing Start and Stop Dates for Adverse Events Due dil igence will be done to obtain accurate AE information. If all planned methods to obtain accurate time AE information have failed, missing and partial AE onset and end dates will be imputed. Imputed dates will be flagged in the individual supportive subject listings. Unless otherwise specified, the following conventions will be used: Missing and Partial AE onset dates:  If onset date is completely missing, then onset date is set to date of first dose.  If onset year is present and - month and day are missing:  If onset year = year of first dose, then set onset date to date of first dose.  If onset year < year of first dose, then set onset month and day to December 31st.  If onset year > year of first dose, then set onset month and day to January 1st. - month is missing:  If onset year = year of first dose, then set onset date to date of first dose.  If onset year < year of first dose, then set onset month to December."

Summaries of subject disposition will be presented by treatment arm and over-all as follows:  Number and percentage of subjects randomized  Num ber and percentage of subjects completed during the blinded treatment phase  Number and percentage of subjects completed during open-label phase  Number and percentage of subjects discontinued from the study and reasons during the blinded treatment phase  Number and percentage of subjects discontinued from the study and reasons during open-l abel phase  Number and percentage of subjects who withdrew early from the follow-up period of the study (i ncluding reasons for early withdrawal)  By-subject listings of enrollment details (last contact date, reason of screened failure), randomization details (randomization number, planned arm, stratification IGA, region), visit dates, and withdrawal details (including reason for discontinuation and duration of treatment prior to discontinuation) will also be provided. 7.2. Screen Failures The number and percentage of subjects who were screened for the study (enrolled subjects, i.e., those who signed informed consent) and reasons for screen failure will be summarized. 7.3. Protocol Deviations Deviations from the protocol including violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed as ‘minor’ or ‘major.’ Major protocol deviations are defined as those deviations from the protocol that are likely to have an impact on the subject’s right, safety, well-being, and/or the validity of the data for analysis. Minor deviations include all deviations from the protocol excluding those considered as major. The impact of major protocol deviations on the efficacy and/or safety results will be investigated by assessing the robustness of the study results and conclusions to the choice of analysis population (see Section 6.5), both including and excluding data pot entially affected by major protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations that will lead to the exclusion of a subject from the PPS will be identified. The final determination of major protocol deviations and the exclusion of subjects from each of the analysis populations will be made prior to database lock. Latest PD specification will be followed. Major protocol deviations may include:  Subjects who did not satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria that may have a significant infl uence on efficacy."

All restrictions on the medications listed in Table 5 in the protocol are applicable for the entire duration of the study. Other concomitant medication that the subject receives on a regular basis may continue, if in the opinion of the Investigator, it does not put the subject at undue risk or does not interfere with the study medications. Rescue treatment may be given for AD (drug or phototherapy or both) based on the opinion of the Investigator, subjects who receive topical rescue treatment (such as topical corticosteroid (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI), crisaborole, or phototherapy) may continue study treatment after appropriate washout. The following information must be recorded in the EDC system for each concomitant medication: preferred name or trade name, route of administration, start date, stop date, dose level, total daily dose, and indication. Any changes in the dosage or regimen of a concomitant medication must be recorded in the EDC system. Medications will be assigned to a time period (prior and/or concomitant) as follows:  If both the start and stop date exist and are before the first dose date of study drug, the medication will be counted as prior.  If the start date is on or after the first dose date of study drug, the medication will be counte d as concomitant."

EFFICACY ANALYSES The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted for all subjects in the FAS using the treatment arm as assigned. For the primary and key secondary endpoints, the efficacy analysis will be also be performed using the PPS. Line Plots / bar charts will be presented for IGA, EASI and SCORAD. Part 1 and Part 2 are two independent parts of the study protocol and will therefore be analyzed separately. That is, upon completion of the double-blind period of Part 1, the database will be partially locked. The data will be analyzed and the TLR will be determined. Similar activities will take place upon the completion of the double-blind period of Part 2. 8.1. General Considerations Data collected in the blinded treatment phase will be used for all efficacy analyses.  All tests will be 2-sided and at the 5% level of significance unless otherwise stated.  All endpoints will be summarized over time, by treatment, as appropriate.  All endpoints will also be listed by treatment and subject.  The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be based on FAS."

Testing Statistical Assumptions Including Comparability at Baseline All baseline data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. No formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. Differences may occur by chance. If there are any clinically meaningful differences identified, analyses may be adjusted to account for these imbalances through inclusion of additional covariates in the statistical models. 8.3. Statement of the Null and Alternate Hypotheses The following null hypothesis and alternative will be tested for each ISB 830 group and the placebo group. H0: There is no treatment difference between ISB 830 and placebo Ha: There is a treatment difference between ISB 830 and placebo. Disease severity and region will be the 2 prognostic stratification factors for patient randomization and will be accounted for in the statistical modelling for efficacy. 8.4. Analyses on Subjects Not Impacted by the Pandemic These analyses are on the subset of subjects not impacted by the pandemic. This subset excludes subjects who withdraw from the study or miss 2 or more consecutive doses prior to Week 16 or miss any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16 due to the pandemic. This subset will be analyzed for Part 2 of the study. The primary (percentage change from baseline in EASI score at Week 16) and key secondary efficacy (EASI-75 and IGA) endpoint analyses performed on FAS and PPS will also be performed on this subset. To assess the robustness of the results in the Part 2 of the study, the primary endpoint using sensitivity analyses tipping point and complete dataset will also be conducted on this subset. 8.5. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity Not applicable. 8.6. Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint For both Part 1 and Part 2 of the study, the primary endpoint (percentage change from baseline in EASI score at Week 16) will be analyzed using MMRM."
158,page_158,"Version 6.0 Date: 21-Sep-2021 Statistical Analysis Plan Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Ichnos Sciences Confidential Page 53 of 68 For continuous primary endpoint (percent change from baseline in EASI score at Week 16), a MMRM will be used, which will account for the variance-covariance structure between visits and missing data. This model includes all schedule visits for the response variable. Early discontinuation visit will be mapped to the nearest scheduled visit of the response variable. The fixed effect factors for treatment, randomization strata (region, disease severity), visit as a categorical variable, treatment-by-visit interaction, relevant baseline value and the baseline-by- visit interaction. An unstructured (UN) covariance matrix for repeated measures within a subject will be used to model the within-subject errors in the analysis, unless there are issues related to convergence. If the UN covariance matrix leads to non-convergence, then Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) will be used to select the best covariance matrix among autoregressive, compound symmetric, and Toeplitz. The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment differences for the treatment comparisons will be presented together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), along with P-values for the treatment comparisons. The adjusted means and estimated treatment differences for the treatment comparisons (each ISB 830 group vs placebo group) will also be plotted, with corresponding 95% CIs. 8.6.1. Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint The pr imary endpoint of percent change from baseline in EASI at Week 16 will be analyzed by sensiti vity analyses using tipping point approach. It will be analyzed using the complete dataset (patients who complete the Week 16 and had EASI measurement). It will also be conducted excluding subjects who withdraw from the study or miss 2 or more consecutive doses prior to Week 16 or miss any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16 due to the pandemic. 8.6.1.1. Sensitivity Analysis – Tipping Point Approach The pr imary endpoint of percent change from baseline in EASI at Week 16 will also be analyz ed using a special application of multiple imputation (MI) of missing values known as the tipping point method. The tipping point method assesses the possibility that subjects on active drug with missing values have worse outcomes than subjects on placebo. This sensitivity analysis involves MIs and is also under the missing not at random (MNAR) assumption in which one searches for a tipping point (region) that reverses the study conclusion. This approach is iterative in nature which tests how severe departures from missing at random (MAR) must be in order to overturn conclusions from the primary analysis. If these departures from MAR in order to change the results from statistically significance (P≤0.05) to statistically insignif icance (P>0.05) are deemed to be implausible, the results will be said to be robust to the departure from MAR assumption ( Roderick J et al, 2019 ). The tipping point approach will be applied to the analysis of the endpoints using the MMRM. In the MMRM, the dependent variable is change from baseline while the covariates are treatment, randomization strata, visit (categorical variable), treatment-by-visit interaction, relevant baseline value and the baseline-by-visit interaction. The imputation will be done on the missing cases of change from baseline values for ISB830 group. Under the MNAR assumption, the imputed values for observations in ISB830 group will be adjusted directly using a shift parameter. Missing values are imputed under the assumption that the distribution of the missing observations has a lower expected value than that of the observed only by a shift parameter value. The shift parameter represents the delta which is an"
159,page_159,"Version 6.0 Date: 21-Sep-2021 Statistical Analysis Plan Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Ichnos Sciences Confidential Page 54 of 68 incremental adjustment applied to the imputed value of the percent change. If the tipping point is found to be between two increments on the given interval, a subsequent tipping point procedure will be performed using an interval on the neighborhood of the perceived tipping point finer increments for the shift parameter. We start with the delta=0 and increase the delta in increments e.g. if 0.1 is the increment then delta will be 0, 0.1, 0.2 and so on. We will stop at a delta where non-significant p value is achieved. The tipping point report (table) for each pairwise comparison will include values for the LSmeans, the 95% CI, and the p-value for each of the delta value (including 0, until p-values are no longer statistically significant. Depending on applicable increment, display around 5-10 delta values in the table including δ=0 until δ=x.x.). If no tipping point is found, the shift parameter will be made more stringent and the proces s repeated. Implementing the tipping point approach includes the following steps with the first 3 steps being the standard MI steps using SAS® 9.4: a. Generate multiple imputed data sets with a specified shift parameter that adjusts the imput ed values for observations in the active treatment groups. b. The imputed data sets are analyzed using PROC MIXED. c. Th e results are then combined for the inference using PROC MIANALYZE. d. Re peat the step (a)-(c) to obtain the p-value until the significance changes. e. I f needed, repeat the steps (a)-(d) with more stringent shift parameter applied until the di rection of the significance changes. The iteration for each value of the shift parameter will be summarized in a table where the estimated treatment differences for the treatment comparisons will be presented together with 95% CIs for the differences and P-values for the treatment comparisons. 8.6.1.2. Sensitivity Analysis – Complete Data Approach The pr imary endpoint of percent change from baseline in EASI at Week 16 will be analyzed with c omplete dataset (with no missing data) using MMRM similar to Section 8.6. The patients who complete the Week 16 and have an EASI measurement at baseline and Week 16 will be only analyzed. If a subject withdraws from the study before Week 16 or does not have EASI record at baseline or Week 16 then he will not be considered in the analyses. 8.6.1.3. Sensitivity Analysis – Subjects Not Impacted by the Pandemic To assess the robustness of the results in the Part 2 of the study, the analyses on primary endpoint using MMRM will also be conducted excluding subjects who withdraw from the study or miss 2 or more consecutive doses prior to Week 16 or miss any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16 due to the pandemic. Additionally, Tipping point and Complete Data approach will be also analyzed on the subjects not impacted by the pandemic. 8.7. Analyses of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  Proportion of subjects with EASI-75 (75% improvement from baseline) at Week 16 (key secondary endpoint) – Binary variable"

The analyses will be based on the stratified Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) test where randomization strata (region, disease severity) will be used as stratification variables. Pairwise treatment comparisons will be made based on the CMH test using the P-value for the general association. The odd ratio and associated confidence interval based on Wald test will be provided. The subjects with both IGA 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale) and IGA reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at Week 16 will be consid ered as Responders. Any subject w ho receives protocol-specified rescue medication during the blinded treatment period or withdraws from the study before Week 16, will be considered a Non-Responder. Also, any subject who is missing a Week 16 efficacy assessment will be considered a Non-Responder. The key secondary endpoint EASI-75 will be analyzed similarly. For all other binary endpoints Pruritus NRS and EASI-50, the efficacy analysis will also use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted by randomization strata (region, disease severity) to analyze the categorical secondary endpoints. The FAS will be used for these analyses. The PPS will be used to assess the robustness of the results from the key secondary endpoint (EASI-75 and IGA, respectively). The continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the MMRM model similar to primary endpoint."

Sensitivity Analyses of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Sensi tivity analyses using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method and Observed Data approach will be performed to analyze the key secondary endpoints of IGA and EASI-75. It will also be conducted excluding subjects who withdraw from the study or miss 2 or more consecutive doses prior to Week 16 or miss any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16 due to the pandemic. 8.7.1.1. Sensitivity Analysis – LOCF Approach For t he binary secondary endpoints, the efficacy data will be set to missing after rescue medication is used or subject withdrawal before Week 16. The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method will be used as a sensitivity analysis to determine the status of subjects at Week 16 after censoring for the use of rescue medication or for study withdrawal. This analysis will be conducted to assess the robustness of the secondary endpoints’ analyses for IGA and EASI-75 regarding handling of missing data. For subjects who received a rescue medication for atopic dermatitis (AD) during the blinded treatment period, any assessments present after rescue medication are set to missing, and their last available assessment on or before the rescue medication will be used for imputation. For subjects who did not receive a rescue medication for atopic dermatitis (AD) during the blinded treatment period, and who had missing Week 16 assessment or withdrew before Week 16, their last available assessment before Week 16 will be used for imputation. 8.7.1.2. Sensitivity Analysis – Observed Data Approach The ke y secondary endpoints of EASI-75 and IGA will be analyzed using the Observed Data approach by CMH test. All observed data, regardless if rescue medication for atopic dermatitis (AD) during the blinded treatment period was received will be included. Any subject who had missing Week 16 assessment or who withdrew before Week 16 will be considered as Non- Responder. 8.7.1.3. Sensitivity Analysis – Subjects Not Impacted by the Pandemic To assess the robustness of the results in the Part 2 of the study, the analyses on secondary endpoints (IGA, EASI-75) using CMH test will also be conducted excluding subjects who withdraw from the study or miss 2 or more consecutive doses prior to Week 16 or miss any part of the primary endpoint assessments at Week 16 due to the pandemic. 8.8. Impact-benefit of treatment at follow-up Impact-benefit of treatment at follow-up will be evaluated for primary and key secondary efficacy assessments at EOS. Descriptive statistics will be presented for the percentage change from baseline in EASI score, EASI-75 and IGA for completers and non-completers/early discontinued subjects.

PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES PK analyses will be conducted based on PKAS for the blinded treatment phase. An overview of blood sampling time points for the rich PK group and the sparse PK group is provided in Tables 2 in the protocol. Serum concentrations of ISB830 will be quantified using a validated ELISA method. The PK parameters derived using non-compartmental techniques will be regarded as primary endpoints for the PK analyses. Primary inference for all the PK parameters will be based on the PKAS population. 9.1. Presentation of PK Data, Descriptive Statistics and PK Assessment PK serum concentration data will be listed by group (rich vs. sparse), treatment, subject, day and actual elapsed time point relative to first dosing and immediate dosing event for serum data. Serum concentrations will be summarized by treatment, day and nominal time point. The following descriptive statistics will be presented for serum concentrations obtained at each nominal time point: n, arithmetic mean, SD, coefficient of variation (%CV), geometric mean, median, minimum and maximum values, where %CV = 100 × SD mean ⁄ .

Handling of Values Below the Limit of Quantification All serum concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) or missing data will be labeled as below the limit of quantification (BLQ) or missing, respectively, in the concentration data listings. BLQ values for the generation of serum PK parameters and for plotting of individual serum PK concentration data will be imputed in the PK concentration dataset used for the derivation of PK parameters. The following rules will be applied:  BLQs at the beginning of a subject profile (i.e., before the first incidence of a measurable concentration on the first day of dosing) will be assigned to zero;  BLQs at the end of a subject profile (i.e., after the last incidence of a measurable concentration on last day of dosing) will be set to missing;  Single or consecutive BLQs which fall between measurable concentrations will be set to miss ing.  Quantifiable concentrations falling between 2 BLQ values might be set to missing if conside red anomalous by the pharmacokineticist after consultation with the Sponsor. For linear plots, zero concentration value(s) will be included in the plot while missing values will be ignored. For log-linear plots, zero concentration value(s) will be assigned a ½ LLOQ value with the exception of the predose sample collected on Day 1 while missing concentrations at the end of the profile will be ignored. BLQ values for summarizing serum PK concentration data will be imputed for mean concentration-time plots and tabular summaries according to the following rules:"

The number of subjects contributing to the calculation of the mean will be specified in a footnote to the mean plots (both in linear and semi-log scales) if lower than the total amount of samples available per time point; A high proportion of BLQ values may affect derivation of SD; if more than 30% of values at a time-point are imputed, then SD will not be displayed. Tabular summaries for concentration-time data will report N (number of subjects who received treatment), n (number of subjects with non-missing values) and, if applicable, number imputed (number of subjects with imputed values (i.e., BLQ assigned zero concentration). 10. SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY 10.1. Overall Summary of Tolerability The safety analyses will be based on the SAS. Safety will be assessed by evaluating AEs, SAEs, treatment related AEs and SAEs, anaphylactic events, injection site reactions, vital signs, physical examinations, ECG values, and laboratory test results. 10.1.1. Pandemic Related Safety Assessments To ensur e the ongoing safety of subjects during the pandemic, study subjects who miss or are unable to attend scheduled clinic visits will be contacted by the site via a safety phone call that includes the collection of AEs/SAEs and concomitant medications. This phone call is to be performed for every missed visit that occurs during the pandemic. If the subject meets other criteria, eg, for withdrawal/discontinuation of the study drug, the site is to follow the protocol in regard to those criteria. Subject withdrawal/discontinuation criteria are outlined in protocol Section 8.3. 10.2. Adverse Event Preferred Term and Body/Organ System Summary Tables 10.2.1.

Immunogenicity Analyses The immunogenicity (IM) analyses will be based on the FAS, unless otherwise specified. Blood sample (5 mL each) will be collected at appropriate time points defined in Tables 2 and Table 3 in the protocol, to detect the presence of ADA to ISB830. Antibodies generated against ISB830 will be detected and confirmed using a validated Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method. The objectives include the following:  To evaluate sample IM status [confirmed positive/negative or unevaluable and, when applicable, titer of ADA] during treatment or placebo in all evaluable subjects  To evaluate confirmed positive ADA subjects for neutralizing antibody status  To evaluate potential relationships of IM with key efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic measures  Definitions for subject IM results below are provided as a reference: 1. Positive ADA response: Total of Treatment-Emergent and Treatment-boosted A DA in a cohort 2. Positive Nab response: At least one post baseline measurement classified as neutralizing positive 3. Treatment-Emergent ADA: Treatment-Emergent ADA incidence refers to percentage of the total number of evaluable subjects that were ADA-negative at baseline but developed antibodies following biologic drug administration. 4. Treatment boosted ADA: Percentage of the total number of evaluable subjects that were ADA positive at baseline with at least fourfold increase in ADA titer after biologic drug administration are considered for computing treatment boosted ADA incidence."

Persistent ADA: Treatment-Emergent positive ADA detected at 2 or more consec utive sampling time points during the treatment or follow up period, where the first and last ADA positive samples are separated by a period of at least 16 weeks. Also, ADA detected only in the last sampling time point of the study. 6. Transient ADA: Any positive ADA response not considered persistent. Trea tment-induced ADA detected at two or more sampling time points during the treatment (including follow-up period if any), where the first and last ADA- positive samples (irrespective of any negative samples in between) are separated by a period less than 16 weeks, and the subject’s last sampling time point is ADA-negative. 7. ADA-positive subject: A subject with at least one treatment-induced or treatment-boosted ADA-positive sample at any time during the treatment or follow-up observation period. 8. ADA-negative subject: A subject without a treatment induced or treatment- boosted ADA-positive sample during the treatment or follow-up observation period. A subject who tested ADA positive result in only the predose sample with ADA negative result in the time points following drug administration. 9. ADA-inconclusive subject: A subject who cannot clearly be classified as ADA- negat ive. A subject tested ADA negative at all-time points post drug administration with circulating drug concentration greater than the drug tolerance of the immunogenicity assay will be flagged and will not be considered for computation of overall ADA. 10. Evaluable subject: A subject with at least 1 sample taken after drug admi nistration during the treatment or follow-up observation period that is appropriate for ADA testing (with reportable result). Only evaluable subjects are considered for computing treatment-induced ADA incidence. 11. Non-evaluable subject: A subject without a single sample taken (or without a repor table result) after drug administration during the treatment or follow-up observation period. However, whereas such a subject is excluded from treatment- emergent immunogenicity analyses, this subject ought to be included in the reporting of pre-existing ADA if the baseline sample had a reportable result. Sample IM results (confirmed positive/negative or unevaluable) during treatment with study drug (treatment or placebo) will be listed by treatment, time point and dose. Subject IM results will be listed by treatment and dose for all evaluable patients, which will include but may not be limited to: subject IM status (positive, negative or unknown), the study day associated with the first positive IM status (T first, i.e., onset of ADA development) and the last positive IM status observed (T last). The overall treatment and post-treatment evaluation period, as well as subject IM incidence and incidence rate, will be determined and appropriately summarized by treatment, as the total number of and percentage of evaluated subjects with IM negative, positive, and unknown status. Furthermore, onset, titer overtime, and peak titer of the ADA response, if applicable, will be"

PK endpoints (C max and AUC 0-tau) will be stratified by IM status of subject (i.e., IM positive, negative, unknown) from the rich PK group and C trough values will also be stratified by IM status using data from both rich and sparse PK groups. In addition to PK assessments, key efficacy and safety assessments may also be further stratified by IM status of subjects and presented in tables and/or graphically. 10.3. Treatment Compliance The study drug compliance will be evaluated according to volume of injections during treatment period: [total volume injected during exposure period /total volume planned study drug injections during exposure period] × 100. Subjects with a compliance rate between 80% and 100% are considered as compliant with study drug during their participation in the study. Proportion of subjects considered as compliant with study drug will be summarized. 10.4. Concomitant and Other Medications Concomitant medications and rescuer medications (such as TCS, TCI, crisaborole or phototherapy) will be coded using the most recent version of WHODD available in EDC at the time of analysis. Medication will be summarized by ATC level 2, level 3, and preferred name in frequency tables. All concomitant medications taken since screening until the end of the study will be listed by treatment and subject. 10.5. Laboratory Data Baseline and post-baseline clinical laboratory data (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis) will be obtained at the visits designated on the protocol Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 in the protocol). Descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) will be presented for laboratory data as well as change from baseline by treatment and visit. In addition, values outside the respective normal range will be listed. Anaphylactic events will be assessed by the Investigator based on guidance given in the protocol; Injection site reactions will be assessed according to the CTCAE v4.03. The number"
172,page_172,"Version 6.0 Date: 21-Sep-2021 Statistical Analysis Plan Protocol Number: GBR 830-204 Ichnos Sciences Confidential Page 67 of 68 and percentage of subjects reporting at least one occurrence of anaphylactic event will be summarized. For quantitative laboratory measurements descriptive statistics will be used to summarize results and change from baseline by treatment group and time point. The number of subjects with values normal range and outside the respective normal range will be tabulated by treatment group. Shift in laboratory test relative to normal ranges from baseline will also be tabulated. Line Plots and bar charts will be presented. All laboratory data will be listed by treatment and subject. If any laboratory value falls above or below the upper or lower level of quantification, the value of the upper or lower level of quantification will be taken (e.g. <0.2 will become 0.2) for summaries but left as recorded in the listing. 10.6. Vital Signs Vital sign measurements (i.e., systolic and diastolic blood pressure [mmHg], pulse rate [beats per minute], respiratory rate [breaths per minute], oral or tympanic temperature [degrees in Celsius]) will be obtained at the visits designated on the protocol Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 in the protocol) by standard methods. Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured after the subject has been supine for 5 minutes. Height [cm], weight [kg] and BMI (kg/m2) will also be recorded at Screening Visit. Descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) will be used to summarize vital sign results and changes from baseline by treatment group and time. All vital sign data will be displayed in listings. Shift tables will present changes from baseline (categorized as normal; abnormal) to end-of- treatment. The shift tables will be done only for SBP and DBP. The groups for SBP will be Normal < 140, Abnormal ≥140 and DBP will be Normal < 90, Abnormal ≥90. All vi tal sign data will be listed by treatment and subject. 10.7. Electrocardiogram Baseline and post-baseline electrocardiograms (12-lead ECG) will be obtained at the visits designated on the protocol Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 in the protocol). Subjects must be in a supine or recumbent position for a period of 5 minutes prior to the ECG. The parameters to be reported are heart rate, RR interval (RR), PR Interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and corrected QT (QTc) interval (QTcF and QTcB). The absolute values and the change from baseline for ECG parameters will be summarized. An outlier analysis of ECG results will be conducted. All ECG variables will be presented by visit. Descriptive statistics for ECG parameters and changes from baseline will be presented by treatment group. Shift tables will present changes from baseline in ECG interpretation (categorized as normal; abnormal) to end-of-treatment. All ECG data will be listed by treatment and subject."

Physical Examination Baseline and post-baseline physical examinations will be performed at the visits designated on the protocol Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 in the protocol). A comprehensive physical examination will include HEENT, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, musculoskeletal system, skin (non-atopic dermatitis related), gastrointestinal system, genitourinary system, and brief neurological examination. Urogenital and anorectal exams are optional. Sign/symptom- directed examination might be performed as per the Investigator’s discretion. Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) will be used to summarize physical examination results by body system, treatment group and visit. All physical examination data will be listed by treatment and subject. 11. REFERENCES 1. Roderick J. A. Little, Donald B.
