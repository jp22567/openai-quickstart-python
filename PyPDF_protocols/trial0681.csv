Study Multicenter Observational Prospective study Title PRO spective multicenter observational study on Elective Pelvic nodes (PRO-EPI ) Irradiation in Patients with intermediate/high/very high risk prostate cancer submitted to adjuvant or radical Ra diotherapy with or without concomitant Androgen Deprivation. Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common male malig nancy all over the word causing some concerns for public health. In It aly prostate cancer is in the third place of the cancer mortality scale (8% o f all cancer related deaths) even if a constant, though moderate, annual decreas e (-1.8%) has been observed for over twenty years as well as a consequ ent increase in overall survival. Despite these data, still now, in the pos t PSA era, current estimates indicate that high-risk disease accounts for 15% of all PCa diagnoses in the United States and even more in the low-PSA screenin g regions. Radiotherapy for prostate cancer: some open questio ns Several modalities, alone and/or in combination, ha ve been advocated to treat patients with intermediate/high/very high risk PCa, but universally accepted consensus guidelines are still lacking. Mounting ev idence supports the use of a multimodality approach to treat locally advanced prostate cancer and in particular the combination of Radiation Therapy (RT ) with Total Androgenic Deprivation (ADT); adjuvant post-surgical RT is als o needed in many cases submitted to radical prostatectomy (RP) because of unexpected extra- capsular invasion or microscopically involved margi ns. In both cases, some issues are still present regarding RT: volumes of i nterest, total dose, radiation techniques and fractionation. Elective nodal irradiation and its association with hormonal manipulation in the context of radical exclusive radiotherapy. Whether or not elective irradiation of pelvic nodes (ENI) provides any benefit over exclusive RT to prostate only, has bee n a longstanding therapeutic dilemma being still now increasingly di scussed in the modern radiotherapy scenario. Data obtained from internati onal literature are still controversial and ENI is not clearly linked to rele vant advantages in terms of overall survival (OS) according to the few randomiz ed clinical trials available and to recent reviews particularly if Whole Pelvic Radiation Therapy (WPRT) is associated with ADT. Neoadjuvant (NHT), concomitant, or adjuvant (AHT) androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is recommended for selected men with unfavourable intermediate-risk or high risk disease. Long-term A DT is indicated in patients with a high/very high risk of disease recu rrence and typically consists of NHT plus RT followed by AHT (for 2-3 ye ars) Conversely, the addition of RT to ADT is related to a significant reduction of cause-specific and all-cause mortality (OS) in comparison with exc lusive systemic treatments. Elective nodal irradiation (ENI) and evolving treat ment techniques Modern technologies contributed to a larger diffusi on of ENI after a period during which this practice was almost abandoned due to its worse toxicity"
4,page_4,"Final Version 1.0 – 18/01/2016 5 profile. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMR T) may allow to treat larger volumes with better sparing of organs at ris k (OARs). Other different techniques can also been used to obtain these resul ts, however, there is no consensus in the literature on the superiority of a ny of these techniques in terms of tumor control and toxicity reduction. Radi ation-induced toxicity is most often associated with high total and daily dos e, short recovery time, and a larger amount of normal tissues included in the h igh dose regions. Data suggest that even in prostate-only RT, toxicity to OARs is more prevalent in the “high-dose” group. Acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) complications were however more frequently reported in patients treated with WPRT than in those receiving PORT, possibly due to “old” radiation techniques and less sophisticated dosimetric elabor ation. Elective nodal irradiation in the context of postop erative treatments Adjuvant RT after RP reduces the risk of PSA failur e of about 50% (thus ameliorating biochemical relapse free survival- bRF S) in pN0 patients with pT3-T4 disease, positive surgical margins (R+), als o without any association with ADT, and seems to increase survival, particula rly metastasis free survival. Patients with negative lymph nodes, but unfavorable prognostic factors such as positive surgical margins, extracap sular involvement (pT3a) and/or seminal vesicles infiltration (pT3b) are the refore recommended to undergo adjuvant RT. In patients with severe post- surgical side effects (urinary incontinence, persistent bleeding) intensi ve follow up followed by salvage RT at the time of biochemical relapse repre sents an alternative choice for patients with severe post-surgical side effects (such as urinary incontinence, persistent bleeding). In the adjuvant setting, sterilizing microscopic di sease potentially persistent after radical surgery, particularly in high-risk pa tients, represents the rationale of adding WPRT to prostatic bed radiother apy in pN0 patients. Goldner et al. evaluated the clinical impact of pro state only adjuvant RT in pN0 patients showing a 5-year biochemical relapse f ree survival of 100% and 58% in patients with a risk of nodal involvemen t <15% and >15%, respectively. These findings may be explained by a microscopic involvement of pelvic structures (lymph nodes, bone) other than prostate bed. However, the role of adjuvant post-surgical WPRT need to be validated by large prospective studies, not actually ongoing to our kn owledge. Moreover, no clear-cut guidelines are available about the useful ness of adding ADT to adjuvant RT in the different subsets of pN0 patient s. On the other hand, nodal involvement (pN1) is a str ong negative prognostic factor and adjuvant RT in these patients may be use ful to optimize loco- regional control deferring first or second line sys temic therapies . The standard adjuvant treatment for pN1 PCa patients is represented by long term ADT, but the association with WPRT might significan tly increase survival outcomes . Rationale Open questions are still needed to be answered: - In the exclusive radiotherapy scenario, does ENI pr oduce an overall or biochemical relapse free survival advantage over prostate only radiotherapy for intermediate/high/very high-risk c ases? - If ADT is added to prostate only radiotherapy, in intermediate/high/very high-risk cases, ENI is any longer needed?"

Study design This is a prospective, multicenter, observational c ohort study aimed to describe the advantage/disadvantage of different tr eatments of patients with intermediate/high/very high risk prostate cancer, t hrough a web-based database. The study will include all consecutive patients affected by intermediate, high or very high-risk prostate cancer that fit to the inclusion criteria and who are evaluated at each Centre involved in the st udy . Patients may have already undergone or not to radical prostatect omy and/or pelvic lymphadenectomy. Phase 1: Establishment of the network of Centers in volved in the study Phase 2: Activation and recruitment of eligible cas es Phase 3: Follow-up (1,3,6,12/18,24/30/36 months) Statistical considerations Sample size From previous experiences of the AIRO Prostate Canc er Study Group (AIRO PCSG), at least 15-20 Radiotherapy Centers from dif ferent regions of the country will be able to participate to the study. I t is conceivable an accrual of at least 400-500 patients within 2 years and a furt her follow up of at least 3 years for each patient. For intermediate and high r isk patients, an overall survival at 5 years of 0.8 has been previously repo rted (RTOG 94-13). According to the primary end-pint of the study, a s ample size of 400 patients will allow to estimate a 5-year survival of 0.8 wit h 95% confidence interval of 0.76-0.84. Statistical Analyses In order to describe the data, mean and standard de viation will be used for normally distributed continuous variables, median a nd ranges for non- normally distributed continuous variables, proporti ons and percentages for"

Differences between two-sample central tendencies will be assessed with a two independent sample t-test or Ma nn-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon, depending on distribution of the continuo us variable. Analysis of variance and covariance and regression models will be used for evaluating the associations of some variables with survival taking account of possible confounders. In order to compare groups in terms of survival end -points, Kaplan-Meier curves will be estimated and log-rank tests will be performed.

In Italy prostate cancer is in the third place of the cancer mortality scale (8% of all cancer relat ed deaths) even if a constant, though moderate, annual decrease (-1.8%) has been observed for over twenty years [3] as well as a consequent increase in overall survival [4] .

In fact, in the radical setting, the addition of ADT to RT (but not to RP) is linked to a surviv al benefit in men with intermediate- or high risk disease acco rding to Level I evidence; to date, however, it remains unclear whether this benefit is driven by a n effect on micro metastatic disease in the pelvic lymph nodes and/or bones, by hormonal radio sensiti zation of the primary tumour, or by some combination thereof [16, 17, 18, 19] . Consequently, neoadjuvant (NHT), concomitant, or ad juvant"
9,page_9,"Final Version 1.0 – 18/01/2016 10 (AHT) androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is recomme nded for selected men with unfavourable intermediate-risk or high risk disease. Long-term A DT is indicated in patients with a high/very high risk of disease recurrence and typically consists o f NHT plus RT followed by AHT (for 2-3 years) [20, 21, 22, 23] . Conversely, the addition of RT to ADT is related to a significant reduction of cause-specific and all-cause mortality (OS) in comp arison with exclusive systemic treatments [24, 25]. Elective nodal irradiation and evolving treatment t echniques Modern technologies contributed to a larger diffusi on of ENI after a period during which this practice was almost abandoned due to its worse toxi city profile. The larger diffusion of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) may allow to tre at larger volumes with better sparing of organs at risk (OARs). Modern techniques can also obtain better conformal dose distributions and include static fields (“step-and-shoot”) intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), dynamic fields (“sliding-window”) IMRT, and, more recently, volume tric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and helical tomotherapy (Tomotherapy ®). However, there is no consensus in the literature on the superiority of any of these techniques in terms of tumor control and toxicity reduction. Radiation- induced toxicity is most often associated with high total and daily dose, short recovery time, and a larger amount of normal tissues included in the hig h dose regions. Data suggest that even in prostate-only RT, toxicity to OARs is more prevalen t in the “high-dose” group [26, 27] . Acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) compli cations were however more frequently reported in patients treated with WPRT than in those receivi ng PORT, possibly due to “old” radiation techniques and less sophisticated dosimetric elabor ation [28, 29] . Due to its improved ability in bowel sparing, IMRT may be an effective tool to red uce the risk of toxicities during WPRT [30, 31, 32, 33] . Kaidar-Person and colleagues' review [34], summarizes the main international studies on WPRT. Elective nodal irradiation in the context of postop erative treatments Adjuvant RT after RP reduces the risk of PSA failure of about 50% (thus ameliorating biochemical relapse free survival- bRFS) in pN0 patients with p T3-T4 disease, positive surgical margins (R+), also without any association with ADT, and seems to increase survival, particularly metastasis free survival [35] . Patients with negative lymph nodes, but unfavorable prognostic factors such as positive surgical margins, extracapsular involvemen t (pT3a) and/or seminal vesicles infiltration (pT3b) are therefore recommended to undergo adjuvan t RT.

Actually, the standard adjuvant treatment for pN1 P Ca patients is represented by long term ADT, but the association w ith WPRT might significantly increase survival outcomes [42]. A recent analysis conducted by SEER on “pN1 M0” PCa patients treated with adjuvant WPRT seems to confirm the benefit obtained by the association of WPRT with ADT, demonstrating a survival advantage for intermediate risk patients [43] . Conclusions, rationale and summary of the study In conclusion, open questions about ENI for prostat e cancer still remain: 1. In the exclusive radiotherapy scenario, does ENI pr oduce an overall or biochemical relapse free survival advantage over prostate only radiothe rapy for intermediate/high/very high risk cases? 2. If ADT is added to prostate only radiotherapy, in i ntermediate/high/very high risk cases, ENI is any longer needed?"

How many Radiation Oncology centers use ENI to trea t patients with intermediate/high/very high-risk prostate cancer, with or without ADT? We propose a no-profit, multicenter observational s tudy to collect data of consecutive patients treated with ENI both in the exclusive radical radi otherapy scenario and in the adjuvant postsurgical setting.

Toxicity and response evaluation The enrolled patients will undergo the first follow up visit one month after the end of radiotherapy. On that occasion, clinical examination will be perf ormed and previously prescribed blood tests, if required, will be evaluated. Genitourinary and gast rointestinal toxicity due to radiation therapy for prostate cancer will be reported according to the N CI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 for adverse event (AE) rep orting. The CTCAE version 4 is identified and located on the CTEP web site at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electron ic_applications/ctc.htm [48] In addition, a Case Report Form (CRF) will be compl eted (see Attachment 2), regarding: • Technical characteristics of the radiation treatmen t (dose, volume, technique, association or not with hormonal therapy); • Quality of life and complications due to prostate c ancer (according to Italian UCLA- PCI) [45, 46]; • General quality of life (SF-12 Standard V1) [47]. Thereafter patients will be evaluated at 3-months, 6-months and 12-months after the end of radiotherapy, and then every 6 months for at least 24 months. During all those scheduled follow up visits, PSA level (jointly with testosterone, in ca se of association with hormonal therapy) and"
17,page_17,"Final Version 1.0 – 18/01/2016 18 previously prescribed blood texts if required, will be evaluated. Patients will undergo clinical examination, and genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity will be assessed according to the CTCAE v4.0 classification scale). In addition, a CR F (see Attachment 3) will be completed at each visit, regarding: • Survival status (mortality, date and cause of death ) or exit from the study; • If macroscopical recurrence or disease progression occurred, the radiological exams (if performed); • Further treatments received/planned after radiother apy; • The last available PSA; • Quality of life and complications due to prostate c ancer (Italian UCLA-PCI) [45, 46]; • General quality of life (SF-12 Standard V1) [47]. The Italian UCLA-PCI and SF-12 Standard V1 question naires reported in Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 [45, 46, 47] will be given by the referring physician and self-c ompiled by patients in physician's absence, eventually with the help of a nurse if necessary; thereafter, the referring physician will insert the data to the database. Data Collection, Confidentiality Data will be collected through an ad hoc web based software, built to guarantee: 1. Respect of the Italian laws and of the internati onal rules about GMP and privacy, according also to the general principles fixed by the Helsinki dec laration and its subsequent updates; 2. The anonymization of the patient records; 3. The possibility for each participating Center to have unrestricted access to its own data; 4. The restriction of the access to the full datase t composed by the sum of the records provided by the sin gle Centers; this will be allowed only after the au thorization of the PI and the Study Coordinator. Once the study will be completed, acce ss to the whole database will be possible only after having obtained the authorization of the AIRO President in charge and of the AIRO Board; 5.

Statistical Considerations Sample size From previous experiences of the AIRO PCSG [49, 50] , at least 15-20 Radiotherapy Centers from different regions of the country will be able to pa rticipate to the study. It is conceivable an accru al of at least 400-500 patients within 2 years and a f urther follow up of at least 3 years for each patient. For intermediate and high risk patients, a n overall survival at 5 years of 0.8 has been previously reported (RTOG 94-13) [51]. According to the primary end-point of the study, a sample size of 400 patients will allow to estimate a 5-yea r survival of 0.8 with 95% confidence interval of 0.76-0.84 [ 52]. Statistical Analyses In order to describe the data, mean and standard de viation will be used for normally distributed continuous variables, median and ranges for non-nor mally distributed continuous variables, proportions and percentages for categorical variabl es. Associations between two categorical variables will be assessed through the Pearson’s ch i-squared test or Fisher test, when appropriate. Differences between two-sample central tendencies w ill be assessed with a two independent sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon, dependin g on distribution of the continuous variable. Analysis of variance and covariance and regression models will be used for evaluating the associations of some variables with survival taking account of possible confounders. In order to compare groups in terms of survival end -points, Kaplan-Meier curves will be estimated and log-rank tests will be performed. Periodical analyses are planned in order to check t he quality of entered data. The analyses will be performed by using STATA 13 (S tataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP) or S PSS Statistical Software."
