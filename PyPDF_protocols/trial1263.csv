Synopsis A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled, Double -Blind, Proof -of-Concept Study to Evaluate Guselkumab for the Treatment of Subjects with Moderate to Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa Protocol number: CNTO1959HDS2001 Guselkumab (CNTO 1959) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 lambda (IgG1λ) monoclona l antibody that binds to the p19 protein subunit of human interleukin (IL)-23 with high specificity and affinity. The binding of guselkumab to the IL-23p19 subunit blocks the binding of extracellular IL-23 to the cell surface IL-23 receptor, inhibiting IL-23-specific intracellular signaling and subsequent activation and cytokine production. Guselkumab has been studied in Phase 1, Phase 2, and ongoing Phase 3 studies for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Guselkumab has been approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in the United States, Europe ,Canada , and several other countries .Guselkumab is also being studied globally for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) , Crohn’s disease, and pedi atric psoriasis. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Objective s Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the initial efficacy, safety, and tolerability of guselkumab in adult participants with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (H S). Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of this study are: To evaluate the efficacy of guselkumab in adult participants with moderate to severe HS during the maintenance phase. To evaluate the effect of guselkumab on the dermatologic health -related quality of life in adult participants with moderate to severe HS. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics (PD)of guselkumab therapy in adult partic ipants with moderate to severe HS. Endpoints Primary Endpoint The proportion of participants achieving Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 16 Major Secondary Endpoints The change from baseline in total abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count at Week 16. The change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score at Week 16. The change from baseline in HS-related pain in the past 24 hours based on Hidradenitis Suppurativa Symptom Diary (HSSD )at Week 16."
9,page_9,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959HDS2001 10 Approved , Date: 2 May 2019Other Secondary Endpoints The proportion of participants achieving at least 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% reduction intotal AN count at Week 16. The proportion of participants achieving an AN count of 1 and 2 ,respectively, at Week 16. The proportion of participants achieving complete elimination of abscesses at Week 16 among those participants with abscesses at baseline. The change from baseline in the number of abscesses at Week 16. The chang e from baseline in HSSD symptom scale score (other than pain the past 24 hours) at Week 16. The change from baseline in HSSD total symptom score at Week 16. The proportion of participants achieving complete elimination of draining fistulas at Week 16 among those participants with draining fistulas at baseline. The change from baseline in number of draining fistulas at Week 16. The proportion of participants achieving complete elimination of inflammatory nodules at Week 16 among those participants with inflammatory nodules at baseline . The change from baseline in number of inflammatory nod ules at Week 16. The proportion of participants with HS-IGA (investigator’s global assessment) score of inactive (0), almost inactive (1), or mild activity (2) and with at least 2-grade improvement relative to baseline at Week 16. The proportion of partici pants with HS-IGA score of inactive (0) or almost inactive (1) at Week 16 among participants with HS -IGA score of moderate activity (3) or severe activity (4) at baseline. The c hange from baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores at W eek16. The change from baseline in high -sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs -CRP) at Week 16. The distribution of the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of HS severity at Week 16. Hypothes es The primary hypothesis is that guselkumab treatment is superior to placebo as assessed by the proportion of participants achieving HiSCR at Week 16. The major secondary hypotheses are that guselkumab treatment is: Superior to placebo as assessed by the change from baseline in AN count at Week 16. Superior to placebo as assessed by the improvement in patient -reported outcomes (PRO) as measured by: The change from baseline in DLQI score at Week 16. The change from baseline in HS-related pain in the past 24 hours based on HSSD at Week 16. OVERALL DESIGN This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind study evaluating the efficacy , safety , PK, and immunogenicity of subcutaneous (SC)and intravenous (IV)administered guselkumab for the treatment of moderate to severe HS in adult particip ants. The participant population will comprise men and women who have had moderate to severe HS for at least 1 year ."

Serum samples will also be collected at the final visit from participants who terminate study participation early. BIOMARKER EVALUATIONS Biomarke r assessments will include the evaluation of relevant markers in serum for all participants and will be collected at the time points presented in the Schedule of Activities . Serum samples will be analyzed for circulating factors such as cytokines and other inflammatory markers (eg, IL -17A, IL-17F, IL-23, TNFα, IL -6, IL-22), and other categories of biomarkers potentially associated with the development and progression of HS or related to the guselkumab mechanism of action. SAFETY EVALUATIONS Safety evaluatio ns conducted at each study visit will include the assessment of adverse events (AEs, at the visit and those occurring between evaluation visits), a tuberculosis evaluation and other infection assessment, clinical laboratory blood tests (complete blood coun t and serum chem istries), physical examinations, vital sign measurements , echocardiogram, suicidality assessment measured using C-SSRS , concomitant medication review, and observations for injection -site reactions, reactions temporally associated with an in fusion, and/or allergic reactions. STATISTICAL METHODS Sample Size Determination This study is designed to enroll approximately 180 participants, in order to have sufficient power achieving the primary efficacy endpoint. The assumptions for the sample size and power calculations were based on the clinical data from the 2 adalimumab (Humira ®) Phase 3 clinical studies M11 -313 (PIONEER I) and M11 -810 (PIONEER II) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in the treatment of adult participants with moderate to severe HS. With 60 participants in each of the guselkumab treatment group and 60 participants in the placebo group, there will be more than 90% power to detect a treatment differ ence of 30% between each guselkumab group and the placebo group for the primary efficacy endpoint with a significance level of 0.05. Efficacy Analyses All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention will be included in the efficacy analyses. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless of the treatment they actually received. For response efficacy endpoints, treatment comparisons will be performed using a Cochran -Mant el- Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the baseline weight (≤95 kg, >95 kg) and baseline Hurley stage (I, II, and III). For continuous efficacy endpoints, treatment comparisons will be performed using either a Mixed -Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model or an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. All of the models will have treatment group, baseline weight (≤95 kg, >95 kg), baseline Hurley stage (I, II, and III), and baseline value as explanatory factors. MMRM models will additionally include visit, treatment by visit, and baseline value by visit interaction terms. All statistical tests will be performed at a"

INTRODUCTION Guselkumab (CNTO 1959) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 lambda (IgG1λ) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to human interleukin (IL)-23 with high specificity and affinit y. The binding of guselkumab to the IL-23p19 subunit blocks the binding of extracellular IL-23 to the cell surface IL-23 receptor, inhibiting IL-23-specific intracellular signaling and subsequent activation and cytokine production. In this manner, guselkumab inhibits the biological activity of IL -23 in all in vitro assay s examined. Guselkumab has been approved in the United States , the European Union ,Canada , and several other countries for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis .Data supporting the approval of the plaque psoriasis indication in adults included safet y and efficacy data from 2,700 participants from 3 global Phase 3 studies (CNTO1959PSO3001 [VOYAGE 1], CNTO1959PSO3002 [VOYAGE 2], and CNTO1959PSO3003 [NAVIGATE]). Studies CNTO1959PSO3001 and CNTO1959PSO3 002 have ongoing long-term extensions (LTE). In addition, guselkumab is being studied globally for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) , Crohn’s disease , and pediatric psoriasis. The approved dosage in the moderate to severe adult plaque psoriasis indication is 100 mg administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection at Week 0, Week 4, and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter. Guselkumab is not currentl y approved for use for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding guselkumab , refer to the latest version of the Inv estigator's Brochure (IB) forguselkumab . The term ""sponsor"" used throughout this document refers to the entities listed in the Contact Information page(s), which will be provided as a separate document. 2.1. Study Rationale This is a proof -of-concept (POC) study to evaluate the efficacy ,safety , and tolerabilit yof guselkumab for the treatment of moderate to severe HSin adult particip antsby means of: Comparing the initial efficacy of 2dose regimens (intravenous [IV]and SC) of guselkumab to placebo Evaluating the longer -term efficacy resulting from the initial IV vs. SC dose regimens of guselkumab Collecting safety andtolerability data for guselkumab in these HS participants In addition, this study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicit y, and pharmacod ynamics (PD) of guselkumab therap y in patient swith HS."

Background Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic skin disease of unclear etiology that affects 1% to 4% of the general population .5,10,21,23HS typicall y manifests as recurrent, inflamed , tender, subcutaneous nodules that are generally restricted to the axillary , inguinal, and anogenital regions .5,10,21While some nodules resolve spontaneously , others progress to form sterile abscesses, which then rupture into the skin, leading to the formation of fistulas and sinus tracts that can spontaneousl y release purulent drainage .5,10,21Over time, chronic inflammation can lead to irreversible scarring and fibrosis, which in severe cases can result in contractures and limitations in limb mobility , especiall y in the axilla .5,10,21Disease onset is typically after pubert yand women are affected 2 to 5times more commonly than men .5,10Multiple factors including genetics, cigarette smoking, and obesity are believed to predispose a person to HS.5,23 The chronic pain, drainage ,and progressive, irreversible scarring associated with HS has been shown to have a particularly profound effect on patients’ health -related quality of life relative to other common skin disorders .23Patients with HS experience considerable impact on activities of daily living, work/school attendance and productivity , phy sical activities, and emotional state .20 Although a variet y of treatments are utilized to manage HS, including medical treatments (eg, systemic combination therapy with clindam ycin and rifampicin, tetracy clines, intralesional steroids, systemic cyclosporine, anti-androgen treatment in women, systemic dapsone, systemic retinoids and metformin)20and surgical treatments (eg, incision and drainage of active lesions, local marsupialization and deroofing procedures ,and radical excision), most have not been well studied and none appear particularl y effective. The biologic anti-TNF inhibitor adalimumab (Humira ®) has recentl y been approved to treat moderate to severe HS, but even this agent has notshown satisfactory treatment effects in many patients . Across two Phase 3 studies, the primary endpoint of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) , defined as at least 50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline,4,9was achieved in 42% and 59%,respectivel y,of adalimumab -treated patients compared with 26% and 28% ,respectivel y,of placebo -treated patients .8Therefore, a substantial ,unmet medical need exists for safe and more effective HS management options with alternative mechanisms of action . Although the pathogenesis of HS remains somewhat unclear, there is evidence that inf lammation associated with increased IL-17 pathway activit y mediated by IL-23may be involved. Genetic variations within the gene encoding the common IL-12βR1 subunit of the IL-12/IL -23 receptor have been shown to be associ ated with a more severe course of HS, and tissue obtained from HS lesions showed increased IL-23/Th17 pathway gene expression and distinct infiltration of IL-17- producing T helper cells compared with healthy skin.3,22Moreover, an uncontrolled, open -label, investigator -initiated clinical study of ustekinumab (STELARA ®), a monoclonal antibody that inhibits both IL-12 and IL-23,using the standard weight -based psoriasis dosage ,demonstrated that theprimary outcome (a moderate to marked improvement based on the modified Sartorius Score) was achieve d in 82% of participants at Week 40.1Furthermore, in a post-hoc analy sis, 47% of participants achieved a HiSCR .1These results suggest that reducing IL-23-mediated"
18,page_18,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959HDS2001 19 Approved , Date: 2 May 2019inflammation with guselkumab may improve the signs and symptoms of active HS and potentially allow for better treatment of this distressing disease. Nonclinical Studies A comprehensive overview of the nonclinical development program for guselkumab is available in Section 3 of the latest version of the guselkumab IB. This section provides a summary of the sponsor's assessment of how the overall nonclinical data support the safety of the proposed dosing for guselkumab in this Phase 2 program in HS. Details regarding the proposed dose regimen and dose rationale are described in Section 4.3of this protocol. To place the proposed clinical dosing for guselkumab in HSparticipants into perspective relative to the existing preclinical data, the predicted cumulative human exposures during the placebo - controlled phase (1200 mg IV given at Weeks 0, 4, 8) were compared to the exposure at the no- observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL )in cynomolgus monkey sfollowing weekly IV administration in the 5-week arm of the subchronic toxicology study. In addition, predicted cumulative 12 -week human exposures during the induction phase were compared to the exposure at the NOAEL in cynomolgus monkey s following weekl y SC administration in the 24-week arm of the subchronic toxicology study. Thereafter, the predicted human exposure at stead y-state (based on the highest SCdose being tested in this protocol, ie, 200 mg SC q4w) was compared with the exposure at the NOAEL in cynomolgus monkey sfollowing weekly SC administration in the 24-week arm of the subchronic toxicology study. These data are presented inAppendix 8 (Section 10.8). From a nonclinical perspective, the risk to HSpatients is considered low when guselkumab is administered IV once every 4weeks at doses up to 1200 mg (approx imately 16mg/kg in humans) followed by the proposed maintenance doses of up to 200 mg SC q4w, based on no adverse findings observed in cynomolgus monkey s following 5 weeks of once -weekl y subchronic IV dosing at 50 mg/kg and 24 weeks of chronic once -weekly SC dosing. As summarized above, the actual exposure data (area under the serum concentration versus time curve [AUC ]) achieved in monkey s relative to the predicted Week 8 to Week 12 IV clinical induction dosing interval AUC, or stead y-state SC maintenance interval AUC (both normaliz ed to weekly dosing to compare with the monkey dosing interval) provide ample exposure margins for the proposed clinical doses. This is further supported by the fact that guselkumab is an approved biotherapeutic with a good clinical safety profile in patients with plaque or other types of psoriasis, administered guselkumab at a dose of100 mg SC, but also at doses up to 300mg SC and 10 mg/kg IV in a limited number of patients with plaque psoriasis and in healthy normal volunteers, respectivel y, during Phase 1 of clinical development."
19,page_19,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959HDS2001 20 Approved , Date: 2 May 2019Clinical Studies This protocol repr esents the first study of guselkumab in participants with H S. This section provides a summary of the sponsor’s assessment of how the overall clinical experience with guselkumab across various indications supports the investigation of guselkumab in HS. Details about theguselkumab clinical development programs across various indications are provided in Section 4 of the latest version of the guselkumab IB. Guselkumab is currentl y approved in the United States , European Union , Canada , and several other countries for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Also, Japan recently approved guselkumab for the treatment of patients with psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) ,erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) ,and PsA. In addition, guselkumab is being evaluated in adult PsA,Crohn’s disease , and pediatric psori asis globall y, and in palmoplantar pustular psoriasis (PPP) in Japan. Through the current IB cutoff date of 30 June 2017, 2,805 participants have been exposed to guselkumab across all indications in completed and ongoing clinical studies, including 185 healthy participants , 2,336 participants with psoriasis, 129 participants with PsA, and 155 participants in other indications. The largest clinical experience to date with guselkumab has been in plaque psoriasis, primaril y based on dosing at 100 mg SC q8w in theglobal Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development program (n=1 ,748),but also at doses up to 300 mg SC in a small number of participants (n=10) during Phase 1 clinical development. The safety profile of guselkumab in participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis based on data from the Phase 2 study (CNTO1959PSO2001) and three Phase 3 studies (CNTO1959PSO3001, CNTO1959PSO3002, and CNTO1959PSO3003) is described in Section 4.4 of the latest version of the guselkumab IB. Briefl y, of the 1,748 guselkum ab-treated participants in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, 1,393 participants were exposed for at least 6 months and 728 participa nts were exposed for at least 1year. TheLTEs oftwo ofthe Phase 3 studies (CNTO1959PSO3001 and CNTO1959PSO3002) are ongoin g and will evaluate the safety and efficacy of guselkumab through up to 5 years of follow -up. The totality of the safet y data available to date show that guselkumab, administered SC at doses of 100 mg q8w in participants with plaque psoriasis, is well tolerated ,has a safet y profile comparable to placebo over 16 weeks, and safet y remained favorable when referenced versus an active comparator (adalimumab) over 1 year. Additional safet y data in other indications (in participants who also receive concomitant immunomodulators as background therapy ) with guselku mab doses as high as 200 mg SC q8w (in a Phase 2 rheumatoid arthritis study ; n=54) did not identify any clinically significant safety signals through 1 year. Finally , a limited number of healthy participan ts (n=30) received single doses of IV guselkumab between 0.03 mg/kg and up to 10 mg/kg. Of the 6 participants in the 10 mg/kg dose group, the highest dose received was 987mg in 1 participant. No clinically significant safet y signals were identified."
20,page_20,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959HDS2001 21 Approved , Date: 2 May 20192.3. Benef it/Risk Assessment Based on the available data and the proposed safety measures discussed below, the risks of the dose regimens of guselkumab to be investigated in this protocol appear to be acceptable relative to the potential benefit . Guselkumab has unde rgone extensive nonclinical and clinical development in inflammatory diseases such as PsA, Crohn’s disease, GPP, EP, PPP, and pediatric psoriasis, as summarized in the latest version of the IB and described briefly in Section 2.2.The collective efficacy and safet y results of the Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical studies in healthy volunteers and patients with plaque psoriasis ,and the recent regulatory approval for the adult plaque psoriasis indication ,established a favorable benefit -risk profile for guselkumab in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. There is evidence that inflammation associated with increased IL-17 pathway activity mediated by IL-23 may be involved in the pathogenesis of HS. Efficacy from an open -label ustekinumab study further suggested that reducing IL-23-mediated inflammation may improve the signs and symptoms of active HS ( Section 2.2). The approved dose regimen for guselkumab in psoriasis (100 mg SC at Week 0 and Week 4, and then q8w) has a favorable benefit/risk profile, and dose regimens as high as200 mg SC q8w have been shown to be safe in a Phase 2 trial in rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical evidence suggests that meaningful efficacy in HS may require higher drug doses and exposures than psoriasis (Section 4.3). To determine the efficacy of guselkumab that results from the maximum exposure feasible , while maintaining an adequate safet ymargin to the available guselkumab nonclinical toxicology data (Section 2.2), a dose of 1200 mg IV given q4w for 3 doses will be utilized for this POC study in HS. Of note, this 1200 mg IV dose regimen is also being utilized and evaluated in a large ongoing Crohn’s disease Phase 2b/3 clinical program . Unblinded safety will be evaluated on an ongoing basis throughout this trial by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), in addition to the standard safety oversight performed by the sponsor. Details about the safet y evaluation sthat will be utilized to continue or modify the protocol as the trial progresses are outlined in Section 9.6and in the DMC charter. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks of guselkumab may be found in the IB. 3.

A screening period will take approximately 4 weeks. All participants will enter safet y follow-up after Week 36through W eek 48. Two planned database locks (DBL s)will occur ,at Week 16 and at Week 48. Efficacy assessments (HS-IGA, lesion counts, Hurley staging, HSSD ,DLQI, HADS , andPGIC) will be performed according to the Schedules of Activities. Serum samples for PK, immunogenicit y, and biomarker analyses will be collected at the timepoints shown in the Schedules of Activities (Section 1.3). An interim anal ysis is planned and an independent D MCwill be commissioned for this study for safet y evaluation .Refer to Section 9.5(Interim Analy sis) and Section 9.6(Data Monitoring Committee) for details. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design Blinding, Control, Study Phase/Periods, Intervention Groups Blinded treatment for guselkumab and placebo will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of endpoints. A placebo control will be used to establish the frequency and magnitude of changes in clinical endpoints that may occur in the absence of active treatment. Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of participants to treatment groups, to increase the likeliho od that known and unknown participant attributes (eg, demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups."

Study -Specific Ethical Design Consi derations Potential participants will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study and, during the study , participants will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue participation. They will be told that their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Only participants who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits , and potential adverse events (AEs)of the study and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled. The total blood volume to be collected from each participant in each group (181.5 mLover approximatel y 48 weeks) is far less than the American Red Cross standard limit for whole blood donation (approximatel y 475 mL q8w) and is therefore considered an acceptable amount of blood to be collected over this time period. For more details regarding blood collection, see Blood Sample Collection in Section 8. 4.3. Justification for Dose The following guselkumab dose regimens are selected for this Phase 2 POC study in partici pants with moderate to severe HS: Guselkumab 1200 mg IV at Weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by 200 mg SC q4w through Week 36 Guselkumab 200 mg SC q4w from Week 0 through Week 36 Placebo IV and SC administration through Week 16. At Week 16, participants in the placebo group will cross over to : Guselkumab 200 mg SC (q4w from Week 16 to Week 36), or Guselkumab 100 mg SC (Weeks 16 ,20, 28 and 36 ;placebo SC at Weeks 24 and 32 ). Theseguselkumab dose regimens were selected based on existing safety information from relevant preclinical and clinical studies, the approved dose regimen for psoriasis, and the objective of determining the maximum efficacy of guselkumab possible for treatment of HS. Published information about adalimumab (an anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody ) on relative dosing requirements among Crohn’s disease, psoriasis ,and HS patients also contributed to the choice of these dose regimens, along with data from an open -label HS clinical trial using ustekinumab (an anti -IL-12/IL -23 monoclonal antibody ).1,2,17,18,19 This is a POC study , therefore, the maximum feasible dose (1200 mg IV),based on safet y margins from preclinical and clinical studies ,is being evaluated to define the maximum efficacy of guselkumab possible in HS. Single IV doses of guselkumab as high as 10 mg/kg, with the highest IV single dose tested being 987 mg, have been previousl y studied in a Phase 1 plaque psoriasis study . Additionally , guselkumab IV doses of up to 50 mg/kg weekly for 5 weeks, and guselkumab SC doses of up to 50 mg/kg weekl y for 24 weeks, were well tolerated in cynomolgus monkey s (Section 2.2).These data support an acceptable exposure margin between"
25,page_25,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959HDS2001 26 Approved , Date: 2 May 2019the predicted guselkumab exposures at the proposed dose regimens compared to those observed in toxicology studies; the estimated safet y margins are approximately 4-to-6-fold for the 1200 mg IV dosing (See Appendix 8[Section 10.8]).Of note, the 1200 mg IV dose is the same asthe high guselkumab dose to be studied in Crohn’s disease (NCT01369355, ClinicalTrials.gov). The 1200 mgIV dose regimen will help assess if incremental HS efficacy is possible with guselkumab exposure exceeding what can be p racticab ly achieved with SC dosing . Aguselkumab 200 mg SC q4w dose, approximately 4-fold of the approved psoriasis dose (ie, 100mg SCat Weeks 0 and 4, then 100 mg SC q8w thereafter), is also included in this POC study to determine the HS efficacy resulting from the maximally practicable SC dose of guselkumab. Participants randomized to placebo will cross over to blinded guselkumab treatment at Week 16, including the 200 mg SC q4w dose and a lower 100 mg SCdose at Weeks 16 and 20, followed by q8w through Week 36, which is the approved psoriasis dose. Based on the results from an open -label ustekinumab HS study , it is likely that the psoriasis dose regimen could provide some clinical benefits .1Comparison of the relative efficacy of these two dose groups will provide useful data for determining if a dose higher than the optimal psoriasis dose provides incremental efficacy in HS. Available preclinical observations and clinical data from other therapies suggest that a dose higher than the psoriasis dose may be needed in HS to achie ve optimal efficacy .For example, IL-17+ CD4 T cells were shown to be enriched more than 40-fold in HS -involved skin compared with normal skin,11while the ratio was onlyapproximately 2-fold for psoriasis .6IL-17A gene expression and protein levels have been reported to be highly up-regulate d in HS affected skin compared to unaffected skin.7Additionally , studies have shown similar IL-23/Th 17 pathway gene expression in HS -and Crohn’s disease -affected tissues , indicating potential commonality in the patho physiology of these autoinflammatory conditions.16,22Moreover, an adalimumab Phase 2 dose-ranging HS study found that an adalimumab dosage comparable with that used for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and essentially twice the psoriasis dose,provided better efficacy compared with the approved psoriasis dose,8and ultimately became the adalimumab dose approved for HS treatme nt. Finally , HS patients are generally heavier than patients with psoriasis (median body weight of approximately 94 kg and 89 kg, respectivel y)12,14and guselkumab exposure has been shown to be lower in heavier participants . 4.4.

Potentially hazardous materials such as used ampules, needles, syringes and vials containing hazardous liquids, should be disposed of immediately in a safe manner and therefore will not be retained for drug accountability purposes. The study intervention boxes will be retained for inventory by the sponsor . Study intervention should be dispensed under the supervision of the investigator or a qualified member of the study -site personnel, or by a ho spital/clinic pharmacist. Study intervention will be supplied only to participants participating in the study . Study intervention may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by other participants. The investigator agrees to neither dispense the study interv ention from, nor store it at, an y site other than the study sites agreed upon with the sponsor. 6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding Intervention Allocation Procedures for Ran domization and Stratification Central randomization will be implemented in this study . Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3intervention groups based on a computer -generated randomization schedule prepared under the supervision of the sponsor . Permuted block randomization with stratification by baseline weight (≤ 95 kg, > 95 kg) and baseline Hurley stage (I, II, and III) will be used. The number of participants in Hurley stage I should be limited toapproximately 30% of the total planned number of participants. Additionally ,the number of participants in Hurley stage III should be limited toapproximately 50% ofthe total planned number of participants. The interactive web response system (IWRS )will assign a unique intervention code, which will dictate the intervention assig nment and matching study intervention kitsfor the participant. The requestor must use his or her own user identification and personal identification number when"
37,page_37,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959HDS2001 38 Approved , Date: 2 May 2019contacting the IWRSand will then give the relevant participant details to uniquely identify the participant. At Week 16, participants randomized to placebo at Week 0 will be rerandomized using the IWRS either to guselkumab 200 mg SC q4w or guselkumab 100 mg SCat Weeks 16, 20, and q8w thereafter (participants will receive placebo SC at Weeks 24 and 32)in a 1:1 ratio using permuted block randomization and the randomization and will be stratified by baseline weight (≤95 kg, > 95kg) and baseline Hurley stage (I, II, and III) . Blinding To maintain the study blind, the study intervention container will have a label containing the study name, study intervention number, and reference number . The blinded label will not identify the specific study intervention in the container (ie, guselkumab or placebo) . However, if it is necessary for a participant's safety , the study blind may be broken ,and the identity of the study intervention ascertained. The study intervention number will be entered in the eCRF when the study intervention is administered . The guselkumab and placebo will be identical in appearance and will be packaged in identical containers. The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained within the IWRS,which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the blind for an individual participant. Data that may potentially unblind the intervention assignment (ie, study intervention serum concentrations, anti-guselkumab antibodies, and intervent ionallocation ) will be handled with special care to ensure that the integrit y of the blind is maintained and the potential for bias is minimized. This can include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by the investi gators, clinical team, or others as appropriate until the time of DBL and unblinding. Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken until all participants have completed the study and the database is finalized. However, selected sponsor person nelwill be unblinded for analysis after the Week 16 DBL has occurred. All site personnel and participants will remain blinded to the treatment assignments until the last participant completes Week 48 evaluations and the database has been locked. The inves tigator may,in an emergency ,determine the identity of the intervention bycontacting the IWRS.While the responsibility to break the intervention code in emergency situations resides solel y with the investigator, it is recommended that the investigator contact the sponsor or its designee if possible to discuss the particular situation, before breaking the blind. Telephone contact with the sponsor or its designee will be available 24hours per day , 7days per week. I n the event the blind is broken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date and reason for the unblinding must be documented in the appropriate section of the eCRF , andin the source document. The documentation received from the IWRSindica ting the code break must be retained with the participant's source documents in a secure manner ."

For the planned interim analyses and the DMC, the randomization codes andthe translation of randomization codes into intervention and control groups will be disclosed to those authorized and only for those participants included in the interim analy sis. 6.4. Study Intervention Compliance Because study intervention will be administere d at the investigational site for all randomized participants, intervention compliance will be ensured b y site personnel. When study intervention is administered as an IV infusion or SC injection by qualified staff, the details of each administration will be recorded in the eCRF. For IV infusions, these will include date and start and stop times of the IV infusion and volume infused; for SC injections, these will include date, bod y location and time of SC injection. All visits through Week 36 should occur within ±7days of the scheduled visit. If a study visit occurs outside this window, the sponsor should be consulted about how the participant should resume his/her normal dosing schedule relative to the baseline visit (Week 0). Information regarding study intervention administrations that are administered outside of the scheduled windows or missed will be recorded. Source data will be reviewed and compared with the data entries on the eCRFs to ensure accuracy . Although it is understood that intervention may be interrupted for many reasons, compliance with the intervention schedule is strongly encouraged. 6.5. Concomitant Therapy Concomitant therapies must be recorded throughout the study from Week 0through Week 48 or continuing until 12 weeks after the last dose of study intervention. Concomitant therapies on randomized participants should also be recorded beyond that point only in conjunction with serious adverse events (SAE) that meet the criteria outlined in Serious Adverse Events in Section 8.3.1 , Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Information . All therapies (prescription or over-the-counte r medications, including vaccines, vitamins, herbal supplements; non-pharmacologic therapies such as electrical stimulation) different from the study intervention must be recorded in the eCRF.Modification of an effective pre-existing therap y should not be made for the explicit purpose of entering a participant into the study . The sponsor must be notified in advance (or as soon as possible thereafter) of any instances in which prohibi ted therapies are administered."

Rescue Therapy In the event that a particu larly painful HS lesion occurs that necessitates an acute intervention, investigators will have the option to perform protoco l-allowed interventions. Two types of interventions are allowed: Injection with intralesional triamcinolone acetonide suspension (at a concentration of up to 5mg/mL , up to 1 cc) Incision and drainage of the lesion If incision and drainage is performed, the required over-the-counter soap and water or antiseptic wash should continue to be used. New systemic and topical therapies following incision and drainage (including antibiotics) are prohibited. Concomitant use of wound care dressings is allowed; however ,options are limited to alginates, hydrocolloids, and hydrogels. Participants should continue using any ongoing oral and topical therapies (as described in Section 6.5, Concomitant Therap y) during the stud y. Concomitant therapies associated with the lesion intervention(s) must be captured in the source documentation and on the appropriate eCRF. A total of 2protocol -allowed intervention s are permissible through Week 16. An intervention can occur maximally on2different lesions atthe same visit or on the same lesion at 2different study visits. The same lesion cannot be treated 2times at the same visit. If a participant requires more than 2interventions within the first 16 weeks, then he or she must be discontinued from study interventions but continued for follow -up for approximately 12 weeks after last administration of study intervention. After Week 16, interventions will not be permitted since all participants will receive active guselkumab treatment . If a participant requires anintervention after Week 16, heor she must be discontinued from study interventions, but continued for follow -up for approximately 12 weeks after last administration of study intervention . Allstudy visit evaluations must occur before anyinterventions are performed. Anylesion that undergoes an interventi on will be documented in the source . 6.5.2. Antiseptic Therapy Participants are required to use a daily antiseptic wash on their HS lesions. Allowable antiseptic washes are limited to one of the follo wing: soap and water , a topical antiseptic wash containing chlorhexidine gluconate, triclosan, or benzoy l peroxide, or a dilute bleach bath. 6.5.3.

During the study , concomitant use of opioid analgesics isalso prohibit ed,with theexception of tramadol as detail ed below . Oral analgesics for HS-related pain are prohibited 14 days prior to the baseline visit. If a participant is on a stable dose of a non -opioid analgesic (PRN is not considered stable) for a non - HS medical condition (eg, osteoarthritis), the participant may continue the analgesic, provided the dose is stable for 14 days prior to baseline and is anticipated to remain stable throughout study participation. If a participant’s pain (HS-related or non-HS-related) worsens after baseline, they may initiate analgesic thera pyatany time as follows: For HS-related pain, permitted analgesics are limited to: Ibuprofen (at a dose of up to 800 mg by mouth every 6 hours) not to exceed 3.2grams/24 hours; AND/OR Acetaminophen as per local labeling; AND/OR IfHS-related pain is uncontrolled with ibuprofen and/or acetaminophen at the above dosing regimens after the baselinevisit, participants can be prescribed tramadol (at a dose of up to 100 mg by mouth every 4 hours), not to exceed 400 mg/24 hours. Dose adjustments of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or tramadol, and use of these analgesics on an ""as needed"" (PRN) basis for HS-related pain up to the maximum permitted dose and frequenc y, are allowed during the stud y.

DISCONTINUA TION OF STUDY INTERVENTION A ND PA RTICIPA NT DISCONTINUA TION/ WITHDRA WAL A participant will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed assessments through Week 48 as specified in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.3). 7.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention A participant's stud y intervention must bediscontinue d if any of the following occur: The investigator believes that for safet y reasons or tolerability reasons (eg,AE) it is in the best interest of the participant to discontinue study intervention . The participant has a serious adverse reaction that is tempora llyrelated to an injection or an infusion including an injection -siteor infusion reaction, resulting in bronchospasm with wheezing and/or dyspnea that requires ventilatory support OR that results in symptomatic hypotension with a decrease in systolic blood pressure >40 mm Hg or blood pressure <90/60 mm Hg. This may include events of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) toxicity grade ≥3. In general, discontinuation of study intervention administration must be considered for participants who develop a severe injection -site or i nfusion reaction. The participant or their legally acceptable representative withdraws consent/assent for administration of study intervention. The participant becomes pregnant or plans a pregnancy during the study period. Refer to Appendix 7 (Section 10.7), Contraceptive and Barrier Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy Information. The initiation of protocol -prohibited medications ,treatments , or interventions (outlined in Section 6.5, Concomitant Therap y)that have an impact on HS efficacy evaluations. The participant has a malignancy including squamous cell skin cancer. Consideration may be given to allow participants, who develop ≤2 basal cell skin cancers and who are adequatel y treated with no evidence of residual disease, to continue to receive study intervention. A systemic opportunistic infection. A recurren t or chr onic serious infection. The participant is deemed ineligible according to the following TB screening criteria: A diagnosis of active TB is made. A participant has symptoms suggestive of active TB based on follow -up assessment questions and/or physical exam ination or has had recent close contact with a person with active TB and cannot or will not undergo additional evaluation."

These may be accompanied by other events including pruritus, facial, hand, or lip edema, d ysphagia, urticaria, sore throat, and/or headache. The participant has his/her treatment assignment unblinded by the investigator. Sponsor decision . Discontinuation of a participant’s study intervention should be considered for: Participants with any type of suicidal ideation or behavior, or any self-injurious behavior, who are deemed to be at risk by the investigator. Discussion of such participants with the medical monitor or designee is required. For participants who report Suicidal Ideation with Intention to Act (“Ideation level 4”), suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent (“Ideation level 5”), suicidal behavior (actual suicide attempt, interrupted suicide attempt, aborted suicide attempt, or preparatory behaviors formaking a suicide attempt) or any self- injurious behavior on a post-baseline C-SSRS assessment, the investigator risk assessment must be based upon evaluation by a mental health professional (see Section 8.2.5 ). Participants who decide to discontinue study intervention administration for reasons other than those outlined above must be interviewed by the investigator to determine if a specific reason for discontinuin g study intervention can be identified. Participants should be explicitly asked about the possible contribution of AEs to their decision to discontinue study intervention; investigators should confirm that any AE information elicited has been documented. If a participant elects to discontinue study intervention due to an AE, the event should be recorded as the reason for study intervention discontinuation, even if the investigator’s assessment is that the AE would not require study intervention discontinuat ion. The reason for study intervention discontinuation must be documented in the eCRF and in source documents. Study intervention assigned to a participant who discontinues may not be assigned to another participant. A participant will not be automatically withdrawn from the study if he or she must discontinue treatment before the end of the treatment regimen. Participants who discontinue study intervention but do not terminate study participation will continue to return for protocol -specified procedures and evaluations for approximately 12 weeks following the last dose of study intervention. The procedures and evaluations listed for the EarlyTermination Visit should also be performed approximately 12 weeks after the last dose of study intervention."

Participant Discontinuation/ Withdrawal from the Study A participant will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: Lost to follow -up(Refer to Sec tion 7.3) Withdrawal of consent Death To ensure access for participant follow -up, study sites should try to obtain both primary and secondary telephone contact numb ers from participants (eg, home, work, and mobile phones), as well as other contact information such as email addresses, and emphasize the importance of follow -up information to the participant, before randomization. For participants who withdraw from study participation, every effort should be made to conduct the Early Termination Visit assessments, as indicated in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3).If the reason for withdrawal from the study is withdrawal of consent, then no additional assessments are allowed. Withdrawal of consent should be a very unusual occurrence in a clinical trial; the investigator should make every effort to maintain good participant relationships to avoid withdrawals of consent. For participants who truly request withdrawal of consent, it is recommended that the participant withdraw consent in writing; if the participant or the participant’s representative refuses to do so or is physicall y unavailable, the study -site should document the reason for the participant’s failure to withdraw consent in writing, sign the documentation, and maintain it with the particip ant’s source records. When a participant withdraws before completing the study , the reason for withdrawal is to be documented in the eCRF and in the source document. Study intervention assigned to the withdrawn participant may not be assigned to another participant. Participants who withdraw will not be replaced. 7.2.1. Withdrawal from the Use of Research Samples The participant may withdraw consent for use of samples for research (refer to Long-Term Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research in Appendix 5 [Section 10.5], Regulatory , Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations). In such a case, samples will be destro yed after they are no longer needed for the clinical study . Details of the sample retention for research are presented in the main ICF. 7.3. Lost to Follow -up If a participant fails to return for study visits (and thus is considered lost to follow -up), study -site personnel must make all reasonable efforts tocontact the participant to determine the participant’s reason for discontinuation/withdrawal before considering the participant to be lost to follow -up. Such efforts should include repeated telephone calls, certified letters, email requests, etc. Measures taken to obtain follow -up information must be documented.

Efficacy Assessments Efficacy evaluations are consistent with those used to evaluate other therapies for HSand will include the following: 8.1.1. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Investigator’s Global A ssessment The HS-IGA (Appendix 10[Section 10.10 ]) documents the investigator’s assessment of the participant’s HS at a given timepoint. The anatomic region with the most severe HS activit y at the baseline visit should be evaluated for erythema, draina ge, and pain and/or tenderness to palpation for each participant . For each participant , the same anatomic site selected for evaluation at the baselinevisit should be re-evaluated at each subsequent visit. The participant’s HS is assessed as inactive (0), almost inactive (1), mild activity (2), moderate activity (3), or severe activity (4). A higher score indicates more severe disease. 8.1.2. Lesion Counts Lesion counts are defined as the counting of abscesses, inflammatory nodules, non-inflammatory nodules, drain ing fistulas, and non-draining fistulas . Lesions will be counted during each visit. 8.1.3. Hurley Staging Hurley staging consists of 3 stages of disease that will be used to determine stratification: Stage I: Abscess formation, single or multiple, without sinus tracts and scarring Stage II: One or more widely separated recurrent abscesses with tract formation and scarring Stage III: Multiple interconnected tracts and abscesses across the entire area, with diffuse or near diffuse involvement 8.1.4. Hidradenitis Suppurati va Symptom Diary The HSSD (Appendix 11[Section 10.11 ])is a 7-item patient self-reported questionnaire that assesses 5 HS-related symptoms including pain, tenderness, hot skin feeling , odor, and itchiness. The participants are asked to rate the severity of each symptom on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, with 0 indicating no symptom experience and 10 indicating the worst possible symptom experience. All 5 symptoms have a recall period of the past 7 days, except for 2additional questions on pain which evaluate current pain and pain in the past 24 hours. Each individual symptom scale score , ranging from 0 -10, will be summarized . A total sy mptom score, which w ill"

Dermatological Life Quality Index The DLQI (Appendix 12[Section 10.12 ]) is a dermatology -specific quality of life instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a participant’s quality of life .It is a 10-item PRO questionnaire that, in addition to evaluating overall quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. The DLQI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 30. A higher score indicates more severe disease. 8.1.6. Hospital A nxiety and Depression Scale The HADS (Appendix 13[Section 10.13 ]) consists of 2 subscales, one measuring anxiety (A- scale) and one measuring depression (Dscale), which are scored separately .A higher score indicates more severe disease. 8.1.7. Patient Global Im pression of Change of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI C)of HSSeverit y (Appendix 14[Section 10.14 ]) is a questionna ire that measures participants’ perceived change (improvement or deterioration) in severit y of their HS. Participants will rate how his/her HS has changed since the beginning of the study using a 7-point scale ranging from “a lot better now” to “a lot wors e now” with a neutral center point (“neither better nor worse”). PGIC will be used as an anchor to test reliability and establish a clinical response criterion of other patient or physician reported outcomes for future reference . 8.1.8. Photographs of Skin Lesion s Photographs of selected HS lesions will be taken at a subset of study sites in participants who provide additional consent. Consult the Trial Center File for photograph y instructions. 8.2. Safety Assessments Details regarding theDMC are provided in Committees Structure in Section 9.6, Data Monitoring Committee . Adverse events will be reported and followed by the investigator as specified in Section 8.3, Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events and Appendix 6(Section 10.6),Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -Up, and Reporting.

Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) The C-SSRS defines 5 subty pes of suicidal ideation and 4 possible suici dal behaviors, as well as non-suicidal self-injurious behavior and completed suicide. It will be used as a screening tool to prospectivel y evaluate suicidal ideation and behavior in this study , as part of a comprehensive evaluation of safet y. The C-SSRS is an investigator -administered questionnaire .13,15Two ve rsions of it will be used in this study : the ‘Baseline/Screening’ version of the C-SSRS (see Appendix 15, [Section 10.15 ])will be conducted during the screening visit and the ‘Since Last Visit’ version of the C-SSRS (see Appendix 16, [Section 10.16 ])will be completed at all other visits through the end of the study . The investigator or trained study -site personnel will interview the participant and complete the C-SSRS. The C-SSRS will be provided in the local languages in accordance with local guidelines. At screening and after obtaining informed consent ,the C-SSRS will be the first assessment performed, before any other study procedure. At all subsequent visits, the C-SSRS will be performed according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3)and should be performed before any tests, procedures, or other consultations , with the exception of the urine pregnancy test,to prevent influencing participant perceptions .Participants will be interviewed by the investigator or trained stud y-site personnel in a private, quiet place. At the conclusion of each assessment, the trained personnel administering the C-SSRS will determine the level of suicidal ideation or behavior, if any. They will then determine the next course of action if any level of suicidal ideation or behavior is reported. The participant should not be released from the site until the C-SSRS has been reviewed by the investigator and the participant’s risk has been assessed and follow -up determined, as appropriate. At screenin g (within the last 6 months) and Week 0, participants with a C-SSRS rating of Suicidal Ideation with Intention to Act (“Ideation level 4”), Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent (“Ideation level 5”), or suicidal behavior (actual suicide attempt, interrupted suicide attempt, aborted suicide attempt, or preparatory behaviors for making a suicide attempt), must be determined to not be at risk by the investigator based on an evaluation by a mental health professional (eg, psychiatrist, psychologist, or appropriatel y trained social worker or nurse) in order to be randomized. Participants with C-SSRS ratings of Wish to be Dead (“Ideation level 1”), Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts (“Ideation level 2”), Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act (“Ideation level 3”) or non-suicidal self-injurious behavior must be determined not to be at risk by the investigator in order to be randomized.

For each assessment after Week 0 , the following actions should be taken, if applicable: No suicidal ideation or behaviors (including self-injurious behavior without suicidal intent): No further action is needed. Suicidal ideation levels 1-3 or non-suicidal self-injurious behavior: Participant risk is assessed b y the investigator. Suicidal ideation levels 4 or 5 or any suicidal behavior: Participant risk assessed and referral to a mental health professional. Interruption or the discontinuation of study intervention should be considered for any participant who reports Suicidal Ideation with Intention to Act (“Ideation level 4”), Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent (“Ideation level 5”), or suicidal behavior (actual suicide attempt, interrupted suicide attempt, aborted suicide attempt, or preparatory behaviors for making a suicide attempt) on a post-baseline C-SSRS assessment and who is deemed to be at risk by the investigator based upon evaluation by a mental health professional. If a participant can be adequatel y treated with psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherap y then the participant, at the discretion of the investigator, may be continued with treatment if agreed to by the medical monitor or designee. Discussion of such participants with the medical monitor or designee is required (see Section 7.1, Discontinuation of Study Intervention). Any C-SSRS finding, which in the opinion of the investigator is new or considered to be a worsening and clinically significant, should be reporte d on theAE eCRF (see Appendix 6 [Section 10.6], Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow - up, and Reporting). 8.2.6. Immunogenicity Assessments Anti-guselkumab antibodies will be evaluated in serum samples collected from all participants according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3). Additionally , serum samples should also be collected at the final visit or at the Early Termination Visit from participants who are discontinued from intervention or withdrawn from the study . These samples will be tested by the sponsor or sponsor's designee.

Each serum sample will be divided into 3 aliquots (1 each for serum concentration of study intervention, antibodies to study intervention, and a back -up). Immunogenicity Analytical Procedu res The detection and characterization of anti-guselkumab antibodies will be performed using a validated assay method by or under the supervision of the sponsor. All samples collected for detection of anti-guselkumab antibodies will also be evaluated for guselkumab serum concentration to enable interpretation of the antibody data. 8.2.7. Concomitant Medication Concomitant medications will be reviewed at each visit and recorded in the source documents and eCRF. 8.2.8. Allergic Reactions Before any SC injection or IVinfusion, appropriately trained personnel and medications must be available to treat allergic reactions, including anaphy laxis. All participants must be observed carefully for sy mptoms of an allergic reaction (eg, urticaria, itching, hives). I f a mild or moderate allergic reaction is observed, acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or diphenhy dramine may be administered. In the case of a severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphy laxis), SC aqueous epinephrine, corticosteroids, respiratory assistance, and other proper resuscitative measures may beessential and must be available at the location where the injections or infusions are being administered. Participants who experience serious adverse reactions related to an injection or infusion shoul d be discontinued from further study intervention administrations. Participants who experience reactions following an injection or infusion that result in bronchospasm with wheezing and/or dyspnea that requires ventilatory support, or symptomatic hypotensi on with a decrease in sy stolic blood pressure >40mm Hg or blood pressure <90/60 mm Hgwill not be permitted to receive additional study intervention . Participants who experience reactions suggestive of serum sickness -like reactions (resulting in symptoms such as myalgia and/or arthralgia with fever and/or rash that are not representative of signs and symptoms of other recognized clinical syndromes) occurring 1 to 14 days after an injection of study intervention, should be discontinued from further study intervention administrations.

Adverse Events Temporarily Related to Infusion Any AE that occurs during or within 1 hour after the IV infusion of study intervention will be carefully evaluated. Minor infusion -related AEs may be managed by slowing the rate of the IV infusion and/or treating with antihistamines and/or acetaminophen (paracetamol) as clinic ally indicated. If an IV infusion of study intervention is stopped because of an AE that, in the opinion of the investigator, is not severe or does not result in a SAE , the infusion may be restarted with caution. 8.2.10. Injection -site Reactions A study interventi on injection -site reaction is any adverse reaction at an SC study intervention injection -site. The injection sites will be evaluated for reactions and any injection -site reactions will be recorded as an AE. 8.2.11. Tuberculosis Evaluation(s) 8.2.11.1. Initial Tuberculosis E valuation Participants must undergo testing for TB (refer to laboratory manual for QuantiFERON ®-TB testor Appendix 4[Section 10.4]for tuberculin skin test) and their medical history assessment must include specific questions about a history of TB or known occupational or other personal exposure to individuals with active TB. The participant should be asked about past testing for TB, including chest radiograph results and responses to tuberculin skin or other TB testing. Investigators have the option to use both the QuantiFERON ®-TB test and the tuberculin skin test to screen for latent TB if they believe, based on their judgment, that the use of both tests is clinically indicated in order to evaluate a participant who has high risk of having latent TB. If either the QuantiFERON ®-TB test or the tuberculin skin test is positive, the participant is considered to have latent TB infection for the purposes of eligibility for this study . Participants with a negative QuantiFERON ®-TB test result (and a negative tuberculin skin test result in countries in which the QuantiFERON ®-TB test is not approved/registered or the tuberculin skin testis mandated by local health authorities) are eligible to continue with pre- randomization procedures. Participants with a newly identified positive QuantiFERON ®-TB (or tuberculin skin) test result must undergo an evaluation to rule out active TB and initiate appropriate treatment for latent TB. Appropriate treatment for latent TB is defined according to local country guidelines for immunocompromised patients. If no local country guidelines for immuno compromised patients exist, US guidelines must be followed, or the participant will be excluded from the study . 8.2.11.2. Ongoing Tuberculosis Evaluation Early Detection of Active Tuberculosis To aid in the early detection of TB reactivation or new TB infection during study participation, participants must be evaluated for signs and symptoms of active TB at scheduled visits (refer to the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.3).The following series of questions is suggested for use during the evaluation:"
53,page_53,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959HDS2001 54 Approved , Date: 2 May 2019“Have you had a new cough of >14 day s’ duration or a change in a chronic cough?” “Have you had an y of t he following s ymptoms: Persistent fever? Unintentional weight loss? Night sweats?” “Have you had close contact with an individual with active TB?” (If there is uncertaint y as to whether a contact should be considered “close,” a physician specializing in TBshould be consulted.) If the evaluation raises suspicion that a participant may have TB reactivation or new TB infection, an immediate and thorough investigation should be undertaken, including, where possible, consultation with a phy sician specializing in TB. Investigators should be aware that TB reactivation in immunocompromised participants may present as disseminated disease or with extrapulmonary features. Participants with evidence of active TB should be referred for appropriate treatment. Participa nts who experience close contact with an individual with active TB during the conduct of the study must have a repeat chest radiograph, a repeat QuantiFERON ®-TB test, a repeat tuberculin skin test in countries in which the QuantiFERON ®-TB test is not appro ved/registered or the tuberculin skin test is mandated by local health authorities, and, if possible, referral to a physician specializing in TB to determine the participant’s risk of developing active TB and whether treatment for latent TB is warranted. Study intervention administration should be interrupted during the investigation. A positive QuantiFERON ®-TB test or tuberculin skin test result should be considered for the detection of latent TB. If the QuantiFERON ®-TB test result is indeterminate, the test should be repeated as outlined in the laboratory manual. Participants should be encouraged to return for all subsequent scheduled study visits according to the protocol. Participants who discontinue treatment for latent TB prematurel y or who are noncomp liant with therap y must immediately discontinue further administration of study intervention and be encouraged to return for all subsequent scheduled stud y visits according to the Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.3). 8.3. Adverse Events and Serious A dverse Events Timely , accurate, and complete reporting and analy sis of safety information from clinical studies are crucial for the protection of participants, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y information; all clinical studies conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates will be conducted in accordance with those procedures."

Serious adverse events, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator within 12weeks after the last dose of study intervention , must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. The sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously reported by an investigator beyond the time frame specified in the protocol. Serious Adverse Events All SAEs occurring during the study must be reported to the appropriate sponsor contact person by study -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event. Information regarding SAEs will be transmitted to the sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event Form and Safety Report Form of the eCRF, which must be completed and reviewed by a physician from the study -site and transmitted to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow -up reports of a serious adverse event should be transmitted electronically or by facsimile (fax). 8.3.2.

Pregnancy All initial reports of pregnancy in female participants or partners of male participants must be reported to the sponsor by the study -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. Any participant who becomes pregnant during the study must discont inue further study intervention (see Section 7, Discon tinuation of Study Intervention) . Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required 8.3.5. Events of Special Interest Any newly identified malignancy or case of active TB occurring after the first study intervention administration(s) in participants participating in this clinical study must be reported by the investigator according to the procedures in Appendix 6 (Section 10.6). Investigators are also advised that active TB is considered a reportable disease in most countries. These events are to be considered serious only if they meet the definition of an SAE. 8.4. Treatment of Overdose For this study , any dose of study intervention greater than the highest dose at a single dosing visit specified in this protocol will be considered an overdose. The sponsor does not recommend specific in tervention for an overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator or treating ph ysician should: Contact the medical monitor immediately . Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities. Document the quantit y of the excess do se in the eCRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 8.5. Pharmacokinetics Blood samples will be collected for the measurement of serum guselkumab concentrations at the timepoints presented in the Schedules of Activities.

Blood samples collected for serum guselkumab concentrations may also be used for exploratory biomarker anal yses. Evaluations At visits in which only serum concentration of guselkumab will be evaluated (ie, no antibodies to guselkumab will be evaluated), 1 venous blood sample of sufficient volume should be collected, and each serum sample should be divided into 2 aliquots: 1 for serum concentration of guselkumab and a back -up. At visits where serum concentration of guselkumab an d antibodies to guselkumab will be evaluated, 1 venous blood sample of sufficient volume should be collected. Each serum sample will be divided into 3 aliquots: 1 for serum concentration of guselkumab, 1 for antibodies to guselkumab, and 1 back -up. The exact dates and times of blood sample collection must be recorded in the laboratory requisition form. See the laboratory manual for further information regarding collection, handling, and shipment of biological samples. Genetic analyses will not be performed on these serum samples.

Genetics Samples for DNA anal ysis will not be collected in this study . 8.7. Biomarkers Biomarker assessment swill include the evaluation of relevant markers in serum for all participants . The samples will be used to better understand the biology of HS in the following ways:to provide mechanistic assessment of the pharmacod ynamic response of participants to treatment with guselkumab ,to analy ze differences betwee n responders and nonresponders, and to determine if the markers can be used to classify participants as potential responders prior to treatment. Samples will be collected pre-dose at Week 0, and at Weeks 4, 16, 40, and 48for serum biomarkers .Instructions for the collection and shipment of these samples are found in the laboratory manual . Serum samples will be analy zed for circulating factors such as cytokine s and other inflammatory markers (eg, IL-17A,IL-17F, IL-23, TNFα, IL-6, IL-22), and other categories of biomarkers potentially associated with the development and progression of HS or related to the guselkumab mechanism of action."

STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS Statistical analy sis will be done by the sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. A general description of the statistical methods to be used to anal yze the efficacy and safet y data is outlined below. Specific details will be provided in the SAP. 9.1. Statistical Hy potheses The primary hypothesis is that guselkumab treatment is superior to placebo as assessed by the proportion of participants achieving HiSCR at Week 16.More specifically , considering 2 guselkumab treatment arms in the study , the study willbe considered positive if one of the following h ypotheses are true: Guselkumab Regimen 1 (1200 mg IV q4w x3 → 200 mg SC q4w) demonstrates superior efficacy compared with placebo as measured b y HiSCR at Week 16 Guselk umab Regimen 2 (200 mg SC q4w x3→ 200 mg SC q4w) demonstrates superior efficacy compared with placebo as measured b y HiSCR at Week 16 The major secondary hypotheses are that guselkumab treatment is: Superior to placebo as assessed b y the change from baseline in total AN count at Week 16. Super ior to placebo as assessed by the improvement in PROs as measured by : The change from baseline in D LQI score at Week 16. The change from baseline in HS-related pain in the past 24 hours based onHSSD at Week 16. 9.2. Sample Size Determination This study is designed to enroll approximately 180 participants , primarily in order to provide adequate information to have sufficient power for the primary efficacy endpoint.

Simple descriptive summary statistics, such as n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, inter quantile range, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for discrete variables will be used to summarize most data. In general, for response efficacy endpoints, treatment comparisons will be performed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the baseline weight (≤95 kg, >95 kg) and baseline Hurley stage (I, II, and III). For continuous efficacy endpoints, treatment comparisons will be performed using either a Mixed -Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model or an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. All of the models will have treatment group, baseline weight (≤95 kg, >95 kg), baseline Hurley stage (I, II, and III),and baseli ne value as explanatory factors. The MMRM model will also include visit, treatment group by visit interaction, and baseline value by visit interaction as additional explana tory factors. In addition, treatment differences and their associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented. In case the number of subjects that are Hurley Stage I at baseline is much less than was expected, subjects that were Hurley Stage I will be pooled with subjects that were Hurley Stage II at baseline when baseline Hurley Stage is adjusted for in anal yses. In general, all statistical tests will be performed at a 2-sided significance level of α=0.05. In addition, graphical data display s (eg, line plots) and participant listings may also be used to summarize/present the data. Participants who discontinue study intervention due to lack of efficacy or an AE of worsening of HS, or who started a protocol -prohibited medication or therapy during the study that could improve HS are considered treatment failures. The baseline values will be assigned regardless of the observed data for continuous endpoints, zero will be assigned to improvement and percent improvement, and nonresponders status will be assigned to binary response variables. Lesions that received intervention will be counted as present after the visit of intervention. After appl ying the treatment failure rules, the remaining missing data will be assigned nonresponders status for binary variables.

Appendix 4 : Tuberculin Skin Testing Administering the Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test The Mantoux tuberculin skin test (CDC, 2000) is the standard method of identifying persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Multiple puncture tests (Tine and Heaf) should not be used to determine whether a person is infected because the amount of tuberculin injected intradermally cannot be precisely controlled. Tuberculin skin testing is both safe and reliable throughout the course of pregnancy. The Mantoux tuberculin test is performed by placing an intradermal injection of 0.1mL of tuberculin into the inner surface of the forearm. The test must be performed with tuberculin that has at least the same strength as either 5tuberculin units (TU) of standard purified protein derivative (PPD) -S or 2TU of PPD-RT23, Statens Seruminstitut, as recommended by the World Health Organization. PPD strengths of 1TU or 250TU are not acceptable (Menzies, 2000). Using a disposable tuberculin syringe with the needle bevel facing upward, the injection should be made just beneath the surface of the skin. This should produce a discrete, pale elevation of the skin (a wheal) 6mm to 10mm in diameter. To prevent needle -stick injuries, needles should not be recapped, purposely bent or broken, removed from disposable syringes, or otherw ise manipulated by hand. After they are used, disposable needles and syringes should be placed in puncture -resistant containers for disposal. Institutional guidelines regarding universal precautions for infection control (eg, the use of gloves) should be follow ed. A trained health care worker, preferably the investigator, should read the reaction to the Mantoux test 48 to 72 hours after the injection. Participants should never be allow ed to read their own tuberculin skin test results. If a participant fails to show up for the scheduled readin g, a positive reaction may still be measurable up to 1week after testing. How ever, if a participant who fails to return within 72 hours has a negative test, tuberculin testing should be repeated. The area of induration (palpable raised hardened area) around the site of injection is the reaction to tuberculin. For standardization, the diameter of the induration should be measured transversely (perpendicular) to the long axis of the forearm . Erythema (redness) should not be measured. All reactions should be recorded in millimeters, even those classified as negative. Interpreting the Tuberculin Skin Test Results In the US and many other countries, the most conservative definition of positivity for the tuberculin skin test is reserved for immunocompromised patients, and this definition is to be applied in this study to maximize the likelihood of detecting latent TB, even though the participants may not be immunocompromised at baseline. In the US and Canada, an induration of 5mm or greater in response to the intradermal tuberculin skin test is considered to be a positive result and evidence for either latent or active TB. In countries outside the US and Canada, country -specific guidelines forimmunocomprom ised patients should be consulted for the interpretation of tuberculin skin test results. If no local country guidelines for immunocompromised patients exist, US guidelines must be follow ed. Treatm ent of Latent Tuberculosis Local country guidelines for immunocompromised patients should be consulted for acceptable antituberculous treatment regimens for latent TB. If no local country guidelines for immunocompromised patients exist, US guidelines must be follow ed. References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Any work created in connection with performance of the study and contained in the data that can benefit from copy right protection (except any publication by the investigator as provided for below) shall be the propert y of the sponsor as author and owner of cop yright in such work. Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines, the sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary (multicenter) data and information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to publish study -site-specific data after the primary data are published. If an investigator wishes to publish information from the study ,a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review at least 60days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by the sponsor in writing, the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60days to allow for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity or regulatory compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The sponsor will not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress information. For multicenter study designs and sub-study approaches, secondary results generally should not be published before the primary endpoints of a study have been published. Similarly , investigators will recognize the integrity of a multicenter study by not submitting for publication data derived from the individual study -site until the combined results from the completed study have been submitted for publication, within 18months after the study end date, or the sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study publication. Authorship of publications resulting from this study will be based on the guidelines on authorship, such as those described in the ICMJE Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant contribution to the concep tion or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, orinterpretation of the data for the work; and drafted the work or revised it critically for important intellectual content; and given final approval of the version to be published; and"

Registration of Clinical Studies and Disclosure of Results The sponsor will regis ter and disclose the existence of and the results of clinical studies as required b y law. DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and study -site personnel before the study , periodic monitoring visits by the sponsor , and direct transmission of clinical laboratory data from a central laboratory into the sponsor's data base. Written instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples. The sponsor or designee will review the eCRF for accuracy and completeness during on-site monitoring visits and after transmissio n to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database they will be verified for accuracy and consistency with the data sources. CASE REPORT FORM COMPLETION Case report forms are prepared and provided by the sponsor for each participant in electronic format .All data relating to the study must be recorded in the eCRF. All eCRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by the investigator or authorized study -site personnel. The investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRF are accurate and correct. The study data will be transcribed by study-site personn el from the source documents onto an eCRF, if applicable. Study -specific data will be transmitted in a secure manner to the sponsor. Worksheets may be used for the capture of some data to facilitate completion of the eCRF. Any such worksheets will become part of the participant's source documents. Data must be entered into the eCRF in English. The eCRF must be completed as soon as possible after a participant visit and the forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit. If neces sary, queries will be generated in the eDC tool. If corrections to aneCRF are needed after the initial entry into the eCRF, this can be done in either of the following way s: Investigator and study -site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own initiative or as a response to an auto query (generated by the eDC tool). Sponsor or sponsor delegate can generate a query for resolution by the investigator and study -site personnel."

The author of an entry in the source documents should be identifiable. Specific details required as source data for the study and source data collection methods will be reviewed with the investigator before the study and will be described in the monitoring guidelines (or another equivalent document). The minimum source documentation requirements for Section 5.1, Inclusion Criteria and Section 5.2, Exclusion Criteria that specify a need for documented medical history are as follows: Referral letter from treating ph ysician or Complete history of medical notes at the site Discharge summaries Inclusion and exclusion criteria not requiring documented medical history must be verified at a minimum by participant interview or other protocol -required assessment (eg, physical examination, laboratory assessment) and documented in the source documents. An electronic source (eSource) system may be utilized, which contains data traditionally maintained in a hospital or clinic record to document medical care (eg, electronic source documents) as well as the clinical study -specific data fields as determined by the protocol. This data is electronically extracted for use by the sponsor. If eSource is utilized, references made to the eCRF in the protocol include the eSource system but information collected through eSource may not be limited to that found in the eCRF. MONITORING The sponsor designee will perform on -site monitoring visits as frequently as necessary . This will include blinded site monitors who will perform source data verification and review drug preparation and dispensation .The monitor will record dates of the visits in a study -site visit log that will be kept at the study -site, as allowed by local regulation. The first post-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the monitor will compare the da ta entered into the eCRF (as defined in the monitoring guidelines) with the source documents (eg,hospital/clinic/phy sician’s office medical records).

The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be available, the source documents will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. The monit or will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct. In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts will occur. It is expected that during these remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the study at the site. ON-SITE A UDITS Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality assurance department may visit the study -site at any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance with regulatory guidelines and company policy . These audits will require access to all study records, including source documents, for inspecti on. Participant privacy must, however, be respected. The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible for being present and available for consultation during routinely scheduled study -site audit visits conducted by the sponsor or its designees. Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by agents of any regulatory body, either as part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study in support of a regulatory submission. The investigator should immediately notify the sponsor if he or she has been contacted b y a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection. RECORD RETENTION In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all eCRF and all source documents that support the data collected from each participant, as well as all study documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial, and all study documents as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). The investigat or/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pend ing or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP.

Append ix 6: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS A ND CL ASSIFICA TIONS Adverse Event An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administere d a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention . An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. (Definition per ICH) This includes any occurre nce that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. Note: The sponsor collects AEs starting with the signing of the ICF(refer to All Adverse Events under Section 8.3.1 , Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Information, for time of last adverse event recording). Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose: Results in death Is life -threatening (The participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe ) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product Is Medicall y Important* *Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in decidi ng whether expedited reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should usually be considered serious."

For guselkumab , the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the I B. Adverse Event Associated with the Use of the Intervention An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the intervention if the attribution is possible, probable, or very likel yby the definitions listed below (see Attribution Definitions ). ATTRIBUTION DEFINITIONS Not Related An adverse event that is not related to the use of the intervention . Doubtful An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely , eg,concomitant treatment (s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely . Possible An adverse event that might be due to the use of the intervention . An alternative explanation, eg,concomitant treatment (s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore, the cau sal relationship cannot be excluded. Probable An adverse event that might be due to the use of the intervention . The relationship in time is suggestive (eg,confirmed by dechallenge). An alternative explanation is less likely , eg,concomitant treatment (s),concomitant disease(s). Very Likely An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonabl y explained by an alternative explanation, eg,concomitant treatment (s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very sug gestive (eg, it is confirmed by dechallenge and rechallenge). SEVERITY CRITERIA An assessment of severity grade will be made using the following general categorical descriptors: Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomf ort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity ."

Prevents normal every day activities. The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit y of events not directly experienced b y the participant (eg,laboratory abnormalities). SPECIA L REPORTING SITUA TIONS Safety events of interest on a sponsor study intervention inan interventional study that may require expedited reporting or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to: Overdose of a sponsor study intervention Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study intervention Accidental or occupational exposure to a spo nsor study intervention Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without participant /patient exposure to the sponsor study intervention , eg, name confusion) Exposure to a sponsor study intervention from breastfeeding Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page of the eCRF. PROCEDURES All Adverse Events All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severit y, or presumed relationship to study intervention , must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the eCRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (eg,cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as ""upper respiratory infection""). Investigators must record in the eCRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the adverse event to study therapy . All measures required for adverse event management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor instructions. For all studies with an outpatient period , including open -label studies, the participant must be provided with a ""wallet (study)card"" and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration of the study indicating the following: Study number Statement, in the local language(s), that the participant is participating in a clinical study Investigator's name and 24 -hour conta ct telephone number Local sponsor's name and 24 -hour contact telephone number (for medical staff only ) Site number"

Any event requiring hospitalization (or prolongation of hospitalization) that occurs during the course of a participant's participation in a study must be reported as a serious adverse event , except hospitalizations for the following: Hospitalizations not intended to treat an acute illness or adverse event (eg, social reasons such as pending placement in long -term care facility ). Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the eCRF). Note: Hospitaliza tions that were planned before the signing of the ICF, and where the underl ying condition for which the hospitalization was planned has not worsened, will not be considered SAEs . Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of the originall y planned ho spitalization is to be reported as a new serious adverse event. The cause of death of a participant in a study within 16 weeks of the last dose of study intervention , whether or not the event is expected or associated with the study intervention , is consid ered a serious adverse event.
