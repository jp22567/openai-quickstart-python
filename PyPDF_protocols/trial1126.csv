Open -label, evidence of activity, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), multiple dose study. Study Objectives The objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy and PK of multiple (SC) doses of APL -2 in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who have not received treatment with eculizumab in the past. An explor atory objective of the study is to assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple SC doses of APL -2 when administered to PNH patients. Study Population Subjects will: • be male and female (using contraception as specified in the protocol) and at least 18 yea rs old • have a diagnosis of PNH Number of Subjects The study will be conducted alongside the ongoing Phase Ib study APL2 -CP-PNH -204 (PADDOCK) to investigate APL -2 in PNH patients who have not previously received treatment with eculizumab. Safety and efficacy data from both studies will be used to support t he data obtained in the Phase III confirmatory study. Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled to complete 28 days of dosing."

Safety and efficacy data from both studies will be used to support the data obtained in the Phase III confirmatory study. Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled to complete 28 days of dosing (Part 1). Safety will be assessed throughout the study; serial blood and urine samples will be collected for these assessments. Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of APL -2 PK. Additional samples for assessmen t of PD will also be collected. The study will consist of four parts : • Part 1: subjects will receive APL -2 for 28 days. • Part 2A: subjects may continue to receive APL -2 for a further 56 days if there is evidence of clinical benefit following review of ava ilable safety, PK and PD data by the investigator and sponsor • Part 2B: subjects may continue to receive daily APL -2 treatment for up to 364 days if there is ongoing evidence of clinical benefit following review of the available safety, PK and PD data. • Part 3: Safety follow up Screening will take place within 30 days prior to the start of dosing on Day 1. Subjects will be entered into Part 1 of the study on Day 1 at a time designated by the PI. Research nurses or other appropriately qualified research perso nnel will administer the SC infusions for a minimum of 3 days (Days 1 -3) until the research nurse considers that the subject is both capable and confident to conduct self - administration. The subject will continue to self -administer infusions at the clini c on those days when a clinic visit occurs (Day 8, 15 and 22) and at an off -site location convenient to the subject on all other days up to Day 28 in Part 1. Following ongoing review of available safety, PK and PD data by the investigator and sponsor, subj ects showing evidence of clinical benefit may progress to Part 2A and then to Part 2B of the study and continue to receive daily doses of APL -2 until Day 84 and then until Day 364. Doses will be self -administered by the subject throughout this period at an off-site location convenient to the subject with the exception of Days 29, 36, 43, 57, 71, 85, 113, 141, 169, 197, 225, 253, 281, 309, and 337 where dosing is performed by the subject at the clinical site.

The subject population will be comprised of adult male and female subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) . 4.1.1 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria PNH is an acquired, clonal, non -malignant hematological disease characterized by complement - mediated RBC hemolysis with or without hemoglobinuria, an increased susceptibility to thrombotic episodes, and/or some degree of bone marro w dysfunction. The onset of PNH is often insidious. Although there have been reports of spontaneous remission, the course of the disease is generally chronic and progressive. It has been known for many years that PNH is caused by complement -mediated lysis of erythrocyte clones lacking functional CD55 and CD59 on their surface to protect them against this process . As such, these erythrocytes are particularly susceptible to the membrane attack complex (MAC) and have been shown to lyse readily in the pres ence of complement activation. Any therapy that effectively inhibits MAC formation is anticipated to be a plausible candidate - treatment for PNH . Indeed, eculizumab is a monoclonal anti -C5 antibody that inhibits the formation of the MAC, and eculizumab treatment has been approved for the treatment of this serious condition. However, inhibition of MAC formation does not appear to be sufficient to fully control the disease, as many PNH patients receiving eculizumab treatment still suffer from anemia, with only roughly 13% of patients being classified as complete responders, i.e. achieving transfusion independence and normal Hb levels . Most of the patients (53%) were classified as partial responders with decreased transfusion needs and reduced LD, and 33% of patients were poor responders, with unchanged transfusion ne eds and persistent symptoms (DeZern, 2013 ). Recent studies have suggested that significant opsonization of PNH erythrocytes by C3 fragments is observed in patients receiving eculizumab treatment. This ops onization is believed to cause the removal of erythrocytes by the spleen and the liver, resulting in extravascular hemolysis . Extravascular hemolysis can be significant in a subset of eculizumab -treated PNH patients and is considered to be the principal contributor to the lack of complete eculizumab response in most patients . It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that a treatment able to inhibit both MAC formation and C3 opsonization will provide improved therapeutic benefit to PNH patients compared to eculizumab. An overview of available information regarding APL -2 follows below . Further d etails can be found in the APL -2 Investigator’s Brochure ( Apellis Pharmaceuticals , June 2017 ). 4.1.2 APL-2 APL-2 is formed by a pentadecapeptide (combining a cyclic tridecapeptide active C3 -inhibiting moiety and a 2 -amino acid linker) covalently coupled to each end of a linear 40 kDa PEG chain, so there are two peptide moieties per molecule of APL -2. The peptide portion of the drug binds to complement C3 and is a broa d inhibitor of the complement cascade, a biological process that is part of innate immunity and is involved in multiple inflammatory processes. The PEGylation of the molecule imparts slower elimination from mammalian systems following administration. APL-2 injection (drug product) is a solution of APL -2 in 5% dextrose or a solution of APL -2 in acetate -buffered mannitol or a solution of APL -2 in acetate -buffered sorbitol for SC administ ration . APL-2 is being developed for the treatment of paroxysmal noc turnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)."
21,page_21,"Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL - Page 22 of 55 Protocol: APL2 -202 Version 3.0: 31 -JAN-2018 4.1.3 Nonclinical Data 4.1.3.1 Pharmacology Primary Pharmacology : Subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) doses of APL -2 were shown to be pharmacologically active (as measured by a drop in CH50) in monkeys as soon as 8 hours following initial administration and persisting up to 72 hours after the last dose. Ex vivo studies conducted with blood from PNH patients revealed that an APL -2 concentration of ≥100 µg/mL can protect PNH erythrocytes (RBCs) from complement -mediated lysis while simultaneously preventing RBC opsonization by C3 fragments. APL -2 was as effective as ec ulizumab, an anti -C5 monoclonal antibody approved for PNH, in protecting PNH erythrocytes against membrane attack complex -mediated hemolysis but, unlike eculizumab, APL -2 was also effective in preventing opsonization of those cells by C3 fragments. Safety Pharmacology: The potential for APL -2 to inhibit human ether -a-go-go gene (hERG) - encoded ion channels and pose a risk for cardiac arrhythmias indicates that such a risk is low. Similarly, no evidence of APL -2-related adverse effects on myocardial conducti on, cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and body temperature control mechanisms have been observed in either rabbits or monkeys. 4.1.3.2 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic (TK) assessments of APL -2 have been investigated after IV and SC a dministration to New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys . The PK behavior of APL -2 in rabbits and monkeys has been consistent with the expected PK behavior of a PEGylated peptide. APL -2 is readily absorbed from SC injections in both species , with an estimated bioavailability of approximately 85% in monkeys. Repeated administrations of APL -2 have indicated that absorption is non -linear at higher doses, and the potential for bioaccumulation exists. No gender -related differences have been obs erved in either species after 6 or 9 months of SC dosing in rabbits and monkeys, respectively. Terminal elimination half -lives (t 1/2), estimated during 4 -week, drug -free, recovery phases of the 28 -day SC studies were between 2.48 –2.78 days in rabbits and 6.29–8.25 days in monkeys. Similarly, the t 1/2 was estimated to be between 2.3 and 2.6 days in rabbits and 6.0 days in monkeys after two IV doses separated by 14 days. 4.1.3.3 Toxicology The toxicological potential of APL -2 has been investigated in repeat -dose to xicity studies in rabbits and monkeys across three routes of administration (SC, IV, IVT) under a testing strategy designed to facilitate differentiation between potential changes attributable to APL -2 per se and those attributable to the PEG40 domain of t he drug molecule. Daily subcutaneous administration of APL -2 and PEG40 for a duration of 6 months in rabbits and 9 months in monkey were associated with little systemic toxicity noted in either species beyond observations in the kidney (noted below). AP L-2 and PEG40 were weakly to mildly immunogenic in rabbits, but not significantly immunogenic in monkeys. Single - or multi -tissue (or multi -organ) macrophage vacuolation was consistently observed in both species, and generally comparable in incidence and severity between APL -2- and PEG40 -treated groups; thus, it was concluded the finding were caused by the PEG40 domain present within APL -2. Renal tubular degeneration was observed with a higher incidence in the monkey 9 -month study in APL -2-treated animals compared to the PEG40 -treated ones and was concluded to be APL -2 related. The no -observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL) for SC -administered APL -2 was <1 mg/kg/d in rabbits and approximately 7 mg/kg/d in monkeys after 6 - and 9 -month chronic dosing, respecti vely. Intravenous arms included in the 28 -day repeat -dose SC studies of APL -2 in rabbits and monkeys suggested that IV -administered APL -2 was well -tolerated in both species, with only vacuolation of"
22,page_22,"Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL - Page 23 of 55 Protocol: APL2 -202 Version 3.0: 31 -JAN-2018 tubular epithelial cells in the kidney observed microsco pically in rabbits (which, again, was deemed to be caused in part by the PEG40 domain of APL -2). IV APL -2 was mildly immunogenic in rabbits (albeit less than what was observed by the SC route), and without immunologic effects in monkeys. The no -observed -effect -level (NOEL) by the IV route of administration for both rabbits and monkeys was determined to be ≥42 mg/kg after two doses separated by 14 days. Repeated intravitreal administration (i.e. once every 4 weeks) of APL -2 to monkeys for up to 9 months wa s well -tolerated and revealed no drug -related systemic or ophthalmological changes . APL-2 may be minimally immunogenic when administered intravitreally, as evidenced by a single monkey having a marginal titer of APL -2 antibodies. The NOEL by the IVT rout e of administration for monkeys was determined to be ≥24.8 mg/eye. APL-2 has not demonstrated genotoxic potential in any in vitro or in vivo genotoxicity assays conducted, to date. 4.1.4 Clinical Data To date, two Phase I studies in healthy volunteers have been conducted in order to assess safety and PK parameters of APL -2 administered as single and multiple dose SC injection s and to guide dose selection for clinical studies in PNH subjects. A single Phase I single ascending dose study has evaluated intravenous dosing of APL -2 in healthy volunteers. A further five Phase I studies evaluating APL -2 delivered by SC injection are either planned or ongoing. These include two studies in healthy volunteers, a study in subjects with sever e renal impairment and two ongoing clinical studies in PNH patients. A phase II a study in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia is also ongoing. Table 1 summarises the information for all completed and ongoing studies evaluating systemic administration of APL -2.

24,page_24,"Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL - Page 25 of 55 Protocol: APL2 -202 Version 3.0: 31 -JAN-2018 Serum APL -2 concentrations generally increased linearly with dose. APL -2 was slowly absorbed into the systemic circulati on with median T max values between 4.5 and 6 days across the dose groups. APL -2 serum concentration declined in a steady mono -exponential manner with a consistent rate of decay across two studies for all dose groups. Both studies demonstrated a slow termin al elimination with median t½ values between 8 and 10 days. Plasma complement C3 increased with increasing dose and a general dose -dependent reduction in AP50 was observed following multiple dosing with APL -2. Pharmacodynamic (PD) observations were consist ent with a conclusion that APL -2 interacts with complement C3 and inhibits its activation. Further details can be found in the current APL -2 Investigator’s Brochure. 4.1.6 Ongoing Clinical Studies As of September 2017 t here were two ongoing Phase I clinical studies evalu ating SC administered APL-2 in PNH patients ( APL-CP0514 and APL -2-CP-PNH -204). An interim analysis has been performed for both studies with a data cut at 85 days of treatment for all subjects : 1. APL-2-CP-PNH -204 is a Phase Ib, open -label study in patients with PNH who are not receiving eculizumab. The study is comprised of 2 cohorts with three subjects in cohort 1 (180 mg/day APL -2) and at least 6 subjects in Cohort 2 (270 mg/day APL -2). Cohort 1 has completed and Cohort 2 is ongoing. Two of 3 subjects who have entered into Cohort 2 have completed 3 months of treatment with APL -2 270 mg/day. The third subject withdrew, for personal reasons, after receiving 29 days of treatment. A protocol amendment allowed intra -subject dose escalations up to 360 mg/day. Based on the clinical benefit observed, both subjects who continued dosing beyond 29 days were eligible to enter an extension phase (Part 2B ) allowing them to continue to receive dosing with APL -2 for up to 1 -year. One subject withdrew for personal reasons; 1 subject entered the extension phase and received daily doses of APL -2 for >8 months including doses of 360 mg for >3 months, but was diagnosed with a malignancy, unrelated to the study drug, and treatment was wit hdrawn in April 2017; the remaining subject continues to receive APL-2 270 mg/day. Based on the emerging data, a country specific protocol was submitted and the subject may continue dosing for up to 729 days. This stud y is currently being expanded into Asia. 2. APL-CP0514 is a Phase Ib, open -label study being conducted at multiple clinical sites in the United States to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of APL -2 as an add -on to eculizumab in subjects with PNH. The study is comprised of 4 cohorts in total; 3 cohorts (Cohorts 1 -3) with two subjects per cohort, and one cohort with six subjects (Cohort 4). Cohorts 1 to 3 have completed and Cohort 4 is ongoing. All six subjects in Cohort 4 completed at least 3 months of treatment with APL -2 270 mg/day. A protocol amendment allowed intra -subject dose escalations up to 360 mg/day. Based on the clinical benefit observed all subjects entered an extension phase allowing them to continue to receive dosing with APL -2 for up to 1 year. Two subjects have withdrawn from the study; 1 subject became pregnant and was withdrawn as per protocol and the 2nd subject was withdrawn following a number of adverse events related to other co -morbidities. Based on the emerging data, dosing will c ontinue for up to 729 days. Across the two studies in PNH patients, a total of 14 subjects with PNH have been dosed with APL-2, with 9 having received 270 mg/day for 28 day and 8 having received ≥270 mg/day for >3 months including 2 who have received 360 mg/day for 2 months. APL -2 has been generally well tolerated in these subjects. At approximately bi -monthly intervals, all safety data from each study is reviewed by members of an independent SMC who are responsible for providing recommendations with respec t to monitoring and continuation of the studies."
25,page_25,"Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL - Page 26 of 55 Protocol: APL2 -202 Version 3.0: 31 -JAN-2018 As of the 1st September 2017, there have been a total of seventeen SAEs reported in five out of fourteen subjects across the two studies. Of these, fourteen are considered to be unrelated/unlikely to APL -2 and three have been assigned a causality of ‘possibly related’ to APL -2 by the Sponsor. Those that are considered possibly related include hypersensitivity reaction, and two incidences of increased ALT in a single subject with a history of hepatobiliary di sease and similar ALT increases prior to study entry. Overall, SC administration of APL -2 in PNH patients in the two ongoing clinical studies has been generally safe and well tolerated. 4.2 Rationale 4.2.1 Purpose of the Study This study will investigate APL-2 in patients with PNH that have not received treatment with eculizumab in the past . The assessments of safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, and PD following administration of multiples doses of APL-2 will be added to the data generated in study APL2 -CP-PNH -204 to help guide decisions to further develop the drug. 4.2.2 Dose Selection The toxicological data accumulated from the animal studies were used to guide dose selection during the Phase I single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose studies in HVs (protocols APL-CP0713 -1 and APL -CP1014 respectively). In particular, the highest doses were selected based on exposure predicted by the PK model and compared with the exposures measured at the no observed adv erse effect level (NOAEL) in monkeys. The planned dose of APL -2 is 270 mg/d. Dose selection was based on targeting a level of complement C3 inhibition that will not reduce the levels of uncomplexed C3 (or free C3) to no less than about ~10 % of the normal levels of C3 (approximately 1.0 -1.3 g/L). The rationale for this limit was to preserve some level of complement activity required for adequate immune function. Using a Target Mediated Drug Disposition (TMDD) PKPD model ( Magar, 2001 ) the relationship betwee n APL-2 PK concentration and complement C3 binding has been well characterized. Subsequently, model predictions have been derived to investigate the APL -2 dose -response. Using this TMDD PKPD model, the predicted level of free C3 at the dose of 270 mg/d was calculated to be approximately 0.13 g/L. For comparison, at the higher dose of 360 mg/d the predicted level of free C3 is approximately 0.08 g/L, which is slightly below the self -determined limit of 0.1 -0.13 g/L. Dose selection is further supported by eme rging clinical data from PNH patients receiving daily doses of SC APL -2. To date, no safety issues have emerged that preclude further clinical investigation with the 270 mg/d dose. The proposed dose of 270 mg/d should not produce a significant increase in exposure when compared to the previous human experience of a bolus injection of 270 mg/d and is supported by the 28 -day repeat dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys (study 13CATX -004) and human PK data derived from the single - and multiple -dose ascen ding studies in healthy volunteers (protocols APL -CP0713 -1 and APL -CP1014). 4.3 Risk/Benefit A number of safety monitoring practices are required by this protocol (i.e. physical examination, vital signs, 12 -lead ECG, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, co agulation , prompt reporting of pre-defined AEs of special interest , and AE questioning) in order to protect the subjects’ safety. Injection/infusion site and pump use safety will be assessed during clinical visits, and any significant finding from the assessment will be reported as an AE (see Section 11 )."

If dose is increased during part 2B, additional blood draws will be required . Systemic complement inhibition might predispose individuals to infections caused by encapsulated organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria meningitides , and Haemophilus influenzae . Prophylactic antibiotic therapy (ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID) will be prescribed to all subjects from Day 1 (commencing after first administration of APL -2 and the subsequent post -dose PK sample and ECG) to Day 14. At Day 15 all subje cts will discontinue treatment with ciprofloxacin and receive vaccinations, if required, against Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria meningitides A, C, W, Y and B , and Haemophilus influenza . Prophylactic antibiotic therapy (penicillin V 500 mg twice a day ) will be prescribed to all subjects from Day 15 and will be taken by subjects until 14 days after the final dose of APL -2 to minimize potential infection risk. Body temperature and vital signs will be monitored periodically and relevant blood parameters monitored regularly throughout the study to assess for signs of infection. The principal investigator (PI) should be contacted immediately in the event of a suspected infection despite prophylactic antibiotic treatment for guidance and appropriate action t o be taken. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on beta -lactam antibiotic (e.g . penicillin, amoxicillin, etc .) therapy. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a histo ry of penicillin hypersensitivity . Before initiating therapy with penicillin V, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins or cephalosporins . Patients with a known hypersensitivity to penicillin/amoxici llin may be prescribed erythromycin 500 mg twice daily or Azithromycin 500 mg 3 times per week as alternative treatments at the outset as an alternative treatment at the outset (see Section 8.4 for details). Other frequently reported adverse effects in patients taking penicillin are diarrhea/loose stools, nausea, skin rashes , urticaria and vomiting . Patients should , therefore, be advised that th ese reaction s may occur . Treatment may be switched to erythromycin 500 mg twice daily or Azithromycin 500 mg 3 times per week (see Section 8.4 for detail s) if there is evidence of penicillin - related intolerability (such as nausea and diarrhea) . There is an anticipated health benefit for trial participants from receipt of study drug . At the proposed dose levels of APL -2, a significant decrease in complement -mediated hemolytic activity was observed in all APL -2-treated subjects (both treatment -naïve and treated previously with eculizumab) in PNH Phase Ib studies and in HV studies. APL -2 is therefore expected to reduce complement -mediated hemolytic activity in PNH patients. In this context , a careful evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio should be made . APL-2 at the proposed doses has been deemed safe for up to 9 months of administration in preclinical and 28 days in healthy volunteer studies. In addition, in both studies in subjects with PNH (See Section 4.1.4 ), ongoing treatment with APL -2 270 mg/day has been well -tolerated and has provided clinical benefit to subjects either alone or as an add -on to eculizumab . Based on this data we propose to continue to administer APL -2 to PNH patients for up to 364 days ( 1 year ). See Planned Dose Levels and Dosing Schedule in Section 8.3.2 . If efficacious and safe, APL -2 is expected to continue to improve Hb levels and reduce transfusion dependency in these subjects throughout the treatment period of 364 days . Subjects will be assessed by the Investigator every month for Part 2A and Part 2B. The available safety, PK and PD data will be reviewed by the Investigator and Sponsor on an ongoing basis. If the dose of APL - 2 is increased to above 270 mg/day, the subject will be assessed by the investigator every 2 weeks (recorded as unscheduled visits ) for the first 6 weeks after the dose increase, subjects will then revert to appropriate time intervals for site visits according to the protocol schedule. APL-2 will only be continued in the absence of any safety concerns and with evidence of clinical benefit to the subject , as determined by the Investigator and the Sponsor."

STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 5.1 Study Objectives The objective s of the study are to assess safety, tolerability , preliminary efficacy and PK of multiple SC doses of APL -2 in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who have not received treatment with eculizumab (Soliris) ® in the past . An exploratory objective of the study is to assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple SC doses of APL -2 when administered to PNH subjects . See “Study Endpoints” in Section 5.2 . 5.2 Study Endpoints Primary Safety Endpoint: The primary safety endpoints of the study are the number and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) following administration of multiple doses of SC APL -2. Primary Efficacy Endpoints: • Change from baseline in LD • Change from baseline in Haptoglobin • Change from baseline in Hb Secondary E ndpoints: • APL-2 plasma concentrations (and PK parameters as appropriate) • Change from baseline in FACIT Fatigue Scale score • Change from baseline in reticulocyte count • Change from baseline in total bilirubin • Number of RBC transfusions per month • Change from baseline in Linear Analog Scale Assessment (LASA) for Qua lity of Life Exploratory PD markers include: • Complement (CH50, AP50, and C3) levels • C3 deposition on RBC cells • Clonal distribution of PNH RBCs 6. STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase I Ia, open -label, multiple dose, study in patients with PNH who have not received eculizumab (Soliris ®) in the past . A single cohort of subjects is planned for evaluation. Safety will be assessed throughout the study; serial blood and urine samples will be collected for these assessments. Blood samples will be collected for the assessm ent of APL -2 PK. Additional samples for assessment of PD will also be collected. The study will consist of four parts; • Part 1: Subjects will receive APL -2 for 28 days."

Subjects will be entered into Part 1 of the study on Day 1 at a time designated by the PI. Research nurses or other appropriately qualified research personnel will administer the SC infusions for a minimum of 3 days (Days 1 -3) until the research nurse cons iders that the subject is both capable and confident to conduct self - administration. The subject will continue to self -administer infusions at the clinic on those days when a clinic visit occurs (Day 8, 15 and 22) and at an off -site location convenient t o the subject on all other days up to Day 28 in Part 1. Following review of available safety, PK and PD data by the investigator and sponsor subjects demonstrating clinical benefit from the treatment may progress to Part 2A of the study and continue to rec eive daily doses of APL-2 until Day 84, and then may progress to Part 2B of the study and continue to receive daily doses of APL -2 until Day 364. Doses will be self -administered throughout this period at an off -site location convenient to the subject with the exception of Days 29, 36, 43, 57, 71, 85, 113, 141, 169, 197, 225, 253, 281, 309, and 337 where dosing is performed by the subject at the clinical site . If a subject has a sub -optimal clinical response during daily dosing with 270 mg APL-2, the dose ma y be increased up to 360 mg/day during part 2A, and doses will be administered at the clinical site every 2 weeks for the first 6 weeks after commencing the higher dose. After the conclusion of the treatment period (Day 364), subjects will enter Part 3 of the study and return to the clinical site for follow -up study procedures on Day 365, 379, and 393 and final study procedures at an Exit Visit on Day 414. See Study Flowchart in Section 2 . The planned length of participation in the study for each subject is approximately 444 days (from Day –30 through completion of the Day 414 Exit visit procedures). Interim PK and PD analyses may be performed to recons ider the sampling time points as the study progresses . An independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will assess the progress and cumulative safety/tolerability data of the study on a regular basis . Continuation of treatment – Decision scheme 7. SUBJECT SELECTION The study will be conducted alongside the ongoing Phase Ib study APL2 -CP-PNH -204 (PADDOCK) to investigate APL -2 in PNH patients who have not previously received treatment with eculizumab. Safety and efficacy data from both studies will be used to support the data obtained in the Phase III confirmatory study. Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled to complete 28 days of dosing ."

31,page_31,"Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL - Page 32 of 55 Protocol: APL2 -202 Version 3.0: 31 -JAN-2018 Cohort Planned dosing schedule Single cohort 270 mg/day (up to 360 mg/day from Day 29) from Day 1 to Day 364* * The dose may be increased up to 360 mg/day during Part 2A if the clinical response is sub -optimal. The volume to be administered will depend on the final concentration provided and will be administered as a SC infusion. The dose for this study was determined based on safety, PK, and PD data from the ongoing studies in PNH patients. Intra-subject d ose escalations will be agreed by the Investigator and Sponsor and will be implemented on an individual subject basis and not necessarily applied acro ss all subjects in the cohort. The dose for an individual subject will n ot exceed 360 mg/day (estimated to reach approximately 85 % of the C max of the NOAEL observed in monkeys ) without a protocol amendment . 8.3.3 Drug Administration All doses will be administered as SC infusions. The preferred site of injection will be the abdomen ; however, if a subject does not tolerate administration into the abdomen alternative sites may be selected e.g. thigh or upper arm . Subjects will self-administer the SC infusions after receiving appropriate training by a research nurse or other study personnel. The injections will be administered at the clinic on those days when a clinic visit occurs and at an off -site location convenient to the sub ject on all other days. Doses will be administered while subjects are seated. Dosing records will be maintained at the clinical site and available for review by the sponsor. 8.4 Concomitant Medications 8.4.1 Prophylactic antibiotics Prophylactic antibiotic therapy will be prescribed to all subjects to minimize potential infection risk. Prophylactic antibiotics will be initiated on day 1 following administration of APL-2 dosing and continue until 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.4.1.1 Primary pr ophylactic antibiotic Day 1 -14 • Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily, initial administration on Day 1 will take place at the initial APL-2 dosing , following ECG collection postdose. 8.4.1.2 Primary prophylactic antibiotic Day 15 onwards • Penicillin V 500 mg twice daily Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on beta -lactam antibiotic (e.g . penicillin, amoxicillin, etc .) therapy. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals wi th a history of penicillin hypersensitivity. Before initiating therapy with penicillin V, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins or cephalosporins. If subjects have a known hypersensitivity to penicilli n/amoxici llin they may be prescribed an alternative antibiotic at the outset. Other frequently reported adverse effects in patients taking penicillin are diarrhea/loose stools, nausea, skin rashes and urticaria , and vomiting . Patients should, therefore, be advised that the se reactions may occur."

The PI should be contacted immediately in the event of a suspected infection despite prophylactic antibiotic treatment for guidance and appropriate action to be taken . Action to be taken may include administration of a broad spectrum antibiotic to cover possible resistant organisms such as resistant pneumococcus (e.g. levofloxacin ). 8.4.3 Vaccinations Vaccination against Neisseria meningitides types A, C, W, Y and B, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae Type B (Hib) is required to participate in this study, either within 2 years prior to Day 1 dosing, or within 14 days after starting treatment with APL -2. If required i.e. not previously vaccinated subjects will receive vaccinations against Neisseria meningitides types A, C, W, Y and B, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae Type B (Hib). If the subject’s first documented Neisseria meningitidis vaccine/s are administered at Day 15, a booster (for both vaccinations) should be administered after 2 months. If Pneumococcal vaccination is required, a dose of PCV13 will be administered at Day 15 and a dose of PPSV23 will be administered at least 8 weeks later (u nless documented evidence exists that subjects are non - responders to vaccination as evidenced by titers or display titer levels within acceptable local limits). The PI will discuss with the Sponsor in regard to specific patient requirements 8.4.4 Iron Supplement s For subjects receiving iron supplement s at the time of APL -2 initiation, iron supplement doses should be maintained stable th roughout the study unless iron levels (ferritin and TIBC) increase to unaccepatable levels above ULN during the study . Change in dose of iron supplementation should be discussed with the Sponsor prior to implemntation 8.4.5 Phlebotomy/Venesection for iron overload Phlebotomy/Venesection should only be considered if the Hb is with in the normal range and may only be initiated if the need and frequency have been discussed and agreed to with the Sponsor. 9. STUDY PROCEDURES Please see the Study Flow Chart in Section 2 for a summary of the schedule of study participation and procedures. The schedule of visit dates should be established, either, prior to, or at the time of screening allowing subjects an opportunity to assess whether there are likely to be significant conflicts with other activities or planned absences.

The SMC will have the responsibility to conduct a thorough safety assessment at regular intervals during the treatment phase of the study . A key responsibility of the SMC will be to decide whether to continue or modify the study based on recommendations by the sponsor and upon an evaluation of emerging safety and efficacy data. The first SMC meeting will be scheduled within 3 months after the first subject is randomized, and a future intervals presented within the SMC charter . Regular or ad hoc SMC data reviews may be recommended by the SMC or requested by the Sponsor. If efficacious and safe, APL -2 may reduce LD levels, improve Hb levels and reduce transfusion dependency in these patients. The SMC will be responsible for review ing individual subject data to understand if there is a health benefit in these individuals at any time during the treatment period. If a benefit is observed the SMC may recommend extending the treatment beyond 364 days either through a protocol amendment or an extension study. The remit, roles, and responsibilities of the SMC will be specified in a separate SMC charter. 9.7 Removal of Subjects from the Study Subject participation in this study may be discontinued for any of the following reasons: 1. Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the subject to substantial risk and/or doe s not allow the subject to adhere to the requirements of the protocol. 2.

In addition, ECG parameters of ventricular rate, PQ or PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval (correcte d using both Bazett’s and Fr idericia’s method and uncorrected) will be noted on the CRF . All CS findings will be recorded as AEs. 10.1.5 Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Fatigue Scale The FACIT Fatigue Scale is a 13 item Likert scaled instrument which is self-administered by the subjects during clinic visits on as outlined in the Study Flow Chart in Section 2 . The subject is presented with 13 statements and is asked to indicate their response as it applies to the past 7 days. The 5 possible responses are ‘Not at all’ (0), ‘A little bit (1), ‘Somewhat’ (2), ‘Quite a bit’ (3) and ‘Very much’ (4) . With 13 statemen ts the total score has a range of 0 to 52 . Before calculating the total score , some responses are reversed to ensure that the higher score corresponds to a higher quality of life. The FACIT Fatigue Scale and scoring guidelines are provided in the Manual of Procedures (MOP). 10.1.6 Linear Analog Scale Assessment (LASA) for Quality of Life The Linear Analog Scale Assessment (LASA) consists of three items asking respondents to rate their perceived level of functioning. Specific domains include activity level, ability to carry out daily activities, and an item for overall QOL. A representation of the scale is presented in Appendix 2 (see Appendix 2 ). LASA is self -administered by the subjects during clinic visits as outlined in the Schedule of Events in Section 2 . Scores for the three individual components of the scale and the combined score will be included in the analysis and this will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 10.1.7 Clinical Lab oratory Tests All tests listed below will be performed as outlined in the Study Flow Chart in Section 2 .

FSH will be performed for postmenopausal females at screening only. 10.1.8 Injection / Infusion Site and Pump Safety Assessment On the days of clinical visits, an assessment of the APL -2 injection site, and pump use safety will be performed within 30 minutes after study drug administration. The assessment will be performed by a physician or other licensed health care provider (e.g. study nurse) as delegated by the investigator. The injection site and the surrounding area will be inspected for redness, swelling, induration, and bruising; and the subject will be asked about the presence of pain and/or tenderness, and any issue related to pump use. The date, time, and outcome of the injection site assessment will be recorded on the source documents and CRFs. Subjects will be trained to notify the PI or other study personnel in the event that an injection site reaction occurs after self -administration of APL -2. All clinically signficant findings , as determined by the investigator, from injection site or related to pump use will be recorded as AEs. 10.2 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 10.2.1 Blood Sampling and Processing Blood samples for PK assessment o f APL -2 will be collected via direct venipuncture at the time points delineated in the Study Flow Chart in Section 2 . On Day 1 only, a PK sample will be taken pre-dose and at a minimum of 2.5 hours post -dose (or later depending on how long the subject is kept at the clinic) . All PK samples on other study days will be collected pre -dose. Instructions for collection, handling, processing, storage, and shipping of samples will be provided in a separate sample ha ndling manual prior to study initiation."

The methods used and the results obtained will be included in the final report as an appendix. 10.3 Flow Cytometry Assessments Blood samples will be collected via direct venipuncture at the time points delineated in the Study Flow Chart in Section 2 . Flow cytometry assessment will include, but not be limited to: PNH clona l distribution of RBCs, CD71+ immature reticulocytes, monocytes and granulocytes and C3 deposition on RBCs. Instructions for collection, handling, processing, storage, and shipping of samples will be provided in a separate sample handling manual prior to study initiation. 10.4 Pharmacodynamic Assessments Blood samples will be collected via direct venipuncture at the time points delineated in the Study Flow Chart in Section 2 . for PD assessment of complement activation through the classical (e.g., CH50) and alternative (e.g., A P50) pathway s. Blood sample s will also be collected to measure C3 levels. Other relevant PD markers may also be assessed. Instructions for collection, handling, processing, storage, and shipping of samples will be provided in a separate Laboratory Reference M anual prior to study initiation. 10.5 Anti- APL-2 Antibody Assessment Patients who test positive for anti -APL-2 antibodies at any time will be followed with ADA samples being collected every 6 month s until the antibody levels revert to baseline. Samples that test positive will be characterized by an assay that will determine antibody titer, binding to the cyclic peptide or PEG domains, and measure neutralizing capacity. The proposed ADA sampling sch edule was established to capture the ADA signal at baseline, along with any potential early onset and the dynamic profile (transient or persistent) of antibody formation while minimizing APL -2 level in the sample."

A follow up urine pregnancy test will be performed on Day 1 pre-dose (a negative urine pregnancy test must be received before dosing with study drug) . A urine pregnancy test will also be performed at each site visit (pre-dose ) if applicable . A final urine pregnancy test will be performed at the final Exit Visit. Male subjects will be counseled to avoid donating sperm after dosing on Day 1 until the final Exit Visit. 11. ADVERSE EVENTS 11.1 Definitions An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not consi dered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Adverse events include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre -existing conditions . Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened should be recorded on the medical history eCRF and not reported as an AE. However, if that condition deteriorates or severity changes at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. Any AEs that occur prior to dosing on Day 1 will be categorized as pre -treatment events. Treatment -emergent adverse events (TE AEs) will be defined as those AEs that occur after dosing on Day 1 and up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication. A suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE . Reasonable pos sibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE."
41,page_41,"Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL - Page 42 of 55 Protocol: APL2 -202 Version 3.0: 31 -JAN-2018 11.2 Recording Adverse Events Subjects will be monitored for adverse events throughout the study. Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the study subjec t, or discovered by the study staff during physical examinations, or by asking open, non -leading questions (e.g. “How have you been feeling since the last clinic visit?”) . Subjects will be instructed to inform the investigator and/or study staff of any AEs that may occur at any time during the study. All AEs occurring from screening through the final Exit visit will be recorded in detail in the source documents and documented on the appropriate AE or SAE eCRF . The nature of the AE, date (and time, if known) of AE onset, duration, severity, and action taken will be documented, together with the PI’s assessment of the seriousness of the AE and relationship to study drug . All AEs should be recorded in the study sub ject’s own words (verbatim), unless in the opinion of the PI, the AE constitutes a recognized condition, disease, or syndrome . In that case, the condition, disease or syndrome should be named rather than the individual symptoms . The AEs will be coded using the current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Outcome will be recorded as: • Ongoing • Resolved • Resolved with sequela • Death or • Unknown 11.3 Assessment of Adverse Events Each AE will be assessed by the PI or physician designee with regard to the categories discussed in the sections below. 11.3.1 Intensity The PI will determine the severity of each AE . AEs will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 . The following definitions for rating severi ty will be used: Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)*. Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life - threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL**. Note : An experience may be severe but may not be serious , e.g., severe headache). Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE • A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade. • *Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. • **Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden."
42,page_42,"Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL - Page 43 of 55 Protocol: APL2 -202 Version 3.0: 31 -JAN-2018 When changes in intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum intensity for the event should be noted for that day . Any change in severity of signs and/or symptoms over a number of days will be captured and recorded as a new AE, with the amended severity grade, and the date and time (if known) of the change. 11.3.2 Causality The relationship of an AE to the study drug will be assessed using the following criteria: Definitely Related • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with plausible time relationship to drug intake • Cannot be explained by disease or other drugs • Response to withdrawal plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically) • Event definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically (i.e. an objective and specific medical disorder or a recognized pharmacological phenomenon) • Rechallenge satisfactory, if necessary Possibly Related • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake • Could also be explained by disease or other drugs • Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear Unlikely Related • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible) • Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations Not Related • Event or laboratory test abnormality, is plausibly related to the participant’s clinical state, underlying disease, or the study procedure/conditions • Time relationship to drug intake makes a relationship unreasonable • Other obvious causes for event or laboratory test abnormality exist Unknown • Report suggests an adverse e vent, however, cannot be judged at this time because information is insufficient or contradictory • More data for proper assessment is needed, or additional data is under examination 11.3.3 Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death; • Is life -threatening: this means that the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not mean that the event might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form; • Required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; • Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitaliz ation, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding if an AE is serious and if expe dited reporting is appropriate."
43,page_43,"Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CONFIDENTIAL - Page 44 of 55 Protocol: APL2 -202 Version 3.0: 31 -JAN-2018 11.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Event The reporting period for adverse even ts begins as soon as the subject’s written consent to participate in the study has been obtained, and continues through the final Exit visit , or 30 days after the final dose of study medication . The PI is responsible for reporting all SAEs to the Safety Monitor, whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug. If an SAE occurs, the PI should complete and sign the SAE Report Form, and fax or email it to the Safety Monitor at the number /address which will be provided separately to the invest igator sites, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event: The initial SAE Report should include, at a minimum, the following information: • Study number • Subject number/ID • Gender • Date of birth • Name of PI and full clinical site address • Details of SAE • Criterion for classification as “serious” • Study drug name and treatment start date • Date of SAE onset • Causality assessment (if sufficient informa tion is available to make this determination) The Safety Monitor , or designee, will request clarification of omi tted or d iscrepant information from the initial report . The PI or designee is responsible for emailing or faxing the requested information to the Safety Monitor within 24 hours of the request. Initial reports of SAEs must be followed later with detailed d escriptions, including clear copies of supporting documents as necessary (e.g. hospital discharge summary, laboratory reports, autopsy reports, etc .), with the subject’s personal identifiers removed. If a new SAE Report Form is faxed, the PI must sign and date the form. The PI must report all SAEs to the IRB/IEC according to the institutional IRB/IEC policy. 11.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest An adverse event of special interest is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the Spons or’s product or program where ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the PI to the Sponsor may be appropriate . These adverse events may be serious or non -serious . Applicable adverse events may require further investigation in order to characterize a nd understand, and depending upon the nature of the event, rapid communication by the trial Sponsor to other parties may also be required . These adverse events of special interest must be reported promptly to the sponsor. The adverse events of special inte rest include the following: • Local or systemic infection of any origin • Thrombosis • Clinically significant decrease in kidney function • Injection site reactions If an adverse event of special interest occurs in a study subject , the study subject will be follow ed for resolution of the adverse event . A decision will be made by the Sponsor concerning further exposure to the study treatment and further participation in the study."

For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of increased severity) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzym es or hepatitis. The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting any serious and unexpected adverse events to the applicable re gulatory agencies as required. 11.7 Treatment and Follow up of Adverse Events AEs (whether serious or non -serious), including clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values, w ill be evaluated by the Investigator and treated and/or followed up until the symptoms or value(s) return to baseline or are clinically stable . Treatment of AEs will be performed by appropriately trained medical personnel, either at the clinical site or at a nearby hospital emergency room . When appropriate, medical tests and/or examinations will be performed to document resolution of the event(s). AEs continuing after completion of the study will be followed up by telephone or with visits per the discretio n of the PI. If possible, the outcome of any AE that caused discontinuation from the study or was present at the end of the study should be reported, particularly if the AE was considered by the PI to be related to the study drug. 11.8 Pregnancy Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, the outcom e of a pregnancy, if there is a spontaneous abortion, congenital anomaly or other adverse fetal outcome, may be an SAE. All SAEs are to be reported to the study sponsor on the SAE Reporting Form. Pregnancies wil l be reported using a pregnancy report form. WOCBP and males with female partners of child -bearing potential will be instructed to practice an acceptable method of birth control (as defined in Section 7 .1.1) for the duration of the study. If a female subject or partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the study, the PI should report the pregnancy to the Safety Monitor within 24 hours of being notified. The subject or partner should be followed by the PI until completion of the pregnancy . At the completion of the pregnancy, the PI will document and report the outcome . If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for classification as an SAE (i.e. postpartum complication, stillbirth, neonatal death, or con genital anomaly) the PI should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE ( Section 11.4 ). 12. STATISTICS 12.1 Sample Size Justification The study will be conducted alongside the ongoing Phase Ib study APL2 -CP-PNH -204 (PADDOCK) to investigate APL -2 in PNH patients who have not previously received treatment with eculizumab. Safety and efficacy data from both studies will be used to support the data obtained in the Phase III confirmatory study. Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled to complete 28 days of dosing . The sample size is considered sufficient to obtain useful safety, tolerability, PD and PK data to support the clinical program . 12.2 Statistical Analysis Methodology A formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) wil l be developed and finalized prior to locking the database . The full details of data presentation s and analys es will be provided therein . Additional statistical analyses other than those described in this section may be performed if deemed"

Baseline will be taken as the last measurement prior to the start of dosing. For transfusions baseline will be taken from the 12 month transfusion history. 12.2.2.4 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints Plasma concentrations of APL -2 will be determined from multiple samples taken between Day 1 and the Exit Visit . 12.2.2.5 Explorat ory Pharmacodynamic Endpoints (Markers) Changes from baseline and percentage changes from baseline will be calculated for each of the complement parameters (CH50, A P50 and C3) , C3 deposition on RBC cells and clonal distribution of PNH RBCs . Baseline will b e taken as the last measurement prior to the start of dosing . 12.2.3 Safety Analyses All safety endpoints will be evaluated using the Safety Population . 12.2.3.1 Adverse Events Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) are defined as those AEs that develop or worsen after the first dose of study medication and up to 30 days beyond the last dose of study medication. The current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to classify all AEs. TEAE will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term . Tabulations will be produced for all TEAEs , for those considered potentially treatment related (causality to study drug is reported as possibly or probably, or where causality is not reported) and for TEAE of special interest . Number of su bjects reporting SAEs will also be tabulated. A by-subject TEAE data listing, including verbatim term, preferred term, treatment, severity, and investigator judgment of relationship to treatment, will be provided. 12.2.3.2 Clinical Laboratory Tests A by-subject l isting will be provided including changes from baseline. Laboratory values that are outside the laboratory reference range will be flagged. 12.2.3.3 Vital Signs and ECGs Observed and change from baseline values for vital sign and ECG parameter will be listed.

Absolut e values, changes from baseline and percentage changes from baseline (where appropriate) will be summarised, using descriptive statistics, by study visit. Data will be plotted by study day. The number of RBC transfusions per month and number of units trans fused per month will be summarized over the study. 12.2.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses The PK concentrations will be evaluated using the PK Population . Individual concentration over time profile plots will be presented. Median profiles of the concentration -time data, using nominal sampling times, will also be presented. Both linear -linear and linear -log plots will be presented. APL-2 concentrations will be summarized by study visit using descriptive statistics. Where appr opriate, steady -state PK parameters for APL ‐2 will be estimated from the individual serum concentrations -time data, using actual sample times using a non -compartmental approach. PK parameters will include: AUCt otal: The area under the serum concentration v ersus time curve, from time 0 (pre-dose Day 1) to the last measurable concentration (t) at the end of study . Ctrough, max: Maximum observed pre-dose serum concentration. PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics. PK data will be combined with the prior data collected in earlier clinical studies and then used to update the APL -2 population PK model (Apellis Data on File). 12.2.6 Pharmacodynamic Analyses The PD parameters will be evaluated using the PD Population . Absolute values, changes from baseline and percentage changes from baseline will be summarised, using descriptive statistics, by study visit. Individual parameter over time profile plots will be presented . Median profiles over time, using nominal sampling times, wi ll also be presented. 12.2.7 Handling of Dropouts and/or Missing Data No imputation of missing data for early terminations will be performed. Where appropriate screen values may be used as baseline in the event of missing Day 1 measurements. Missing dates/times will be reviewed on a case by case basis for potential imputations, but the original data will always be presented in data listings. PK concentration values below the limit of quantification will take the value of 0 in individual linea r- linear profile plots and the limit of quantification in linear -log profile plots. 12.2.8 Other Data Analyses Demographic data, baseline characteristics, p hysical examination, concomitant medication and medical history data will be listed.
