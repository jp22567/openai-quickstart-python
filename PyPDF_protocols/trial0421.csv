Achromatopsia resulting from mutations in CNGAœØ has several characteristics that make it an appropriate candidate disease to demonstrate proofÕ≤ofÕ≤principle in a firstÕ≤inÕ≤man trial of gene therapy for photoreceptor disease. Effective improvement in cone photoreceptor function, which is otherwise absent Õæor markedly reducedÕø in this condition, would provide a clear, rapid and reliable measure of outcome. In addition, Achromatopsia is largely nonÕ≤progressive and the extended survival of cones, despite their profound lack of function, presents a wide window of opportunity during which gene supplementation could lead to significant benefit in coneÕ≤mediated vision. Although younger children may benefit most from gene supplementation therapy by virtue of their greater visual plasticity, we anticipate that the intervention may offer benefit across a range of ages and we aim to define this range. For this reason, participants of a range of ages will be included.

Õ∂«§Õ≥«§Õ∂ Ra¬ñi¬ë¬êa¬ée In CNGAœØÕ≤related Achromatopsia, delivery of a cDNA sequence encoding a functional CNGAœØ protein using gene supplementation could lead to measurable improvements in visual function within œ≤ months. There is currently no effective treatment available for most hereditary retinal disorders including Achromatopsia. This condition is characterised by absent Õæor markedly reducedÕø cone function resulting in profound reduction in visual acuity, complete lack of Õæor markedly reducedÕø colour vision, marked photophobia and nystagmus. The CNGAœØ gene encodes the alpha subunit of the cone photoreceptorÕ≤specific cGMPÕ≤gated cation channel, which is critical for cellular responses to light. Absence of this alpha subunit results in absentÕ¨extremely poor cone function and hence very poor daylight vision. Although loss of cone photoreceptor cells may occur in a limited number of patients, the rate of cell death is very slow, resulting in retinas containing surviving but nonÕ≤functioning cones. Improvement of cone function by provision of CNGAœØ could provide a clear, rapid and reliable measure of outcome. Furthermore, the relatively nonÕ≤progressive nature of Achromatopsia, with extended survival of cone photoreceptors, means that the window of opportunity for effective intervention by gene supplementation may extend into adulthood. However, since Achromatopsia results in marked visual impairment from birth, associated abnormal development of physiological coneÕ≤dependent neuronal circuits, including that of the visual cortex, may limit the potential for older individuals to benefit from therapeutic restoration of retinal function. Since visual cortical plasticity is known to be greater in younger children, we will recruit children into the dose escalation phase of the study to provide the greatest opportunity for benefit. The totality of the data from paediatric subjects enrolled in the UK and adult subjects enrolled in the U.S. in this dose escalation study will be reviewed and inform the design of a future Phase ll interventional trial prior to its initiation.

The condition is currently untreatable, but there is a real possibility that gene therapy could offer a significant benefit in terms of improved sight and quality of life ÕæQOLÕø, based on own experience from the existing clinical trials for ocular gene therapy, subsequent ocular gene therapy trials elsewhere ÕæMaguire, et al œÆœ¨œ¨œ¥; Cideciyan, AV et al œÆœ¨œ¨œ¥ and œÆœ¨œ≠œØÕø, the ongoing programme of work in ocular gene therapy trials investigating the safety and efficacy of CNGBœØ as a treatment for Achromatopsia, and preÕ≤clinical data demonstrating improved outcome in both CNGBœØÕ≤ and CNGAœØÕ≤related Achromatopsia. Possible benefits of improved coneÕ≤photoreceptor function include, improved visual acuity, improved colour perception, and relief from disabling photophobia. The safety of the proposed approach will be enhanced by restricting transgene expression to the target tissue by virtue of rAAV vector tropism and the coneÕ≤specific promoter sequence used, and by restricting the intervention to one eye only in each participant.

This risk will be minimised by preÕ≤ and postÕ≤operative prophylactic treatment using topical and systemic corticosteroids. Any persistent intraocular inflammation will be managed by topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic corticosteroids where indicated. The participants will be closely followed up with a schedule of frequent assessments to identify and address any adverse events promptly.

In our subsequent trials with the intraocular administration of AAVœ± and AAVœ¥ vectors has been well tolerated in the majority of participants.

In a number of studies using a variety of animal models involving various routes of administration, including intraocular injection, inadvertent germline transmission by AAV vectors has not been detected. Similarly, we detected no vector genomes in semen in our previous retinal gene therapy clinical trial ÕæBainbridge, et al œÆœ¨œ¨œ¥Õø. Systemic intravascular administration of rAAVœÆ to deliver factor IX in haemophilia B, can lead to vector sequences detectable in semen, though not sperm for a short period ÕæManno et al œÆœ¨œ¨œ≤Õø. However, in this instance doses ranging from œ¥ x œ≠œ¨œ≠œ¨ to œÆ x œ≠œ¨œ≠œÆ vgÕ¨kg were administered, considerably higher than the doses proposed for subretinal injection in this study. Whilst this indicates there may be some potential for inadvertent germline transmission following the systemic delivery of high doses of vector, the possibility of such an event following the microsurgical delivery of tiny amounts of vector to intraocular compartments is considered to be remote. Pregnant or nursing ÕælactatingÕø women will be excluded.

Complications of surgery are typically managed effectively by medication or further surgical intervention but can rarely result in lasting harm to sight. The risk of lasting severe impairment of sight from vitrectomy surgery is approximately œ≠ in œ≠œ¨œ¨œ¨. Reduction in foveal retinal thickness has been previously reported in a proportion of patients in both our first RPEœ≤œ± trial and other RPEœ≤œ± clinical trials, believed to result from temporary retinal detachment which is a deliberate consequence of targeted administration of the vector suspension, but no other significant surgical adverse effects. However, in subsequent trials the use of a modified surgical technique that minimises the height of retinal detachment has resulted in no significant effect on foveal retinal thickness Õ¥ most notably retinal thickness has been stable postÕ≤intervention in all œÆœØ participants Õæœ≠œ≠ adults and œ≠œÆ childrenÕø in the CNGBœØ trial. Delivery of ATIMP to the subretinal space will be performed by standard surgical vitrectomy. This will involve a œØÕ≤port pars plana vitrectomy followed by injection of ATIMP using a fine cannula through small retinotomies, resulting in a temporary retinal detachment. Previous gene therapy clinical trials have shown that the bleb of subretinal ATIMP suspension can be expected to resolve spontaneously over the course of the first œÆœ∞ to œ∞œ¥ hours postoperatively as the fluid is absorbed by the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. Potential complications of this surgery specifically include persistence of the subretinal vector bleb, the development of retinal tears, elevated intraocular pressure and persistent postoperative intraocular inflammation. Persistently elevated intraocular pressure may result in glaucoma and vision loss; likewise, persistent inflammation may result in vision loss. Elevated intraocular pressure will be managed by topical therapy; with systemic therapy where indicated with specialist advice sought as required. Any potential risk to visual function will be minimised by limiting ATIMP delivery to the area of retina most likely to benefit, and by leaving the contralateral eye untreated. Retinal detachment caused by persistent vector bleb or intraoperative retinal tear is expected to occur in fewer than œ≠ in œ≠œ¨œ¨ procedures and can be effectively managed in the majority by retinopexy, with or without intraocular tamponade. Vitrectomy surgery is a standard technique, commonly performed for a wide range of indications. Injection of fluids under the retina is less commonly performed but is a standard step in surgery for subretinal haemorrhage, and an adjunctive technique in the management of retinal detachment.

Rod photoreceptors exposed to the ATIMP are not expected to benefit but may be subject to adverse effects of the surgical intervention or ATIMP. We plan to minimize any adverse effect by targeting the ATIMP to the central retina where the cone photoreceptors predominate. In addition, the use of a cone specific promoter to drive CNGAœØ expression specifically in cones, will minimise inappropriate ectopic expression in rod photoreceptors. Moreover, should cone photoreceptorÕ≤mediated vision be improved by the gene therapy, any dysfunction of rod photoreceptor cells is expected to be evident only in a dimly illuminated environment. No change in rod function has been described to date in the animal models Õæmouse and dogÕø used to demonstrate the potential of gene supplementation therapy in CNGAœØÕ≤associated Achromatopsia.

AAVœÆÕ¨œ¥Õ≤hGœ≠.œ≥p.coCNGAœØ is a gene transfer agent developed for the treatment of a form of Achromatopsia caused by defects in the gene encoding CNGAœØ. This is the alpha subunit of the cGMPÕ≤gated ion channel that plays an essential role in the cone phototransduction pathway. Disruption of the gene prevents the conversion of light to an electrical signal, leading to lack of cone function and visual dysfunction. Recombinant adenoÕ≤associated virus ÕærAAVÕø mediated gene transfer of a copy of the normal CNGAœØ gene to the cone photoreceptors, results in stable, long term transgene expression and improves visual function significantly in both rodents and dogs with CNGAœØ gene defects.

The face and eye will be covered with an adhesive sterile plastic drape. An opening will be made at the point of the palpebral fissure and a wire speculum inserted to retract the upper and lower eyelids. The speculum and all intraocular instruments will be sterilised according to standard local operating procedures. Three pars plana sclerotomies will be sited to enable intraocular infusion, endoillumination probe and surgical instruments.

The site and extent of the subretinal bleb of ATIMP suspension will be documented by video recording. Following intraocular administration of ATIMP, the retinal periphery will be examined for any unplanned retinal breaks for appropriate management by retinopexy with or without intraocular tamponade at the discretion of the operating surgeon. Intraocular instruments used subsequent to ATIMP delivery are disposable and will be destroyed after a single use. Sclerotomies may be secured using a vicryl suture.

It is acknowledged that this is a global crisis and patients may be put at more risk attending hospital appointments due to route of travel into research facility. If appropriate the sponsor will offer expenses for taxi fares to avoid busy train or bus routes. If scheduled visits cannot be conducted within the visit window the site can schedule an additional visit at the earliest opportunity the patients is able to travel, ensuring no visits are completely missed unless authorised by the sponsor. If patients are unable to reach their research facility but are able to seek help at a local ophthalmologist for urgent concerns this is acceptable, and the sponsor will encourage patients to show any nonÕ≤trial staff conducting assessments the contact details for the trial staff so that conversations can be had between the trial and nonÕ≤trial medical staff œ≤ Patients visits conducted outside of visit window Patients will be assessed individually by the sites on a case by case basis and phone interviews may be conducted by sites for all follow up visits up until at least œØ months postÕ≤surgery until onÕ≤site visits are possible.
