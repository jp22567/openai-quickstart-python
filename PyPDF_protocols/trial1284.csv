1,page_1,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 2 (144)VERSION HISTORY Version 5.0, 14 May 2020 Changes to the protocol are summarized below. Section 1.1, SoA, Table 2 –Updated footnote ‘w’ to clarify that subjects rolling over from this study into the extension study D5180C00018 will continue participation in the follow -up visit(s) (Week 58, Week 64) until the on- site visit (or alternate site) for extension study rand omization and IP administration can be conducted. This is to ensure randomization/first IP administration in the extension study D5180C00018 can be performed at the site (or alternate site) and to increase the chances of subjects transitioning to the exten sion study. Section 1.1, SoA, Table 2 –Under Table 2 added guidance on how to proceed with respect to Schedule of Activities during the COVID -19 pandemic to ensure the safety of the study subjects, to maintain compliance with GCP and to minimize risks to data integrity. Section 1.2, Synopsis –Objectives and Endpoints –Other Secondary Objectives ; Section 3, Objectives and Endpoints –Other Secondary Objectives –Revised outcome variable “Proportion of subjects with ≥1 asthma exacerbation ” to “Proportion o f subjects who did not experience an asthma exacerbation”. This is considered to be a more relevant variable for the question of interest. Section 1.2, Synopsis –Objectives and Endpoints –Other Secondary Objectives ; Section 3, Objectives and Endpoints –Other Secondary Objectives –Added “at clinic” to fractional exhaled nitric oxide FENO (ppb) to clarify that this is the clinic and not home based FENO. Section 1.2, Synopsis –Overall design –Added study code “D5180C00018” next to extension study Section 1.2, Synopsis -Study Period –updated the estimated date of last subject completed to Q4 2020 Sectio n 1.2, Synopsis –Treatments and treatment duration -Added a note to refer to Appendix I for further guidance if subjects are unable to come to the site during the COVID -19 pandemic. Section 6.2, Preparation/handling/storage/accountability –Added a note to clarify that during the COVID -19 pandemic, if allowed by local/regional guidelines, IP preparation and administration may be performed at the subject’s home by a qualified HCP. This change is to reduce the risk to subjects of COVID -19 exposure with cli nic visits. Section 6.5, Table 7, Prohibited medications –For any immunomodulators or immunosuppressives, revised the text “(except for OCS used in the treatment of asthma/asthma exacerbations)” to “(except for CCI"
2,page_2,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 3 (144)OCS used in the maintenance treatment of as thma, asthma exacerbations in screening/run -in, and protocol defined asthma exacerbations on or after Visit 3)”. This is to clarify the wording “except for OCS used in the treatment of asthma” is applicable for subjects on OCS maintenance treatment for ast hma and “asthma exacerbation” is applicable if it was a protocol defined exacerbation occurring on or after Visit 3. Section 6.5, Table 7, Prohibited medications –For other investigational products (including investigational use of an approved drug), revised the text “preferably 4 weeks after the last dose of IP” to “until the follow up visit week 64”. Section 8, Study Assessments and Procedures –Added “Additional dat a to assess the impact of COVID - 19 pandemic will be collected.” Section 8.1.6.2, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ -6)–Revised ACQ -6 score from “ ≤1.5” to “<1.5” to indicate partly controlled asthma and from “ >1.5” to “≥1.5” to indicate uncontrolled asthma . This change aligns with the thresholds for partly controlled/uncontrolled asthma established by Juniper et al 2006. Section 8.4.7, Independent adjudication committee –Added “in pulmonology, cardiology, neurology and oncology and will operate”. The state ment now reads “The committee will include specialists in pulmonology, cardiology, neurology and oncology and will operate in accordance to the adjudication committee charter/manual of operations. This change i sto align with section 1.2. Section 9.4.4, Safety analyses –Replaced “post -treatment” with “on -study”, to clarify the periods of interest. Section 9.4.5, Other analyses –Added “additional analyses assessing the impact of COVID -19 m ay be included in the SAP”. Appendix A 3 –Added “During the COVID -19 pandemic, re -consent may be obtained remotely and/or verbally if local/regional guidelines allow in order to reduce the risk to subjects of COVID -19 exposure during clinic visits. For further details please refer to Appendix I” to accommodate the change s made in the protocol. Appendix H, Table of Abbreviations –Added 1) COVID -19 and 2) HCP Appendix I –Added Appendix I to describe in more detail the changes made during the COVID -19 pandemic. Version 4.0, 15 April 2019 Changes to the protocol are summa rized below. Section 1.2, Synopsis –Study Objectives –Other Secondary objectives; Section 3.0, Objectives and Endpoints –Table 3: Study Objectives –Other Secondary Objectives – Removed neutralizing antibodies (nAb). The reason for this change is that the incidence of ADA is the key outcome measure for the immunogenicity evaluation. Other immunogenicity outcomes, including nAb, are considered supportive and therefore should not b e included in this table. They are described in Section 9.4.5 of the protocol. Section 1.2, Synopsis –Study Objectives –Statistical methods –Added the evaluation of AAER in the subgroup of subjects with baseline eosinophils < 300/µL into the confirmatory hierarchical testing strategy as Level 2, and renumbered subsequent levels accordingly. Added clarification that the nominal significance level of 0.01 is for the primary endpoint in all -comers."
3,page_3,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 4 (144)Section 5.1, Inclusion criteria, removed criter ion #15 –“Non -sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a condom plus spermicide from Day 1 through 16 weeks after receipt of the final dose of IP. In those countries where the above -mentioned method for contraception is not available, a condom can be used alone. Male subjects must not donate or bank sperm during this same time period.” To align with version 4.2 of the IB. Section 5.2, Exclusion criteria # 6 –revised criteria to add in restrictions related to the usage of vaping products “Current smokers or subjects with smoking history ≥10 pack -years and subjects using vaping products, including electronic cigarettes. Former smokers with a smoking history of <10 pack years and users of vaping or e -cigarette products must have stopped for at least 6 months prior to visit 1 to be eligible.” To clarify the required timeframe for stopping of e -cigarettes prior to screening since its use is prohibited during the study. Section 5.2, Exclusion criteria # 16–reduced the timeframe for subjects who have been treated with bronchial thermoplasty from 24 to 12 months prior to visit 1. This allows sufficient time for any safety issues related to performing this procedure, (for example asthma exacerbations which occur within 1 -2 months after the procedure), to resolve and for efficacy related to the procedure to stabilize. Section 5.4, Screen Failures –Replaced “Incorrect Enrolment” with “Screen Failure” to align with the proper documentation of the disposition of the screen failed subjects within the eCRF. Section 5.4, Screen Failures –Added “If the timeframe between Screening and re -screening is more than 30 days, then all Visit 1 assessments should be repeated.” To reduce the risk of not identifying the sta tus change in HIV 1, HIV 2, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and FSH prior to rescreening, if initial screening visit 1 was more than 30 days ago. Section 6.2, Preparation/handling/storage/accountability –Dose preparation steps –Added that a 2 mL sterile syringe can be attached to a 21G 1½ -inch sterile disposable needle during IP dose preparation and subsequently used for IP administration. This change allows for use of a 2 mL syringe in addition to 3 mL syringe because it meets the requirements for IP dose pre paration and dosing. Section 6.2, Preparation/handling/storage/accountability –Dose preparation steps –clarified that the vial labels along with the vials can be discarded immediately post IP preparation as per site’s SOP. The statement now reads “ If the opened and dispensed vials must be discarded immediately after dose preparation as per site’s SOP, the kit boxes must be retained for IP accountability.” Section 6.2, Preparation/handling/storage/accountability –Dose administration –Removed wording “Injection site must be documented on the eCRF and in the source documents at each treatment visit” as it was a repeat sentence. Section 6.2, Preparation/handling/storage/accountability –Dose administration –Removed wording “The subject, in the opinion of the investigator, is experiencing an acute or emerging asthma exacerbation” from the list of scenarios when IP should not be administered. An exacerbation per se is not a contraindication for IP administration. Reasons for not administering IP are well c overed by the remaining bullets. Section 6.3, Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding –Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized subjects –Revised text to clarify that if subject is discontinued from IP they should still follow the IPD discontinuation procedures as defined in section 7.1.1."
4,page_4,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 5 (144)Section 6.3, Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding –Ensuring blinding –removed “biomarker, ADA and nAb” from the following laboratory personnel that will have access t o the randomization list. The statement now reads: “bioanalytical lab analyst performing the PK sample analysis.” The reason for this change is that the laboratory does not require the randomization list for performing biomarker, ADA and nA sample analysi s. Section 6.3, Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding –Ensuring blinding –Clarified that no other members of the study team, other than those listed earlier within this section, will have access to the randomization list until after the primary database lock. Section 6.3, Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding –Methods for unblinding –replaced “pharmacists” with “delegate(s)” to clarify that the Investigator delegate(s) in addition to the Investigator will be provided access to unblinding the treatment. This change allows alignment with the IXRS setup for thi s study. Section 6.3, Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding –Methods for unblinding –Added “until primary database lock after last subject completes week 52.” To accommodate a planned additional database lock once the last subject compl etes treatment phase (week 52). Section 6.5.2, Rescue medicine –Added “Regularly scheduled SABA use in the absence of any asthma symptoms is not allowed from enrolment (Visit 1) and throughout the study duration. Prophylactic use of SABA (e.g. prior to planned exercise) or any other use than to curb worsening of asthma symptoms should be documented in medical notes and entered in the eCRF. Any such use of SABA must not be recorded in the Asthma Daily Diary. ” This change further clarifies that regularly s cheduled SABA use in the absence of any asthma symptoms is not allowed and that the occasional prophylactic use of SABA is not to be recorded in the eDiary. Section 7.1, Discontinuation of study treatment –Under “Development of any study specific criteri a for discontinuation, any malignancy”, added the following statement “except subjects who develop basal cell carcinoma or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, provided that the malignancy is excised and deter mined to have clean margins.” This ch ange allows subjects who have had excision of their lesions, which is considered curative, to continue study treatment. Section 7.1.1, Procedures for discontinuation of study treatment –Replaced “termination” with “Discontinuation of Investigational Prod uct” to reflect the corresponding eCRF module title. The statement now reads: “ If a subject discontinues IP due to a study specific discontinuation criterion, this should always be recorded as ’Development of study specific discontinuation criteria ’ on th e Discontinuation of Investigational Product form in the eCRF.” This change allows alignment with eCRF design. Section 7.3.2, Discontinuation or suspension of entire study and site closure –Updated the title of this section and added additional comments about site closure. The rationale for this change is to specify the conditions for closure of sites during and after study completion. Section 8.2.4, Vital Signs –Revised text to specify that the pulse rate will be obtained before blood pressure only if the manual measurement technique is used. This is to reflect that when the automated device is used the pulse and blood pressure measurements are taken simultaneou sly. Section 8.2.4, Vital Signs –Removed “in degrees Celsius” as the units of body temperature measurement. This is to accommodate the local guidelines as some regions may not be measuring in degrees Celsius."
5,page_5,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 6 (144)Section 8.3.8, Adverse Events of Special In terest –Added “systemic” in front of antiviral medications. The revised text reads: “Requiring treatment with systemic antiviral medications, intravenous antibiotics or medications for helminth parasitic infection”. To clarify that infections treated with local antivirals are not considered as adverse events of special interest. Section 8.4.2.2, Paternal exposure –Removed “Male subjects should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks (5 half -lives) following the last dose.” To align with version 4.2 of the IB. Section 8.4.2.2, Paternal exposure –Added “in the Pregnancy Report Form” to clarify where outcome of all pregnancies will be reported. This change aligns with eCRF design. Section 8.4.2.2, Paternal exposure –Added “Consent from the partner must be obtained before the Pregnancy Report Form is completed.” To clarify that consent is being obtained from the pregnant partner prior to completing the Pregnancy Report Form. Section 8.8, Biomarkers –Added “The results of exploratory biomarker analyses may be reported outside of the CSR.” To clarify the reporting of the exploratory biomarker analyses. Section 9.1, Statistical hypotheses –Added the evaluation of AAER in the subgroup of subjects with baselin e eosinophils < 300/µL into the confirmatory hypotheses, and renumbered subsequent hypotheses accordingly. Added further clarification that the other hypotheses in this section are in all subjects. Section 9.2, Sample size determination –Added nominal po wer statement and supporting assumptions for the evaluation of AAER in the subgroup of subjects with baseline eosinophils < 300/µL. Added clarification that the original primary endpoint calculation is based on all subjects. Section 9.4, Statistical Analy ses–Added “There will be two DBLs in this study. The primary DBL will be conducted after the last subject completes Week 52, and the final DBL will be conducted once the last subject has completed the last safety follow -up visit (Week 64). All analyses o f the primary and secondary objectives will be performed based on the primary DBL data.” This provides clarity around timing of database locks and primary analysis evaluation. Section 9.4, Statistical Analyses; Section 9.4.5, Other Analyses –Added “prim ary” to database lock. To accommodate a planned additional database lock once the last subject completes treatment phase (week 52). Replaced “Clinical Study Protocol deviations identified” with “important Protocol deviations identified” for clarity. Secti on 9.4, Statistical Analyses –Added “After primary database lock, treatment allocation for subjects during this study will become known to the Sponsor staff and/or designated CRO. The blind will be maintained for the Investigator, investigational site sta ff, and for the subject.” To provide clarity about the blinding approach after the primary database lock. Section 9.4.1, Multiple testing procedures –Added the evaluation of AAER in the subgroup of subjects with baseline eosinophils < 300/µL into the con firmatory hierarchical testing strategy as Level 2, and renumbered subsequent levels accordingly, following direction from the FDA. Other minor typographical corrections made to this section. Section 9.4.3.1, Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint –Added statement that the statistical model"

Section 5.1, Inclusion criterion # 2 –Removed ‘Optional’ to clarify consent is a requirement for genetic analysis, added “optional” to sample for genetic analysis and added “applicable for adult subjects only. Section 5 .1, Inclusion criterion # 10 –Separated first bullet point to two points, and added description of an acceptable documented exacerbation. Section 5.2, Exclusion criterion # 3, Medical conditions –Added “localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin” to H istory of Cancer. Section 5.2, Exclusion criteria # 11 –Replaced ‘prior to randomization’ with ‘prior to Visit 1’ Section 6.2, Dose Preparation –Replaced ‘5 cc’ with ‘5 mL’ for consistency of units. Section 6.3, Bullet #2 –Added ‘via the Interactive Web Response System/Interactive Voice Response System (IWRS/IVRS)’. Section 6.3 –Added reference to Section 4.1 and changed ‘maximum’ to ‘approximately’. Section 6.5, Concomitant therapy –Removed ‘and 7’. Section 6.5, Table 6, Restricted Medications, Short -acting beta -agonists (SABA) –Added ‘not allowed’ to wording for ‘Usage’ for consistency with other wording for restricted medications in table CCI CCI"
11,page_11,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 12 (144 )and added ‘home PEF and domiciliary FENO’. Section 6.5, Table 6, Additional Maintenance Controllers –Added ‘with the exception of any unscheduled visits due to asthma worsening’ to wording in ‘Usage’ for Twice daily LABA or LAMA, LTRA, Twice daily theophyllines and once daily theophyllines. Section 6.5, Live Attenuated Vaccines –Replaced ‘throughout the IP t reatment and preferably 4 weeks after the last dose of IP (unless there is a medical need as judged by the Investigator) with ‘and during the study including the follow -up period.’ Section 6.5, Table 7, Prohibited medications, Any marketed or to be markete d or investigation biologic treatment –Replaced ‘prior to the date of randomization, throughout the IP treatment and preferably 4 weeks after the last dose of IP (unless there is a medical need as judged by the Investigator)’ with ‘prior to the date of Vi sit 1, throughout the entire screening run in period, treatment period (even if the subject has discontinued IP) and until the follow up visit week 64.’ Section 6.5.2, Rescue Medication Use –Added ‘and domiciliary FENO’ Section 7.1, Discontinuation of s tudy treatment –Added ‘pregnancy’ to list of reasons for discontinuation Section 7.1.1, Procedures for discontinuation of study treatment –Added ‘ However, treatment with marketed or investigational biologics is not allowed until week 64 even if the subje ct has discontinued IP’, to this section. Section 8.1.1, Assessment of asthma exacerbation –Added description of another acceptable method for documentation of an historic exacerbation. Section 8.1.1, Assessment of asthma exacerbation –Replaced ‘Asthma e xacerbations should not be recorded as AEs after randomization. All asthma exacerbations should be recorded in the exacerbation eCRF. In addition, if the asthma exacerbation leads to discontinuation of IP, the investigator must assess whether the asthma deter ioration should also be reported as an AE leading to discontinuation of IP (DAE)/AE or withdrawal from study on the AE form’ with ‘All asthma exacerbations that occur during the treatment period and follow up, must be recorded in the exacerbation eCRF. See section 8.3.7 for additional information on recording asthma exacerbations as an AE/SAE during the study.’ Section 8.1.2.2 –Changed ‘and’ to ‘or’ as either salbutamol or albuterol is to be used for the post BD spirometry and reversibility testing.

The subject will be asked to blow air out of his/her lungs in one breath every morning, prior to the PEF measurement. Additional breaths may be required to have to achieve an acceptable FENO measurement. Further instructions for use will be described in a sepa rate instruction manual.’ Removed ‘These instructions for use will be described in a separate instruction manual.’ Added ‘approximately’ 100 subjects. Section 8.1.4.2 –Section updated to specify number of daily breaths and duration of home FENO testing t o be performed by a subject and that it must be collected in the morning prior to the PEF measurement. Section 8.1.6.1 –Replaced ‘study physician’ with ‘investigator’ for consistency and clarification.

CHANGES REQUIRED DURING THE COVID- 19 PANDEMIC Please Note: Changes below should only be implemented during the COVID -19 pandemic. During the COVID- 19 pa ndemic, changes are being implemented in order to ensure the safet y of study subjects, to m aintain compliance wi th good clinical pract ices, and to minimize risks to data integrit y. Where allowable by local heal th authori ties, ethi cs committees and healt hcare provi der gui delines (e.g. hospi tal policies), these changes include: The opti on of home visit s including home administration of Investigat ional Product (IP) performed by a qualified Healt h Care Professio nal (HCP). Addit ional informat ion related to the v isit can be obtained remotely by phone call and/or video conference. The rationale for this change is to minimize the risk of subjects missing scheduled IP administration and visit assessments due to inabilit y/unwillingness to visit the site during the COV ID-19 pandemic. Remote vi sits (phone call and/or video conference) to replace on -site visi ts, if subjects cannot attend the visits at the study site,"

INTRODUCTION Asthma i s a chronic inflammatory airway disorder caused by the interacti on of genet ic and environmental factors. It is characterized by widespread, variable, and reversible airflow obstructi on, ai rway inflammat ion, excessive mucus producti on; and airway hyperresponsiveness that lead to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing ( The Collaborative Study on the Genet ics of Asthma (CSGA) 1997). Progressive patho logic airway rem odeling and scarring may occur in persistent asthma result ing in only partially reversible or irreversible airway obstruction ( Pascual and Peters 2005 ). The eti ology of asthma is thought to be mult i-factori al, influenced by both genet ic and environmental mechanisms. The majorit y of cases ari se when a person beco mes hyperse nsitive to allergens. Despite the availabilit y of multiple therapeutic options, asthma cont inues to be a major healt h probl em. Worl dwide, asthma current ly affects approximately 300 milli on peopl e; by 2020, asthma is expected to affect 400 millio n peopl e (Partri dge 2007 ). Each y ear in the US, asthma accounts for an estimated 8.9 millio n outpati ent visi ts, 1.9 millio n emergency room visits, 479,000 hospitalizat ions (DeFrances et al 2008), and 3400 deaths ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevent ion 2017 ). Approximately 5% to 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, which may be inadequately controlled by ICS and LABA combinat ions together with addit ional controller therapies (Brightling et al 2008 ). These pati ents are at ri sk of asthma exacerbat ions (Tough et al 1998 , Turner et al 1998 ) and have the greatest medical need among the asthmatic populat ion today . Patients wi th severe asthma represent the greatest economic cost (>50% of total asthma- related healt h care costs) ( Antonicelli et al 2004 , Serra Batlles et al 1998 , Barnes and Kuitert 1996 ). 2.1 Study rationale Tezepel umab is in development for the treatment of severe asthma. A proof -of-concept study (Gauvreau et al 2014) showed that tezepelumab attenuated the late allergic response (LAR), the early allergic response (EAR) and the increase in FENO levels after an allergen challenge. A Phase 2 b study (CD -RI-MEDI9929- 1146) showed that doses of 70mg and 210mg administer ed Q4W and 280 mg of tezepelumab administered Q2W SC resulted in a reduction of the AAER by 61%, 71% and 66% respectively. This phase 3 study is desi gned to evaluate the effect of tezepelumab on the AAER, lung funct ion, asthma control, and safet y in adult and ado lescent subjects with uncontrolled severe asthma receiving medium or high- dose ICS pl us at l east one addit ional asthma controller medicat ion with or wi thout OCS. This will allow the benefit -risk profile of tezepelumab in the treatment of severe asth ma to be further characterized and to enable a better understanding of how best to position tezepel umab in the severe asthma treatment pathway ."
40,page_40,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 41 (144 )2.2 Background Biologic therapies have been shown to reduce AAER in severe asthma patients who are uncontrolled with medium to high dose ICS and addi tional asthma controller m edicati ons. Omalizumab provi ded benefi t for a subgroup of pati ents wi th proven reactivit y to an aeroallergen and elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels who remain inadequately controlled with ICS plu s LABA ( XOLAIR US PI 2016 ). Two addit ional biologics, mepolizumab and reslizumab, have recent ly been approved for severe asthma wit h an eosinophilic ph enoty pe (XOLAIR US PI 2016 ; CINQAIR US PI 2016 ). Bio logics targeti ng IL -5 and IgE are now included in internat ional treatment guidelines ( GINA 2017 ) as an add- on treatm ent to pati ents uncontrolled with ICS/LABA treatment. However, even when using currently available biologics, substant ial proporti ons of pat ients continue to experience exacerbations and may benefit from agents that target different mo lecular pathways ( Wenzel 2016 , Froi dure et al , 2016 , Swedin et al, 2017 ). Therefore, despite these addit ional therapeutic options, there is st ill a clear unmet medical need among pat ients with severe asthm a, independent ly of IgE st atus or eosinophil level, who are unable to gain co mplete asthma control using currently available therapi es. Thymic stromal lymphopoiet in (TSLP) is an epit helial cell -derived cy tokine that i s produced in responses to proinflammatory stimuli (e.g., infectious, allergic and environmental st imuli) and traum a. TSLP has an upstream and central role in the init iation of immune responses, and can activate a broad range of cell t ypes including eosinophils, mast cells, T cells, dendrit ic cells, type 2 innate lympho id cells and basophils ( Watson and Gauvreau, 2014 ). Classically , TSLP m ay be a critical com ponent in the init iation and perpetuation of the T helper 2 (Th2) response and the resul ting cascade of cy tokines associ ated wi th Th2 driven asthma ( Kaur and Bright ling, 2012 ). Asthma i s recognized as a heterog eneous disease. There are subsets of patients that do not exhibit Th2- associ ated disease ( Wenzel 2012 ), and there are em erging data that TSLP may also mediate non -allergic (non -T helper cell 2) inflammation ( Tanaka et al, 2009 , Ziegler et al, 2013). Given that TSLP is an upstream and pleiotropic cytokine, the blockade of TSLP is therefore anticipated to have broad impact on the spectrum of inflammatory responses seen in asthma. Tezepel umab is a fully human immunogl obulin G (IgG) 2λ monoclonal ant ibody (mAb) di rected against TSLP. Tezepelumab binds to human TSLP and prevents its interaction with TSLP receptor (TSLPR). Owing to the central role of TSLP in init iating and maintaining a Th2 response, ant i-TSLP therapy may provi de an opportuni ty to treat the upstream underlying mechanisms of asthma by reversing the established inflammatory responses to asthma triggers. Results of a co mpleted inhaled allergen challenge study in 31 adult subject s with mild atopic asthma (Study 20101183) dem onstrated that tezepelumab attenuated the LAR and EAR to allergen challenge, as measured by the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the percent fall in FEV1 and the maximum percent fall in FEV1. Tezepelumab also att enuated the increase in FENO value on the post -allergen day co mpared with the pre- allergen day. Mult iple doses of 700 mg IV tezepel umab dem onstrated an acceptable safet y profile in subjects with mild atopic asthma. No subjects developed anti -drug ant ibodie s (ADA) after receiving tezepelumab. Based upon these"
41,page_41,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 42 (144 )data, MedImmune/AZ have conducted a randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled, dose range finding study in asthmat ics who were inadequately controlled wit h medium or hi gh dose ICS/l ong-acting β2 agon ist (LABA) with or without other controller medicat ions. Study CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 was a Phase 2b mult icenter, mult inational, dose -ranging, double - blind, randomized, parallel -arm, placebo -controlled study to eval uate the effect of 3 dose levels of tezepel umab on the AAER in adult subjects with inadequately controlled, severe asthma. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dose levels o f SC tezepel umab (280 m g Q2W, 210 m g Q4W, 70 m g Q4W) or pl acebo (Q2W) for 52 weeks. A total of 584 subjects received at least 1 dose of tezepelumab or placebo. An AAER reduction o f 61%, 71%, and 66% for the 70 m g Q4W, 210 m g Q4W, and 280 m g Q2W tezepelumab groups, respectively, compared wi th placebo were observed in the intent- to-treat (ITT) populat ion (p<0.001). After repeated SC administration, mean serum trough concentration increased over time and achieved steady -state by week 12. Tezepelumab exhibi ted linear pharm acokinetics (PK) across 3 doses. A total of 5 (4.1%) pl acebo subjects and 8 (1.8%) tezepelumab sub jects who had no detectable ADA at baseline had detectable ADA post -treatm ent; no subjects developed neutralizing ADA in the study . The resul ts of this study did not i dentify safet y signals associated with tezepelumab for any dosing regimen. The frequencie s of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between the placebo (62.2%) and the total tezepelumab (64.2%) dose groups and a majorit y of subjects had TEAEs that were mild or moderate in severit y and not related to investigat ional product (IP ). Few subjects had TEAEs that resulted in permanent discont inuat ion of IP. Overall, tezepelumab was well -tolerated wi th an acceptable safet y profile and no safet y signals were i dentified. 2.3 Benefit/risk assessment In order to evaluate the clinical benefit -risk balance for tezepelumab, preclinical and clinical data have been taken into considerat ion, as well as a review of the available information for monoclonal antibodies that are approved for and are in developm ent for the treatm ent of severe asthma. Benefits for tezepelumab over placebo include a clinically meaningful reduct ion in asthma exacerbations, improvement in lung function and asthma control metrics. Tezepel umab has been well tolerated with no safety signals ident ified in studi es to date. No serious allergic reactions or anaphylact ic react ions considered related to tezepelumab were reported in the Phase 2 program. Alt hough TSLP suppressio n could theoretically have unant icipated immune -related si de effect s impairing host defense against certain infect ions, there is no clear preclinical or clinical evidence supporting such a role, and no safet y signals rel ated to infect ions have been detected in the tezepelumab program. The benefit/risk assessment for tezep elumab in severe asthma based on the development through Phase 2 i s favorable. The future benefit / risk assessment will largely be defined by resul ts from the Phase 3 program."

This is a Phase 3, mult icentre, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, pa rallel group study to eval uate the effect of 210 m g of tezepel umab administered Q4W SC in adult and adolescent subjects with severe uncontrolled asthma. The study will randomize approximately 1060 subjects gl obally in a 1:1 rati o to ei ther tezepel umab or placebo. Approximately 80 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, will be included as subjects. The subjects will be stratified by regio n and age (adult/adolescents). All subjects m ust have been on a medium to high dose ICS for at least 3 months prior to scree ning (see Appendix Ffor definit ions of m edium to hi gh dose ICS) and have been on at least one asthma controller medicat ion with or wi thout OCS in t he 3 months prior to date of informed consent as per inclusio n criteria 6 and 7. The total study popul ation will be monitored to ensure a broad subject distribution across 3 different key clinical factors. Approximately 20% of the total study popul ation will be subjects who are treated with a total daily dose of medium dose ICS as well as on at least one addit ional maintenance asthma controller medicat ion with or wi thout OCS in the previous 3 months prior to date of informed consent. Approximately 40% of subjects in the study will be requi red to have had at least 3 exacerbat ions in the past 12 months, with the remaining subjects having had exact ly 2 exacerbat ions. Details on acceptable documentation is specified in sect ion 8.1.1 . The study will also aim to randomize a similar percentage of subjects with <300 eosinophils/μl and ≥ 300 eosinophils/ μl. In addi tion, a reasonable number of subjects is expect ed to be rando mized with < 150 eosinophils/μl and > 450 eosinophils/μl. The ant icipated percentages for the factors above may be applied to the adult populat ion instead of the overall populat ion to avoi d difficul ties wi th adol escent recrui tment, if necessa ry.

If a subject does not m eet all inclusi on criteria or meets any exclusion cri teria as per sect ion 5.1and section 5.2, the subject will be screen failed. Rescreening is allowed only once. Further details are specified in section 5.4. 4.2 Scientific rationale for study design The purpose of this glo bal study is to provi de evidence of the efficacy and safet y of 210 m g dose of tezepel umab administered Q4W SC in adults and adolescents (12 y ears of age and older) wi th a history of asthma exacerbat ions and severe uncontrolled asthma receiving medium or high dose ICS pl us at l east one addi tional asthma controller medicat ion with or wi thout OCS. The primary (AAER) and key secondary endpoints (l ung f unction and asthma control) are well accepted measures for a study in severe asthma. These endpoints have been shown in the Phase 2b study to cl early different iate the tezepelumab benefit from placebo. In order to avoid bias the study will be randomized and double blinded. Subject entry will be stratified by region and age (adol escents and adults) to ensure equitable distribution for analysis. Given that TSLP is an upstream and pleiotropic cytokine, the blockade of TSLP is ant icipated to have broad impact on the spec trum of inflammatory responses seen in asthma. Due to the mechanism o f action it is expected that severe asthmat ics irrespect ive of their phenotype of asthma would benefit fro m treatm ent wi th tezepel umab. Subject entry into the study will be monitored to e nsure that there are adequate numbers of patients within different phenoty pes (high and low eosinophils, medium and high dose ICS, and number of exacerbat ions in the previous year) for analysis. 4.3 Justification for dose A 210 m g Q4W dosing regimen was selec ted for the Phase 3 studi es based on efficacy data and an exposure- response analysis fro m the Phase 2b Study CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 using popul ation PK/PD methodology . The populati on PK m odel of tezepel umab was developed based on all available data fro m 5 Pha se 1 studi es (Study 20070620, Study 20080390, Study 2010118, Study D5180C00003, Study D5180C00002), and 2 Phase 2 studies (Study D5240C00001 and Study CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146). The exposure -response analysis was based on the Phase 2b Study CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146. Analysis of data fro m the phase 2b study identified a statist ically significant exposure -response against the primary efficacy endpo int of AAER and the pharmacodynamic (PD) endpo int of"

These relat ionships indicate that the dose of 70 mg Q4W is a sub -optimally effect ive dose and the dose of 210 mg Q4W is optimally effective. In summary , characteri zation of AAER data from Study CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 indicate the 210 mg Q4W dose provides improved efficacy over the 70 m g Q4W dose, whereas the 280 mg Q2W do se did not f urther reduce AAER. Tezepelumab was well -tolerated at all doses and the safet y profile was well balanced between the tezepelumab and placebo groups with no evidence of a dose relat ionship to TEAEs in the adult populat ion. To ensure that the dos e of 210 mg Q4W is an appropriate dose across adolescents fro m the age of 12 to 17 y ears ol d, PK simulat ions were conducted to compare exposures between adults and adolescents based on the adult body weight di stributi on from the phase 2b study and the adolescent body weight distribut ion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevent ion growth charts (US). The m ean exposure in the adolescent populat ion as a whole was found to be 1.67 -fold higher in adolescents than in adults at the 210 mg Q4W dose. Compar ed to the overall variabilit y in the PK of tezepelumab (coefficient of variation [CV] approximately 45% to 50%), and the fact that tezepel umab has been shown to be well- tolerated at the 280 mg Q2W dose (which resulted in approximately 2.7-fold higher expos ure than at the 210 mg Q4W dose in adults), the adolescent exposures at the 210 mg SC dose are considered unlikely to pose a safet y risk. The dose of 210 mg SC Q4W has been selected for evaluation in both the adult and adolescent popul ations wit h a body weight of ≥40 kg. The study is desi gned to dose subjects at Q4W with the last dose given at week 48, EOT visit at week 52, and a 12 -week follow -up peri od. 4.4 End of study definition The end o f study is defined as when the last subject has co mpleted his/her last scheduled contact. A subject i s considered to have co mpleted the study when he/she has co mpleted his/her last scheduled contact. See Appendix A 6for guidelines for the dissemination of study resul ts. 5.

Rando mizat ion numbers will be grouped in blocks. If a subject withdraws from the study , then his/her enrolment/randomizat ion code cannot be reused. Withdrawn subjects will no t be repl aced. Specific information concerning the use of the IWRS/IVRS will be provided in a separate manual. Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized subjects Subjects who fail to meet the eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any circumstances, be rando mized or receive study medication. There can be no except ions to this rule. Subjects who are enrolled, but subsequent ly found not to m eet all the eligibilit y criteria must not be rando mized or init iated on treatment and must be withd rawn from the study . Where a subject does not meet all the eligibilit y criteri a but i s rando mized in error, or incorrectly started on treatment, the Invest igator should inform the AstraZeneca study physician immediately , and a discussi on shoul d occur betwe en the AstraZeneca study physician and the investigator regarding whether to continue or discont inue the subject from treatment. Study treatm ent m ust be di scont inued in all cases where continued treatment is deemed to pose a safet y risk to the pati ent and. AstraZeneca study physician m ust ensure the deci sion is appropri ately docum ented. Subj ects that are discont inued from treatment should be fo llowed up according to the opti ons described in section 7.1.1 In those cases where cont inuat ion of the study thera py is judged not to present a concern related to safet y and disease management, the rationale for continuing study therapy must be cl early docum ented."

The rando mizat ion code will be assigned fro m a rando mizat ion list prepared by a co mputerized system provi ded by Parexel Informatics on behalf of AZ (AZRand). All subjects will be stratified at randomi zation by age group (adul ts versus adol escents) and regi on. In order to achieve the assumed exacerbat ion rates used to determine sample size, it is expected that approximately 40% of subjects will have ≥3 exacerbat ions in the 12 months prior to Visit 1. Therefore, enrolment of subjects with only 2 exacerbat ions in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 may be halted if this subgroup within a region reaches approximately 60% of rando mized subjects. (Refer to section 4.1) The distribut ion of subjects across the range of baseline eosinophil levels will be operationally controlled by ensuring that a similar percentage of subjects with eos levels < 300 and ≥ 300 are rando mized a nd a reasonable number of subjects is expected to be randomized with eos levels <150 and > 450. In addit ion, the proportion of subjects on medium dose ICS will be operationally controlled to comprise approximately 20% of the subjects. Ensuring blinding This is a double -blind study in which tezepelumab and placebo are not visually distinct from each other. All packaging and labelling of IP will be done in such way as to ensure blinding for all sponsor and investigational site staff. Neit her the subject nor any of the investigators or sponsor staff who are invo lved in the treatment or clinical evaluat ion and m onitoring of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received. Since tezepelumab and placebo are not visually distinct, IP will be handled by a qual ified person (e.g., pharmacist or study nurse) at the si te. An AstraZeneca site monitor will perform IP accountabilit y. In the event that the treatment allocat ion for a subject becomes known to the investigator or other study staff invo lved in the manage ment of study subjects, or needs to be known to treat an individual subject for an AE, the sponsor m ust be notified immediately by the investigator and, if possible, before unblinding. The fo llowing personnel will have access to the rando mizat ion list:  Those carrying out the packaging and labelling of IP  Those generat ing the randomization list  Personnel at the IXRS company  Supply Chain Management department  Patient Safet y department at AstraZeneca  Bioanaly tical lab analyst performing the PK sample analysis  Those involved in the reporting and reviewing the DSMB presentations"

Discont inuing study treatment is not the same as study wit hdrawal. Procedures to fo llow for study withdrawal are detailed bel ow in sect ion 7.3. If the subject decides to withdraw consent, then the reason for this must be recorded separately in the eCRF. A subject that decides to discont inue IP should always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any adverse events. The re ason for discontinuing treatment and the date of last IP administration should be recorded in the eCRF. Subjects permanent ly discont inuing IP administration should be given locally available standard of care therapy , at the discret ion of the Invest igator. However, treatment with marketed or invest igational biologics i s not allowed unt il week 64 even if the subject has discontinued IP.

All subjects who prematurely discontinue IP should return to the study center and complete the procedures described for the premature IP Discontinuation visit (IPD) at 4 weeks (+/ -5 days) post last IP administration. Subjects who discont inue treatment should be encouraged to return for all regularly scheduled visits for safet y and efficacy assessments. At theIPD vi sit the subject will be given three options as to how they will be fo llowed as follows: 1. The subject should be encouraged to return for all regular clinic visits and perform all scheduled assessments until he/she co mpletes a total of 52 weeks treatme nt period. 2. The subject will be offered fo llow-up on a m onthly basis via tel ephone calls while continuing ediary and ePEF com pletion (no further procedures will be performed), until the subject completes 52 weeks in the study. In addit ion to the PRO assess ments that are performed at home, the subject may also complete the other clinic specified PRO assessments (as defined in the SoA) at home as well. The subject should return for a fo llow-up visit 16 weeks (+/- 5 days) (refer to SoA, V19 –Week 64) post las t IP administration and for the EOT visit at Week 52 (+/ -5 days). 3. If the subject cannot or does not wish to comply wit h any o f the opti ons above, (or any component of them such as only telephone based visit s without com pletion of the ediary and ePEF), the y will co mplete a fo llow-up visit at 16 weeks (+/ -5 days) (refer to SoA, Visit 19 – week 64) post last IP administration. After this visit the Invest igator"

If the subject chooses option 1, all assessments will be c ompleted as per the SoA as indicated in Secti on 1.1. If the subject chooses 2 or 3, the key inform ation to be collected during the telephone calls are AEs/SAEs, changes in concomitant medicat ion, healt h care utilizat ion, and asthma exacerbation informat ion. Subjects who init ially choose options 1or 2 and subsequent ly cannot or do not wish to comply with the requi rements of their option can cont inue with a less intensive option (i.e. subject initially choosing opti on 1 can cont inue with options 2 or 3, subjects init ially choosing opti on 2 can cont inue with option 3).

The invest igator ensures the accuracy, completeness, legibilit y and timeliness of the data recorded and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement. The invest igator will sign the completed electronic CRFs. A copy o f the com pleted electroni c CRFs will be archived at the study site. Addi tional data to assess the impact of COVID -19 pandemic will be collected. Immediate safet y concerns should be discussed wit h the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should continue or discont inue study treatment. Adherence to the study design requi rements, including those specified in the SoA, is essent ial and required for study conduct. All screening evaluat ions must be com pleted and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects meet all eligibilit y criteria. The Investi gator will maintain a screening log to record details of all subjects screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. The am ount of blood collected from each subject over the duration of the study (excl uding optional blood sam ples) will be approximately 220 mL, including any extr a assessments that may be required, will not exceed 450 mL.

Spiro metry testi ng can be init iated during the who le day for adolescent subjects. All post -randomizat ion spirometry assessments should be performed wit hin ± 1.5 hours of the time that the randomizat ion spiro metry was performed. For example, if the rando mizat ion spirometry was started at 8:00 AM, then all subsequent spirometry testing needs to be init iated between 6:30 AM and 9:30 AM. Spirometry technique Detailed procedure for performing spiro metry will be describe d in a separate instruction manual. Details regarding assessment of the qualit y of spirometry and the best test report (BTR) process will also be detailed in the manual. Spirometry references The Gl obal Lung Funct ion Init iative (GLI) equations will be used to determine the Predicted Norm al Values (PNV) and are pre -programmed int o the spiro meter (Quanjer et al 2012 ). FEV 1, expressed as percent of the PNV, will be calculated as fo llows: FEV 1% of PNV = (FEV 1measured/FEV 1PNV) x 100 8.1.2.2 Post-BD spirometry and FEV 1 reversibility assessment All subjects m ust m eet inclusio n criteria 9 ei ther by having docum ented histori cal reversibili ty or by demo nstratin g reversibilit y either at Vi sit 2 or Vi sit 2a. If docum ented historical reversibilit y is available, the post -BD spirometry procedures must be perform ed at Visi t 2 to categori ze subjects (establish baseline characteristic) prior to rando mizat ion. The docu mented histori cal reversibili ty must be recorded in the eCRF/spiro meter prior to randomizat ion. Further details will be provided in a separate instruction manual. Bronchodilatation can be induced using albuterol (90 μg metered dose), salbutamo l (100 μg metered dose) or levalbuterol (45 μg metered dose) up to a maximum o f 4 inhalations.

This can be either at Visit 2 or at Visit 2a Hom e PEF testing will be performed by the subject in the m orning upon awakening (and prior to taking their AM asthma contr oller) and in the evening at bedtime (and prior to taking their PM asthma controller). Recording of ho me PEF should start from the evening of Visit 2 or Visit 2a until the morning of Visit 17 (Week 52) using an ePEF meter device (AM3G+™) supplied by the vendor (eResearch Techno logy Inc.). When possible, ambulatory lung f unction measurements shoul d be taken at l east 6 hours after the last dose of SABA rescue medicat ion. Subjects should perform 3 successive peak flow manoeuvres while sitt ing or standing, but in the same posi tion at every testing. The Investigator/authorized delegate will check subject’s adherence to correct use of the peak flow m eter at each visit as sho wn in SoA (or on EOT visit if prematurely discont inued fro m the study ). 8.1.4 FENO 8.1.4.1 FENO at clinic visit Airway inflammat ion will be evaluated using a standardized single -breath FENO test in accordance with the SoA. A single exhalat ion technique recommended by the manufacturer will be followed ( Alving et al 2017). Subjects will be asked whether they have had a respi ratory infecti on in the 2 weeks prior to the measurement. The FENO measurements will not be performed within 2 weeks of a respiratory infect ion. The FENO test will be performed prior to spirometry . Subje cts shoul d not eat or drink 1 hour prior to having the FENO test. Subjects should not use their rescue SABA medicat ion (e.g., albuterol/salbutamo l) within 6 hours of the measurement. Inhaled BDs (including ICS/LABA) should be withheld for the effect durati on specific to the BD as described in the spirometry section. If not, the assessment should be postponed till after the required time has passed since the meal or drink or the visit must be rescheduled within the allowed visit window. The NIOX VERO® Airw ay Inflammat ion Monitor will be used to measured FENO. Instructions for use of thi s monitor will be provi ded in a separate user’s manual.

Subjects will be given and trained on the usage of collect ing home based FENO measurements using the device NIOX VERO® (CIRCASSIA). When possible domiciliary FENO assessments should be perform ed pri or to taking thei r morning inhalers and after the SABA is wit hheld for at least 6 hours. The subject will perform this measurement daily fro m Visit 2 or Visi t 2a to Visi t 17, except on those visits when FENO is scheduled to be performed at clinic/on site a s per Table 2. The subject will be asked to blow air out of his/her lungs in one breath every morning, prior to the PEF measurement. Additional breaths may be required to have to achieve an acceptable FENO m easurement. Further instructions for use will be described in a separate instruction manual. This sub -study will include approximately 100 subjects and be exploratory in nature. All FENO m easurements will be blinded for sites and subjects throughout.

Site personnel will be trained on the use of both devices. Detailed procedures for using both devices and subject training on use of the handheld device will be described in a separate instruction manual. Subjects will be trained o n at home use o f the eDi ary and ePEF meter at Visit 2 or 2a. The site staff will set assessment reminder alarms on the device. Subject training will include explanat ion of funct ionality and proper use of the ePEF meter. Training will emphasize the importan ce of co mpleting the PRO assessments as scheduled to capture the subject's experience and meet the objectives o f the study . The subject will be asked to use both devices as part of the training to verify complet ion of training on the eDiary . The questionna ires will be administered in the handheld device at home in the fo llowing order: Asthma Symptom Diary , Rescue medicat ion, Total Asthma symptom score, nocturnal awakening, maintenance medicat ion, peak expiratory flow assessment. At home PRO assessment will start the evening of Visit 2, if the subject meets inclusio n criteria 8 and 9 at this visit. If only one of these cri teria are met at Vi sit 2, the at hom e ePRO assessment shoul d be deferred to the evening of Visit 2a, after the other criteria is also met. Subjects will complete assessments twice daily and at other timepoints specified in the SOA. The invest igator/authorized delegate will check subject’s adherence to the PRO assessment schedule as is necessary to m aintain necessary to minimize missing data and at each study visit. Frequent compliance checks between visits will be necessary to ensure sufficient data is available to meet inclusio n criteria 17, 18 and 19. 8.1.6.1 Daily Diary The daily diary will be com pleted each day from the evening of Visit 2 or Visi t 2a to the morning o f Visit 17. The m orning eDiary will include: Asthma Symptom Diary (ASD) m orning items, quest ions about rescue medicat ion, nighttime awakening, and use of maintenance medicat ions. The evening eDiary will include: ASD evening items and q uestions about rescue medicat ions. Upon complet ion of the morning and evening quest ions the subject will co mplete the peak expiratory flow assessment. There will be triggers in the ePRO device to alert the subjects to signs o f worsening of asthma and to co ntact their physician, please refer to section 8.1.1 . The subject should contact the investigator for evaluat ion after receiving a diary alert. ASD Asthma symptoms will be recorded using the ASD ( Globe et al 2015 ), which co mprises 10 items (5 items in the m orning; 5 i tems in the evening). The morning items assess nighttime symptom severit y in relat ion to wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness, and the frequency of nighttime awakening. The evening items assess symptom severit y in relat ion to wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness, and act ivity limitation since waking. Items are scored from “0” (no symptom, no nightt ime awakening, or no activit y limitat ion) to “4” (very severe symptom , unable to sl eep, or extrem e act ivity limitat ion). A daily ASD score is"
82,page_82,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 83 (144 )the mean of the 10 items. Responses for all 10 items are required to calculate the daily ASD score; otherwise, it is treated as missing. Calculat ion of a daily ASD score requires data fro m the evening diary assessment and the subsequent morning diary assessment. For the 7 -day average asthma symptom score, scoring is done with no imputation using the mean of at least 4 of the 7 daily ASD scores as a m ean weekly item score. The 7 -day average ASD score ranges fro m 0 to 4. Global asthma symptom items In addit ion to the ASD, subjects will co mplete a single item glo bal assessment of asthma symptoms (0 -3) each morning and eve ning. The sum o f evening and subsequent morning single global item scores (0 -6) will be used for the alerts system. Rescue medication The number of rescue medicat ion inhalat ions (puffs) and nebulizer treatments taken will be recorded by the subject in the Asthma Symptom Diary twice daily (i.e., in the m orning and evening) beginning the evening of Visit 2 or Visit 2a until the morning of Visit 17. The number of inhalat ions taken between the morning and evening lung function assessments will be recorded in th e evening. The number of inhalat ions taken between the evening and the morning will be recorded in the morning. Nocturnal awakenings Nocturnal awakenings due to asthma symptoms will be recorded by the subject in the Asthma Symptom Diary each m orning, begin ning in the morning after Visit 2 or Visit 2a until the morning o f Visit 17, by answering a questi on as to whether he/she woke up during the night due to asthm a symptom s by a “yes” or “no” response. Maintenance medication Maintenance medicat ion administra tion will be recorded in the Asthma Symptom Diary once daily in the m orning, beginning in the morning after Visit 2 or Visit 2a unt il the morning of Visit 17. 8.1.6.2 Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ -6) The ACQ- 6 captures asthma symptoms (night -time waking, symp toms on waking, activit y limitation, shortness o f breath, wheezing) and short -acting β2 -agonist use via subject -report. Quest ions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean ACQ -6 score i s the m ean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤ 0.75 indicate well -controlled asthma, scores between 0.75 and <1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score ≥1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma ( Juniper et al 2006). Individual changes of at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful, and a decrease of at least 0.5 is the responder definit ion for ACQ -6. ACQ -6 will be co mpleted at the beginning o f site visi ts using an eDiary in accordance wit h the SoA."

The questionnaire co mprises 4 separate domains (symptoms, activit y limitations, emotional funct ion, and environmental stimuli). Subjects are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and t o score each of the quest ions on a 7- point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment). The overall score is calculated as the mean response to all questions. The 4 individual domain scores (symptoms, activit y limitat ions, emotional function, and environmental st imuli) are the means of the responses to the questions in each of the domains. The responder definit ion for AQLQ(s)+12 is 0.5- point improvement fro m baseline. The AQLQ(s)+12 will be completed at th e beginning of site visit s using t he eDiary in accordance with the SoA. 8.1.6.4 St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) The SGRQ is a 50- item PRO instrum ent devel oped to m easure the healt h status of patients with airway obstructi on di seases ( Jones et al 1991 ). The questi onnaire is divided into 2 parts: part 1 consists of 8 items pertaining to the severit y of respi ratory symptom s in the preceding 4 weeks; part 2 consists of 42 items relate d to the daily act ivity and psychosoci al impacts of the individual’s respiratory condi tion. The SGRQ yields a total score and 3 domain scores (symptom s, activit y, and impacts). The total score indicates the impact of disease on overall healt h status. This total score is expressed as a percentage of overall impairment, in which 100 represents the worst possible healt h status and 0 indicates the best possible health status. Likewise, the dom ain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicat ive of grea ter impairment. Based on empirical data and interviews with patients, a mean change score of 4 units is associated with a minimum clinically important difference (MCID). Specific details on the scoring algorithms are provided by the developer in a user man ual (Jones et al 2009 ). SGRQ will be co mpleted using eDiary in accordance wit h the SoA. 8.1.6.5 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus Classroom Impairment Questions (WPAI+CIQ) The WPAI+CIQ consists of quest ions about how asthma and asthma related issues impact a subject’s abilit y to work, attend cl asses, and perform regular daily act ivities. The quest ionnaire relates to the subject’s ex perience over the previous 7 day s. The WPAI+CIQ will be used to measure self -reported productivit y loss. The WPAI+CIQ will be co mpleted using the eDiary in accordance with the SoA. 8.1.6.6 European quality of life -5 dimensions- 5 levels (EQ -5D- 5L) The EQ -5D- 5L questi onnai re assesses 5 dimensio ns: m obilit y, self -care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort and anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensio n has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels o f difficult y."

The quest ionnaire also includes a visual analogue scale, where the subject will be asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0 -100, wi th 0 being the worst imaginable healt h state. The EQ -5D- 5L will be completed using the eDiary in accordance with the SoA. 8.1.6.7 Clinician and Patient Global Impression of Change assessment (CGI -C/PGI -C) The Clinical Glo bal Im pressi on of Change (CGI -C) and Patient Global Impressio n of Change (PGI -C) instruments are used to evaluate the overall response to treatment. For the CGI -C the investigator (clinician) will be asked to rate the degree to which the overal l asthma status may have changed when co mpared to baseline (i.e. randomizat ion visit/init iation of study drug). The assessment uses a 7 -point rating scale: 1 = Very Much Im proved; 2 = Much Improved; 3 = Minimally Improved; 4 = No Change; 5 = Minimally Worse; 6 = Much Worse; and 7 = Very Much Worse. The PGI -C asks subjects to report change fro m baseline using the same scale as the CGI -C. The CGI -C will be completed at the site by the invest igator. The PGI -S will be completed by the subject at home per the So A The CGI -C will be co mpleted at the site visits as indicated in Table 2. It is recommended that the same clinician co mpletes the CGI -C at all applica ble visits for an individual subject. Before making the assessment, the clinician will need to access and review the results fro m all relevant assessments including lung function measurements (FEV 1and PEF) and subject reported outcom es (Asthma Symptom Dia ry, ACQ-6 and AQLQ(S) +12) performed before the visit, Adherence to the subject reported outcomes should be closely monitored. 8.1.6.8 Patient Global Impression of Severity assessments (PGI -S) The Pati ent Gl obal Impressi on of Severi ty (PGI -S) is a single item desi gned to capture the subject’s perception of overall symptom severit y at the time of com pletion using a 6 -point categori cal response scale (no symptoms to very severe symptom s).

Instructi ons for sam ple collect ion, processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in a separate laboratory manual prov ided to the sites. 8.3 Collection of adverse events The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff invo lved in the study are familiar with the content of this sect ion. The definit ions of an AE or SA E can be found in Appendix B. AEs will be reported by the subject (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the subject's legally authori zed representative)."
88,page_88,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 89 (144 )The invest igator and any designees are responsible for detecting, document ing, and recording events that meet the definit ion of an AE or SAE. For informat ion on how to fo llow-up AEs see section 8.3.3 . 8.3.1 Method of detecting AEs and SAEs Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and non-leading verbal quest ioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AEoccurrences. 8.3.2 Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information Adverse Events, including SAEs will be co llected fro m time o f signature of informed consent form throughout the treatment period and the follo w-up periods. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix B. The invest igator will submit any u pdated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of i t being available. Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE in former study subjects. However, if the invest igator learns o f any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject’s last visit and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the Study treatment or study participat ion, the invest igator must notify the sponsor. The m ethod of recording, evaluat ing, and assessing causalit y of AE and SAE and the procedures for com pleting and transmitt ing SAE reports are provided in Appendix B. 8.3.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs After the init ial AE/SAE report, the investigator is requir ed to proactively fo llow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAE/non -serious AEs/AEs of special interest, will be followed until reso lution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as appropriate in the study are f ollowed up by the Investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the CRF. AstraZeneca retains the right to reques t addi tional inform ation for any subject wi th ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary . 8.3.4 Adverse event data collection The fo llowing variables will be collect for each AE;  AE (verbat im)  The date when the AE started and stopped  Whether the AE is serious or not  Invest igator causalit y rating against the IP(s) (y es or no)"

Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’. A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix Bto the Clinical Study Protocol . 8.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff : Have you/the child had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked? or revealed by observat ion will be collected and recorded in the CRF. When collect ing AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other sign s or symptom s"
90,page_90,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 91 (144 )that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.7 Adverse events based on examinations and tests The results from the Clinical Study Protocol mandated l aboratory tests and vi tal signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as co mpared to baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory values/vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any o f the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuat ion of treatm entwith the invest igational product. If deteri oration in a laboratory value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory resul t/vital sign will be considered as addit ional information. Wherever possible the reporting Invest igator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anaemia versus low haemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -mandate d param eters shoul d be reported as AE(s). Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion as compared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred, when possible, to recording a list of signs and symptoms. Asthma symptoms or signs, such as wheeze, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, breathlessness and phlegm, will be recorded as AEs only when: The sign or symptom is serious according to defini tions, see Appendix B The patient discont inues IP due to the sign or symptom The sign or symptom is new to the patient or not consistent with the patient’s preexis ting asthma history (defined as wit hin 1 year of Visit 1) as judged by the Investigator. Asthma exacerbation should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if it fulfills any of the above criteria. 8.3.8 Adverse Events of Special Interest An adverse event of special in terest (AESI) is an event of scient ific and medical interest towards improving the understanding of the IP. An AESI may be seri ous or non -serious. For this study , AESIs include:  Anaphylactic reactions  Immune com plex disease (Ty pe III hy persensi tivity reactions)  Malignancy  Helmint h infect ions  Severe infect ions which are defined as:"

Please refer to Appendix E 4for further instructi on on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and eva luation of Hy’s Law. 8.4 Safety reporting and medical management 8.4.1 Reporting of serious adverse events All SAEs must be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF. If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Invest igators or other site pe rsonnel must inform the appropri ate AstraZeneca representatives within one day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it . The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the Invest igator to ensure that all the necessary informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening eve nts and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life -threatening adverse events where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active fo llow-up will be undertaken immediately . Investi gators or other si te personnel wi ll inform AstraZeneca representatives o f any fo llow-up informat ion on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becom es aware of it . Once the Invest igators or other site personnel indic ate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an autom ated em ail alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative(s). If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site staff must report a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative(s) by telephone."

The reference document for definit ion of expectedness/listedness is the Investigator’s Brochure for the AstraZeneca IP. 8.4.2 Pregnancy All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca except if the pregnancy is discovered before the study subject has received any study drug. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours of learning o f the pregnancy. Abnorm al pregnancy outcom es (eg, spontaneous abortion, foetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopi c pregnancy ) are considered SAEs. 8.4.2.1 Maternal exposure If a subject beco mes pregnant during the course of the study, IP should be discont inued immediately . Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspicio n that the IP under study may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion. Congenital abnorm alities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. El ective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormalit y) shoul d be f ollowed up and docum ented even if the subject was discontinued fro m the study . If any pregnancy occurs in t he course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site personnel must inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becom es aware of i t. The designated AstraZeneca represe ntative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all relevant inform ation is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry site wi thin 1 or 5 cal endar days for SAEs (see Section 8.4.1 ) and wi thin 30 days for all other pregnancies. The same timelines apply when outcome informat ion is available. The PREGREP module in the CRF is used to report the pregnancy and the PREGOUT is used to report th e outcom e of the pregnancy . 8.4.2.2 Paternal exposure Pregnancy of the subject’s partners will not be considered an AE. However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnorma lity) shoul d be fo llowed up and docum ented in the Pregnancy Report Form for concepti ons occurring from the date of the first administration of IP unt il 16 weeks (5 half - lives) after the last administration of IP.

There i s currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose of IP and possible symptoms of an overdose are not established. An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF mo dule. An overdose without associated symptom s is only reported on the Overdose CRF module. If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all relevant inform ation is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry site. For overdoses associated with a SAE , the standard reporting t imelines apply, see Sect ion 8.3.2 . For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 day s. 8.4.4 Medication error If a medicat ion error occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all relevant inform ation is completed within 1 (Init ial Fatal /Life -Threatening or fo llow-up Fatal /Life - Threatening) or 5 (other ser ious init ial and fo llow-up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the m edicat ion error (see Section 8.3.2 ) and within 30 days for all oth er medicati on errors. The definit ion of a Medicat ion Error can be found in Appendix B 8. 8.4.5 Management of IP -related toxicities Appropriate drugs, such as epinephrine, H1 and H2 antihistamines, and corticosteroids, as well as medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions, must be immediately available when IP is being administered. Study site personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis (Lieberman et al . 2010 ). Details on anaphylaxis management are provided in Appendix G. Anaphylaxis will be defined as a serious reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death (Sampson et al . 2006 ). Anaphylaxis t ypically manifest as 1 of 3 clinical scenarios: 1.The acute onset of a reaction (minutes to hours) with invo lvement of the skin, mucosal tissue or both and at least one of the f ollowing: a) respiratory com promise; or b) reduced blood pressure or symptoms of end -organ dy sfunct ion"

Subjects will have had a pre -assessment (i.e., vital signs and lung funct ion) pri or to IP administration. At Visits 3 and 5, subjects should be observ ed for a minimum of 2 hours after IP administration for the appearance o f any acute drug reactions. For the remaining visits invo lving IP administration, subjects will be observed for a minimum o f 1 hour after IP administration for any such react ion. If an anaphylact ic react ion occurs, a blood sample will be drawn fro m the subject as soon as possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for analysis of serum tryptase. The sample will be tested at the local lab or ce ntral lab where applicable. 8.4.6 Data Safety Monitoring Board The Data Safet y Moni toring Board (DSMB) i s an independent expert advisory group commissio ned and charged wit h the responsibilit y of assessing safet y aspects of ado lescent involvement in the study . The DSMB will also review safet y data for adults to provide context for the adol escent review. The DSMB will evaluate cumulat ive safet y and other clinical trial data at regular intervals and making appropriate recommendat ions based on the available data. T he DSMB will funct ion independent ly of all other individuals associated with the conduct of the studi es, including the study sponsor, AstraZeneca. The committee will operate in accordance with a DSMB Charter. The DSMB will have access to the individual tre atment codes and will be able to merge these with the collected study data while the study is ongoing if and as required. The personnel involved in the clinical study at AstraZeneca will remain blinded to these analyses and will have no knowledge of the re sults presented to the DSMB. 8.4.7 Independent Adjudication Committee An independent adjudicat ion committee will be const ituted to provi de an external independent assessment of blinded data during the Phase 3 trials to confirm the diagnosis of MACE events and in vestigator reported malignancies that occur from rando mizat ion unt il the end of fo llow up period. This independent adjudication co mmittee, will also evaluate cases of ER or urgent care visit s and hospi talizati ons that occur from randomizat ion up to the en d of treatm ent peri od, as well as all deaths from rando mizat ion unt il the end of fo llow up peri od to eval uate whether any such event is due to a worsening of asthma.

Since the primary analysis o f the primary endpo int will include all available data, including after treatment discont inuation, no need is envisaged to adjust the number of subjects planned to be randomized in order to obtain a number of evaluable subjects . With 530 subjects per treatment group it is est imated that, using the mult iple testi ng procedure described in Section 9.4with an overall Type 1 error control at α=0.05 and a Ty pe 1 error control for the primary endpoint at α=0.01, the power for the primary and the key secondary endpoints will be at least 90%. The Ty pe 1 error control at α=0.01 for the primary endpoint i s chosen to further ensure s tatistically persuasive evidence. For the primary endpoint (in all subjects), assuming a placebo rate of 0.9, a shape parameter of 2.4 (over -dispersio n) and a dropout rate of 10% (uniform over the study), there will be >99% power to detect a rate reduction of 50% at a 2 -sided si gnificance level o f 1%.

For AAER in subjects with baseline eosinophils < 300/µL, assuming a placebo rate of 0.6 and assuming that half o f subjects will be in this subgroup (i.e. 265 subjects per treatment group), there will be 94% power to detect a rate reduction of 50% at a 2 -sided significance of 5%, with the sam e shape param eter and dropout assumpt ions as above. For each of t he key secondary endpoints, change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator FEV1, change from baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 total score, change from baseline in ACQ -6, and change from baseline in weekly mean Asthma Symptom Diary score, the nominal power is 95% or higher, assuming standard deviat ions of 400 mL and 1.3, 1.3, and 1.3 units respectively, and true differences of 100 mL and 0.3, 0.3, and 0.3 units respect ively. The minimum detectable differences being significant, under the above assumpt ions are 50 mL for FE V1, 0.16 for AQLQ(S)+12 total score, and -0.16 for each of Asthma Symptom Diary score and ACQ -6 score. 9.3 Populations for analyses For purposes of analysis, the following populat ions are defined: Population Description Enrolled All subjects who sign the ICF Randomly Assigned to Study treatmentAll subjects randomized to study treatment (irrespective of whether treatment is subsequently taken) Full Analysis Set All subjects randomised to study treatment who received at least one dose of IP, irrespective of their protocol adherence and continued participation in the study.

Prior and concomitant m edicat ions, categorized according to the WHO Drug Reference List dictionary whic h emplo ys the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classificat ion system, will be summarized by treatm ent group as frequency and percentage of subjects reporting usage. Prior medicat ions are defined as those which stopped before first dose of IP. Concomit ant medicat ions are defined as those which eit her started or continued after first dose of IP. Important protocol deviat ions will be defined at subject level prior to unblinding and will be summarized by treatm ent group. Subj ects will not be excluded from analysis sets on the basis o f any important protocol deviat ions. The definit ions of each category of important protocol deviat ion will be fully specified in the study Protocol Deviat ions Plan, and will include (but may not be limited to): subjects who were randomized to study treatment without fulfilling key entry criteria; subjects who received prohibited or restricted concomitant medications during IP treatm ent, subj ects who received the incorrect study treatm ent or study dose at any time during the 52-week double -blind treatment period. 9.4.1 Multiple testing procedures The overall Ty pe 1 error rate will be strongly controlled at the 0.05 level across the primary and key secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint (in all subjects) will be tested at the 0.01 level to further ensure statist ically persuasive evidence. In orde r to assess the primary objective of effect across the all -comer populat ion, the subgroup of subjects with baseline eosinophils < 300/μL has been added into the mult iple testing procedure following direct ion from the FDA. The fo llowing hierarchical test ingstrategy will be applied, ordered by clinical relevance, with the hypotheses to be tested as defined in Sect ion 9.1: Level 1 The null hypothesis H01 will be tested at a 2 -sided 1% si gnificance level wit h regard to the primary endpoint (AAER) in all subjects. Level 2 If H01 is rejected at the 2 -sided 1% si gnificance level, then the null hypothesis H02 will be tested at a 2 -sided 5% si gnificance l evel wi th regard to the AAER in subjects with baseline eosinophils < 300/µL. Level 3 If H02 is rejected at the 2 -sided 5% si gnificance level, then the null hypothesis H03 will be tested at a 2 -sided 5% si gnificance l evel wi th regard to change fro m baseline in pre - bronchodilator FEV1.

In general under this approach, the higher of the two ordered p -values within Level 4 will be evaluated at a γα + (1 -γ)α/2 significance level (2 -sided), and the lower of the 2 ordered p -values wit hin Level 4 will be evaluated at a γα/2 + (1 -γ)α/2 significance l evel (2 -sided), where α = 0.05, and where γ is the truncation parameter (0 ≤ γ ≤ 1) It is noted an interm ediate cho ice 0 < γ < 1 of the tru ncation parameter represents a cho ice between these extremes of regular Hochberg (corresponding to γ = 1) and Bonferroni approaches (γ = 0), balancing considerat ionsof how stringent hypothesis testing should be in Level 4 in order to claim significance, v ersus the abilit y to subsequent ly claim significance fro m formal hypothesis testing in Level 5. In this trial γ will be set to 0.5. Using this cho ice of truncation parameter, the higher of the two Level 4 p -values will be evaluated at a 3.75% significanc e level (2 -sided). If i t is significant at the 3.75% level, then both hypotheses H04a and H04b will be rejected, and testing will proceed to Level 5. If it is not significant at the 3.75% level, then the lower of the 2 Level 4 p- values will be evaluated at a 2.5% si gnificance level (2- sided). If it i s significant, then the relevant null hypothesis (either H04a or H04b) will be rejected, and testing will proceed to Level 5. If it is (also) not significant, then formal testing will stop at Level 4. The signif icance l evels for subsequent evaluat ion in Level 5 for each of these scenarios are given belo w. Level 5 The null hypothesis H05 will be tested at the significance level retained from Level 4, which depends on the outcomes in Level 4 as fo llows:  Case 1: Ifboth comparisons in Level 4 exhibit statistical significance, then H05 will be tested at a 2 -sided 5% significance level with regard to change from baseline in weekly mean ASD score.  Case 2: If only one of the com parisons in Level 4 exhibits statist ical significance, then H05 will be tested at the 2 -sided si gnificance level α – [γα + (1 -γ)α/2] retained fro m Level 4, where α = 0.05. Using the proposed choice of γ = 0.5, if both H04a and H04b were rejected in Level 4, then H05 in Level 5 will be tested at a 2-sided 5% si gnificance l evel (Case 1).

If there is no value on or prior to the date of rando mizat ion, then the baseline value will not be imputed and will be set to missing. For weekly means derived fro m subject diaries, baseline is de fined as the mean of the available data in the most recent week prior to the first dose of study treatm ent. If m ore than 3 day s are missing, then the baseline weekly mean will be set to missing. Further details regarding baseline definit ions will be pro vided in the SAP. Change from baseline is defined as the abso lute difference between the measurement at the relevant post- randomizat ion time po int and the baseline value. 9.4.3 Efficacy analysis 9.4.3.1 Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (AAER over 52 weeks) will quant ify the effect of the init ially rando mized treatment, regardless of the treatments that subjects actually received, or whether the subjects received other controller thera py/rescue medicat ions post IP discontinuat ion. This analysis will therefore include all available data after treatment discontinuat ion . Subjects will be encouraged to cont inue to undergo applicable study related visits/procedures for the full 52 -week peri od even after premature discontinuation o f IP. Consequent ly, subjects lost to follow -up and subjects who withdraw their consent will be the only source of missing informat ion for the primary analysis. Missing data from study discontinuat ion will be modelle d based on what was observed during the study using di rect likelihood approaches, which is a valid approach under the assumpt ion that data are missing at rando m (MAR). AAER in the tezepelumab group will be co mpared to that seen in the placebo group using a negat ive binomial model. This m odel will be used to perform the statist ical test specified in Secti on 9.1, and to estimate the treatment effect a nd both its 99% and 95% confidence intervals. The response variable in the model will be the number of asthma exacerbat ions experienced by a subject over the 52- week study period (or shorter durati on if not followed up for the full 52 weeks). Treatment, re gion, age (adolescents or adults) and history of exacerbat ions (2 or >2 in previous 12 months) will be included as factors in this model. The logarithm of the time at risk for exacerbat ion in the study will be used as an offset variable in the model, to ad just for subjects having different fo llow-up times during which the events occur. Time during an exacerbation and the 7 day s following an exacerbat ion in which a new exacerbat ion cannot occur, will not be included in the calculat ion of time at risk for exacerbat ion. Descript ive summaries of the asthma exacerbat ions will also be presented. Annualized rates for the individual exacerbat ion criteria (emergency room or urgent care visits due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizat ion due to asthm a, or use of"
104,page_104,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 105 (144 )systemic corticosteroids) will be summarized descript ively and analyzed using a similar model as for the primary endpoint. For the purpose of showing consistency of treatm ent effect across continuous baseline biomarkers (including, but not necessarily limited to, baseline eosinophils, FENO and total IgE), the AAER will be modelled across the continuous bio marker using methods such as mo ving average or smoothing splines. For the purpose of showing consistency of treatm ent effect across c ategorical baseline or demographic vari ables (including, but not necessarily limited to, hi gh and l ow eosinophil categori es, high and low FENO categories, specific IgE status, age categories, gender, race, history of exacerbat ions, asthma controller therap y at randomizat ion, and medium/high ICS dose), a similar model will be fitted as for the primary analysis wit h addit ional factors for the relevant subgroup variable and its interaction with treatment. This includes the analysis o f AAER in subjects wi th baseline eosinophils < 300/μL specified in Sect ion 9.4.1. Any further subgroup analyses, and exact definit ion of all relevant categories where needed, will be pre -specified in the SAP. Sensit ivity analyses on the primary endpoint will be perform ed, and will b e fully specified in the SAP. These may include, but not necessarily be limited to:  Analysis which makes provisio n for data to be missing -not- at-random (MNAR) and which makes different assumpt ions regarding those subjects who discont inue treatment or study prior to 52 weeks  Analysis which uses the exacerbat ion data captured whilst receiving study treatm ent only  Analysis in which adjudicat ion outcome of the ER or urgent care visit s, hospi talizati ons and all deaths are considered. 9.4.3.2 Analysis of key secondary efficacy endpoints The m ain analysis o f the key secondary endpoints (changes from baseline to Week 52 for each of pre-bronchodilator FEV1, AQLQ(S)+12 total score, ACQ -6 score and weekly mean ASD score) will quant ify the effect of the init ially rando mized t reatment at Week 52, regardless of the treatm ents that subjects actually received, or whether the subjects received other controller therapy /rescue medicat ions, including for subjects who discont inued study treatm ent pri or to Week 52. This analysis will th erefore include all available data after treatment discont inuat ion. Missing data fro m study discont inuat ion will be modelled based on what was observed during the study using di rect likelihood approaches, which is a valid approach under the assumpt ion that data are missing at random (MAR). Change from baseline for the key secondary endpoints in the tezepelumab group will be compared to that seen in the placebo group using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) model. This model will be used to perform the stati stical tests specified in Sect ion 9.1,"

The response variable in the model will be change fro m baseline at each scheduled post-randomizat ion visit up to and including Week 52, and irrespect ive of whether the subject remained on treatm ent and/or took other treatments. Treatment, visit, region, age (adolescents or adults) and treatm ent by visit interacti on will be incl uded as factors in this model. Baseline of the corresponding endpo int will also be included in the model as a continuous linear covariate. Unstructured covariance will be assumed to mo del the relat ionship between pairs of response variables taken at different visits on the same subject. If the MMRM model fails to converge with unstructured covariance, the SAP will pre- specify the approach for sel ecting a simpler covari ance structure. Th e Kenward- Roger approximat ion to estimat ing the degrees of freedo m will be used for tests of fixed effects derived fro m the MMRM model. Descript ive summaries of the key secondary endpoints will also be presented. Adjusted means from the MMRM m odel above wi ll be displayed graphically over time and used to evaluate time of onset of effect. The consistency o f treatm ent effects across continuous and categorical demographic/baseline variables will be invest igated in a similar manner to the primary endpoint. In t he case of categori cal variables, appropriate terms will be added to the MMRM model, including a treatm ent by visit by subgroup interacti on term , to enable the treatment effects within each subgroup category at Week 52 to be estimated. Any further subgroup analyses, and exact definit ion of all relevant categories where needed, will be pre -specified in the SAP. Sensit ivity analyses on the key secondary endpoints will be perform ed, and will be fully specified in the SAP. These may include, but not necessarily be limited to, the same items considered for the primary endpoint in Sect ion 9.4.3.1 . As a supportive analysis to the analysis o f change from baseline in ACQ -6, the main ACQ -6 analysis described above will be repeated for change fro m baseline in ACQ -5 and ACQ -7 score using a similar MMRM model. Similar descript ive and graphical summaries will also be produced. As further supportive analyses to t he analyses of change fro m baseline in ACQ -6 and AQLQ(S)+12, responders/non -responders (as defined in Sect ions 8.1.6.2 and 8.1.6.3 ) will be summarized descript ively and analyzed using a logist ic regressio n model with factors whi ch will include treatment, region and age (adolescents or adults).

Further details o f the logistic regression models and how missing responses at Week 52 will be handled will be specified in the SAP. 9.4.3.3 Analysis of othe r efficacy endpoints Annual rates for other relevant endpoints will be summarized descript ively and analyzed using a similar model as for the primary endpoint (Secti on 9.4.3.1 ). Other binary endpo ints will be summarized descriptively and analyzed using a logist ic regressio n model with factors which will include treatment, region and age (adolescents or adults). Baseline"

Other con tinuous endpo ints will be summarized descript ively and analyzed using an MMRM model analogous to that specified for key secondary endpoints (Secti on 9.4.3.2 ). Log transformation of endpo ints prior to implement ing the MMRM will be considered for continuous endpo ints which do not meet the distribut ional a ssum ptions, and this will be pre -specified in the SAP where possible. Time to first asthma exacerbat ion will be summarized graphically using Kaplan -Meier estimates, and analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards mo del with factors for treatment, region, ag e (adol escents or adul ts), and history of exacerbati ons (2 or >2 in previous 12 months). Further details of statistical models for other efficacy endpoints will be specified in the SAP, including details o f how missing data and data collected after premat ure di scontinuati on of study medicat ion will be handled. Sensit ivity and subgroup analyses will not be performed on other efficacy endpoints, unless specified otherwise in the SAP. 9.4.4 Safety analyses Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) versio n in force at each database lock. The definit ion of on-treatm ent and on -study for adverse event analyses will be given in the SAP. The number and percentage of subjects with on -treatm ent and on -study adverse events will be tabul ated separately by preferred term and system organ class. An event that occurred one or more times during a period will contribute 1 observat ion to the numerator of the proportion. The deno minator of the proportion will co mprise all subjects in the safety populat ion. On -treatm ent adverse events will also be summarized by intensit y/sev erity and separately , by causalit y/relatedness (as determined by the invest igator). Should a subject report the same preferred term/system organ class within mult iple intensit y/severit y or causalit y/relatedness categori es, the subject’s worst occurrence (m ost severe/m ost related) will be tabulated.

117,page_117,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 118 (144 )Appendix BAdverse event definitions and additional safety information B 1 Definition of adverse events An adverse event is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical study subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfav ourable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a deterioration of a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including run -in or washout periods, even if no Study treatm ent has been administered. B 2 Definitions of seri ous adverse event A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i .e., run -in, treatment, washout, follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:  Results in death  Is immediately life -threatening  Requi res in -subject hospi talisati on or prol ongat ion of exist ing hospi talisat ion  Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty.  Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect  Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or m ay requi re medical treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. B 3 Life threatening ‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would resul t in the subject’s death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (e.g., hepatit is that resolved without hepat ic failure). B 4 Hospitalisation Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in i tself a seri ous AE, al though the reasons for it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital admissio ns and/or surgical operati ons planned before or during a study are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study ."
118,page_118,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 119 (144 )B 5 Important medical event or medical treatment Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospi talisat ion, disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious. These shoul d usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used. Examples of such events are:  Angioedema not severe enough to require intubatio n but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatment  Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatm ent wi th N-acetylcysteine  Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  Blood dy scrasias (e.g., neutro penia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalisation  Development of drug dependency or drug abuse B 6 Intensity rating scale: 1. mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 4. moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities) 5. severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform norm al activities) It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of intensit y whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix B 2. An AE of severe intensit y need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for seve ral hours m ay be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix B 2. On the other hand, a stroke that resul ts in only a limited degree of disabilit y may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix B 2. B 7 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by the drug.  Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the subject actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the suspect drug?"
119,page_119,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 120 (144 ) Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect dr ug (pharmacology and toxico logy) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharm acological properti es?  De-challenge experience. Di d the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug?  No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.  Re-challenge experi ence. Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after hav ing been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge .  Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the relat ionship . In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:  Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?  Is there a known mechanism? Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a ‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expressio n ‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship. The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including eno ugh information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’. Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study has deteri orated due to l ack o f effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y. B 8 Medication Error For the purposes of this clinical study a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that ei ther causes harm to th e participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or parti cipant. Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error.  occurred"

The Principal Invest igator keeps full traceabilit y of collected bio logical samples from the subjects while in sto rage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate). The sample receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples while in storage and during use unt il used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival. AstraZeneca will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of study sites, audi ting or process checks, and contractual requirements of external laboratory provi ders Samples retained for further use will be stored in t he AZ-assigned bi obanks and will be registered by the AstraZeneca Bio bank Team during the ent ire life cycle. If required, AstraZeneca will ensure that remaining bio logical samples are returned to the site according to local regulations or at the end of the retenti on peri od, whi chever i s the sooner. C 2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples If a subject wi thdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical samples, the sam ples will be disposed of/destroy ed, and the acti on documented. If samples are already analyzed ,AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the resul ts of this research. As collect ion of th e bio logical sample(s) i s an integral part of the study , then the subject i s withdrawn from further study parti cipat ion. The Investigator:  Ensures subjects’ wit hdrawal o f informed consent to the use of donated samples is notified immediately to AstraZeneca  Ensures that bio logical samples from that subject, if stored at the study site, are immediately ident ified, disposed of /destroyed, and the action docum ented  Ensures the organizat ion(s) ho lding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroy ed, the acti on docum ented and the signed document returned to the study site  Ensures that the subject and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal ."

C 3 International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) 6.2 Guidance Document LABELLING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 3 categori es (http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.htm ). For transport purposes the classific ation of infect ious substances according to risk groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulat ions in the 46th edition (2005). Infect ious substances are now classified eit her as Category A, Category B or Exem pt. There is no direct relationship betwee n Risk Groups and Categories A and B. Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life- threatening or fatal disease in otherwi se healt hy humans or animal s. Category A pathogens are e.g., Ebola, Lassa fever virus:  are to be packed and shipped in accordance wit h IATA Instruction 602. Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious Substances that do not meet the criteria for inclusio n in Category A. Category B pathogens are e.g., Hepatit is A, B, C, D, and E viruses, Hum an immunodeficiency virus ty pes 1 and 2. They are assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name:  UN 3373 –Biological Substance, Category B  are to be packed in accordance with UN337 3 and IATA 650 Exempt -all other materials wit h minimal risk of containing pathogens  Clinical trial samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regul ations  Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient  temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging (http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_sub stances.htm )  Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods specification for the dry- ice content"

Variable response to therapy may be due to geneti c determinants that impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excret ion; mechanism of action of the drug; di sease aet iology; and/or mo lecular subt ype of the di sease being treated. Therefore, where local regulati ons and IRB/IEC allow, blood samples will be collected for DNA analysis fro m consent ing subjects. AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the response to medicat ions. Genetic research may lead to better understanding of disea ses, better di agnosis of diseases or other improvements in healt h care and to the discovery of new diagnosti cs, treatm ents or m edicat ions. In addit ion, collect ion of DNA samples from populat ions wit h well described clinical characterist ics may lead to im provements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, possibly , to geneti cally guided treatment strategies. Genet ic research may consist of the analysis o f the structure of the subject ´s DNA, i.e. the entire geno me. The results of genet ic an alyses m ay be reported in the clinical study report (CSR) or in a separate study summary . The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confident iality. The samples will be retained while research on tez epelumab cont inues but no l onger than 15 years or other period as per local requirements. D 2 Genetic research plan and procedures Selection of genetic research population Study selection record All subjects will be asked to participate in this genetic research. Participat ion is vo luntary and if subject declines to participate there will be no penalt y or loss of benefit. The subject will not be excluded fro m any aspect of the m ain study . Inclusion criteria  For inclusio n in this genet ic research, subjec ts must fulfil all o f the inclusio n criteria described in the main body of the Clinical Study Protocol and: Provide informed consent for the genet ic sampling and analyses. Exclusion criteria"
125,page_125,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 126 (144 )Exclusio n from this genet ic research may be for any o f the excl usion criteria specified in the main study or any of the fo llowing:  Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant  Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n in 120 days of genetic sample collect ion Withdrawal of consent for genetic research: Subjects m ay withdraw from this genetic research at any time, independent of any decisio n concerning participat ion in other aspects of the main study . Vol untary withdrawal will not prejudice further treatment. Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Se ction 7.3of the m ain Clinical Study Protocol . Collection of samples for genetic research Blood sam ples f or geneti c research will be obtained from subjects at Visit 3, 10, 17 and 19. Although DNA is stable, early sample coll ection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding subjects who may wit hdraw due to an adverse event (AE), such subjects would be important to include in any genet ic analysis. Samples will be co llected, labelled, stored, and shipped as detaile d in the Laboratory Manual. Coding and storage of DNA samples The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are important to maintain subject confident iality. Samples will be stored for a maximum o f 15years, from the date of l ast subject l ast visit, after which they will be destroy ed. DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. An addit ional second code will be assigned to the blood either before or at the time of DNA extracti on repl acing the information on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will be ident ifiable only by the second, u nique number. This number is used to ident ify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genet ics laboratories, or at the designated organisat ion. No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca employee or designated organisations working with the DNA). The link between the subject enrolment/randomization code and the second number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or designated organisations. The link will be used to ident ify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul ts wi th clinical data, all ow regulatory audi t, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal o f consent. Ethical and regulatory requirements The principles for ethical and regulatory requi rements for the study , incl uding this genet ics research component, are outlined in Appendix D."
126,page_126,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 127 (144 )Informed consent The genetic component of this study is opti onal and the subject may participate in other components of the m ain study without parti cipat ing in the genet ic component. To participate in the genet ic component of the study the subject must sign and date both the consent form for the main study and the genet ic component of the study. Copies o f both si gned and dated consent forms must be given to the subject and the original filed at the study centre. The Principal Invest igator(s) is respons ible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the subject understands that they may freely wi thdraw from the genet ic aspect of the study at any t ime. Subject data protection AstraZeneca will not provide individual genoty pe resul ts to subjects, any insurance com pany, any emplo yer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by law. Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identi ty of the subject. Regul atory authori ties may requi re access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical informat ion and the genetic files would remain physically separate. Data management Any genoty pe data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca and/or designated organi zations to analyse the samples. AstraZeneca and its designated organisat ions may share summary results (such as genet ic differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease) fro m this genetic research with other researchers, such as hospi tals, academic organisat ions or health insurance co mpanies. This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the resul ts of similar studi es to l earn even m ore about healt h and disease. The researchers can o nly use thi s informat ion for health -related research purposes. Researchers may see summary resul ts but they will not be able to see individual subject data or any personal identifiers. Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merg ed wi th the genet ic data in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database. Statistical methods and determination of sample size The number of subjects that will agree to participate in the genet ic research is unknown. It is therefore n ot possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal statist ical evaluat ion or whether only descript ive statist ics will be generated. A Statist ical Analysis Plan may be prepared where appropriate."

It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. Specifi c guidance on managing liver abnorm alities can be found in Sect ion 7.1of the Clinical Study Protocol . During the course of the study the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry . The Invest igator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets potential PHL cri teria at any point during the study . All sources of l aboratory data are appropri ate for the determinat ionof PHL and HL events; this includes samples taken at scheduled study visit s and other visits including central and all local laboratory evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study visits; for exam ple, PHL cri teria could be m et by an elevated ALT fr om a central laboratory and/or el evated TBL from a local laboratory . The Investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events. The Investigator participates, tog ether with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the el evations in liver biochem istry other than drug induced liver injury (DILI) caused by the Invest igational Medicinal Product (IMP). The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Adverse Events (AEs) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line wit h standard safet y reporting processes. E 2 Definitions Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3× Upper Limit of Norm al (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2×ULN at any point during the study following the start of study medicat ion irrespect ive of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).

128,page_128,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 129 (144 )For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e., on the same day ) the elevati on in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevat ions in transaminases and TBL must occur. E 3 Identification of potential Hy’s Law cases In order to i dentify cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any subject who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in iso lation or in combinat ion:  ALT ≥ 3×ULN  AST ≥ 3×ULN  TBL ≥ 2×ULN Central laboratories being used: When a subject m eets any of the PHL i dentificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in co mbinat ion, the central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Invest igator (and also to AstraZeneca representative). The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the PHL ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:  Notify the AstraZeneca representative  Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by the central laboratory  Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory CRF m odule(s) wi th the original local laboratory test resul t When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central or local laboratory resul ts the Invest igator will wit hout del ay:  Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria (see section 2 wi thin this Appendix for definit ion) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previ ous visits (including both central and local laboratory resul ts) E 4 Follow -up E4.1 Potential Hy’s Law criteria not met If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:  Inform the AstraZeneca representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria."

E4.2 Potential Hy’s Law criteria met If the subject does meet PHL criteria the Invest igator will:  Notify the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study Team  Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the Invest igator will report the case as an SAE of Potential Hy’s Law; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causalit y assessment ‘yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting  For subjects that m et PHL cri teria prior to starti ng IMP, the invest igator is not required to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the subject’s condit ion  The Study Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an approach fo r the study subjects’ foll ow-up (including any further laboratory testing) and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to this contact the Invest igator will:  Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. Completes follow-up SAE Form as requires.  Invest igate the aetiology o f the event an d perform diagnosti c investigat ions as discussed with the Study Physician. This includes deciding which tests available in the Hy’s law lab kit shoul d be used.  Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available E 5 REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all cases where PHL cri teria are m et. As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study Physician contacts the Invest igator in order t o review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanat ion for meet ing PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP, to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date PHL criteria was m et.

According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator wil l follow the instructi ons bel ow. Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for a S AE:  If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanat ion on the appropriate CRF  If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential Hy’s Law SAE and AE CRFs accordingly with the new inform ation (reassessing event term; causalit y and seriousness criteria) following the AZ standard processes If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations other than the IMP:  Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard processes. The ‘Medically Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious cri teria apply As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned. Ifthere is an unavo idable delay o f over 15 cal endar days in obtaining the informat ion necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio ncan be m ade:  Provi de any further update to the previously submitted SAE SAE of Potenti al Hy’s Law, (report term now ‘ Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IMP and seri ousness criteria is medically important, according to CSP proces s for SAE reporti ng.  Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary supplementary informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL S AE report fo llowing CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and amending the reported term if an alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemistry elevations is determined.

The World Healt h Organizat ion has categorized anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups, which are clinically indist inguishable: immuno logic [IgE -mediated and non -IgE-mediated (eg, IgG and immune complex mediated) and nonimmuno logic (Johansson et al, 2004). The clinical criteria for defining anaphylaxis for this study are listed in section 2. A gui de to the si gns and symptom s and management of acute anaphylaxis is provided in section 3. Appropri ate drugs, such as epinephrine, ant ihistamines, corticosteroids, etc, and medical equipment to treat anaphylact ic reacti ons must be immediately available at study sites, and study personnel sh ould be trained to recogni ze and treat anaphylaxis according to local guidelines. If an anaphylact ic react ion occurs, a blood sample will be drawn fro m the subject as soon as possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at dis charge for analysis of serum tryptase. G 2 Clinical Criteria for Defining Anaphylaxis and Immune Complex Disease Anaphylaxis In adults, anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the fo llowing 3 cri teria is fulfilled: 1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to se veral hours) with invo lvement of the skin, mucosal t issue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue- uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING (a) Respiratory com promise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia). (b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunct ion (eg, hy potoni a [collapse], syncope, incont inence). 2. Two or more of the fo llowing that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that subject (minutes to seve ral hours): (a) Involvement of the skin -mucosal t issue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips-tongue-uvula). (b) Respiratory com promise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hy poxemia). (c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hy potonia [collapse], syncope, incont inence). (d) Persi stent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomi ting)."
135,page_135,"Clinical Study Protocol 5.0 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00007 136 (144 )3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours): Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater th an 30% decrease fro m that subject’s baseline. Immune Complex Disease Immune com plex disease or Hy persensi tivity Type III i s evoked by the deposi tion of antigen- antibody or anti gen-antibody -complement com plexes on cell surfaces, with subsequent involvement of breakdown products of complement, platelets, and polymorphonuclear leukocy tes, and development of vasculit is; serum sickness and nephrit is is co mmo n.

Assessment of airway , breathing, ci rculation, and adequacy of mentati on 2. Administer epinephrine intramuscularly every 5-15 minutes, in appropriate doses, as necessary , depending on the presenting signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, to control signs and symptoms and prevent progression to more severe symptoms such as respi ratory distress, hypotension, shock and unconsciousness. Possibly appropriate, subsequent measures dep ending on response to epinephrine (a) Place subject in recumbent posit ion and elevate lower extremit ies. (b) Establish and maintain airway. (c) Administer oxy gen. (d) Establish venous access. (e) Norm al saline IV for fluid replacement. Specific measures to consider after epin ephrine injections, where appropriate (a) Consider epinephrine infusio n. (b) Consider H1 and H2 ant ihistamines. (c) Consider nebulized β2 agonist [eg, albuterol (salbutamo l)] for bronchospasm resistant to epinephrine. (d) Consider systemic corticosteroids. (e) Consider vasopressor (e.g. dopamine). (f) Consider glucagon for subject taking b -blocker. (g) Consider atropine for symptomat ic bradycardia. (h) Consider transportation to an emergency depart ment or an intensive care facilit y. (i)For cardi opulm onary arrest during anaphylaxis, high-dose epinephrine and prolonged resuscitat ion efforts are encouraged, if necessary ."
