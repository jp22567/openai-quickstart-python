8,page_8,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 8 LY28352191.Synopsis Protocol Title: An adaptive ,open -label, randomized Phase 2study of abemaciclib as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents versus choice of standard of care (gemcitabine or capecitabine) in patients with previously treated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Rationale: Cyclin -dependent kinase ( CDK )4 and CDK6 pathway alterations , along with Kirsten rat sarcoma ( KRAS ) mutations, are key molecular signatures thatoccur i n approximately 90% of panc reatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) . Abemaciclib, a CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor, has shown activity in KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines and has acceptable safety and tolerability in clinical studies. Given the relevance of the CDK4 and CDK6 pathway in PDAC, the activity of abemaciclib in KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines, acceptable safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in clinical studies, and the unmet medical need, this study aims to explore the safety and efficac y of abemaciclib in patients with PDAC . This study also aims to explore the safety and efficacy of abemaciclib in combination with LY3023414, an orally available, potent selective inhibitor of the class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K )isoforms, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR ), and DNA-dependent protein kinase, in patients with PDAC. Upstream mitogenic growth factors, including PI3K, induce the expression of Cyclin D1 ,which further activate sthe Cyclin D1 -CDK4 and CDK6 complex. Frequent ac tivating aberrations of PI3K/mTOR signaling have been reported in several cancers. A potent impact of CDK4 and C. DK6 inhibition in PDAC models has been observed ;however, in the majority of models analyzed, acquired/intrinsic resistance has resulted through bypassing of this inhibition. PI3K/mTOR inhibitors demonstrated cooperative effects in combination with a CDK4 and CDK 6 inhibitor in a pancreatic cancer tumor model. Synergistic activity of CDK4 and CDK6 and PI3K/mTOR blockade has been observed in o ther tumor models, and clinical trials are ongoing exploring this strategy. Galunisertib (LY2157299) is a small molecule designed to selectively inhibit the serine/threonine kinase of the transforming growth factor beta ( TGF -β)receptor ty pe I (TGF -RI). In PDAC , an increase in expression of epithelial -mesenchy mal transition triggering factors, including TGF -, has been observed and may contribute to the high metastatic potential. In pancreatic cancer cells, a CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor exert edgrowth -inhibitory effects , although a TGF -RI inhibitor alone was unable to suppress colon y growth in 3 -D culture . However , when the TGF -RI inhibitor was combined with a CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor, optimal growth inhibition was achieved . These preclinical data pr ovide a basis for exploring the combination of abemaciclib and galunisertib in the current study , although with amendment (c) the assessment of this combination is being discontinued ."

11,page_11,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 11 LY2835219Overall Design: Study I3Y-MC -JPCJ is a multicenter, randomized, open -label , Phase 2trial in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma w ho have been previously treated with at least one, but no more than 2 ,prior therapies for meta static disease . At least one of the prior therapies must have been either gemcitabine -based or fluoropyrimidine - based therapy . The safety and efficacy of each investigational arm will be assessed versus the standard -of-care arm by implementing a 2-stage design. For Stage 1, the primary analys esof safety and efficacy will be evaluated for each of 2investigational arms versus a standard -of-c are arm approximately 16 weeks after the last planned Stage 1 patient enters treatment. The 2 investigational arms include abemaciclib monotherapy (Arm A) andabemaciclib plus LY3023414 (PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor; Arm B). The comparator arm will be choice of standard -of-c are (gemcitabine or capecitabine; Arm D). Following the completion of the Stage 1 assessment, any treatment arm(s) with a disease control rate ( DCR )difference ≥ 0 as compared to the standard-of-c are (Arm D) will be selected to advance to Stage 2. Enrollment in the nonadvancing arm(s) will be discontinued. For the treatment arms that advance to Stage 2, additional patients will be randomized equally among the treatment arms (Stage 2) for further evaluation of safety and efficacy. Number of Patients: Safety Lead -in: According to the initial protocol, p rior to initiating Stage 1 of the study, a safety lead- in period for abemaciclib plus galunisertib was to be conducted with up to 12 patients. At the time of amendment (c), Lilly determined no additional patients would be enrolled to the safety lead -in and that Arm C (abemaciclib plus galunisertib) woul d be remov ed from the study. Stage 1: For Stage 1, a total of approximately 75 patients (25 patients per arm) will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3treatment arms. Randomization will be stratified by number of prior systemic therapies (1 versus 2). Stage 2: For the treatment arms that meet the decision criteria to advance to Stage 2 (DCR difference ≥ 0 in abemaciclib containing arms vs. the standard -of-care arm ),50 additional patients will be randomized to each experimental arm , as well as tothe standard -of-care arm. The arms that advance to Stage 2 will enroll a total of approximately 75patients per arm (including 25 patients from Stage 1) ."

29,page_29,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 29 LY28352193.Introduction 3.1. Study Rationale The m ost comm on genet ic mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcino ma (PDAC) include KRAS and CDK2NA , each of which occur sin approximately 90% of cases ( Jones et al . 2008; Biankin et al . 2012; Chiorean and Coveler 2015). Mutati on of KRAS leads to uncontrolled activat ion of mult iple downstream intracellular signaling pathways, contribut ing to tumor cell prolifera tion. However, in clinical trials, KRAS inhibitors have been largely unsuccessful , thus an emphasis has been placed on downstream pathways (Iriana et al. 2016 ). Abemaciclib , a cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) 4 and CDK6 inhibitor, has shown single -agent antiproliferat iveactivity in KRAS mutant pancreat ic cancer cell lines (Eli Lilly and Com pany [Lilly ] data on file) and has an acceptable safety and tol erabili typrofile in clinical studies. In addition, in preclinical models of pancreat ic cancer a synergist ic effect of CDK4 and CDK 6 inhibitors in co mbination wit h phosphat idylino sitol 3-kinase ( PI3K )/mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR )or transforming growth factor beta receptor ty pe I ( TGF -RI)inhibitors has been demo nstrated (Liu and Korc 2012; Franco et al. 2014 ). Given the unmet medical need for second -and third-line treatment options , this study aims to explore the safet y and efficacy of abemaciclib monotherapy , as well as abema ciclib in co mbination wit h other agents (including a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibi tor),versus choice of standard ofcare (gem citabine or capeci tabine) in patients wi thpreviously treated metastatic PDAC . 3.2. Background 3.2.1. Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Pancreat ic ductal adenocarcino ma is considered one of the most lethal so lid tumors , likel y to beco me the second -leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States by 2020 . Although the survival for most cancers has shown a steady increase, the estimated 5-year survival rate for metastati c PDAC is only 2.4% (Weinberg et al. 2015) . Worldwide, the incidence of pancreat ic cancer ranges fro m 1 to 10 cases per 100,000, with adenocarcinoma account ing for 85% of these cases ( Ryan et al. 2014). The poor prognosis is attributable to a lack of clinical symptoms and a delay in diagnosis unt il the cance r has reached an advanced stage. In addit ion, PDAC is unusually resistant to both cy totoxi c and molecularly targeted anti cancer agents (Ry an et al 2014; Schober et al .2015). Current ly,preferred first-line therapy options for patients wi th metastati c PDAC include the combinat ion of 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), leucovorin, irinot ecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX), gemcitabine plus nab -pacli taxel , or single -agent gemcitabine. In select patients with good perform ance status, second -line therapy for pati ents pr eviously treated with gemcitabine -based therapy includes fluoropy rimidine -based therapy and clinical tri al parti cipat ion; for those patients previously treated with fluoropy rimidine -based therapy , the recommended second -line option s aregemcitabine -based t herapy , the combinat ion of 5 -FU, leucovorin, and liposo ma l irinotecan (if no pri or irinotecan), or clinical trial participat ion (National Com prehensive Cancer Network"
30,page_30,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 30 LY2835219[NCCN ]Guidelines Versio n 1.2017). Addit ional second -line options include gemcitabine or fluorouracil mo notherapi es if pati ents have ei ther an Eastern Cooperative Onco logy Group ( ECOG ) performance status (PS)of 2 or a comorbidit y profile that precludes more aggressive regimens ( Sohal et al . 2016). In the third-line setting, no standard of care exists; recommendat ions are to provide palliat ive and best supportive care or enroll pat ients in a clinical trial. Recent ly, a Phase 3 study in pat ients previously treated with gemcitabine -based therapy has shown that nano liposo mal irinotecan (Onivyde ™[Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA]) in combinat ion with 5-FU and leucovorin compared to 5 -FU and leucovorin alo ne resul ted in improvement in progressi on-free survival (PFS) of 3.1 months versus 1.5 months an d in overall survival (OS) of 6.1 months co mpared to 4.2 months (Wang -Gillam et al . 201 6). In a retrospective review of patients treated in the second -line setti ng wit h gemcitabine monotherapy , PFS was 2.0 months and OS was 5.7 months (da Rocha Lino et al . 2015) . APhase 2 study of second -line ruxolit inib and capecitabine versus capecitabine alo nein pat ients previously treated with a gem citabine -based therapy resul ted in a PFS rate of 13% at 3 months and median OS of 4.3 m onths for pati ents receiving capeci tabine m onotherapy (Hurwi tz et al . 2015). Despite advances in both first -and second -line therapies for PDAC, OS rem ains poor, and treatm ent of PDAC remains an unmet m edical need. Current second -and third -line treatments for metastati c disease have limited efficacy andnovel therapies are urgent ly needed . Given these data, the current study will use gem citabine al one or capeci tabine al one as the standard- of-care treatm ent for the control arm. 3.2.2. Cyclin -Dependent Kinases 4 and 6 and Role in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma During the cell cycle, the G1 restrict ion point con trols entry into S phase and is essent ial for proper regulat ion of cell proliferat ion (Sherr 1996; Ortega et al. 2002). Cy clin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK 6) participate i n a complex with the D -type cyclins to init iate progression through the G1 restrict ion point. The CDK4 and CDK6 – Cyclin D1 co mplex regul ates the G1 restrict ion point through phosphorylat ion and inact ivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) tum or suppressor protein, thereby prom oting S phase entry . Alterati ons in this pathway occur frequent ly in human cancers , including PDAC, and invo lve 1) loss of funct ional CDK inhibitors , such as p16INK4A,through delet ion or epigenet ic silencing, 2) activating mutations and/or overexpressio n of CDK4 and CDK6 or the D -type cyclins, and 3) loss of funct ional Rb through m utation or deletion. Except for tumors wit h functional loss of Rb, which funct ions downstream of the CDK4 and CDK6 – Cyclin D1 complex, most cancers are poten tially sensit ive to pharmaco logic inhibit ion of CDK4 and CDK6. From a therapeutic standpo int, the goal of inhibit ing CDK4 and CDK6 with a small mo lecule is to prevent cell cycle progression through the G1 restrict ion point, thus arresting tumor growth. A key regulator of cell cycle progressi on in the CDK4 and CDK 6/Cyclin D/Rb pathway is the CDK inhibitor, p16INK4A. The cataly tic act ivity leading to reduced phosphorylation o f Rb, and thus G 1cell cycle arrest, is inhibited when p16INK4Abinds to CDK4 and 6. In more than 90% of"
31,page_31,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 31 LY2835219PDACs, p16INK4Ais inact ivated due to a genetic alteration in CDKN2A , which l eads to excessive activat ion of Cyclin D -CDK4 and 6 signaling (Biankin et al . 2002 ; Jones et al 2008; Ryan et al 2014 ; Goel and Sun 2015 ). In addit ion, overexpressio n of Cyclin D1 , due to am plificat ion of CCND1, occurs in approximately 68% of pancreatic cancers and is associated with a poor prognosi s (Biankin et al . 2002). Several preclinical reports have indicated that cell lines with loss or m utations of CDKN2A or l oss of p16 protein expressio n are parti cularly sensi tive to CDK4 and CDK 6 inhibitors (Wi edemeyer et al . 2010; Konecny et al . 2011). Abemaciclib (LY2835219) is a select ive and potent small mo lecule inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK 6. Abemaciclib prevents Rb phosphorylat ion, blocking progressi on from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, leading to suppression of tumor growth in preclinical models fo llowing short -duration target inhibit ion. Abemaciclib has broad antitumor activit y in preclinical pharmaco logy models, acceptable physical and pharmacokinet ic (PK) properties, and an acceptable toxicit y profile in nonclinical species. In vitro, abemaciclib has demonstrated antiproliferat ive act ivity in some KRAS mutant pancreat ic cancer cell lines (Lilly data on file). In addit ion, single- agent abemaciclib has demo nstrated an acceptable toxicit y profile and evidence of clinical act ivity in breast and non- small cell lung cancers (Dickler et al. 2016; Patnai k et al . 2016) . Given the relevance o f the CDK4 and CDK6 pathway in PDAC , the activit y of abemaciclib in KRAS mutant cancer cell lines, the acceptable toxicit y profile of abemaciclib in clinical studies, and the unmet medical need, this study aims to explore the safet y and efficacy of abemaciclib in patients wi th PDAC . 3.2.3. Phosphatidylinositol 3 -Kinase (PI3K)/ Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Pathway and Role in Pancreat ic Ductal Adenocarcinoma The expressio n of Cyclin D1 is induced by mitogenic growth factors, acting through various upstream signaling pathways. These signaling pathways, including mitogen -activated protein kinase and PI3K, converge downstream at the Cycl in D1-CDK4 and CDK6 com plex, l eading to its activation. Frequent activat ing aberrations of PI3K/mTOR signaling have been reported for several cancers (Opitz et al. 2008; Courtney et al . 2010; Miller et al. 2011; Varghese et al. 2011). PI3K and mTOR signa ling is st imulated by various growth factors and their receptors (including insulin) and regulates cell metabo lism, growth, survival, proliferat ion, and motilit y. A potent impact of CDK4 and CDK 6 inhibit ion in PDAC models has been observed ;however, in th e majorit y of models analyzed, acqui red/intrinsic resistance has resulted in bypassing of this inhibit ion. As it is widely recognized that combination targeted therapies may be requi red for successful treatment of pancreat ic cancer, a series of targeted a gents were screened in conjunction with a CDK4 and CDK 6 inhibitor in cell viabilit y assays. Based upon this screening, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors demonstrated cooperative effects in co mbination wit h a CDK4 and CDK 6 inhibitor in a pancreat ic cancer tumor model (Franco et al .2014). Synergist ic act ivity of CDK4 and CDK6 and PI3K/mTOR blockade has been observed in other preclinical tumor"

This study also aims to e xplore the safet y and efficacy of LY3023414, an orally available, potent and selective inhibitor of the class I PI3K isoforms, mTOR, and deoxy ribonucleic acid ( DNA )- dependent protein kinase ( DNA -PK), in co mbinat ion with abemaciclib in pat ients with PDAC . LY3023414 has demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile, and though limited efficacy data are available to date, preliminary evidence of single -agent activit y was observed in the Phase 1 Study I6A-MC-CBBA (CBBA) in pat ients with solid tum ors (Lilly dat a on file ) 3.2.4. Transforming Growth Factor -Beta and Role in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Transforming growth factor -beta (TGF -) has been shown to be a tumor promoter in advanced, metastati c cancer (de Caestecker et al. 2000; Massagué et al. 2000; Wakefield and Roberts 2002; Derynck and Zhang 2003). In pancreat ic cancer, TGF -has been involved in tum or progressi on (Miyazono 2000), by activating matrix metalloproteinase -2 and the urokinase plasminogen pathway (Ellenrieder et al 2001) . The TGF -pathway is one of 12 core signaling pathways in pancreat ic cancer, and mutations in the TGF -receptors or the downstream transcript ion factors (SMAD) occur in 90 %to 100% of tumors (Jones et al. 2008). In preclinical models o f pancreat ic cancer, TGF -signaling ind uces Rb phosphorylat ion, and hence inact ivation, leading to cellular proliferat ion (Biankin et al . 2002; Ouyang et al .2014). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the tumor- prom oting activit y of TGF -β,such as increased tumor neovascularizat ion,immunosuppression leading to the escape of tumor immune surveillance, and increased migrat ion and invasio n result ing in metastasis (Akhurst and Derynck 2001; Derynck et al. 2001; Siegel and Massagué 2003). Hence, recent studies have re cognized that TGF -plays animportant role in the progression of pancreat ic cancer (Truty and Urruti a 2007). These combined effects on the tumor microenvironment by TGF -β prom ote tum or progressi on and therefore, a TGF β-RI kinase inhibitor is expected to cause arrest of tumor growth and metastasis in patients with PDAC . Galunisertib (LY2157299) i s a small molecule designed to select ively inhibit the serine/threonine kinase of TGF -RI. Thus, the antitumor effect of galunisertib is expected to resul t in an increased tumor immune surveillance, reduced metastatic spread, and decreased tumor-associated neoangiogenesis. In a recent first -in-human dose study , Study H9H -MC- JBAH, single -agent administrati on of galunisertib was associated with partial tumor respons es in patients wi th relapsed glio blastom a multiforme. In addi tion, galunisertib has shown a favorable toxicity profile and preliminary activi ty in pancreati c cancer in the clinic. In a randomized, doubl e-blind, Phase 2 study (Study H9H -MC-JBAJ)in patients with PDAC comparing gemcitabine plus galunisert ib versus gemcitabine plus placebo, higher PFS and OS were observed in the gemcitabine plus galunisert ib arm (3.7 vs 2.8 months and 9.1 vs 7.6 months, respectively ). The subgroup of pat ients with baseline TGF 1 levels ≤4224 pg/mL had a median OS of 10.9 v ersus 7.2 m onths ( hazard rati o [HR] =0.68), respectively, and decreases in TGF -1 occurred with treatment, correlating with improved OS (Melisi et al. 2016)."
33,page_33,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 33 LY2835219In PDAC, an overexpressio n of epithelial -mesenchymal transit ion triggering factors, including TGF -, has been observed and may contribute to the high metastatic potential. In pancreat ic cancer cells, a CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor was found to exert growth -inhibitory effects ,although a TGF -RI inhib itor alone was unable to suppress colony growth in 3 -dimensio nalculture. However, when the TGF -βRI inhibitor was combined wit h a CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor, optimal growth inhibit ion was achieved (Liu and Korc 2012). These preclinical data provide a basis for exploring the combinat ion of abemaciclib and galunisertib in the current study , although ,with amendment (c) the assessment of this combinat ion is being discont inued (see Secti on5.4.3 ). 3.3.

Overall Design Study I3Y-MC-JPCJ (JPCJ) is a mult icenter, randomized, open -label, Phase 2study in pat ients with metastati c PDAC who have been previously treated wi th at least one, but no more than 2 prior therapies. At least one of the prior therapies must have been either gemcitabine -based or fluoropy rimidine -based therapy . This study will evaluate the safet y and efficacy of abemaciclib as a monotherapy or in co mbinat ion with other age nts versus choice of standard ofcare (gem citabine or capeci tabine ) by implement ing a 2 -stage design. No safet y data had been generated for the combination of abemaciclib and galun isertib . Therefore , a Safety Lead-in Period was included in the ori ginal protocol (see Section 7.2). The combinat ion of abemaciclib and LY3023414 wasassessed in a Phase 1b study (I3Y -MC- JPBJ) in pat ients with non-small cell lung cancer. Of 5 pati ents treated with abemaciclib 150 mg twicedaily (BID) plus LY3023414 200mg BID, 2 pati ents experienced dose-limiting toxicit ies (DLTs). However, of 3 patients treated with 150 mg abemaciclib BID plus LY3023414 150 mg BID, none experienced a DLT. Therefore, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LY3023414 in combinat ion with abemaciclib was determined to be 150 mg BID . With amendment (c) , Stage 1 of the study will randomize pat ients 1:1:1 into each of the following arms (25 pati ents per arm ): Arm A: Abemaciclib (LY2835219) , Arm B: Abemaciclib plus LY3023414 (PI3K/m TOR Dual Inhibi tor),or Arm D: Choice of Standard of Care (gemcitabine or capecitabine). For Stage 1, the analys es of safety and efficacy will be evaluated approximately 16weeks after the last planned Stage 1 patient enters treatmen t. All data accumulated during this period (beyond 16 weeks for some patients, if available), will be included in the analysis. Initial evaluat ions will co mpare investigational arms (Arms A andB) wi th the standard -of-care arm (Arm D), and will include a ssessment of disease control rate (DCR; complete response [CR]+ partial response [ PR] +stable disease [ SD]). Fo llowing the com pletion of the Stage 1assessment, any treatment arm(s) wit h a DCR difference ≥ 0 as com pared to the standard - of-care arm(Arm D) wi ll be selected to advance to Stage 2. Enrollment in the nonadvancing arm(s) will be discont inued . While the analysis for Stage 1 is ongoing, enro llment for all arms may continue unt il the assessment is co mplete. Any patients enrolled during the time tha t Stage 1 analysis is ongo ing will be included in planned enro llment for Stage 2. For the treatment arms that advance to Stage 2 , an additional 50patients will be rando mized equally to each arm for further evaluat ion of safet y and efficacy. The primary analysis o f Stage 2 will be conducted when at least 120 total PFS events have occurred for the combinat ion of each individual abe maciclib -containing arm and the standard -of-care arm,or all planned patients have been enrolled in Stage 2, whiche ver com es later.

End of Study Definition End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure for the last patient. 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design Study JPCJ is a Phase 2 adaptive design study thatwill be conducted in 2 stages. Stage 1 will permit decisio n-making in order to determine if eit her abemaciclib mo notherapy or abem aciclib in combinat ion with other agents provides a level of disease control that is at least comparable to the standard ofcare. Any arms demo nstrating evidence of dis ease control com parable to or better than the standard ofcare woul d meri t expl oration in a larger popul ationin order to assess PFS, and thus these arms would advance to Stage 2 in the current study . Although treatment guidelines reco mmend the use of combinat ion therapies in the second -line setting for metastatic PDAC, there is no consensus on the standard ofcare in pat ients who have failed first -line therapy. Further, no standard ofcare exists in the third -line setti ng. Based upon histori cal data, therecommended second -line co mbinat ion therapies do not provide significant survival benefit over gemcitabine or capecitabine mo notherapi es. The m edian OS for pati ents in a Germ an single -center cohort receiving second -line treatments including XELOX, FOLFOX , gemcitabine (± erl otinib), or FOLFIRI was 5.4 months (Maier -Stocker et al. 2014) , whi ch is comparable to the OS observed in prior studies (Secti on 3.2.1 )with gemcitabine (5.7 months) and capecitabine (4.3 months) . Ano ther single -institution retrospective study dem onstrated a median OS of approximately 5 months in pat ients treated wi th gem citabine/Nab -pacli taxel in the second -line setting (Bertocch i et al. 2015). Given the lack of consensus on standard ofcare in the disease setting being studied, and the similarit y in OSbetween combinat ion therapies and monotherapi es, gemci tabine and capeci tabine m onotherapi es were chosen for the standard -of- care arm. 5.4.1.

Major changes for am endment (b) included the fo llowing : Reduced the starting dose of LY3023414 to be administered in co mbinat ion with abemaciclib to reflect the MTD (150 mg BID) as determined in Study JPBJ Removed the restriction for taking LY3023414 at least 1 hour before or after a meal. Study CBB Bdetermined that LY3023414 can be administered irrespect ive of food intake,as the difference inexposure observed with and without food was not considered to be clinically relevant given the inter- subject variabilit y. Further, toxi city was determined to not be a concern based on di etary state. Added flexibilit y to the timing of the C3D1 echocardiogram for patients receiving galunisertib in order to accommodate this procedure which may be performed by a facilit y at a l ocati on other than the invest igative site Updated m ost comm on treatm ent-related AEs for abemaciclib and LY3023414 in Table JPCJ . 7.2to align wit h 2016 IB updates. 5.4.3.

In Study JPBA, abemaciclib inhibit ed CDK4 and CDK6 as indicated by inhibi tion of pRb and topoII al pha, which results in cell cycle inhibit ion upstream of"

This inhibit ion was associated with clinical benefit. The dose of LY3023414 ( 150 mg BID) used in this study was the MTD ident ified in combinat ion with abemaciclib 150 m g BID in the Phase 1b Study JPBJ . The dose of galuni sertib (150 mg BID) used in th e safet y lead-in period has demo nstrated a favorable risk /benefit profil e across m ultiple studi es, when administered as a single agent or in combinat ion with various chem otherapies . The g alunisertib dose was ident ifiedbased on resul ts from preclinical pharmacodynamic biomarker s and non-clinical toxi cology models, which allowed for a prospective definit ion of a therapeutic window. Simulat ions suggested that target- related inhibit ion of p -SMAD (a downstream target of TGF -β activation) by more than 50% for at least 8 hours, shoul d provi de sufficient activit y, while minimizing the potential for cardi ovascular toxi city. Plasma exposures observed in clinical trials following administrati on of 150 m g BID arewithin th ispredicted therapeutic window (Gueorguieva et al. 2014). Furtherm ore, clinical tri als ut ilizing 150 mg BID have demo nstrated activit y inhepatocellular and pancreat ic cancer patients (Faivre et al. 2014; Melisi et al. 2016) , without si gnificant toxicity. The current study will assess the safet y and pharmacokine tics (PK)of abemaciclib 150 mg BID plus galunisert ib 150 mg BID for the 7 pati ents enrolled in a safet y lead-in period at the time of amendment (c) , but will not assess this co mbinat ion in the rando mized period of the study."

Method of Treatment Assignment Safety Lead -in Based on the original protocol , prior to the randomized portion of the study (Stage 1 and Stage 2) up to 12 patients who satisf iedall inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusio n criteriawere to be enrolled to a safet y lead-in peri od. Initially, 6 pati ents were to be enrolled to receive abemaciclib plus galunisert ib. If the combinat ion of abemaciclib 150 mg BID and galunisert ib150 m g BID was not tol erated (that is, more than one patient experi enced a DLT wi thin the fi rst 28 -day cycle), then the dose of abemaciclib was to be reduced to 100 mg BID and an addit ional 6 patients enrolled at thi s dose. If the combinat ion was not tol erated (that is, more than one patient experience da DLT wi thin the fi rst 28 -day cycle) at the reduced dose of abemaciclib, then patients were not to be enro lled to the abemaciclib plus galunisert ib arm (Arm C). For the safet y lead-in, any pat ient who was discontinued fro m the study before receiving at l east 75% of the planned doses of abemaciclib and galunisertib in Cycle 1 w asdeemed nonevaluable for assessment of that dose level and wasreplaced ,unless that patient experience da DLT before withdrawal . Nonevaluable patients were to be replaced to ensure that no fewer than 6 patients receive dat least 75% of the planned doses of abemaciclib and galunisertib in Cycle 1, unless enrollment to that cohort was stopped because more than one patient at that dose level experienced a DLT. At the time of amendment (c), Lilly determined no additional pat ients woul d be enro lled to the safet y lead-in and that Arm C would be removed from the study . A total of 7 patients had been enrolled in the safet y lead-in and 2 were still on treatment. Ongoing patients enro lled to the safet y lead-in may cont inue on study treatment if, at the discretion of the treating invest igator, the pati ents are benefit ing from therapy and not considered at r isk from a safet y standpo int. Toxicit ies were graded according to Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0 ). If mult iple toxicit ies were observed, the presence o f DLTs was to be based on the m ost severe toxi city experi enced. D uring the Safety Lead- in Period only, DLTs were defined as any of the f ollowing events thatoccur redduring the first cy cle of administrati on of the combinat ion of abemaciclib and galunisertib and were consi dered by the invest igator to be attributable to either study treatment alone or the combinat ion of the two: Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicit y (except for nausea, vo miting, diarrhea, or electroly te disturbance) Grade 3 or 4 nausea or electrolyte disturbance that persist edmore than 48 hours despite maximal supportive intervent ion Grade 3 vomit ing or diarrhea that persist edmore than 48 hours despite maximal supportive intervent ion Grade 4 vomit ing or diarrhea of any durat ion Grade 4 hematologic to xicity that persi stedmore than 5 days Grade 3 thrombocy topeni a with bleeding Grade 4 thrombocy topeni aof any durati on Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever"

Rando mizat ion will be stratified by number of prior sy stemic therapies (1 versus 2). The peri od between rando mizat ion to study treatment and the first dose (Cy cle 1, Day 1) shoul d not exceed 7 days. Stage 1 Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 amongtheinvestigat ional arms and the standard -of-care arm, to provi de a total of 25 pati ents per arm . Pati ents assigned to the standard -of-care arm (Arm D) will be administered either gemcitabine or capecitabine, at the discretion of the invest igator. In determining which standard -of-care therapy to administer, the invest igator should take into consideration NCCN Guidelines, which indicate that patients previously treated with gemcitabine -based therapy shoul d receive capecitabine and patients previously treated with fluoropy rimidine -based therapy shoul d receive gemcitabine . Stage 2 An addit ional 50 patients will be randomized to each invest igational arm that pass esStage 1 as well as in the standard -of-care arm. The interactive web- response system (IWRS) will be used to assign unique pati ent identification numbers and study treatm ent to each pati entin the Safet y Lead -In,Stages 1 ,and Stage 2. 7.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses A cycle is defined as an interval of 28days for all study treatm ents except capecitabine (21- day cycle). During all cycles, oral study treatm ents shoul d be taken wi th a glass of water at approximately the same t ime each day. Patients should not chew or crush these study treatments. If the patient misses or vomits a dose of oral study treatm ent, the patient should skip the dose and take the next dose as scheduled. For pati ents assigned to the safet y lead-in or Arm B, combinat ion agents are to be taken at approximately the same time, in no specific order of administration. A delay of a cycle due to holiday, weekend, bad weather, or other unforeseen circumstances will be permitted for a maximum o f 7 days and not counted as a protocol deviat ion. A cy cle delay due to toxicit y is permitted up to 14 day s (see Sectio n 7.4).In the event only 1 of 2 study treatm ents for pati ents inthe safet y lead-in or Arm B is suspended or if each study treatm ent is reintroduced in a sequent ial manner , Day 1 of the next cycle is considered the date that the first of the individual study treatm ents is dispensed and ad ministered to the patient. The actual doses of gemcitabine and capecitabine to be administered will be determined by calculat ing the patient ’s body surface area at the beginning of each cycle. If the patient’s weight does not fluctuate by more than 10% fro m the weight used to calculate the prior dose, the dose will not need to be recalculated. A 5% variance in the calculated total dose will be allowed for ease of dose administration."

Dosage Modifications for Investigational Agents Dose adjust ments(suspensio ns and reductions) will be m ade based on the clinical assessment of hematol ogic and nonhematologic toxicit ies(defined as an AE possibly related to study treatm ent per invest igator judgment) . The CTCAE v 4.0 will be used to assess AEs. Treatment may be suspended for a maximum o f 14 days to allow a patient sufficient time for recovery from study treatm ent-related toxicit y. If a pat ient does not recover fro m the toxicit y within 14 days fro m the time of last treatment, the patient should be considered for permanent discont inuat ion from study treatm ent. In except ional circumstances, a delay >14 day s is permitted upon agreement between the invest igator and the Lilly CRP. Patients in the safet y lead-inreceiving galunisert ib must receive a minimum o f 10 days of dosing in a 28 -day cycle. This sect ion is intended to be a guideline for the investigator and cannot fully replace the investigator’s best judgment. The invest igator should assess the contribut ion of each individual investigat ional agent to the AE and differentiate from disease -related si gns and symptom s before deciding on a dose suspensio n orreduction. In assessing to which study treatm ent to assi gn a toxicityfor the purpose s of dose adjustments , the investigator may consult Table JPCJ .7.2, which includes the most common treatment -related AEs reported in the IB for each invest igational agent . This list ing of co mmo n treatment -related AEs is not exhaustive; invest igators should consider all preclinical and clinical data provided in the respect ive IB (or product label in the case of Arm D) for each agent when deter mining whether to adjust a patient’s study treatment.

Dosage Modifications for Gemcitabine The safet y profile of gemcitabine as a single agent is well characterized in studies of a variet y of malignancies (Gem zar® gemci tabine HC l [for injecti on]prescribing instructions page [WWW]), in which patients received gemcitabine 800 mg/m2to 1250 mg/m2. For these patients, the hematol ogic toxici ty was mild wi th only 1%to 4% of pat ients having Grade 3/4 thrombocy topenia , 1% to 7% having Grade 3/4 anemia, and 6% to 19% of pat ients having Grade 3/4 neutropenia. The m ost comm on (≥5%) Grade 3 /4 n onhematol ogic toxi cities of this regimen were nausea/vo miting, increased ALT, increased alkaline phosphatase, and increased AST . All of these toxicit ies are m onitorable, manageable, and reversible. Therefore, Lilly recommend sto reduce gem citabine only to m anage hematol ogic toxi cities of neutropeni a and thrombocy topenia or if nonhematol ogic toxi city arises. The gemcitabine d ose can be adjusted fo llowing Table JPCJ. 7.4in the event of a hematologic toxicity, as th ispresent sthe in-label reco mmendat ions for dose reductions for gemcitabine when used as monotherapy .

All nonhematologic toxicit ies (excluding alopecia) should also return to CTCAE Grade ≤1 or baseline prior to reinit iating treatment. Treatment may be delayed up to 4 weeks after com pletion of the 28- day cycle to allow sufficient time for recovery . For nonhematologic toxicit ies, gem citabine shoul d be perm anent ly discont inued in the event any of the fo llowing occur: unexplained dyspnea or other evidence of severe pulmo nary toxicity, severe hepatic toxicit y, hemolytic-uremic syndro me, capillary leak s yndrome, or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndro me. Gemcitabine should be suspended or the dose reduced by 50% for other severe (Grade 3 or 4) non hematol ogic toxici ty until resolved. No dose modificati ons are recommended for alopecia, nausea, or vomit ing. For pati ents who have a gemcitabine dose reduction within a cycle, subsequent dose escalat ion to the original dose will be allowed, providing that the patient tolerates the cy cle given at the reduced dose level. If a patient requires a second red uction wi thin a cycle and after a dose re -escalat ion, the dose shoul d not be re -escalated to the higher level a second time. The patient should continue to receive the reduced dose for the remainder of the study .If a patient requires a second reduct ion after a cy cle is com pleted, the dose should not be re -escalated to the higher level a second time unless, in the opinio n of the invest igator, this is likely not to result in addit ional toxicit y. Patients requi ring m ore than 2 consecut ive dose reductions ( within a cycle or after a cy cle is completed) for gemcitabine -related hematol ogic and/or nonhematologic toxicit y, will be discontinued from the study unless there is clinical benefit for the patient. 7.4.3. Dosage Modifications for Capecitabine The safet y profile of capeci tabine as m onotherapy has been characterized for patients with colorectal and breast cancers.

F or these pati ents, the incidence o f Grade 3/4 hematologic abnormalit ies(neutropeni a, thrombocy topeni a,or decreases in hemoglo bin)was l ow. Commo n nonhematol ogic Grade 3 /4toxicitiesinclude dia rrhea, abdo minal pain, hand -and-foot syndrome, and hyperbilirubinemia. Of note, elderly patients (≥65years) may experience a higher incidence of Grade 3/4 toxicit iesand therefore therapy may be initiated at a lower dose per the discret ion of the invest igator and inst itutional guidelines . The capecitabine dose can be adjusted fo llowing Table JPCJ. 7.5, as this presents the in -label recommendat ions for dose reducti ons for capecitabine when used as mo notherapy . Once the dose has been reduced, it should not be subsequently increased. Doses omitted for toxicit y shoul d not be repl aced. Capecitabine will not be given unless the ANC is ≥1.5 ×109/L and platelets are ≥100 ×109/L. If Grade 3/4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurs, stop therapy until condit ion reso lves.

Following the administration of growth factors, the dose of study drug m ust be reduced by 1 dose level , if a dose reducti on for the specific event necessitat ing the use of the growth factors has not already occurred. Use of ery thropoi etin is allowed (Rizzo et al. 2008). For pati ents assigned to abemaciclib treatment a rms ( safet y lead-in as well as Arms AandB) or those assigned to Arm D who are receiving capecit abine, proth rombin time or internat ional norm alized rati o must be routi nely mo nitored ifpatients are receiving conco mitant oral coum arin-derivat ive ant icoagulants. For pati ents in Arm B requi ring ini tiation of or changes to oral ant idiabet ic medicat ions for blood glucose control , the first choice recommendation is sitagliptin because of low potential for drug interact ions mediated via cytochrom e P450 ( CYP ) 3A a nd renal transporters . Addit ional options may include repaglinide or low -dose sulfonylureas (with due precautions, including standard education of pat ients regarding the signs o f hypoglycemia). No other chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radi ation therapy , horm onal cancer therapy , or experimental medicat ions will be permitted while the pat ients are participat ing in this study . Any disease progression requiring anticancer therapy will be cause for early discontinuati on from the study . 7.7.1. Surgery for Cancer A pat ient may receive surgery (for example, m etasta sectomy) during the study treatm ent peri od if clinically indicated. Patients undergo ing surgery should have study treatment suspended for at least 7 day s prior to surgery , as well as 7 days postoperatively to allow for wound -healing. If a patient undergoes a surgical procedure that involves removal of tumor, then formalin-fixed paraffin -embedded ( FFPE )tumor from that procedure may be requested. 7.7.2. Management of Diarrhea Upon treatment init iation , patients assigned to abemaciclib treatment arms ( Safety Lead -Inas well as Arms A andB)or those assigned to Arm D who are receiving capecitabine shoul d"
55,page_55,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 55 LY2835219receive instructions on the management of diarrhea. In the event of diarrhea, supportive measures should be i nitiated as early as possible . These include the fo llowing: At the first sign o f loose stools, the patient should init iate antidiarrheal therapy (for example, loperamide) and notify the invest igator/site for further instructions and appropriate fo llow-up. Patients shoul d also be encouraged to drink fluids (for example, 8 to 10 glasses of clear liquids per day ). Site personnel should assess response within 24 hours . If diarrhea does not resolve with ant idiarrheal therapy within 24 hours to at least Grade 1, study treatm ent should be suspended unt il diarrhea is reso lved to at least Grade 1. In severe cases of diarrhea, the measuring of neutrophil counts and body temperature and proactive management of diarrhea wit h ant idiarrheal agents shoul d be considered. If diarrhea i s severe (requiring intravenous [ IV]rehydrat ion) and/or associated with fever or severe neutropenia, broad- spectrum antibiot ics such as fluoroquino lones must be prescribed. Patients wi th severe di arrhea or any grade of di arrhea associated with severe nausea or vomit ing shoul d be carefully mo nitored and given IV fluid (IV hy dration) and electroly te repl acement. 7.7.3. Management of Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia has been observed in pat ients treated wi th LY3023414. Patients who develop hyperglycemia duri ng the study shoul d be treated according to the American Diabetes Associ ation and European Association for the Study o f Diabetes consensus guidelines. It is recommended to start treatment with an oral ant idiabet ic medicat ion, preferably sitaglipt in. Addit ional options may include repaglinide or low -dose sulfo nylureas (with due precautions, including standard educat ion of patients regarding the signs o f hypoglycemia) (see Section 7.7). 7.7.4. Supportive Management for Stomatitis/Mucositis Stom atitis, including oral mucosit is, has been observed in pat ients treated with LY3023414. Prophylactic treatment and early recognit ion of this AE is highly important . Early and act ive management includes the promotion of good oral hygiene. Topical treatments with corticosteroi ds and m outhwashes similar to those used for management of chemotherapy -induced stomat itis are recommended. However, mouthwashes containing a lcoho l, peroxi de, iodine, and thyme derivat ives should be avo ided as they may exacerbate the condit ion. Antifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infect ion has been diagnosed. Patients also shoul d be advised to avoid acidic, spicy , and hard or c runchy foods, and to consume foods that are tepid rather than hot in temperature to prevent the potential for mechanical injury."

Concurrent Use of Inducers and Inhibitors of CYP3A4 , Substrates of CYPS with Narrow Therapeutic Range ,or Drugs Causing QTc Pro longation Abemaciclib is extensively metabo lized through oxidat ion by CYP3A. In clinical drug interact ion studies, coadministration of clarithro mycin, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased exposure ( area under the concentration -time curve ) to abem aciclib by 3.4-fold (Study I3Y-MC- JPBE) and coadministration of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased exposure to abemaciclib by 95% (Study I3Y-MC-JPBF). Based on these findings, grapefruit juiceaswell as inducers (forexample, phenytoin orcarbamazepine) andinhibitors of CYP3A4 shoul d be substituted or avoided if possible (Appendix 7 ). Inaddition, in vitro studies in primary cultures of human hepatocy tesindicate thatabemaciclib andits active metabolites LSN2839567 andLSN3106726 ,down regulate messenger ribonucleic acid (mRN A)of CYPs including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, andCYP3A atclinically relevant concentrations. The mech anism ofdown regulat ionand its clinical relevance arepresent lynot understood. Caution should be exercised when coadministering substrate drugs of CYPs with narrow therapeutic margin (Appendix 7 ). Abemaciclib and its major metabolites inhibit the efflux transporters P -glycoprotein and breast cancer resistant protein and renal transporters organic cat ion transporter 2, mult idrug and toxin extrusi on protein 1 (MATE1) and MATE2 -K at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, substrates of these transporters such as metformin and those with a narrow therapeutic index such as digoxin and dofet ilide should be substituted or avoided if possible. For LY3023414, preclinical data suggested potential inhibit ion of CYP3A4 -mediated metabo lism and potential corrected QT ( QTc)interval prolongat ion likely secondary due to the sustained hyperglycemia induced by LY3023414 at plasma concentrations exceeding the ones observed in patients (for details, see the IB for LY3023414). Clinically, no obvious trend for QTc prol ongat ion has been observed in pat ients receiving LY3023414. The clinical data fro m Study CBBA indicate LY3023414 is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 ,as concomitant administration of LY3023414 and midazo lam leads to an increased exposure of midazolam (fo ld increase: m ean 1. 46). LY3023414 may lead to an increase in exposure to abemaciclib and other CYP3A4 substrates. Therefore, caution sho uld be exercised when coadministering substrate drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4 with narrow therapeut ic margin (Appendix 7 ) or drugs causing QTc interval prolongat ions (Appendix 8 ). As stated above ,grapefruit juice as well as inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be substituted or avoi ded if possible (Appendix 7 ) . Galunisertib is cleared predominant ly by oxidat ive metabo lism, wit h ident ified (inact ive) metabo lites accounting for 76% of the recovered dose, compared to only 13% of the dose being excreted as intact parent drug in the urine and feces combined (Study H9H -MC-JBAM). An invitro substrate depl etion approach using recombinant human CYP enzymes showed that 99% of the in vi tro hepati c CYP -mediated clearance of galunisertib was linked to CYP3A, with CYP2C19 accounting for the remaining 1%. As such, potent CYP3A inhibitors may have the"

Appendix 3 provi des a list of the laboratory tests that will be performed for this study . Appendix 4 provi des the schedule for collect ion of samples in this study . Unless otherwise stated in the fo llowing subsections, all samples co llected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed within 60 days after receipt of confirmed test results. Cert ain samples may be retained for a l onger peri od, if necessary , to com ply wi th applicable laws, regul ations, or laboratory certificat ion standards. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments Tumor assessments will be performed according to RECIST v.1.1 (Eisenhauer et al . 2009) for each patient at screening (within 28 days of randomizat ion) and subsequent ly approximately every 8 weeks (±3 days) . Upon init iation of Stage 2, Lilly or its designee will co llect and store all tumor assessment images; retrospective co llection of Stage 1 images will occur only for those arms that advance to Stage 2 . An independent review of imaging scans may be performed by an independent panel of radio logists. Com puted tom ography (CT) scans, including spiral CT, are the preferred methods of measurement (CT scan thickness reco mmended to be 5 mm); however, MRI is also acceptable in certain situat ions, such as when body scans are indicated or if there is a concern about radiation exposure associated with CT. Intravenous contrast is required unless medica lly contraindicated. The CT portion of a positron emission tomography (PET) -CT scan may be used as a method of response assessment if the site can document that the CT is o f ident ical diagnostic qualit y to a diagnosti c CT (wi th IV contrast). A PET scan al one or as part of a PET -CT may be perform ed for addi tional analyses but cannot be used to assess response according to RECIST v.1.1 (Eisenhauer et al. 2009). The m ethod of tum or assessment used at baseline must be used consistently throughout the study . Radi ological scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis is required at screening; subsequent ly,scans of the thorax for tum or assessments (CT of the chest for safet yis required per the Schedule of Act ivities for pati ents in the safet y lead-in; see Sect ion 9.4.1 )are required only for those pati ents wi th evidence of disease on the baseline scan or if clinically indicated (that is,progressive disease issuspected) . Partial response or CR will not require confirmat ion to be considered a response. In the case of SD, postbaseline tumor assessments must have m et the SD cri teria at l east once after rando mizat ionat a minimum interval of 6 weeks to assign a b est response of SD. See Secti on10.3.1 for definit ions of the efficacy endpo ints."
62,page_62,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 62 LY28352199.1.1. Appropriateness of Assessments The m easures used to assess safet y and efficacy in this study are consistent wi th those used in most convent ional onco logy trials. 9.2. Adverse Events A clinical study AE is any untoward medical event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is considered related to that dr ug. The invest igator will use CTCAE v4.0 (National Cancer Inst itute [NCI]2009) to assign AE terms and severit y grades. Any minor versio n of CTCAE v4.0 (for example, Version 4.0X) m ay be used for this study . Minor CTCAE v4.0 updates from the NCI will no t necessitate a protocol amendment. Invest igators are responsible for: monitoring the safet y of patients in this study and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the pati ent the appropriate medical care of patients during the study docum enting their review of each laboratory safet y report following, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to study treatm ent or the study , or that caused the pati ent to discont inue study treatm ent before com pleting the study. The patient shoul d be f ollowed until the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluat ion, or is reasonably explained. Frequency of fo llow-up evaluat ion is left to the discreti on of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the ICF is signed, study site personn el will record vi a electroni c data entry the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically significant si gns and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study . In addi tion, study site personnel will record via electroni c data entry any change in the preexist ing condit ions and any new condit ions as AEs. Invest igators should record their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to study treatm ent vi a electroni c data entry . The invest igator will interpret and docum ent whether or not an AE hasa reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent or a study procedure, taking into account the disease, concomitant treatments ,or pathologies. A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause andeffect rel ationship between the study treatm ent and/or study procedure and the AE. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . Study site personnel must report any dose m odificati ons or treatm ent discont inuat ions that result from AEs to Lilly or its designee via el ectroni c data entry , clarifying, if possible, the circumstances leading to the dose modificat ion or discontinuat ion oftreatm ent."
63,page_63,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 63 LY28352199.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es: death initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying) persistent or significa nt disabili ty/incapacit y congenital ano maly/birth defect considered significant by the invest igator for any other reason: important medical events that may not resul t in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious, based upon appropriate medical judgment Although all AEs after signing the ICF are recorded in the electronic data entry, SAE reporting begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received study treatm ent. However, if an SAE occurs after signing t he ICF, but prior to receiving study treatm ent, i t needs to be reported ONLY if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must notify Lilly or its designee of any SAE within 24 hours of investigator aware ness of the event via a Lilly -approved m ethod. If alerts are i ssued via telephone, they are to be immediately followed wit h official notification on study -specific SAE forms. This 24 -hour notification requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up SAE information. Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to study treatm ent) does not m eet the definit ion of an AE but shoul d be reported. However, to fulfill regulatory requi rements any pregnancy shoul d be reported following the SAE proces s to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in pat ients once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the pati ent summary CRF has been com pleted). However, if the inves tigator l earns of any SAE, incl uding a death, at any time after a pati ent has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Li lly. Planned hospi talizat ions or procedures for preexisting condit ions that were recorded in the patient’s medical history at the time of enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion without a preci pitating clinical AE (for example, for the administration of study treatm ent or other protocol -requi red procedure) shoul d not be considered SAEs. Serious adverse events, including death, caused by disease progression should not be reported unless the investigator d eems them to be possibly related to study treatment. 9.2.2. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to study treatment or study procedure.

Cardiac Monitoring In addit ion toelectrophysio logical assessments of the heart for all patients in this study , the m ost important evaluat ions are dictated by the gal unisertib preclinical findings. Hence, cardiotoxicit y monitoring must be performed for patients participating in the Saf ety Lead -in of this study , based on echocardiographs with Doppler and Chest CT/MRI (see Schedule of Act ivities [Section 2] and Appendix 6 ). The chest CT/MRI of the ascending aorta and aortic arch should be performed according to inst itutional guidelines. The same imaging techniques used at ba seline shoul d be used for each patient throughout the evaluat ion peri od. Electrocardiograms (all patients) For each patient, a 12 -lead di gital ECG will be collected according to the Schedule of Activit ies (see Section 2). Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collect ion and rem ain supine but awake during ECG collect ion. ECGs may b e obtained at additional times, if clinically indicated. ECGs will be interpreted by a qualified physician (the invest igator or qualified designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible and ideally while the pati ent is still present for immediate patient management, should any clinically relevant findings be ident ified. After enro llment, if a clinically significant increase in the QT/QTc interval fro m baseline, or other clinically significant quantitative or qualitat ive change fro m baseline, is present, the investigator will assess the patient for symptoms (for example, palpitations, near syncope, or syncope) and to determine if the patient can continue in the study . The invest igator or qualified designee is responsible for determ ining if any change in pati ent management is needed and must docum ent his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluat ion. Chest CT Scan with Contrast or MRI (Safety Lead- in Patients Only) A chest CT scan with contrast or MRI was required at screening for all patients in the Safet y Lead -inand subsequent ly according to the Schedule of Act ivities (see Sect ion 2) for these patients. The p urpose of this safet y assessment is to detect aneurysm formation of the ascending aorta and aortic arch. If a CT scan with contrast or MRI has been done as part of the patient’s tumor assessment, this scan may be used for safet y screening if the scan has properly assessed the great vessels and the heart. The same method of assessment used at screening should be used for each pat ient throughout the evaluat ion peri od. Echocardiogram with Doppler (Safety Lead- in Patients Only) Echocardi ography with Doppl er(ECHO/Doppler) was locally assessed at screening for all patients in the Safet y Lead -inand subsequent ly according to the Schedule o f Activities (see"
66,page_66,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 66 LY2835219Secti on 2) f or these patients,and safet y decisio ns made by physicians or a team of people who are qualified by experi ence or training. Individuals so qualified must be identified at each Safety Lead -insite. The same person should be responsible for reading the ECHO on any individual study patient. For pati ents who develop clinically significant changes, ECHO shoul d continue to be performed at 2-mont h intervals unt il clinically stable for 6months, then every 6months thereafter. If the patient has clinically significant cardi ac findings at the 30- day follow-up visit, ECHO will be repeated every 2 months for 6 m onths. If there are no clinically significant cardi ac findings at the 30-day follow-up visi t, a rep eat ECHO will be performed wit hin 6 months of the last ECHO. If there were no clinically significant cardiac findings at the last cardiac assessment conducted within the last 30 days and the patient has started another treatment, the 30 -day follow-up visi t ECHO will not be performed. 9.4.2. Guidance for Monitoring of Renal Function in Patients on Abemaciclib Abemaciclib has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibit ion of renal tubular secretion o f creatinine wit hout affect ing cystatin C cal culated gl omerular fil tration rate ( see Secti on3.2.4 of the abemaciclib IB for addit ional background). Increases in serum creat inine occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment, remained stable through the treatment period, and were reversible upon treatment di scont inuat ion. If deterioration of renal funct ion is suspected, serum creat inine should not be the only measure used to assess a patient’s renal funct ion. Based on this informat ion, it is suggested that for those patients with an increased serum creat inine test resul t while receiving abemaciclib, a serum c ystatin -C test can be performed to confirm renal funct ion. Cystatin -C blood concentration depends almost ent irely on the glo merular filtrat ion rate and is not affected by diet, nutri tion, inflammati on, or malignant disease. Dose alterati ons (omissio n, reducti on, or discontinuation) should not solely be based on interpretation of serum creatinine values because these may not reflect renal function. 9.4.3. Other Safety Measures For each patient, vital signs, laboratory tests, or other tests should be collected as shown in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Blood sam ples will be collected to determine whether patients meet inclusio n/excl usion criteria and to m onitor pati ent heal th. Enrollment and treatment decisio ns may be based upon results of tests performed locally. If local laboratory tests are used for this purpo se, then a duplicate specimen must be submitted to the central laboratory . Local laboratory tests perform ed for eligibilit y purposes m ust include analy tes wi th associ ated eligibilit y criteria (absol ute neutrophil count, pl atelet count, hem oglobin, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, serum creat inine, and HbA1c) ,as well as fast ing glucose ,at a minimum. Subsequent to enrollment, local laboratory tests may include the inst itution’s standard chemistry and hematol ogy panels , but m ust be perform ed under fasting condit ionsto assess glucose for all patients parti cipat ing in Arm B; Arm B m ust also include HbA1c.

Any clinically significant findings from ECGs, ECHOs , safet y CT scans, l abs, vi tal sign measurements, and other study procedures that resul t in a di agnosis shoul d be reported vi a electroni c data entry as an AE. 9.4.4. Safety Monitoring Lilly will periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate methods. The first periodic safet y review of the rando mized portion of the study (Stage 1) will occur after 10 patients have been rando mized to each treatment arm and co mpleted 1 cy cle (28 days) or have discont inued treatm ent. If a patient experiences elevated alanine aminotransferase ( ALT )5× upper limit of normal (ULN )and elevated total bilirubin 2× ULN in the absence of liver metastases , clinical and laboratory monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by the investi gator. For patients entering the study with ALT or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) >3× ULN in the presence of liver metastases, monitoring shoul d be tri ggered if ALT or AST is elevated to >2× baseline. Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory test abn ormalities.To ensure patient safety and comply wit h regulatory guidance, the investigator is to consult with the Lilly CRP regarding collect ion of specific reco mmended clinical informat ion and fo llow-up laboratory tests. See Appendix 5 . 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinet ic (PK) samples will be co llected as shown in Appendix 4 . During the Safety Lead -in, patients receiving the co mbination o f abemaciclib and galunisertib will undergo intense PK sampling. For all patients participat ing inthe study , thePKsample c ollection shoul d occur on the day that clinical laboratory samples are collected for the purposes of eligibilit y or heal th monitoring , corresponding to the originally planned next visit/cycle . Blood sam ples will be used to determine the concentrations of abemaciclib and its metabolites, LY3023414 , and gal unisertib . A patient diary will be used as source to collect the date and time of study treatm ent doses for the 3 day s preceding collect ion of PK samples. A maximum of 3samples m ay be collected at additional t ime po ints during the study if warranted and agreed upon by the invest igator and Lilly. Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure abemaciclib plus its metabo lites, LY3023414, and galunisertib concentrati onswill be retained for a maximum o f 1 year following the l ast pati ent visit for the study . 9.6.

Whole Blood Samples for Pharmacogenetic Research A who le blood sample will be co llected for pharmacogenet ic analysis as specified in Appendix 4, where l ocal regul ations allow. Samples will notbe used to conduct unspecified disease or populat ion genet ic research either now or in the future. Samples will be used to investigate variable response to study treatm ent and to investigate gene tic variants though t to pl ay a rol e in PDAC . Assessment of variable response may include evaluat ion of AEs or differences in efficacy. All samples will be coded with the patient number. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patie nt only by the study site personnel. Sam ples will be retained for a maximum o f 15 years after the last patient visit for the study , or f or a shorter period if local regul ations and/or ethical review boards ( ERBs ) /institutional review boards ( IRBs )impose shorter time limit s, at a facilit y selected by Lilly or i ts designee.

Molecular techno logies are expected to improve during the 15 -year storage period and therefore cannot be specifically named. However, exist ing techno logies include whol e genom e and exo me sequencing, geno me-wide associ ation studies, multiplex assays, candidate gene studies, and epigenet ic analyses. Regardless of the technology utilized, data generated will be used only for the specific research s cope described in this sect ion. 9.8. Biomarkers Biomarker research is performed to address questions of relevance to drug disposit ion, target engagement, pharmacodynamics, mechanism o f action, variabilit y of pat ient response (including safet y), and clinical out come. Sample collect ion is incorporated into clinical studies to enable examinat ion of these questions through measurement of bio molecules including DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular elements. As part of Lilly’s ongoing efforts to understand the relationship between cancer, genet ics, and response to therapy , this study will analyze biomarkers relevant to abemaciclib, galunisertib, LY3023414, gemcitabine, capecitabine, immune funct ion, cell cycle, and/or PDAC, and/or for related research method s or validation o f diagnostic tool s or assay s. Samples for bi omarker research will be co llected as specified in Appendix 4 , where l ocal regul ations allow. It is possible that bio marker data for patients in the study ha vealready been generated fro m samples that were collected and analyzed prior to enrolling in this trial. This may include data generated from genet ic analyses. If available, these da ta may be requested from medical records for use in the research described in Sections 9.8.1 and 9.8.2 ."

Collect ion of the fo llowing tum or tissue sample is required for all pat ients in o rder to participate in this study : FFPE tumor tissue obtained fro m the primary tumor or m etastati c site as a bl ock or unstained slides. However, if this sample is not available for a patient or provisio n of the sample is restri cted by local regulat ions, a protocol deviation will not be incurred and the patient is eligible for the study . Due diligence should be used to make sure that tumor sample (not a norm al adjacent or a tum or margin sam ple) is provided. Pathology report accom panying archival t issue m ay also be requested. The report must be coded with the patient number. Personal ident ifiers, including the patient’s name and init ials, must be removed fro m the institutional pathol ogy report pri or to submissio n. Archival blocks will be sect ioned and returned to the study site. Slides and tissue samples collected on -study will not be returned. For patients wi thout available FFPE tumor tissue at baseline, a core needle biopsy (minimum 3 cores) obtained prior to study treatm ent init iation is highly encouraged , but not required. Patients m ay be asked to undergo collect ion of an addi tional core needle biopsy specimen and blood sam ple after treatment with abemaciclib, LY3023414, gemcitabine, or cap ecitabine has been init iated or after disease progression. If requested, this biopsy specimen and blood sample will be used to further investigate mo lecular features that may explain treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

Tech nologies are expected to improve during the 15 -year storage period and therefore cannot be specifically named. However, exist ing techno logies, including mutation profiling, copy number variabilit y, gene expressio n, multiplex assays, and/or immunohistochem istry,may be performed on these tissue samples to assess potential associat ions with these bio markers and clinical outcom es. 9.9. Health Outcomes The primary healthoutcomes research goal isto determine if abemaciclib therapy is able to palliate pain, as meas ured by themodified Brief Pain Inventory -short f orm (mBPI -sf) (Cleeland and Ryan 1994). Additionally, the European Organisat ion for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC )QLQ -C30 (Aaronson et al.1993) will assess the broader impact of abemaciclib therapy on symptom s, functioning and qualit yoflife. Patient-reported questionnaires should be completed by pat ients when a linguist ically validated language translat ion is available in which the patient is fluent or literate. Ateach time point ident ifiedintheStudy Schedule ( Section 2), a paper copy of themBPI -sfand EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaires should be administered to the patient prior to extensive interact ionwithsite staff and study drug administration. 9.9.1. Pain Intensi ty The m BPI-sf (Cleeland and Ryan 1994) i s an 11 -item instrument used as a mult iple-item measure of cancer pain intensit y. In addi tion to pain intensit y (4 items), the m BPI-sf is designed for pati ents to record the presence of pain in general, pain relief, and pain interference with funct ion (general activit y, mood, abili ty to wal k, abili ty to perform normal work, rel ations wi th others, sl eep, and enjo yment of life). Responses for the mBPI -sfitems are captured through the use of 11-point numeric ratingscales anchored at 0 ( nopain ordoes not interfere ) and ranged through 10 ( pain as bad as you can imagine orcompletely interferes ). The mBPI -sfrecall periodis24 hours, and typical completion time for this instrum entislessthan5minutes. Focused analysis will be on “worst pain”. Use of pain medicat ion will be assessed in conjunction with the mBPI -sfassessment. Data on each individual prescript ion and over -the -counter analgesic medication willberecorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF. The use of pain medicat ions should be reviewed with the patient at each subsequent visit. Any changes to analgesic use (new or stopped analgesics) will be recorded on the eCRF. Pain medicat ion will be classified into medicationcategori es,using theWorldHeal thOrganizat ionanalgesic l adder. Amedicat ioncategory willbeassigned based onthemaximum analgesic therapy administered forthat cy cleon a routi ne basis. The BPI population will include all pat ients who com pleted at l east 1 baseline followed by at least 1 BPI “worst pain” postbaseline assessment."

Health -Related Quality of Life Broadly used in cancer trials, validated, and available in over 80 different l anguages, the EORTC QLQ -C30 (Aaronson et al. 1993) isareliable and validated too l. The EORTC QLQ -C30 self-reported general cancer instrument (Aaronson et al. 1993) consists of 30 itemscovered by 1of3dimensio ns: global healthstatus/qualit yoflife(2 items) functional scales (15 total items addressing eitherphysical, role, emotional, cogni tive, orsocialfunctioning) symptom scales (13 total items addressing eit her fati gue, nausea/vo miting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, or financial impact) The EORTC QLQ -C30 is administered per the Study Schedule ( Secti on2). The recall period is the past week, complet ion time is t ypically 5 to 7 minutes, and the questionnaire will be scored as described by the EORTC scoring manual (Fayers et al. 2001). The EORTC populat ion will include all pat ients who com pleted at least 1 baseline fo llowed by at least 1 EORTC postbaseline assessment. 9.9.3. Resource Utilization Invest igators will be asked to report the use of concomitant medicat ions (in particular, analgesics, growth factors, or antidiarrheals ), blood product transfusions ,andhospi talizati on days. This informat ionshould be collected at baseline, during thestudy ,andatthe 30-day follow -upvisit."
72,page_72,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 72 LY283521910.Statistical Considerations 10.1. Sample Size Determination According to the original study protocol , prior to randomizat ion for Stage 1, approximately 6 to 12 pati ents were to be enro lled in the safet y lead-in part of the study . However, withamendment (c), no addit ional patients will be enrolled to the safet y lead-inand Arm C (abemaciclib plus galunisertib) will be removed . During Stage 1, 25 patients will be treated per arm to provide a preliminary assessment of tumor response and assessment of safet y. The null hypothesis is based on the assumption that the DCR is no greater than 50%; Table JPCJ. 10.1 shows the probabilit y of stopping at the end of Stage 1 (ranges fro m 11% to 72%) for DCR differences ranging fro m -10% (experimental arm DCR worse than standard of care ) to 15% (experimental arm DCR better than standard of care ). At the end of Stage 1, an addit ional 50 patients will be enro lled in each of the advancing treatm ent arm s from Stage 1 ,giving a total of approximately 75 pat ients in each treatment arm (combined Sta ge 1 and 2). This will allow the detection of PFS HR of 0.65 (median PFS of 2.3months in abemaciclib containing arms vs. 1.5 mo nths in the standard -of-care arm) with a two -tailed log -rank test at 0.10 significance level and a power of 76 %. Analysis for Stage 2 will be perform ed when approximately 120 total events have occurred for the combinat ion of each individual abemaciclib -containing arm and the standard -of-care arm, or all planned pat ients have been enro lled in Stage 2, whichever comes later.

Populations for Analyses The fo llowing popul ations will be defined for this study : Intention -to-Treat (ITT) population: will include all rando mized pat ients. The ITT analysis of efficacy data will consider allo cation of patients to treatment groups as randomized and not by actual treatment received. This populat ion will be used for all baseline, efficacy, and healt h econ omics analyses. Safety population: will include all rando mized patients who received any quant ity of study treatm ent, regardless o f their eligibili ty for the study . The safet y evaluat ion will be performed based on the first dose of study treatm ent a pati ent actually received, regardless of the arm to"
73,page_73,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 73 LY2835219which he or she was rando mized. The safet y populat ion will be used for all dosing/exposure, safet y, and resource utilizat ion analyses. Pharmacokinetic population: will include all rando mized pat ients who re ceived at least 1 dose of study treatm ent and have baseline and at least 1postbaseline evaluable PK sample. Biomarker population: will include the subset of patients fro m whom a valid assay result has been obtained. 10.3. Statistical Analyses Statistical analy sis of this study will be the responsibilit y ofLilly or i ts desi gnee. Unless otherwise stated, a ll tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2- sided alpha level o f 0.05, and all confidence intervals ( CIs )will be given at a 2 -sided 95% l evel. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment only if it changes a princi pal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for making t he change, will be described in the statist ical analysis plan ( SAP)and the clinical study report. Addi tional expl oratory analyses o f the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate. 10.3.1. Efficacy Analyses Stage 1 analysis will be performed approximately 16 w eeks after the last planned Stage 1 patient enters treatment. All tumor assessment data accumulated during this period (beyond 16 weeks for som e pat ients, if available), will be included in the assessment of DCR. This an alysis will compare DCR in the inv estigational arms (Arms A and B) to the s tandard- of-care arm (Arm D). Following th e com pletion of the Stage 1 assessment, any treatment arm(s) with a DCR difference ≥0 as compared to the standard of care (Arm D) will be selected to advance to Stage 2. Enrollment m ay cont inue while Stage 1 analysis is ongoing. Any patients enrolled during the Stage 1 analysis will not be included in Stage 1 analysis but will be included in the analysis at the end of Stage 2. The primary analysis of Stage 2 will be conducted when at least 120 total PFS events have occurred for the combinat ion of each individual abemaciclib -containing arm and the standard -of-care arm , or all planned patients have been enrolled in Stage 2, whichever comes later. Data from both Stages 1 and 2 will be pooled for this analysis. The stratificat ion factors are captured in the IWRS and on eCRFs. Unless otherwise stated, all stratificat ion analyses will be based on the stratification factors per CRF. Key efficacy parameters are defined as fo llows: ORR: The deno minator of objective response rate ( ORR )includes each rando mized patient. The numerator includes those patients counted in the deno minator with a best overall tumor response of PR or CR."
74,page_74,"I3Y-MC-JPCJ (c)Clinical Protocol Page 74 LY2835219DCR: Using the same deno minator as for ORR, the numerator of the DCR includes those patients counted in the denominator with a best tumor response of SD, PR, or CR. DOR: The durati on of response ( DOR )is defined only for responders (patients with a CR or PR). It is measured from the date of first evidence of a CR or PR to the date of object ive progression or the date of death due to any cause, whichever i s earlier. If a responder is not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data inclusio n cutoff date, DOR will be censored at t he date of the last complete objective progression -free disease assessment. PFS: The PFS time is measured from the date of rando mizat ionto the date of objective progression or the date of death due to any cause, whichever i s earlier. The censoring is ta ken in the following order: if a pat ient does not have a complete baseline disease assessment, then the PFS time will be censored at the randomizat iondate, regardless of whether or not object ively determined disease progression or death has been obser ved for the pati ent; otherwise, if a pat ient is not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data inclusio n cutoff date for the analysis, the PFS time will be censored at the last complete obj ective progression -free disease assessment date. Additional sensi tivity analysis using alternate censoring rules may be conducted. Addi tional details regarding these censoring rules will be defined in the SAP. OS: OS duration is measured fro m the date of randomizat ion to the date of death from any cause. For each patient who is not known to have died as of the data -inclusio n cutoff date, OS will be censored at the last known alive date. ORR, DCR, DOR, and PFS will be assessed based on RECIST 1.1. For time -to-event parameters, such as PFS, OS, and DO R, the Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate parameters (for example, medians, quartiles, 3 months, and 6 month event rates) (Kaplan and Meier 1958) . Com parison between abemaciclib -containing treatm ent arms and the standard -of-care armwill be done using the log-rank test stratified by rando mizat ion strata. An unstratified log -rank test will also be performed. The stratified and unstratified Cox proporti onal hazard m odel (Cox 1972 )will be used to estimate the HR and corresponding 95% CI. The ORR and DCR of each treatment arm will be calculated as defined by RECIST 1.1. All rates will be co mpared between abemaciclib -containing treatment arms and the standard -of-care arm based on a normal approximat ion for the diffe rence between the rates. Full det ails around analyses will be included in the SAP. Allrates will be com pared between treatm ent arm s based on a norm al approximat ion for the difference between the rates. 10.3.2.

Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses PK analyses will be conducted on all pat ients who have received at least 1 dose of investigational agent and have evaluable PK samples and sufficient dosing informat ion. Mean popul ation PK param eters for abemaciclib in plasma (for example, clearance, exposure, volume of distribut ion) and inter -individual PK variabilit y will be com puted using nonlinear mixed effect modelling (NONMEM). Likewise, and if warranted by the data, m eanpopulat ion PK parameters for LY3023414 and galunisertib in plasma and interindividual variability estimates will also be co mputed using nonlinear mixed -effect m odelling implemented in NONMEM. The observed concentrations of abemaciclib and metabolites, LY3023414, and galunisert ib, may be summarized by t ime and dose. Pharmacodynamic samples will be collected as specified in the Study Schedule and PK and Pharmacodynamics ( PD)Sampling Schedule ( Appendix 4 ). Refer to these attachments (including footnotes) for important informat ion about these samples and their co llection. Furtherm ore, PD data (such as neutrophil, lymphocy te, or pl atelet counts in blo od) collected in this study may also be analyzed by means of NONMEM and connected to the populat ion PK model in a PK/PD m odel. Pharmacodynamic data from all patients undergoing PD assessments will be analyzed. The PD data will be co mbined and exploratory analyses will be conducted to determine if a relat ionship exists between plasma concentration and PD effect(s) in humans. Interpatient variabilit y in human PD response may also be assessed. 10.3.3.7.

Echocardiographic Guidelines Echocardiography In thi s study , ECHO images were to be acquired wit h the purpose of ascertaining that patients enrolledin the Safet y Lead -inhave (and maintain during the study ) baseline norm al cardiac structure and funct ion, normal pulmo nary artery pressure, and absence of significant valvular disease (defined herein as no valvular regurgitation except for mild tricuspid, mild mitral, or mild aortic regurgi tation, and no m ore than mild mitral or aortic valvular stenosis). Repeated ECHOs in each patient will be performed to establish the cardiac safet y of galunisert ib by co mpar ison with the ini tial studi es. Determinat ion of normalcy status re quires objective evaluation of cardi ac chamber size and funct ion and attention to the use of appropriate techniques in the perform ance of the ECHO examinations, in particular the use of standardized settings during the acquisit ions of colorflow Doppl er im aging. Therefore, because quant itative ECHO is the goal, stringent criteria for image qualit y and reproducibilit y are essent ial. In addit ion to qualitat ive assessment of valvular regurgitation when or if detected (trace, mild, moderate, or severe accordin g to Singh et al . [1999] and Zoghbi et al. [2003; see below]) and qualitat ive/quant itative assessment of valvular stenosis when or if detected (mild, moderate, or severe, using mean and peak pressure gradient in mm Hg and orifice area in cm 2as applicable) , other ECHO parameters to be serially quant ified are: LV cavit y size (di ameters, vol umes), LV ejection fraction, LV m ass and mass index, diastolic function based on mitral flow velocit y, mitral decelerat ion time, pulmo nary venous flow pattern, tissue Dop pler, extrapolat ion of LV end-diastolic pressure by E/Em , left atri al volume index, and extrapol ation of pulmo nary artery systolic pressure when obtainable. An ECHO with no clinically significant abnormalities is one defined specifically as: the LV (Schil ler et al . 1989) internal dimensio n in diastole should be 2.8 cm /m2, the l eft atri al (Tsang et al. 2002) end -systolic vo lume shoul d be 36 mL/M 2, the l eft ventricular ej ection fraction (Oh et al. 2006) shoul d be 50% wi thout regi onal wall m otion abnorm alities, 2-dimensio nal ECHO -derived LV mass index (Schiller et al. 1989) should be 115 g/M 2for males and 99 g/M 2for females, the pulmo nary artery pressure shoul d be norm al (tricuspid regurgi tation jet velocit y 2.5 m /s and/or pulmo nary valve flow accelera tion time 120ms), the LV diastolic funct ion (Khouri et al. 2004) should be normal (screening: mitral deceleration t ime 150ms and 250 m s, mi tral E/A rati o 0.75 and 1.5, mitral E velocit y divided by Doppl er mi tral annular velocit y [E/Em ] <15), and th ere should be no evidence for pericardial or congenital or heart disease. In addi tion, there shoul d be no evidence for more than mild mitral or aortic stenosis (mitral valve area should be >2.0 cm 2and aorti c valve area should be >1.5 cm 2) and no evi dence of more than mild mitral or aortic regurgitation (Singh et al. 1999; Zoghbi et al. 2003). Patients enrolled in the study may have evidence for tricuspid (trace or mild), pulmo nary, mitral (trace or mild), or aortic (trace or mild) regurgitation by Doppl er techniques (Singh et al. 1999; Zoghbi et al. 2003)."

Synopsis Galunisertib (LY2157299) is a small molecule designed to selectively inhibit the serine/threonine kinase of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF -β) receptor type I (TGF -RI). In PDAC, an increase in expression of epithelial -mesenchy mal transition triggering factors, including TGF -, has been observed and may contribute to the high metastatic potential. In panc reatic cancer cells, a CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor exerted growth -inhibitory effects, although a TGF -RI inhibitor alone was unable to suppress colon y growth in 3 -D culture. However, when the TGF -RI inhibitor was combined with a CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor, opti mal growth inhibition was achieved. These preclinical data provide a basis for exploring the combination of abemaciclib and galunisertib in the current study , although with amendment (c) the assessment of this combination is being discontinued . STAGE 1 Objectives Endpoints Primary To evaluate disease control rate of the abemaciclib treatment arms versus the standard -of-care arm (gemcitabine or capecitabine)Disease control rate is the percentage of patients with a best overall response of stable disease, complete response, or partial response according to RECIST 1.1. Secondary To evaluate objective response rate of the abemaciclib treatment arms versus the standard-of-care armObjective response rate is the percentage of patients with a best ov erall response of complete response or partial response according to RECIST 1.1. Evaluate safety and tolerability of the abemaciclib treatment armsThe safety endpoints evaluated will include but are not limited to the following: TEAEs and SAEs Clinical laboratory tests and vital signs PK of abemaciclib and its metabolites ,as well as LY3023414Exposure of abemaciclib ,andLY3023414 , and galunisertib STAGE 2 To evaluate pain and symptom burden of the abemaciclib treatment arms by best response group (partial response, stable disease, progressive disease) versus the standard -of-care armmodified Brief Pain Inventory short form (mBPI -sf) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnai re- Core 30 (EORTC QLQ -C30) PK of abemaciclib and its metabolites , as well as LY3023414 and galunisertibExposure of abemaciclib ,andLY3023414 and galunisertib"

For Stage 1, the primary analyses of safety and efficacy will be evaluated for each of 3 2investigational arms versus a standard-of-care arm approximately 16 weeks after the last planned Stage 1 patient enters treatment. The 3 2 investigational arms include abemaciclib monotherapy (Arm A) and,abemaciclib plus LY3023414 (PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor; Arm B), and abemaciclib plus galunis ertib (Arm C) . Number of Patients: Safety Lead -in: According to the initial protocol, p Prior to initiating Stage 1 of the study, a safety lead -in period for abemaciclib plus galunisertib willwas to be conducted with up to 12 patients.

Study Rationale Given the unmet medical need for second- and third -line treatment options, this study aims to explore the safet y and efficacy o f abemaciclib monotherapy , as well as abemaciclib in combinat ion with other agents (including a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor and a TGF -RI inhibitor ), versus cho ice of standard of care (gemcitabine or capecitabine) in patients with previously treated metastatic PDAC 3.2.4. Transforming Growth Factor -Beta and Role in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma In PDAC, an overexpressio n of epithelial -mesenchymal transit ion triggering factors, including TGF -, has been observed and may contribute to the high metastatic potential. In pan creat ic cancer cells, a CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor was found to exert growth -inhibitory effects, al though a TGF -RI inhibitor alone was unable to suppress colony growth in 3 -dimensio nal culture. However, when the TGF -βRI inhibitor was combined wit h a CDK4 an d CDK6 inhibitor, optimal growth inhibit ion was achieved (Liu and Korc 2012). These preclinical data provide a basis for"

Stage 1 (following com pletion of the safet y lead-in period) will permit decisio n-making in order to determine if either abemaciclib mo notherapy or abem aciclib in co mbinat ion with other agents provi des a l evel of disease control that i s at l east com parable to the standard of care. 5.4.3. Rationale for Amendment (c) Study JPCJ was amended to discont inue enro llment to the safet y lead-in for abemaciclib plus galunisertib and rem ove Arm C (abemaciclib in combinat ion with galunisert ib), as well as all galunisertib -related baseline procedures and eligibilit y requirements. The combinat iontesting strategy for study JPCJ was reassessed considering other priorit ies wit h Lilly mo lecules in clinical development, and it was decided not to continue the invest igation of abemaciclib in combinat ion with galunisertib in this study . This decisio n was not tri ggered by safet y concerns wi th the combinat ion. 5.6.5.5. Justification for Doses of Investigational Treatments The dose of LY3023414 (150 mg BID) used in this study was the MTD i dentified in combinat ion with abemaciclib 150 m g BID in the Phase 1b S tudy JPBJ. The dose of galunisert ib (150 mg BID) used in this study e safet y lead-in period has demonstrated a favorable risk/benefit profile across mult iple studies, when administered as a single agent or in combinat ion with various chem otherapies. The c urrent study will assess the safet y and pharmacokinet ics (PK) of abemaciclib 150 mg BID plus galunisert ib 150 mg BID in for the 7 patients enro lled in a safet y lead-in peri odat the time of amendment (c), but will not assess this combination in the randomi zed peri od of the study prior to init iation of Stage 1 . 6.2.

If the combinat ion is was not tol erated (that is, more than one patient experience dsa DLT wi thin the first 28 -day cycle) at the reduced dose of abemaciclib, then patients will were not to be enrolled to the abemaciclib plus galunisert ib arm (Arm C). For the saf ety lead-in, any pat ient who is was discontinued from the study before receiving at least 75% of the planned doses of abemaciclib and galunisertib in Cycle 1 w asill bedeemed nonevaluable for assessment of that dose level and may bewasreplaced unless that patient experience dsa DLT before withdrawal . Nonevaluable pat ients may bewere to be replaced to ensure that no fewer than 6 patients receive dat least 75% of the planned doses of abemaciclib and galunisert ib in Cycle 1 at each dose level , unless enrollm ent to that coh ort hw as stopped because more than one patient at that dose level hasexperienced a DLT. At the time of amendment (c), Lilly determined no additional pat ients woul d be enro lled to the safet y lead-in and that Arm C would be removed from the study . A total of 7 patients had been enrolled in the safet y lead-in and 2 were still on treatment. Ongoing patients enro lled to the safet y lead-in may cont inue on study treatment if, at the discretion of the treating invest igator, the pati ents are bene fiting from therapy and not considered at risk fro m a safet y standpo int. While it i s not expected, i t is possible that galunisertib will enhance the toxicit y of abemaciclib or vice versa. Toxicities were will be graded according to Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0).

Patients assigned to the standard -of-care arm (Arm D) will be administered ei ther gem citabine or capeci tabine, at the discretion of the investigator. In determining which standard -of-care therapy to administer, the investigator shoul d take into consideration NCCN Guidelines, which indicate that patients previously treated with gemci tabine -based therapy shoul d receive capeci tabine and pat ients previousl y treated wi th fluoropy rimidine -based therapy shoul d receive gemcitabine. 7.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses Patients shoul d not chew or crush these study treatments. If the patient misses or vomits a dose of oral study treatm ent, the pati ent shoul d skip the dose and take the next dose as scheduled. For patients assigned to the safet y lead-in or Arm Bor C, com binat ion agents are to be taken at approximately the same t ime, in no specific order of administration. A delay of a cycle due to holiday, weeke nd, bad weather, or other unforeseen circumstances will be permitted for a maximum o f 7 days and not counted as a protocol deviat ion. A cy cle delay due to toxicit y is permitted up to 14 day s (see Sectio n 7.4.4). In the event only 1 of 2 study treatm ents for pati ents inthe safet y lead-in or ArmsB or C is suspended or if each study treatm ent is reintroduced in a sequent ial manner, Day 1 of the next cycle is considered the date that the first of the individual study treatm ents is dispensed and administered to the patient. 7.4.1. Dosage Modifications for Investigational Agents Dose adjust ments (suspensio ns and reductions) will be made based on the clinical assessment of hematol ogic and nonhematologic toxicit ies (defined as an AE possibly related to study treatm ent per invest igator judgment). The CTCAE v 4.0 will be used to assess AEs. Treatment may be suspended for a maximum o f 14 days to allow a patient sufficient time for recovery from study treatm ent-related toxicit y. If a pati ent does not recover from the toxicit y within 14 days fro m the time of last treatment, the patient should be considered for permanent discont inuat ion from study treatm ent. In except ional circumstances, a delay >14 day s is permitted upon agreement between the invest igator and the Lilly CRP. Patients in the safet y lead-inreceiving galunisert ib must receive a minimum o f 10 days of dosing in a 28 -day cycle. Dose reductions for invest igational agents should be as shown inTable JPCJ.7.3. Study treatm ent m ust be reduced sequent ially by one dose l evel unless an except ion is granted in consultation wit h the Lilly CRP. Mid -cycle dose reductions for abemaciclib may be implemented by informing patients to reduce the number of 50 -mg capsules taken for each dose (with dose reducti ons appropri ately docum ented in the electronic case report f orm [eCRF]); however, mid -cycle dose reducti ons of LY3023414 and galunisertib will require patie nts to return to the clinic and the site to call the IWRS Help Desk to dispense new study treatm ent.

Dosage Modifications for Gemcitabine A new cycle of gG emci tabine will not be given unless the ANC is ≥1.0×109/L and platelets are ≥100×109/L. All nonhematologic toxicit ies (excluding alopecia) should also return to CTCAE Grade ≤1 or baseline prior to reinit iating treatment. Treatment may be delayed up to 4 weeks after com pletion of the 28- day cycle to allow sufficient time for recovery . 7.7. Concomitant Therapy For pati ents assigned to abemaciclib treatment arms ( safet y lead-in as well as Arms A and, B, and C ) or those assigned to Arm D who are receiving capecitabine, prothrombin time or internat ional norm alized rati o must be routi nely moni tored if pat ients are receiving concomitant oral coum arin-derivative ant icoagulants 7.7.2.

Cardiac Monitoring Hence, cardi otoxici ty monitoring m ust be performed for pati ents parti cipat ing in the Safet y Lead -inor Arm Cof this study , based on echocardiographs wit h Doppler and Chest CT/MRI (see Schedule of Act ivities [Section 2] and Appendix 6 ). Chest CT Scan with Contrast or MRI (Safety Lead -in and Arm C Patients Only) A chest CT scan with cont rast or MRI is was required at screening for all pat ientsin the Safet y Lead -in, and subsequent ly according to the Schedule of Act ivities (see Sect ion 2) for these patients participat ing in the Safet y Lead -in or Arm C . The purpose of this safet y assessment i s to detect aneury sm formation of the ascending aorta and aortic arch. If a CT scan with contrast or MRI has been done as part of the patient’s tumor assessment, this scan may be used for safet y screening if the scan has properly assessed the great vessels and the heart. The same method of assessment used at screening should be used for each pat ient throughout the evaluat ion peri od. Echocardiogram with Doppler (Safety Lead -in and Arm C Patients Only) Echocardi ography with Doppl er (ECHO/Doppl er) will was be locally assessed at screening for all patients in the Safet y Lead -in, and subsequent ly according to the Schedule of Act ivities (see Secti on 2) for these patientsparticipat ing in the Safet y Lead -in or Arm C , and safet y decisio ns made by physicians or a team of people who are qualified by experience or training. Individuals so qualified must be identified at each Saferty Lead-insite. The same person should be responsible for reading the ECHO on any individual study patient . Echocardiograms will be as perform ed as indicated in the Schedule of Activit ies (see Section 2) and according to Appendix 6 for all patients at screening, and subs equent ly for all patients parti cipat ing in the Safet y Lead -in or Arm C. The ECHO will be read locally 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinet ic (PK) samples will be co llected as shown in Appendix 4. During the Safety Lead -inas well as Stage 1 , patients rece iving the combinat ion of abemaciclib and galunisertib will undergo intense PK sampling until notified by Lilly that this intense sampling is no longer requi red. Subsequently, a sparse sampling schedule will be implemented. For all patients participat ing inany of the stages/arm sthe study , the PK sample collection should occur on the day that clinical laboratory samples are collected for the purposes of eligibilit y or heal th monitoring, corresponding to the originally planned next vi sit/cycle 9.7.1. Whole Blood Samples for Pharmacogenetic Research All samples will be coded with the patient number. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patient only by the study site personnel. Sam ples will be retained for a maximum o f 15 years aft er the last patient visit for the study , or f or a shorter period if local regul ations and/or ethical review boards (ERBs)/institutional review boards (IRBs) impose shorter time limit s, at a facilit y selected by Lilly or i ts designee. This retention period enables use of new techno logies, response to questions from regulatory agencies, and investigation of"

Tissue Samples for Nonpharmacogenetic Biomarker Research Patients m ay be asked to undergo collect ion of an addi tional core needl e biopsy specimen and blood sam ple after treatment with abemaciclib , galunisertib , LY3023414, gemcitabine, or capecitabine has been init iated or after disease progressio n. If requested, this biopsy specimen and blood sample will be used to further investigate molecular features that may explain treatm ent response and resistance mechanisms. 9.9. Health Outcomes The primary healthoutcomes research goal isto determine if abemaciclib combinat ion therapy is able to palliate pain, as measured by the modified Brief Pain Inventory -short f orm (mBPI -sf) (Cleeland and Ryan 1994). Additionally, the European Organisat ion for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ -C30 (Aaronson et al.1993) will assess the broader impact of abemaciclib combinat iontherapy on symptom s, functioning and qualit yoflife. 10.1. Sample Size Determination According to the original study protocol , pPrior to randomizat ion for Stage 1, approximately 6 to 12 pati ents will were to be enrolled in the safet y lead-in part of the study. However, with amendment (c), no addit ional pat ients will be enro lled to the safet y lead-in and A rm C (abemaciclib plus galunisertib) will be removed . 10.3.1. Efficacy Analyses Stage 1 analysis will be performed approximately 16 weeks after the last planned Stage 1 patient enters treatment. All tumor assessment data accumulated during this period (be yond 16 weeks for som e pat ients, if available), will be included in the assessment of DCR. This analysis will compare DCR in the invest igational arms (Arms A , and B, and C ) to the standard -of-care arm (Arm D). 10.3.5. Stage 1 Analyses The Stage 1 analy sis of efficacy will be conducted under the guidance of an internal Assessment Committee (AC) after the last planned Stage 1 patient has enrolled and co mpleted at least 16weeks of treatment or have discont inued (whichever co mes earlier). All data accumul ated during thi s peri od (bey ond 16 weeks for some patients, if available), will be included in the analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate safet y and efficacy (DCR) to select which arms will continue to Stage 2. The AC will include an exter nal physician as well as the study statist ician, Gl obal Patient Safety physician, and Medical Director. Appendix 4.

Abemaciclib and galunisertib will be administered togeth er. bIf a patient will have galunisertib dosing suspended prior to D14, that the patient should be brought in for PK on the mo rning of the last day of dosing, if possible. cSamples should be drawn prior to any study treatment on these days. In the event of a delay to a cycle due to toxicity, these predose samples should be drawn on the day when the cycle would have normally begun, to be close in time to the labs upon which the decision whether or not to begin a cycle is made. Appendix 6. Echocardiographic Guidelines Echocardiography In thi s study , ECHO images will were beacqui red wi th the purpose of ascertaining that patients enrolledin the Safet y Lead -inin the study have (and maintain during the study ) baseline norm al cardi ac structure and function, normal pulmo nary artery pressure, and absence of significant valvular disease (defined herein as no valvular regurgitation except for mild tricuspid, mild mitral, or mild aortic regurgitation, and no more than mild mitral or aortic valvular stenosis)."
