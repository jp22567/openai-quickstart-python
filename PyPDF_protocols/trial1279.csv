2,page_2,"I1F-MC-RHBH (b)Clinical Protocol Page 2 LY24398212.Synopsis Study Rationale Ixekizumab ( LY2439821 )is a humanized immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (MAb) that neutralizes the cy tokine interleukin -17A (IL -17A, al so known as IL -17). It has a high affinit y for and neutralizes the activit y of both human and mo nkey IL -17. It has high specificit y to IL -17A (IL-17) and has no cross -reactivit y to other IL -17 family members (IL-17B- F).Ixekizumab blocks IL -17 binding to the IL -17 receptor (IL -17R) . Specific inhibit ion of IL-17 represents a targeted approac h to the management of psori asis ( Ps)and a novel mechanism of act ion compared to other Ps therapies. As such, ixekizumab may provide a therapeuti c opti on for pati ents who are candidates for init ial systemic treatment as well as those patients who have lo st response, failed to respond, or are intolerant to current marketed drugs . Ixekizumab may provide an alternat ive therapy providing a f avorable benefit/risk profile. Specifically, targeti ng IL -17 wi th ixekizumab is hypothesized to provide optimal therap eutic benefit while reducing the risk of impacting host defenses, which may be inherent wi th som e other bio logic-based immun omodulatory treatments.

6,page_6,"I1F-MC-RHBH (b)Clinical Protocol Page 6 LY2439821Analysis Methods: Sample size: The total sample size for the study is 420 patients randomized at a 2:2:1 ratio in the blinded Induction Dosing Period to 80 mg Q2W, 80 mg Q4W, and placebo, respectively. In order to account for multiple testing for the 2 ixekizumab groups, a 2 -sided Fish er's exact test at the 0.025 level is assumed. Assuming the response rate sfor both sPGA (0, 1) and PASI 75 at Week 12 (Visit 7) are75% for each ixekizumab treatment group and 5% for the placebo group, 168 patients in 80 mg Q2W (o r 80 mg Q4W) versus 84 p atients in placebo group will provide >99% power to test the superiority of each ixekizumab dose regimen to placebo for sPGA (0, 1) and for PASI 75. These assumptions are based on the integrated results from the pivotal Phase 3psoriasis studies I1F-MC -RHAZ (RHAZ ), I1F-MC -RHBA (RHBA ), and I1F-MC -RHBC (RHBC ). Analy sis populatio n:Unless otherwise specified, efficacy and health outcomes analy ses for Period 2 (Induction Dosing Period) will be conducted on the intent -to-treat population (ITT), defined as all r andomized patients, even if the patient does not take the assigned treatment, does not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise does not follow the protocol. Patients will be analy zed according to the treatment to which they were assigned. In additio n, the primary analy ses will be repeated using the per protocol set (PPS), which is defined as all randomized patients who are compliant with therapy, who do not have a subset ofimportant protocol deviatio nsthat impact the primary efficacy endpoint s, and whose investigator site does not have significant Good Clinical Practice (GCP) issues that require a report to the regulatory agencies prior to Week 12 (Visit 7). Safety analyses for Period 2 will be conducted on the safety population, defined as all randomized patients who received at least 1dose of study treatment. Patients will be analy zed according to the treatment to which they were assigned .Efficacy, health outcomes, and safety analy ses for Period 3 (Maintenance Dosing Period) will be condu cted on the Maintenance Dosing Period Primary population, defined as all re-randomized patients (that is, patients randomized to ixekizumab in Period 2 who achieved ansPGA (0, 1)and were re -randomized at Week 12) who received at least 1 dose of study treatment during Period 3 (Maintenance Dosing Period). Patients will be analy zed according to the treatment to which they were re -randomized. Primary and secondary analy ses: Continuous data will be summarized in terms of the mean, standard deviation, minim um, maximum, median and number of observations. Categorical data will be summarized as frequency counts and percentages. A gatekeeping testing strategy for the primary and major secondary analy ses will be implemented to control the overall type I error rate at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. Treatment comparisons of categorical efficacy variables will be conducted using a logistic regression analy sis with treatment in the model. The proportions, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) , the difference in proportio ns, and the 95% CIof the difference will be reported. Secondary analy sis on the categorical efficacy variables may be conducted using a Fisher’s exact test. The primary analyses for all continuous efficacy and health outcome variables will be made using mixed effects for repeated measures (MMRM) analy sis. Type III tests for the LS means will be used for the statistical comparison; the 95% CIwill also be reported. In addition, treatment comparisons for continuous efficacy and health outcomes variables may also be made using analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA). For the ANCOVA analy sis, missing data will be imputed by the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. Type III sums of squares for the least- squares (LS) means will be used for the statistica l comparison; the 95% CI will also be reported. The Kaplan -Meier product limit method will be used to estimate the survival curves for time-to event and time-to relapse (loss of response). Treatment comparisons will be performed using the log-rank test. Other continuous variables will be analy zed by t-tests, unless otherwise stated. All AE, baseline, discontinuation and other categorical data will be summarized and may be tested using Fisher’s exact test. Efficacy, health outcomes, and safety variables will also be summarized for the Maintenance Dosing Period and Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period. Safety: Fisher's exact test may be used for all AE, baseline, discontinuation, and other categorical data. Continuous vital signs and laboratory values will be analy zed by an ANCOVA model where appropriate. Other continuous variables will be analyzed by t -tests, unless otherwise stated. For patients originally randomized to placebo during Period 2 and enter Period 3, efficacy, health outcomes and safety variab les will be summarized. Pharmacokinetics :Observed ixekizumab serum concentrations will be summarized by treatment regimen, visit and corresponding time when sampling occurred."

One recent populat ion-based and dermatologist -confirmed study showed that the prevalence of psori asis in China is 0.47% in 2012 (Ding et al. 2012) , whi ch is higher than that reported (0.12%) in 1987 (Shao et al. 1987) .Histologically, the hallmark of Ps is the presence of a greatly thickened, nucleated kerati nocy te layer, wi th exaggerat ion of the rete pegs, and dermal infiltrat ion by act ivated T cells and dendrit ic cells (Lowes et al. 2007). Activated T cells, monocy tes, neutrophils, and dendrit ic cells produce inflammatory cytokines that drive the additional recrui tment of inflammatory cells, further elaboration of proinflammatory mediators, and the proliferat ion of kerat inocytes (Bowcock and Kr ueger 2005; Lowes et al. 2007). The occurrence of Psis thought to be the pathological consequence of a T -cell-mediated immune response to an as -yet, unidentified autoantigen. Clinical features include sharply demar cated, scaly ery thematous pl aques as well as pain, itching, and c racking of the skin . These lesio ns m ost ty pically affect the elbows, knees, scalp, lumbar area, umbilical area, and gluteal cleft. Approximately 1/4 t o 1/3 of patients have moderate -to-severe Ps, corresponding to involvement of over 5% of thei r body surface area (BSA) (Dubin et al. 2003; Menter and Griffit hs 2007) . Disease of thi s extent is frequent ly painful and physically and/or socially debilitating to a degree comparable wi th other chronic medical condi tions (Rapp et al . 1999). Current treatments for moderate -to-severe plaque Ps include phototherapy and systemic immune modulators, including biotherapeut ics that target cy tokines and aspects of T cell funct ion (Menter et al . 2008; Canadian Psoriasis Guidelines Committee 2009 [WWW] ; Smit h et al . 2009); ho wever, there are limitations to thei r effectiveness and use. Phototherapy is associ ated with photoaging, ery thema, and a concern around skin cancer induct ion, and in many geographi es, there i s limited access to phototherapy . Agents that inhibit T cell fu nction and/or skin cell hyperproliferat ion, such as cyclosporin A, methotrexate (MTX), or acitretin, may effect ively suppress psoriat ic disease, but their use is limited due to their potential to cause adverse systemic effects (Cather and Menter 2002) . Biologic therapi es that i nhibit the activit y of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other proinflammatory cytokines, such as interl eukin (IL) - 12/23, implicated in psoriat ic immunopathogenesis are also efficacious for plaque Ps (Chaudhari et al. 2001; Leonardi et al. 2008). However, the use of these biologic therapi es in various indicat ions isassoci ated wi th safety concerns, such as an increased risk of serious infect ion, infusio n-related events, hematol ogic/lymphoproliferative disorders, demyelinat ing disorders ,"
22,page_22,"I1F-MC-RHBH (b)Clinical Protocol Page 22 LY2439821small vessel vasculit is, immunogenicit y, potenti al congest ive heart failure, and on rare occasions, paradoxi cally, wi th new -onset Ps or exacerbat ion of exist ing Ps (Smit h et al . 2009) . Therefore, there remains a significant unmet medical need for safer, more effective treatments for patients with Ps. The development of new bio logic therap iesthat selectively target key inflammatory molecules rather than inducing generalized immunosuppression offer appealing means to address these unmet needs (Chaudhari e t al. 2001; Krueger 2002) . The classical IL -12/Th1 cy tokine pathway was thought to be the dominant immuno logic pathway mediat ing human T -cell-dependent autoimmunit y. However, a subset of CD4+ T cells, called Th17, is now thought to play a specific patho logical rol e in Ps and other autoimmune diseases (reviewed by Kikly et al . 2006). Th17 cells secrete many proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin -17A ( IL-17A, a lso known as IL -17), IL-17F, IL -6, and TNF -α that can trigger an inflammatory cascade. IL -17A is 1 of 6 members o f the family of proinflammatory IL-17 cy tokines (IL - 17A- F) and has been implicated in a variet y of human autoimmune diseases, including Ps (Ar ican et al. 2005; Li et al. 2007). Th17 cells are also a source of IL -22, a cy tokine implicated in the keratinocy te hyperproliferat ion characteristic of Ps (Zaba et al. 2007; Zheng et al. 2007), which synergizes with IL-17A to induce the proinflammatory /antimicrobial proteins, S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, and β -defensin, in primary kerat inocytes (Liang et al. 2006). IL-17A synergizes with TNF -α (also produced by Th17 cells) to induce the production of neutrophil attracting chemokines, CXCL1 (growth -related onc ogene [Gro] -α) and CXCL8 (IL -8) (Laan et al . 1999; Hellings et al. 2003). Ixekizumab ( LY2439821 )is a humanized immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (MAb) that neutralize s the cy tokine IL -17A ( also known as IL -17). Ixekizumab was develo ped by humanizat ion and optimization o f a mouse ant i-human IL -17 antibody . It has a high affinit y for and neutralizes the activity of both human and mo nkey IL -17. It has high specificit y to IL -17A and has no cross -reactivit y to other IL -17 family members (IL-17B- F). Ixekizumab blocks IL -17 binding to the IL -17 receptor (IL -17R) . Results fro m Phase 1 (Study I1F-MC-RHAG [RHAG]) and Phase 2 ( Study I1F-MC-RHAJ [RHAJ]) studies in patients with Ps support the potent ial efficacy o f ixekizumab in Ps. Both studi es, although based on rel atively small numbers of pati ents, showed a favorable benefit/risk profile of ixekizumab in this disease. In Study RHAG, ixekizumab demonstrated a dose -related improvement in Ps over the dose range tested, as measured by the Psori asis Area and Severi ty Index (PASI) and Physician Glo bal Assessment (PGA). At the 50- and 150 -mg doses, a statist ically and clinically significant improvement in PASI was demo nstrated, which was sustained after complet ion of dosing unt il the end of th e study . Larger Phase 3 pivotal studies have been conducted (Studies I1F -MC-RHAZ [RHAZ] , I1F -MC- RHBA [RHBA] , and I1F -MC-RHBC [RHBC] ) that have further demonstrated the efficacy of ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W for the treatment of patients with moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasis. In each of these studies, the primary and secondary"
23,page_23,"I1F-MC-RHBH (b)Clinical Protocol Page 23 LY2439821outcom es for disease severi ty, heal th outcom es, and associated symptoms were superior with ixekizumab co mpared to placebo. Two of the 3 studies included an act ive com parator of etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (Studies RHBA and RHBC), and both doses of ixekizumab w ere demonstrated to be superior in efficacy com pared to etanercept. While each of these studies ha s been concluded for their primary endpo ints, the durat ion of them may extend up to 5 years to study long-term treatm ent wi th ixekizumab in pat ients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Current results indicated that pat ients had benefits fro m treatment wi th ixekizumab. Upon re - rando mizat ionat W eek 12 , patient s who were treated with ixekizumab 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) had clearly superi or responses than patients who were randomized to receive placebo or ixekizumab 80 mg every 12weeks (Q12W) dosing. Study I1F-MC-RHBH ( RHBH )is a Phase 3, mult icenter , randomized, double -blind, placebo - controlled, parallel -group, outpati ent study to evaluate the efficacy and safet y profile o f ixekizumab in Chinese patients with moderate to severe plaque Ps compared to placebo. There will be an induction dosing period with primary endpoint at Week 12 followed by a randomized maintenance dosing period to Week 60. The dosing regimen sarebased onStudy RHAZ ( 80 m g Q2W or Q4W for induction period, 80 m g Q4W or 80 m g Q12W for mainte nance peri od).The resul ts of global large pivotal studi es dem onstrated si gnificant greater efficacy in maintenance of treatm ent benefit s of 80 m g Q4W versus Q12W with comparable safety profiles . Therefore, only 80 mg Q4W dosing regimen will be selected in maintenance period. More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks ,serious adverse events (SAEs) and reasonably ant icipated adverse events (AEs) of ixekizumab can be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).

Screening Period (Period 1) The durati on of the Screening Period is between 4 and 30 days and consists of 1 or 2 screening visits (Vi sits 1 and 1A, where applicable) to assess patient eligibilit y. The patient will sign the inform ed consent form (ICF) p rior to any study assessments, examinat ions, or procedures being perform ed. All inclusio n and exclusion criteria are provided in Sections 8.1and 8.2, respectively . Screening procedures will be performed according to the Study Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).

For those patients administered a PPD test at Visit 1, the test results will be read between 48 to 72hours after administration, at Vis it1A. Patients who test posi tive for l atent TB at screening may be rescreened fo llowing appropri ate treatm ent as described i n Sect ion 10.3.2.2 . Additionally , pati ents who do not qualify at screening under Exclusio n Criteria [28] or [29 ] may be rescreened (1 time) at least 4 weeks after docum ented resol ution of symptoms. 7.1.2.

At Week 0 (baseline; Visit 2), r outine safet y assessments, laboratory tests ,and clinical efficacy assessments will be performed on eligible pat ients according to the Study Schedule (Attachm ent 1). Patients will be randomized at a 2:2:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups : 80mg ixekizumab Q2W, 80 m g ixekizumab Q4W, or pl acebo . Each patient assigned to an ixekizumab dose regimen will receive a starting dose of 160 mg ixeki zumab as 2 SC inject ions at Week 0 (Visit 2). Blinded dosing will occur at 2 -week intervals throughout Period 2. See Secti on 9.1and Table RHBH. 9.1for a full descript ion of all treatment groups .

Continued treatment for non - responders is provided so that partial or slow responders to ixekizumab and non -responders to placebo may remain in the study and receive treatm ent with ixekizumab w hile maintaining the study blind. Som e pat ients may be deriving benefit from treatment with ixekizumab but will be slow responders or partial responders thereby not meet ing the “responder” criteria at Week 12. A discont inuat ion criterion for patients who remain at or above their baseline sPGA score at both Week 12 and Week 24 is included (see Section 8.3.1 ) to ensure that patients who have not shown any benefit from treatment wi th ixekizumab can be treated with any other psoriasis therapy as determined appropriate by the invest igator . Once a patient has switched to 80 mg Q4W, regardless of original treatment in Period 2, re - rando mizat ion in Period 3, or any assessments of response/relapse, the patient will remain on 80mg Q4W.

Upon resolut ion of infection, the neutrophil count should be monitored using the required study visits in the Post -Treatment Follow-Up Peri od (Peri od 4) design at Visits 801 (4 weeks post resolut ion of infect ion), 802 (8 weeks after Visit 801), and 803 (if necessary; 12 weeks after Visit802); addit ional visits may be requi red depending on the degree of neutropenia . Patients wi thout Concurrent Infect ion: If there is no concurrent infection that requires systemic anti -infect ive therapy, the neutrophil count should be mo nitored using the requi red study visits in the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Peri od (Peri od 4) design, Visits801 (4 weeks post ETV or last regularly scheduled visit), 802, and 803 (if necessary ); addi tional visi ts may be requi red depending on the degree of neutropenia. For Vi sit 801 and subsequent visits, the following monitoring applies: oAs long as a pati ent’s neutrophil count is <1000 cells/ L at any follow up visi t, the pati ent shoul d return for visits at least Q4W (may requi re unscheduled visit s). oAs long as a pati ent’s neutrophil count is ≥1000 cells/ L and <1500 cells/ L at any fo llow up visit, the patient should return for addit ional visit(s) at l east every 4to 8 weeks (may requi re unscheduled visits). oIf at Visit 802 or Visit 803, the patient’s neutrophil count is ≥1500 cells/ L or greater than or equal to the patient’s baseline neutrophil count (whichever is lower), the pati ent’s pa rticipati on in the study will be considered complete unless the invest igator deems addit ional fo llow -up m ay be necessary . oIf, at Vi sit 803, the pati ent’s neutrophil count remains <1500 cells/ L and less than the patient ’s baseline neutrophil count, or if the invest igator deems addit ional follow-up m ay be necessary , the invest igator in consultat ion with Lilly, or qualified designee, will determine the appropriate management of the patient and the appropriate timing of addit ional contact(s) or visit(s). 7.2. Discussion of Design and Control During the Induction Dosing Period(Peri od 2) , 2dose regimens o f ixekizumab will be studi ed: 80 m g Q2W and 80 m g Q4W. During the Maintenance Dosing Period(Period 3) , 1dose regimen of 80 m g Q4W ixekizumab will be studi ed. All treatm ent groups are detailed in Secti on9.1, with the dose j ustificat ion as outlined in Section 9.4. The stu dy blind is m aintained as described in Section 9.7. The Induct ion Dosing Period (Period 2) is designed to minimize bias in the evaluation o f ixekizumab in pat ients with Ps. The select ion of placebo as a comparator is just ified on the basis that the most robust evaluation o f efficacy can be made versus placebo treatment, and the durati on of the 12 -week primary evaluation is sufficient ly short that patients will receive placebo without lasting adverse effects ."

The efficacy of ixekizumab in treating Ps will be measured by the sPGA and PASI response scales ,with the primary efficacy endpoint at 12 weeks. These measures and the 12-week endpo int are in alignment with efficacy endpo ints for currently approved Ps therapies and wit h regul atory guidance (EMEA 2004 [WWW] ).

Doses were selected based on efficacy, safet y and pharmacokinet ics/pharm acodynamics ( PK/PD )data fro m a dose rangin g Phase 2 and Phase 3 studi es in psori asis. More details o f the efficacy , safety and PK/PD of ixekizumab can be found in the IB. 9.4.1. Dose Rationale for the Induction Dosing Period (Period 2; Weeks 0 to 12) During the Induction Dosing Period (Period 2), 2 dos e regimens o f ixekizumab and a placebo group will be investigated: 80 mg Q2W :A starting dose of 160 mg given as 2 SC inject ions at Week 0 and 80 mg given as 1 SC inject ion Q2W for 5 doses at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 . 80 mg Q4W: A starting dose of 160 mg given as 2 SC inject ions at Week 0 and 80 mg given as 1 SC inject ion Q4W for 2 doses at Weeks 4 and 8. To maintain the study treatm ent blind, placebo will be given at Weeks 2, 6, and 10. The starting dose of 160 mg is used to shorten the time to achiev e steady -state serum concentration sof ixekizumab and obtain a more rapid onset of act ion. The exposure of ixekizumab fo llowing the init ial dose at 160 mg was more than 80% of the steady -state exposure"

Induct ion dosing regimens of 80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W were evaluated in the pivotal Phase 3 studi es and dem onstrated overall efficacy for both doses (vs placebo and active co mparator, etanercept) but a more favorable benefit /risk profile with Q2 -different ial effects on efficacy but similar safet y profiles. In the integrated analysis of data in the Induction Dosing Per iod from three Phase 3 controlled studies, the PASI 75, sPGA (0 or 1), and sPGA (0) response rates as well as improvements in Itch NRS and DLQI were consistently greater in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group than in the 80 mg Q4W group. In addit ion, the PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 response rates as well as the sPGA (0 or 1) and sPGA (0) response rates at Week 12 were significant ly higher in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W grou p than in the 80 mg Q4W group . In the Induction Dosing Period in the Phase 3 studies, the safet y profile was similar between the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group and 80 mg Q4W group. The frequency o f Candida infect ion- related treatm ent-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was higher in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group than in the 8 0 mg Q4W group, but the differences in the frequencies of oral candidiasis and oral fungal infect ion between the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group and 80 mg Q4W group were l ess than 1% . The results from PK and exposure -response analyses we re consistent with the results from the efficacy and safety resul ts, wi th high predi ctabili ty for more rapi d achievement of PASI 75 and sPGA (0 or 1) in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group than in the 80 mg Q4W group during the Induct ion Dosing Period as well a s the PASI 75 and sPGA (0 or 1) response rates at Week 12. In addition, for the adverse events investigated, an exposure -response relat ionship was generally not observed . 9.4.2. Maintenance Dosing Period ( Period 3) Dose Rationale (Weeks 12 to 60) During the Maintenance Dosing Period (Period 3), oneixekizumab dose regimen will be investigated: 80 mg Q 4W:given as 1 SC inject ion of 80 mg Q4W starting from week 12. This dosingregimen will be evaluated to establish the sustained response with continuous dosing, to assess durabilit y of response fo llowing treatm ent wi thdrawal, and to allow evaluat ion of response to retreatment following disease relapse. Maintenance dosing regimen s of 80 m g Q4W and 80 m g Q12W were evaluated in the pivotal Phase 3 studies . Patients who were treated with ixekizumab 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) had clearly superi or responses than patients who were randomized to receive placebo or ixekizumab 80 m g every 12 weeks (Q12W) dosing. For sPGA (0,1) responders at Week 12, the proportion of patients who m aintained this response at Week 60 in the integrated maintenance set was higher for ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W (71%) compared with 80 mg Q12W (35.5%) or placebo (7%). Due to the superior efficacy o f the Q4W regimen over the Q12W regimen and no"
50,page_50,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 50 LY2439821clinically meaningful differences in safet y profile for both doses , only the Q4W regimen will be evaluated in Study RHBH. The exposure -adjusted inci dence rate of ixekizumab -treated patients reporting at least 1 TEAE was lower in the Maintenance Dosing Period than in the Induct ion Dosing Period. The exposure -adjusted incidence rate of patients reporting at least 1 TEAE for theQ4W maintenance dosing regimen was generally similar to, or l ower than, the rate for the Q12W maintenance dosing regimen. The results from PK and exposure -response analyses were consistent with the results from the efficacy and safety resul ts. Results fro m ansPGA time course PK/PD m odel dem onstrated sustainabilit y of response at Week 60 (end of the maintenance dosing period), for the Q4W dose regimen with 25% to 27% higher predicted sPGA (0,1) and sPGA (0) response rates as compared to Q12W. In addit ion, for the adverse even ts investi gated, an exposure -response relat ionship was generally not observed . Additional Supporting Information Sub-group analyses examining potential differences in response across the endpo ints at Week 12 and Week 60 were conduct ed. Subgroup variables included : pati ent dem ographics (age, sex, race, ethnicit y, wei ght), di sease -related (previ ous psori asis therapy type and frequency , baseline disease severi ty, age of psori asis onset, and concomitant topical therapy ), and di sease l ocation (fingernails, scalp , palm oplantar ). Ixeki zumab was superior to placebo in all subpopulat ions on all efficacy endpo ints during both the Induction and Maintenance Dosing Periods. The Q2W dosing regimen yielded better outcomes than Q4W for almo st eve ry subgroup. Further details on the efficacy and safet y of these ixekizumab dosing regimens can be found in the IIB. 9.5. Selection and Timing of Doses Patients are assigned to treatment and will r eceive their assigned treatment as outlined in Secti ons 9.3and 9.1, respecti vely. Invest igational product should be administered at approxim ately the same t ime oninject iondays, as much as possible. For inject ions not administered on the scheduled day of the week from Week 0 to Week 12, the missed dose should be administered within 3 days of the scheduled day; after Week 12, the missed dose shoul d be administered within 5 days of the scheduled day . Dates of subsequent study visitsand inject ionsshoul d not be m odified according to this delay. 9.5.1. Special Treatment Considerations Patients will be screened for eligibilit y in the study as described in Sect ions8.1and 8.2and will be informed of the study -specific restrict ions and requirements of the study . Patients who are not willing to comply wit h the study restricti ons and requi rements of the study will not be eli gible forenrollment . Patients shoul d be instructed not to donate bl ood or bl ood products during participat ion in the study .All biological agents carry the risk of systemic allergic react ions/hypersensi tivity.

Proteins may also cause redness, i tching , swelling, or pain locally at the inject ion site. Therefore ,all pat ients should be closely mo nitored for signs or symptoms that could result from such reactions ,educated on the signs or symptoms of these ty pes of react ions, and instructed to contact the study siteimmediately if any of the symptoms are experienc ed following an inject ion.If a patient experiences an acute allergic reacti on/hypersensit ivity after an injection o f investigat ional product , he or she should be managed appropriately and given instruction to receive relevant supportive care . Addit ionally, for an event j udged by the invest igator to be a potent ial systemic allergic reacti on/hypersensi tivity, a blood sample should be drawn to test for anti -drug ant ibodies (ADAs). For pati ents who experience a potential allergic reacti on/hyperse nsitivity, considerat ion for any prem edicat ion for future inject ions will be agreed upon between the investigator and sponsor and/or its designee . Examples o f potenti al allergi creacti ons/hypersensi tivitiesthat mi ght m erit prem edicat ion include mild -to-moderate skin rashes, mild- to-moderate generalized pruritus and/or urti caria, and mild -to-moderate inject ion-site reacti ons (for example, injection -site erythema, inject ion-site pruri tus). Patients who develop clinically significant sy stemic allergic react ions/hypersensi tivitiesfollowing administration of invest igational product who do not respond to symptomat ic medicat ion or resul t in clinical sequelae (for example, hospitalization) shoul d be discont inued fro m the study and not receive further doses of invest igational product, with or wi thout premedicat ion (See Section 8.3.1.1 ). Medi cations considered appropriate for prem edicat ion include but are n ot restricted to acetaminophen /paracetam ol up to 1000 m gand antihistamines (for example, oral diphenhydramine, 50 mg), given 30 to 60 minutes prior to investigat ional product inject ion. Patients may self -premedicate at hom e prior to administration of investigational product, as di rected by the investigator. All such premedicat ions will be recorded as concomitant therapy . Corti costeroi ds are not permitted as agents for premedicat ion. 9.6. Continued Access to Investigational Product Invest igational product wil l not be m ade available at the conclusio n of the study . 9.7. Blinding This is a double -blind study; pat ientsandstudy site personnel will be blinded to study treatm ent until all pat ients reach Week 60 (Visit 19) or have discontinued fro m the study (moved into Period 4). To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of sponsor personnel not in direct contact wi th study sites will see the rando mization table and treatment assignments before the study is unblinde d.

52,page_52,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 52 LY2439821The invest igator should make every effort to contact the Lilly CRP /CRS prior to unblinding a patient’s treatment assignment. If a patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately by telephone. Unblinding will be performed through IWRS. Emergency unblinding for AEs may be perform ed through an IWRS. This option may be used ONLY if the patient’s well -being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment. All calls result ing in an unblinding event are recorded and reported by the IWRS. If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is prematurely unblinded, the patient m ust be di scont inued fro m the investigational product and should continue in the Post- Treatment Follow -Up Peri od (Period 4). In cases where t here are ethical reasons to have the patient rem ain on the invest igational product , the investigator must obtain specific approva l from a Lilly study physician or representative for the patient to continue in the study . In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment is warrante dfor medical management of the event . Patient safet y must al ways be the first considerat ion in making such a determinat ion. 9.8. Concomitant Therapy All conco mitant m edicat ion taken during the study must be recorded on the Concomitant Medicat ion case report form ( CRF). Treatment with concomitant Ps therapi es during the study is permitted only as outlined in the inclusio n/exclusion criteria (Se ctions8.1and 8.2) and as described in the paragraphs below . Patients taking permitted medicat ions should be on chronic stable doses at the baseline visit (Week 0; Visit 2) as specified in Secti ons 8.1and 8.2. The following therapi es will not be permi tted during the course of the study Periods 1 through 3: Psori asistherapy as described in the inclusio n/exclusion criteria (Sections 8.1and 8.2) except as noted below for other concomitant therapies . Any bio logic therapy within the washout periods specified in Sect ion 8.2. Concomitant medicat ions as described in the inclusion/exclusio n criteria (Secti ons8.1 and 8.2) . Live vaccines . Phototherapy . The fo llowing m edicat ions will be permitted during the course of the study : Topical Steroids : mild and least potent topical steroids used for psori asis [such as desonide , fluocinolone acetoni de,hydrocortisone ] will be permitted for use limited to the face, axilla , and/or genitalia, as needed. These topical medicat ions should not be used wi thin approximately 24 hours prior to study visits requi ring sPGA and PASI measures . Vaccines :Use of non -live seasonal vacc inations and/or emergency vaccinat ion (such as rabies or tetanus vaccinat ions) is allowed. Other Concomitant Therapies : Prior to Week 60, the following will be allowed as needed: shampoos that do not contain >3% salicylic acid, corticosteroids, coal tar, or vitamin D3 analogues; and topical mo isturi zers/em ollients and other non -prescri ption topi cal products that"

These topical therapies are not to be used within 12 hours prior to a study visit. Acetaminophen or aspirin will also be allowed as needed. For pati ents who discont inued study treatm ent and have entered the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period (Peri od 4), Ps therapy is allowed, as determined appropri ate by the invest igator . These allowed Ps therapies include the treatment pat ients received during the double -blind trial when approved. Addit ional drugs are to be avo ided during the study unless required to treat an AE or for the treatm ent of an ongoing medical problem. If the need for concomitant medication arises for an AE or for appropri ate medical management (including the limited use of therapeutic agents which, if used under treatment regimens other than for treating an AE or for appropriate medical management, might be considered Ps therapies) , the invest igator should bas e decisio ns on the patient and clinical factors. Any addit ional medicati on, whether prescript ion or over -the-counter, used at baseline (Week 0; Visit 2) and/or during the course of the study must be docum ented with the start and stop dates on the Concomit ant Medi cations CRF. Patients will maintain thei r usual medicat ion regimen for other concomitant diseases throughout the study unless specifically excluded in the protocol. Patients taking conco mitant m edicati ons shoul d be on stable doses at the time of baseline (Week 0; Visit 2) and should remain at a stable dose throughout the study , unless changes need to be made for an AE or for appropriate medical management . Addit ional systemic drugs are to be avo ided during the study , unless requi red to treat an A E. Other medicat ions may be allowed, if approved by the sponsor or its designee. Any changes in medicat ions not addressed above should be di scussed wi th the investigator . Patients shoul d be instructed to consult the invest igator or other appropriate stud y personnel at the site before taking any new medicat ions or supplements . 9.9. Treatment Compliance Every attem pt will be m ade to sel ect pati ents who have the abilit y to understand and co mply with instructi ons. The investigator is responsible for discussing me thods to ensure high treatment compliance wi th the pati ent before randomization . The time and day of each investigational product administration must be transcribed into the eCRF by site personnel. Patient com pliance wi th the invest igational product wil l be assessed at each study visit by review of the Study Drug Administrati on Log , return of empt y invest igational product packaging, and/or direct questioning (except Week 1 [Vi sit 3]).Deviat ion(s) fro m the prescribed dosage regimen should be documented .

54,page_54,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 54 LY243982110.Efficacy , Health Outcome/Quality of Life Measures, Safety Evaluat ions, Sample Collection and Testing ,and Appropriateness of Measurements Study procedures and their timing (including tolerance limits for timing) are summarized in the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ). Addit ionally, Attachment 2 provides a listofthe specific laboratory tests to be performed for this study . 10.1. Efficacy Measures 10.1.1. Primary Efficacy Measure s The primary efficacy endpoints are sPGA (0, 1) and PASI 75 response at Week 12 (Vi sit 7). 10.1.1.1. Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) The sPGA is the physician’s determin ation of the patient’s Ps lesions overall at a given t ime point . The s PGA is recommended as an endpo int to use to assess efficacy in the treatment of Ps (EMEA 2004 [WWW] ). Overall lesio ns are categori zedby descri ptions for indurati on, erythema, and scaling . For the analysis of responses, the patient’s Ps is assessed as clear (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate ( 3), severe (4), or very severe (5). 10.1.1.2. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) The PASI is an otheraccepted primary efficacy measurement for this p hase of dev elopment of Ps treatm ents (EMEA 2004 [WWW] ). The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body- surface invo lvement in 4 anatomical regio ns (head and neck , trunk, arms, and legs) and the severit y of desquamat ion, ery thema, and pl aque indurati on/infiltrat ion (thi ckness) in each regi on, yielding an ove rall score of 0 for no Ps to 72 for the most severe disease (Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978). The PASI has been the most frequent ly used endpo int and measure of Ps severit y in clinical trials (EMEA 2004 [WWW ]; Menter et al . 2008). A clinically meaningful response is a PASI 75, which represents at least a 75% decrease (improvement) from the baseline PASI score. Higher levels o f clearance (PASI 90) as well as co mplete resol ution of plaque Ps (PASI 100) were a dditional endpo ints due to the increasing recognit ion of the associat ion of higher clearance with greater health-related qualit y of life (HRQoL )(Puig 201 5). 10.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Measures The fo llowing secondary efficacy endpo ints will be assessed in this study : PASI 50, PASI 90, PASI 1 00, NAPSI, PSSI, PPASI 50, PPASI 75, PPASI 100 , and BSA . 10.1.2.1. Nail Pso riasis Severity Index (NAPSI) If the patient has fingernail Ps at baseline ,the NAPSI will be used. The NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, object ive tool for evaluat ion of fingernail Ps. This scale is used to evaluate the severit y of fingernail bed Ps and fingernail matrix Ps by area of involvement in the fingernail unit. In this study, only fingernail invo lvement will be ass essed. The fingernail is divided with imaginary horizontal and l ongitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for fingernail bed Ps (0 to 4) and fingernail matrix Ps (0 to 4) depending on the presence (score of 1)"
55,page_55,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 55 LY2439821or absence (score o f 0) of any of the features of fingernail bed and fingernail matrix Ps in each quadrant. The NAPSI score of a fingernail is the sum of scores in fingernail bed and fingernail matri x from each quadrant (m aximum of 8). Each fingernail is evaluated, and the sum of all the fingernails is the total NAPSI score (range 0 to 80). 10.1.2.2. Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) If the patient has scalp Ps at baseline ,the PSSI will be used. The PSSI is a co mposite score derived fro m the sum scores for ery thema, induratio n, and desquamation mult iplied by a score for the extent of scalp area involved (range 0 to 72). 10.1.2.3. Palmoplantar Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PPASI ) If the patient has palmoplantar Ps at baseline, the PPASI will be used. The PPASI is a composite score derived fro m the sum scores for ery thema, indurati on, and desquamat ion multiplied by a score for the extent of palm and so le area invo lvement (range 0 to 72). 10.1.2.4. Percentage of Body Surface Area (BSA) The invest igator will evaluate the percentage invo lvement of Ps on each patient’s BSA on a continuous scale from 0% (no invo lvement) to 100% (full invo lvement), in which 1% corresponds to the size of the patient’s palm of the hand (including the palm, fingers, and thumb) (NPF 2009 [WWW] ). 10.2. Health Outcome/Quality of Life Measures The fo llowing healt h outcom e measures will be assessed in this study : Itch NRS, DLQI, SF-36, patient’s global assessment of di sease severi ty, and j oint pain VAS . 10.2.1. Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) The Itch NRS is a single -item, pati ent-repor ted outcome (PRO) measure designed to capture inform ation on the overall s everity of a patient’s i tching due to thei r psori atic skin co ndition by having the patient circle the integer that best describes the worst leve lof itching in the past 24 hours on a 11-point NRS anchored at 0representing “no itch” and 10 represent ing “worst itch imaginable.” 10.2.2. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) The DLQI is a validated, dermatology -specific, patient -reported measure that evaluates patient’s HRQoL. This questionna ire has 10 i tems that are grouped in 6 domains, namely symptoms and feelings, daily act ivities, leisure, work and school, personal relat ionships, and treatment. The recall period of this scale is over the “last week”. Response categories include “not at all,” “a little,” “a lot,” and “very much,” wi th corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and unanswered (“not relevant”) responses denoted as “9”. Totals range fro m 0 to 30 (l ess to m ore impairment) (Finlay and Khan 1994; Basra et al. 2008). A DLQI total score of 0 to 1 is considered as having no effect on a patient’s HRQoL, and a 5 -point change fro m baseline is considered as the minimal clinically important difference thresho ld (Khilji et al. 2002; Hongbo et al. 2005)."
56,page_56,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 56 LY243982110.2.3. Medical Outcomes Stud y 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) The SF -36 is a 36 -item,patient-completed m easure desi gned to be a short, m ulti-purpose assessment of healt h in the areas of physical functioning, role -physical, role -emotional, bodily pain, vitalit y, social functi oning, m ental health, and general healt h. The 2 overarching do mains of mental well -being and physical well -being are captured by the MCS and PCS scores , respectively . The summary scores range fro m 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating b etter levels o f function and/or better health . Items are answered on Likert scal es of varying lengths . The SF -36 acute version will be used, which has a 1 -week recall period(The SF Co mmu nity – SF-36 Heal th Survey Update [WWW] ). 10.2.4. Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Severity In the Pati ent’s Gl obal Assessment of Disease Severi ty, pati ents are asked to rank on a 0 to 5NRS theseverit y of theirPs“today ” from 0(Clear) = no Ps to 5(Severe) = the worst their Ps has ever been. 10.2.5. Joint Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Psoriatic Arthritis Patients di agnosed wi th psoriatic arthrit is at baseline will co mplete the Joint Pain VAS. The Joint Pain VAS is a pati ent-administered scale designed to m easure current j oint pain fro m PsA using a 100 -mm horizontal VAS . Overall severit y of a pati ent’s joint pain from PsA is indicated by placing a single mark on the horizontal scale (0 = none; 100 = as severe as y ou can imagine). 10.3. Safety Evaluations Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study. Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwi se medically important, considered rel ated to the invest igational product or the study that caused the patient to discontin ue the investigational product before completing the study. The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event is resolved or explained. Frequency of fo llow-up evaluat ion is left to the discretion of the investigator. 10.3.1. Adverse Events Lilly has standards for r eporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory requi rements that m ay be less stringent. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatm enteffect."
57,page_57,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 57 LY2439821Planned surg eries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to invest igational product shoul d be reported. Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safet y evaluat ion. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via eCRF the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing condit ions, in cluding clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study .In addit ion, site personnel will record any change in the condi tion(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AEs. All AEs related to protocol procedures are reported to Lilly or designee. All AEs occurring after the patient receives the first dose of invest igational product must be reported to Lilly or its designee via eCRF . Invest igators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment o f the potenti al relatedness of each A E to protocol procedure, studied disease state, investigational product, concomitant t herapy, and other m edical conditionvia eCRF. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee wi thin 24 hours of the invest igator unblinding a patient’s treatment group assignment for any reason. If a patient’s treatm ent is discont inued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must cl early report to Lilly or its designee via e CRF the circumstances and data leading to discont inuation of treatm ent. 10.3.1.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es: death initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying) persistent or significant di sabili ty/incapacit y congenital ano maly/birth defect considered significant by the invest igator for any other reason Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardiz e the pati ent or may requi re intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convuls ions that do not result in inpat ient hospi talizati on, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF and assessed for serious criteria. The SAE reporting to the sponsor begins after the pati ent has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the SAE should be reported to the sponsor as per SAE"

PTcodes will be co llected and the events will be adjudicated by an external Clin ical Events Commi ttee (CEC) made up of a chai rman, 2 cardi ologists ,and a neuro logist. Data on suspected IBD, as identified by events possibly indicat ive of ulcerative colit is and CD, will be co llected and the events will be adjudicated by an external CEC made up of gastroenterologists with expertise in IBD. The rol e of the CEC sis to adjudicate defined clinical events, in a blinded, consistent ,and unbiased manner throughout the course of a study . The importance of the CEC sis to ensure that a single group eval uates all events that have been reported uniformly . 10.3.1.1.2. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as re lated to investigational product or procedure. Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the ident ificat ion, recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with glo bal regul ations and the associated detailed guidances. 10.3.2. Other Safety M easures 10.3.2.1. Physical Examination One co mplete physical examinat ion (excluding pelvic, rectal, and breast examinat ions) will be perform ed at screening. This examinat ion will determine whether the patient meets the criteria requi red to parti cipate in the study and will also serve as a monitor for preexist ing condit ions and as a baseline for TEAE assessment. All physical exa minat ionsthroughout the study shoul d include a symptom -directed physical evaluat ion as well as an examinat ion of the heart ,lungs, abdo men,and a visual examinat ion of the skin . 10.3.2.2. Chest X -Ray and Tuberculosis Testing A posteri or-anterior view chest x -ray will be obtained, unless the x -ray or resul ts from a chest x - ray obtained wit hin 6 mo nths prior to the study are available .The chest x -ray or resul ts will be reviewed by the invest igator or designee to exclude patients with active TB infect ion. In addit ion, pati ents will be tested at screening as indicated on the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1) for evidence of active or latent TB (posit ivePPD [ ≥5-mm indurat ion ]or posi tive Quant iFERON ®-TB Gol d test /T-SPOT ®.TBat screening but no other evidence o f active TB). In sites where sample collection and proper incubation for the Quant iFERON ®-TB Gold test are"
60,page_60,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 60 LY2439821available at the si te and in the judgment of the investigator preferred as an alternat ive to the PPD skin test f or the evaluation of TB infect ion, it may be used instead of the PPD test (posit ive test excluded) and woul d be sent to central lab for tes ting. If the Quant iFERON ®-TB Gol d test i s indeterminate, 1 retest is allowed. If the retest is indeterminate , the pati ent will be excluded from the study .If the retest is posit ive but without clinical evidence of TB, the pati ents will be considered as latent TB for study purpose. Patients wi th docum entati on of a negat ive test result within 3 m onths pri or to baseline (Week 0; Visit 2) do not need a TB screen at Visit 1. Documentation of this test result must include a record of the size of the induration response. A PPD test recorded as negative wit hout docum enting the size of indurat ion will result in a retest. However, patients with a PPD skin te st ≥5 mm indurati on or aposit ive Quant iFERON ®-TB Gold or posi tive T-SPOT ®.TBtestat screening ,but no other evidence of act ive TB may be rescreened 1 time and may be enrolled without repeating a PPD or QuantiFERON ®-TB Gold or T-SPOT ®.TBtest if the following condi tions are met: after receiving at least 4 weeks of appropriate latent TB infection (LTBI) therapy , with no evidence o f hepatotoxicit y (ALT/AST must remain ≤2 times ULN) upon retesting of serum ALT/AST prior to randomizat ion.Such patients must complete appropriate LTBI therapy during the course of the study in order to remain eligible, and meet all other Inclusion/Exclusio n criteria for partici pation. If rescreening occurs within 6 months of the screeni ng chest x -ray, there is no necessit yfor repeat of chest x -ray for consi dering enrollment. P atients who have a documented history of completing a n appropriate TB treatment regimen with no history of re-exposure to TB since their treatm ent was com pleted and no evidence of active TB are eligible to participate in the study .Patients who have had househo ld contact wit h aperson wi th active TB are excluded, unless appropriate and documented prophylaxis for TB was given. 10.3.2.3. Vital Signs Vital signs (BP and pulse) and body temperature will be measured (sitting) after resting for a minimum o f 10 minutes at times indicated in the Study Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ). At baseline (Week 0; Visit 2) and Week 12 (Visit 7), BP and pulseshoul d be measured pri or to administration of the investigat ional product and again approximately 1 hour post administration. Any clinically significant findings that result in a diagno sis shoul d be captured on the eCRF . Addit ional measurements of vital signs may be perform ed at the di screti on of the invest igator. 10.3.2.4. Electrocardiograms For each patient, 12 -lead digital ECGs will be obtained locally as single ECGs according to the Study Schedule ( Attachment 1 ). Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collect ion and remain supine but awake during ECG colle ction. Electrocardi ogram s may be obtained at additional t imes, when deemed clinically necessary. Collect ion of more ECGs than expected at a particular time point is allowed when needed to ensure high qualit y records."
61,page_61,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 61 LY2439821Electrocardiograms will be interprete d by a qualified physician (the investigator or qualified designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the patient is st ill present, and for immediate patient management, should any clinically relevant findi ngs be i dentified. The qualified physician must document his/her review of the ECG at the time of evaluat ion. Any clinically significant findings that result in a diagnosis should be captured on the eCRF. The ECGs will be maintained at the site and made available to the sponsor as requested. 10.3.2.5. Immunogenicity Samples for immunogenicit y testing will be collected at time points indicated in the Study Schedule (Attachment 1 )and for an yevent j udged by the investi gator to be a potential systemic allergic reacti on/hypersensi tivity, when possible. Venous blood samples will be collected into tubes and used to determine ant ibody producti on against ixekizumab . The actual date of each sampling will be recorded on the l aboratory requi sition. Immunogenicit y will be assessed by a validated assay designed to perform in the presence of ixekizumab. Antibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for their abilit y to neutralize the activit y of ixekizumab .Treatment -emergent immunogenicit y is defined as any occurrence of a 4- fold or 2 dilution increase in titer over the pre -treatm ent baseline titer. In the case of a negative result at baseline, treatment -emergent immunogenicit y is defined as an increase in titer to ≥1:10. Blood sam ples are al so being collected to determine serum ixekizumab concentration at same time as immunogenicit y samples to facilitate interpretation of immunogenicit ydata (Secti on 10.4.2 ). Samples may be stored for a maximum of 15 years following last pati ent visi t to enable further analysis of immune responses to ixekizumab .The durati on allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory requests rel ated to the invest igational product . 10.3.2.6. Safety -Related Immune Markers IL-17 is believed to play a role in neutrophil ho meostasis and in neutrophil -dependent host defense against extracellu lar infect ions (Happel et al. 2003; Huang et al. 2004; Milner et al. 2008). Neutrophil counts will therefore serve as a safet y marker in the current invest igation. Ixekizumab is not expected to affect the numbers of B, T, and natural killer ( NK) lymphocy tes or serum immunogl obulin subclasses A, G, and M (IgA, IgG, and immunoglobulin M [IgM], respectively ) in peripheral blood. However, since this is a novel immuno modulatory drug, th ese param eters will be measured in pat ients. 10.3.2.7. Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology -Self Report QIDS -SR16 is a self -administered, 16 -item instrument intended to assess the existence and severit y of symptom s of depressio n as listed in the American Psychiatric Associat ion’s Diagnostic and Stati stical Manual of Menta l Disorders, 4th Edit ion (DSM -IV) (APA 1994). The QIDS -SR16 scale is used to assess the potential impact of treatment on new onset or changes in depressio n, thoughts of death, an d/or suicidal ideatio n severit y. A patient is asked to consider each statem ent as it relates to the way they have fel t for the past 7 days. There is a 4 -point scale for each item ranging fro m 0 to 3. The 16 items corresponding to 9 depression domains are"
62,page_62,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 62 LY2439821summed to give a single score ranging fro m 0 to 27, with higher scores deno ting greater symptom severi ty. The domains assessed by the instrument include : (1)sad mood, (2) concentration, (3) self -criticism , (4) sui cidal ideation, (5) interest, (6) energy /fatigue, (7) sleep disturbance (init ial, middle, and late inso mnia or hyperso mnia), (8) decrease/increase in appeti te/wei ght, and (9) psy chomotor agi tation/retardati on. Addit ionalinformat ion and the QIDS -SR16 questions may be found at the Universit y of Pittsburgh IDS/QIDS internet page [WWW]. A QIDS -SR16 assessment will be ta ken at times indicated in the Study Schedule (Attachm ent 1 ). 10.3.2.8. Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C -SSRS (Posner et al. 2007a, 2007b ; Columbia Universit y Medical Center [WWW]) is a scale that captures the occurrence, severit y, and frequency o f suicide-related i deations and behaviors during the assessment period. The C -SSRS m ust be administered by appropri ately trained site personnel. The tool was developed by the Nati onal Institute of Mental Healt h Treatment o f Adolescent Sui cide Attem pters tr ial group for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Col umbia Classificat ion Algorithm o f Suicide Assessment (C -CASA) categorizat ion of suicidal events. Patients will be assessed according to the Study Schedule (Attachment 1). The Self -Harm Supplement Form is a one -quest ion form that asks for the number of suicidal or nonsuicidal self -injuri ous behaviors the patient has experienced since the last assessment. For each unique event ident ified, a questionnaire (Self -Harm Follow-Up Form ) which collects supplemental inform ation on the self -injuri ous behavi or is to be com pleted. This informat ion is then docum ented in the eCRF. The Self -Harm Suppl ement Form will be completed according to the Study Schedule (Attachm ent 1 ). 10.3.3. Safety Monitoring Lilly will periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appro priate methods. In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at the group l evel, only members of the DMC (an advisory group for this study formed to protect the integrit y of data [refer to Section 12.2.10.1 ]) can conduct addit ionalanalyses of the safet y data. The Lilly CRP /CRS will m onitor saf ety data throughout the course of the study andwill, as i s appropriate, consult with the funct ionally independent Global Pat ient Safet y therapeut ic area physician or clinical scient ist. The sponsor willreview SAEs within time frames mandated by com pany procedures and will review trends, laboratory analy tes, and AEs at periodic intervals. See Secti on 8.3for discont inuat ion criteria related to specific AEs and Sect ions10.3.3.1 , 10.3.3.2 ,10.3.3.3 ,and 10.3.3.4 for the monitoring of neutropenia ,hepat ic injury ,hepat itis B, and hypertensio n, respect ively ."

Neutropenia Patients wi th neutrophil counts <1500 cells/ L shoul d be m anaged for neutropenia as fo llows: <500 cells/ L(<0.50 ×103/μLor <0.50 GI/L) , see D iscontinuation Criteria (Secti on8.3.1.1 ) ≥500 cells/ L and<1000 cells/ L (≥0.50 × 103/μLand <1.00×103/μLor ≥0.50 GI/L and <1.00 GI/L) , see Di scont inuat ion Cri teria (Secti on8.3.1.1 ) ≥1000 cells/ L and<1500 cells/ L (≥1.00 × 103/μLand <1.50 × 103/μLor ≥1.00 GI/L and < 1.50 GI/L) ,and the patient has a concurrent infect ion that requires syste mic ant i- infect ive therapy (for example , antibi otic, ant ifungal agent, antiviral agent) : oThe dose of invest igational product should be withheld, the patient should receive appropri ate m edical care ,and a repeat test for neutrophil count should be perform ed wi thin 4 weeks fro m knowl edge of the init ial report. If the repeat neutrophil count has returned to ≥1500 cells/ L (≥1.50 × 103/μLor ≥1.50 GI/L) and the infect ion has reso lved o r is reso lving, the patient may resume dosing of investigat ional product and evaluat ion at scheduled visits. If the neutrophil count remains ≥1000 cells/ L and <1500 cells/ L (≥1.00 × 103/μLand <1.50×103/μLor ≥1.00 GI/L and <1.50 GI/L), invest igational product should continue to be withheld and a repeat neutrophil count should again be performed wit hin another 4 weeks. If, after 2 repeat tests, the neutrophil count still r emains ≥1000 cells/ L and <1500 cells/L (≥1.00 × 103/μLand <1.50 ×103/μLor ≥1.00 GI/L and <1.50 GI/L) ,and: a. the infect ion has not fully resolved, the pati ent will be discontinued from the study . b. the infect ion hasresolved, the pati ent m ay resume dosing and evaluat ion at scheduled visit s.

If a patient without init ial concurrent infection develops an infection that requires systemic ant i- infect ive therapy, then the patient should be managed as indicated above for patients with concurrent infect ion. Management of neutropenia during Period 4 is described in Secti on7.1.4.1 . 10.3.3.2. Hepatic Safe ty Monitoring If a study patient experiences elevated ALT ≥3X ULN, ALP ≥2X ULN, or el evated TBL ≥2X ULN, liver testing ( Attachment 3 ) should be repe ated wi thin 3 to 5 days including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase, and creat ine kinase to confirm the abnorm ality and to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. If the abnormalit y persists or worsens, clinical and lab oratory monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by the invest igator and in consultation wit h the study medical mo nitor. Monitoring of ALT, AST, TBL, and ALP should continue until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline levels. Hepatic Safety Data Collection Addit ional safet y data should be co llected via the eCRF if 1 or m ore of the fo llowing condi tions occur: elevation of serum ALT to ≥5X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests elevated serum TBL to ≥2X ULN (except for cases of known Gilbert’s syndro me) elevation of serum ALP to ≥2X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests patient discont inued fro m treatm ent due to a hepatic event or abnormalit y of liver tests hepat ic event considered to be a SAE 10.3.3.3. Hepatitis B Monitoring Patients that are HBcAb+ at screening, regardless of hepatit is B surface ant ibody (HBsAB) status, will have a serum HBV DNA obtained by the central laboratory . Patients that are found to be HBV DNA posit ive (detectable) at screening will be excluded fro m the trial. Patients that are HBV DNA negat ive (undetectable) may be enrolled into the study with required HBV DNA monitoring every 3 months during treatment and 12 weeks after the last dose of ixekizumab. Patients who are HBcAb negative and HBsAb positive will not require screen ing for HBV DNA as they are likely to have been vaccinated for HBV and have a very low risk of reactivat ion. These pat ients will be fo llowed-up by liver tests as part of the study routine. If the result of the HBV DNA testing is posit ive, the patient must be discont inued fro m the study treatm entand should receive appropriate fo llow-up medical care, incl uding considerat ion for antiviral therapy . A specialist physician in the care of patients with hepatit is (for example, infect ious di sease or hepatologist subspecialists) should be consulted and potentially start antiviral therapy prior to di scont inuat ion of any immunosuppressant therapy (including"
65,page_65,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 65 LY2439821investigat ional drug). Timing of discont inuat ion from the study and of any immunosuppressant therapy (includin g invest igational product) needs to be based on the recommendat ions of the consult ing specialist physician in conjunct ion with the investi gator and m edical guidelines/standard of care. 10.3.3.4. Hypertension Patients who expe rience changes in BP (sy stolic BP at ≥160 mmHg plus ≥20 mmHg increase from baseline [Week 0; Visi t 2]; and/or diastolic BP at ≥100 mm Hg plus ≥10 mm Hg increase from baseline) on 2 consecutive visit s should receive intervent ion for the m anagement of hypertensio n. Intervent ion coul d include the m aximal intervent ion of wit hholding the dose of investigat ional product and/or the introduction of an anti -hypertensive agent. See Section 8.3.1 for the discont inuat ion criterion related to hy pertensi on. 10.3.4. Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study parti cipants, m onitor quali ty, and to facilitate process and product improvements. Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product so that the si tuation can be assessed. Com plaint s related to unblinded concomitant drugs/drug delivery systems are reported direct ly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package insert. For blinded studies, all product com plaints associ ated wi th material packaged, l abeled, and released by Lilly or del egate will be reported. The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the product complaint process in accordance wit h the instructi ons provi ded f or thi s study : recording a complete descript ion of the product complaint reported and any associated AEs using the study -specific co mplaint form s provided for this purpose faxing the completed product complaint form wit hin 24 hours to Lilly or i ts desi gnee .

Samples for Pharmacokinetics At the visit s and t imes specified in the Study Schedul e (Attachment 1 ), blood samples will be collected to determine the serum concentrations o f ixekizumab. These blood samples for PK analysis are matched to the timing of samples for the assessment of immunogen icity (Section 10.3.2.5 ). It is expected that these PK samples will allow sufficient descript ion ofixekizumab PK profiles at steady state throughout the study and may facilitate in the interpretation of the immunogenicit y data. Instructions for the collect ion and handling of blood sam ples will be provi ded by the sponsor. The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sampling will be recorded. Samples co llected for PK analysis will be tested at a laboratory approved by Lilly or its designee.

Determination of Sample Size The total sample size for the study is 420patients rando mized at a 2:2:1 ratio in the blinded Induct ion Dosing Peri od to 80 m g Q2W, 80 m g Q4W, and placebo, respectively .In order to account for mult iple testing for the 2 ixekizumab groups, a 2 -sided Fisher ’s exact test at the 0.025 l evel is assumed. Assuming the response rates for both sPGA (0,1)and PASI 75 at Week 12(Visit 7) are 75% for each ixekizumab treatment group and 5%for the pl acebo group, 168patients in 80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W versus 84 patients in placebo group will provide >99% power to test the superi ority of each ixekizumab dose regimen to placebo for sPGA (0,1) and for PASI 75.

In general, c ontinuous data will be summarized in terms of the mean, standard deviation, minimu m, maximum, m edian ,and number of observat ions.Categorical data will be summarized asfrequency counts and percentages . Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for making the change, will be described"
71,page_71,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 71 LY2439821in the clinical study report. Addit ional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deem ed appropri ate. Com plete details of the planned analyses will be documented in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 12.2.1.1. General C onsiderations for Analyses during Period 2 ( Induction Dosing Period) Com parisons between each ixekizumab dose regimen (80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W) and placebo will be performed for all analyses in Period 2. Baseline will be defined as the last available value before the first injection for both efficacy and safet y analyses. For efficacy measures, if the pati ent does not take any inject ion, the last available value on or prior to randomizat ion date will be used. In most cases, this will be the measure recorded at Week 0 (Visit 2). Change from baseline will be calculated as the visit value of interest minus the baseline value. For safet y analyses using a baseline period, the baseline period is defined as the time fro m Visit 1 to the date/time of the first inj ection. Treatment comparisons of categorical efficacy variables will be conducted using a logist ic regression analysis with treatment in the model . The proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) , the difference in proportion s, and the 95% CIofthe difference will be reported. Secondary analysis on the categorical efficacy variables willbe conducted using a Fisher’s exact test. The primary analysis for all cont inuous efficacy and healt h outcome variables will be made using mixed effects for repeated measures (MMRM) analysi s. In addit ion, treatment comparisons for continuous efficacy and healt h outcom es variables may also be m ade using analysis o f covari ance (ANCOVA). When MMRM is used, the model will include treatment ,baseline value , visi t, treatment -by-visit, and baseline -by-visit interactions as fixed factors .The covariance structure to model the within - patient errors will be unstructured. If the unstructured covariance matrix results in a lack of convergence, the heterogeneous Toeplit z covariance structure, followed by the heterogeneous autoregressive covariance structure , followed by com pound symmetry will be used .The Kenward -Roger m ethod will be used to estimate the deno minator degrees of freedo m.TypeIII tests for the least -squares (LS) means will be used for the statist ical co mpar ison; the 95% CI will be reported. Treatment group compar isons wit h placebo at Week 12 (Visit 7) and all other visit s will be tested. When the ANCOVA model is used, the mo del includes treatm entand baseline value. Type III sums of squares for the LS means will be used for the statist ical co mpar ison; the 95% CIwill also be reported . For vari ables that are not collected at each postbaseline visit, data may exist at visi tswhere the variable was not scheduled to be collected, due to early discont inuat ion visit s. In these situations, data from the early discontinuati on visi t that does not correspond to the planned collect ion schedule will be excluded fro m the MMRM analyses. However, the data will st ill be"
72,page_72,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 72 LY2439821used in other ana lyses, including shift analyses, change fro m baseline to last -observat ion carri ed forward (LOCF) endpo int analyses, and other categorical analyses. The Kaplan -Meier product limit method will be used to est imate the survival curves for time- to-event variables , such as time- to-firstresponse ( e.g. sPGA [0, 1] , PASI 75), time to relapse, time to discont inuat ion. Treatment comparisons will be performed using the log -rank test. Fisher ’s exact test may be used for all AE, baseline, discontinuation, and other categorical safety data. The continuous baseline characteristics will be analyzed using an analysis o f variance (ANOVA) model with dosing regimen as a factor . Continuous vital sign and laboratory values will be analyzed b yan ANCOVA wi th treatm ent and baseline value in the model where appropriate . 12.2.1.2. General Considerations for Analyses during Period 3 (Maintenance Dosing Period) Unless otherwise specified, the fo llowing treatm ent com parisons during t he Maintenance Dosing Period will be performed for the Maintenance Dosing Period Primary Popul ation (defined in Secti on 12.2.1.3 ) as shown in Table RHBH. 12.1.

For the efficacy and heal th outcom es analyses , baseline is defined as the last available value before the first inject ion in Period 2; in most cases it will be the value recorded at Week 0 (Visit2). Unless otherwise specified, for the Peri od 3 safet y analyses, baseline and baseline period are defined as the last non -missing assessment prior to the first inject ion of study treatm ent at Week 12 (Visit 7). In most cases, this will be the measure recorded at Week 12 (Visit 7). For treatm ent-emergent adverse events, baseline value is the measure recorded atthe last visit pri or to the study drug inject ion at Week 12 (Visit 7). Change from baseline will be calculated as the visit value of interest minus the baseline value. For pati ents who met rel apse cri teria and were retreated with ixekizumab, only data up to the time of relapse will be included in the maintenance of effect analyses . These pat ients will be"

Treatment comparisons of categorical efficacy variables will be made using a logistic regressio n analysis with treatment in the model. The proportions and 95% CI,the difference in proportions, and the 95% CIof the difference will be reported. Secondary analysis on the categorical efficacy variables may be conducted using a Fisher’s exact test. Treatment comparisons for c ontinuous efficacy variables will be m ade using MMRM model. An ANCOVA model may also be used. When MMRM is used, the model willinclude treatment, baseline value , visi t, treatm ent-by-visit, and baseline -by-visit interactions as fixed factors .

Treatment arm co mpar isons with placebo at Week 60 (Visit 19 ) and all other visits will be tested. When the ANCOVA model is used, the model includes treatment and baseline value in the model. Type III sums of squares for the LS means will be us ed for the statistical co mparison; the 95% CIwill also be reported. The Kaplan -Meier product limit method will be used to estimate the survival curves for time -to relapse ( loss of response ). Treatment comparisons will be performed using the log -rank te st. Fisher ’s exact test will be used for all AE, baseline, discontinuat ion, and othercategorical data.

Safety analyses for Period 4 (Post-Treatment Follo w-up Peri od)will be conducted on the follow - up population, defined as all rando mized pat ients who received at least 1dose of study treatment and have entered the post -treatm ent follow -up period. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatm ent they actually rec eived prior to entering Period 4. Addit ional analysis popu lations will be described in the SAP. 12.2.1.4. Missing Data Imputation The methods for imputation of missing data to be used in this study are i n accordance with precedent set with other Phase 3 Ps tri als (L eonardi et al. 2008; Papp et al. 2008 ). 12.2.1.4.1. Non-Responder Imputation for Clinical Response (PASI 50/75/90/100, sPGA [0 or 1]/[0] ) Analysis of categorical efficacy and healt h outcome variables will be assessed using a NRI method. In both Periods 2 (Induction D osing Period) and 3 (Maintenance Dosing Period), patients will be consi dered a non -responder for the NRI analysis if they do not m eet the clinical response criteria or have missing clinical response data at the analysis time po int. Randomized patients wi thout at l east 1post-baseline observat ion will also be defined as non -responders for the NRI analysis. 12.2.1.4.2.

Randomized pat ientswithout at least 1 postbaseline observat ion will not be included for evaluat ion. 12.2.1.5. Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons A gatekeeping testing strategy for the primary and major secondary analyses will be implemented to control the overall t ype I error rate a t a 2-sided alpha l evel of 0.05 . This will allow simultaneous inference of all o f the primary and major secondary endpoints. The underlying procedure is derived using the methodology devel oped in Dmi trienko and Tamhane 2011. The gatekeeping procedure is based on the Bonferroni test and utilizes an intuitive, stepwi se testing algorithm. The alpha levels for the p -values associated with the primary and secondary analyses are com puted at each step depending on the outcomes of the preceding significance tes ts. In order to reflect the test order and how the mult iple doses will be analyzed, the doses have been renamed and the treatment comparisons to be performed in each dosing period are shown in Table RHBH. 12.2."

Both treatm ent-emergent only and all ADA posi tive/negat ive pat ients may be expl ored. Neutralizing anti -drug ant ibody positivesamples may be ident ified. Addit ional analyses m ay be performed upon receipt of the data. Data from this study may be combined wit h data from previous efficacy studies for addit ional popul ation PK and/or exposure -efficacy modelling if deemed appropri ate. 12.2.8. Safety Analyses Safety will be assessed by summarizing and analyzing AEs, QIDS -SR16, C -SSRS, laboratory analytes including neutrophil counts and immunogenicit y, vital signs, and conco mitant medicat ions. The primary safety analyses will focus on comparison of the ixekizumab dosing regimens to placebo for Period 2 (Inducti on Dosing Period). Treat ment group com parisons will be analyzed using the methods described in Sect ion 12.2.1.1 . ForPeriod 3 (Maintenance Dosing Period), the same safet y measures as in Period 2 will be summarized. Treatment group comparisons will be analyzed using the methods described in Secti on 12.2.1. 2. Summarie s of safet y data collected during the Post- Treatment Follow -up Peri od will be presented separately . The categorical safet y measures will be summarized with incidence rates. The m ean change of the continuous safet y measures will be summarized by visit s. Unless otherwi se specified, the follow -up baseline is defined as the last non -missing assessment on or prior to the Week 60(Visit 19) or early discont inuation visit. Further details will be described in the SAP. 12.2.8.1. Adverse Events A TEAE is defined as an event that first occurred or worsened in severit y after baseline and on or prior to the date of the last visit wit hin the treatment period . Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), SAEs including deaths, AEs that led to investigat ional product discontinuation, and AEs by maximum severi ty and rel ationship to investigat ional product will be summarized by the MedDRA system organ class (SOC) andPT. For events that are gender specific, the deno minator and computation of the percentage will include only patients from thegiven gende r . MedDRA groupings of PTs will be used to investigate AESIs. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) mayalso b e presented by severi ty. 12.2.8.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests Laboratory assessments will be presented as mean changes from baseline to last observat ion, change from baseline to minimum postbaseline value, change from baseline to maximum postbaseline value and as i ncidence of treatment -emergent abnormal, high, or low laboratory values. Shift tables will be presented for selected param eters."
83,page_83,"I1F-MC-RHBH(b) Clinical Protocol Page 83 LY2439821Treatment -emergent abnormal value = a change from normal at all baseline visits to abnorm al at any time postbaseline. Treatm ent-emergent high value = a change fro m a value less than or equal to the high limit at all baseline visits to a value greater than the high limit at any time postbaseline . Treatment -emergent lowvalue = a change from a value greater than or equal to the low limit at all baseline visits to a value less than the low limit at any time postbaseline . 12.2.8.3. Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Safety Evaluations Vital signs will be presented as m ean changes from baseline and as incidence of abnormal values (as defined in the SAP) and will be summarized both pre- and post -dose, as applicable. The m aximum postbaseline QIDS -SR16 total score will be summarized by treatment, and shift table will be produced for the change from baseline in QIDS -SR16 total score cate gory. Suicide-related thoughts and behaviors and self- injuri ous behavior with no suicidal intent, based on the C -SSRS, will be listed by patient. Assessment of immunogenicit y with respect to safety will include com parison of patients who experience TEAEs o f systemic allergy/hypersensit ivity and of inject ion-site reacti ons and who also develop treatment -emergent ant i-ixekizumab ant ibody posi tivity with patients who experience the same t ypes of TEAEs but who remain treatment -emergent anti -ixekizumab antibody negat ive. Anti-ixekizumab antibody titers will also be evaluated in anti -ixekizumab antibody posi tive patients who experience these events. Other covariate data, including body weight, will be descri ptively summarized by treatment groups. Further analy ses m ay be performed comparing the treatment groups. 12.2.9. Subgroup Analyses Subgroup analys eswill be conducted for sPGA (0,1)and PASI 75 at Week 12 ( NRI) using the ITT populat ionand Week 60 (NRI) using the Maintenance Dosing Period Primary Population .
