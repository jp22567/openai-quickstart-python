Female that is lactating/breast -feeding Investigational Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration ACE -083 drug product is provided as a lyophilized powder contained in stoppered and sealed glass vials. After reconstitution with 1.2 mL of sterile water, t he ACE -083 drug product solution for injection has a concentration of 50 mg/mL. The nominal strength of each vial is 50 mg of ACE -083. Using electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound guidance, each dose of ACE -083 will be administered into the non -tendinous p ortion of the TA as a series of up to 4 equal -volume injections. The use of EMG or ultrasound guidance will ensure that viable muscle is present at the injection site. If the degree of atrophy or fibro -fatty infiltration poses administration challenges, injections of ACE -083 should be distributed approximately 2 cm apart into viable muscle. Injection site locations as well as measures to avoid adjacent nerves and blood vessels and prevent intravascular injection are outlined in the Investigational Produc t (IP) Handling Guide. The maximum absolute dose and schedule for both Parts 1 and 2 is 250 mg/muscle administered bilaterally by injection into the left and right TA muscles every 3 weeks for up to 5 doses (actual dose levels to be based on recommendation s of the SRT) ."
17,page_17,"Clinical Study Protocol ACE -083 Study A083 -03 Revision: 03 09 January 2019 Acceleron Pharma Inc. Page 17 of 66 CONFIDENT IAL Individual Dose Modification Rules For an adverse event (AE, including injection site reaction) of grade 3 or higher, regardless of relationship to study drug, treatment will be paused and the patient will be monitored weekly. At the discre tion of the investigator, dosing may resume upon resolution of the AE to ≤ grade 1 or baseline and may be reduced to the previously tolerated dose (i.e. from 240 to 200 mg or from 200 to 150 mg). Dose will not be reduced to below 100 mg (Part 1) or 150 mg (Part 2). Duration of Treatment Study duration for a patient enrolled in Part 1 will be approximately 24 weeks, including a 4 -week screening period, a 12 -week treatment period, and an 8 -week follow -up period after the last dose. Study duration for a patient enrolled in Part 2 will be approximately 15 months , includi ng a 4-week screening period, a 12-month treatment period ( 6-month double -blind, placebo controlled and a 6-month open -label extension), and an 8 -week follow -up period after the last dose. If a patient has a positive anti -drug antibody (ADA) result at the l ast visit, the patient will be asked to return for additional ADA testing approximately every 3 months, until a negative result is obtained or the result is considered to be stabilized. Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration The placebo (co ntrol agent) to be used in Part 2 of this study will be sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride for injection). Sterile normal saline will be supplied by the investigational site’s pharmacist. The manufacturer’s directions for saline storage and hand ling are to be followed, as are standard clinical practices for ensuring sterility. Saline -filled syringes will be prepared by unblinded study personnel and provided to blinded study personnel for administration. Placebo will be administered using EMG or ultrasound guidance into the non -tendinous portion of the TA as a series of up to 4 equal -volume injections. If the degree of atrophy or fibro -fatty infiltration poses administration challenges, injections of placebo should be distributed approximately 2 cm apart into viable muscle. Injection site locations as well as measures to avoid adjacent nerves and blood vessels and prevent intravascular injection are outlined in the IP Handling Guide.

The review will include all collected safet y data (and, as necessary , imaging data) when at least 4 patients in a cohort have complete d at least their Day 22 visit. For both parts of the study, t he SRT safety data will include, but not be limited to, AEs, laboratory results (including hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis) and vital signs data to assess for DLTs and overall safety. The SRT may request review of additional data collected in currently enrolled patients. Based on review of relevant data, the SRT will make one or more of the following recommendations:  Continue enrollment of remaining patients in the current cohort at the current dose level  Open next cohort in Part 1 or open Part 2 of the study at a recommended dose (higher or lower dose level)  Discontinue one or more cohorts in Part 1 , or the study as a whole SRT recommendations for dose escalation in Part 1 will be based in part upon the dose escalation stopping rules. If a stopping rule is met, a lower intermediate dose may be recommended or the previous dose level will be considered the maximally tolerated dose (MTD). The SRT may also recommend no further enrollment in the presence of AEs that do not meet dose stopping rules if the nature of these AEs is deemed a significant risk to patients in a given cohort. For Part 2, the SRT w ill periodically review blinded preliminary safety data. Further details on the role of the SRT during Part 2 are included in the SRT Guidelines.

Six patients in each cohort will provide sufficient data to evaluate sa fety and to make a preliminary assessment of changes in muscle volume and muscle strength. Part 2 The sample size calculation for Part 2 is based upon the expected percent change from baseline in total muscle volume of the injected TA 3 weeks after the l ast dose. A 10% difference between ACE -083-treated and placebo groups in the percent change in total muscle volume from baseline is considered to be clinically meaningful. The standard deviation (SD) is estimated to be approximately 10% for each group ba sed on preliminary MRI data for the ACE -083-treated side of the TA muscle from Part 1 of the Phase 2 study in FSHD patients . Assuming a 2 -sided type 1 error rate of 0.10, a 10% difference in percent change from baseline between the ACE -083-treated and pla cebo groups in total muscle volume, a SD of 10% for each group, and a 1:1 randomization, 90% power is achieved with a total sample size of n=36 patients (18 active, 18 placebo), based on a standard t -test. In addition, this sample size provides 9 0% power to detect a 10% difference in 6MWD, based on an assumed estimated SD of 10% (based off of available data from Part 1 of the Phase 2 study in FSHD patients as well as available data from Part 1 of this study) and a 2 -sided type 1 error rate of 0.1.

Background ACE -083 is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of a modified form of human follistatin (FST) linked to a human IgG2 Fc domain. FST is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF) -β superfamily, a large family of structurall y related cytokine -like proteins and cell surface receptors that play pivotal roles in the development, differentiation, and maturation of virtually all cells and tissues.1 FST has been shown to be a potent activin antagonist through its role as a natural ligand trap, functioning as a key regulator of activin activity in body tissues.2 Growth and differentiation factor 8 (GDF8) , also known as myostatin, is a powerful negative regulator of skeletal muscle development and growth.3 Inhib ition of the modulating effects of both activin and myostatin on skeletal muscle growth has been identified as a promising therapeutic approach for degenerative diseases of skeletal muscle.4 Unlike myostatin, in which the expression and site of action is primarily restricted to skeletal muscle, activin is produced in many different tissues and mediates a wide range of biologic processes in animals and humans, thro ughout all stages of development.5 The challenge for therapeutic inter vention in muscle diseases, therefore, has been in the selective inhibition of activin/myostatin activity only in the target tissue (i.e., skeletal muscle) in order to prevent or minimize undesirable off -target effects due to broad systemic inhibition of a ctivin. ACE -083 has been engineered and developed as a locally -active ligand trap of activin and myostatin in addition to other ligands. The properties of ACE -083 are such that , when administered by IM injection, the drug remains primarily within the injected muscle(s) to increase mass and strength of the particular muscle(s). As described in the ACE -083 Investigator’s Brochure (IB), a number of nonclinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with ACE -083 to define the ligand -binding properties of t he molecule and assess its anabolic effects on skeletal muscle in normal animals and in a mouse model of muscle disease. Preclinical studies in normal mice and rats have demonstrated increased muscle mass as a result of increased fiber hypertrophy and not hyperplasia. This ACE -083-induced muscle hypertrophy has also been shown to translate to functional improvement in muscle strength in normal mice. ACE -083 has also been evaluated in a well -established mouse model of human Duchenne muscular dystrophy a s representative of a degenerative muscle disorder as well as the SOD1 mouse model of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), representative of a neurogenic disorder . ACE -083 treatment in both mouse models resulted in significant increases in the mass and peak strength of the injected muscle. These studies provide evidence that local inhibition of activin/myostatin by ACE -083 can increase muscle mass even in animals with a degenerative skeletal muscle disease. In addition, Study A083 -01, a P hase 1, dou ble-bind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of local muscle injections of ACE -083 in healthy postmenopausal women has been completed . Forty -two subjects have recei ved ACE -083 at dose levels of 50 to 200 mg administered as single or multiple injections into either the right rectus femoris or right tibialis anterior muscle . ACE -083 was generally safe and well tolerated in this study with no serious adverse events or grade ≥ 3 AEs reported. A significant dose-dependent change in volume of the injected muscle has been seen in the treated versus placebo group ."

Study Rationale Hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN), also known as Charcot -Marie -Tooth (CMT) disease, i s the most common form of hereditary neuropathy with a prevalence of 1 in 2500 individuals or about 125,000 people.6 A specific mutation in one of severa l myelin genes results in defects in myelin structure, maintenance, and formation. Duplication of the PMP22 gene causes CMT1A, the most common type of CMT , accounting for approximately 40 percent of cases. X -linked forms of CMT are the second most common form of CMT and account for approximately 10 to 15 percent of cases.7 Patients with CMT typically present with both motor and sensory nerve manifestations, dista l leg weakness, foot deformities (pes cavus, hammer toes), and sensory deficits . Involvement of the hands may also follow as the patient progresses. Weakness in the lower leg manifests as “foot drop” and patients have difficulty lifting their toes during ambulation. As this weakness progresses, patients begin to lose mobility and are at increased risk for falls and injury. To date, treatment of CMT has been restricted to symptomatic interventions. Although some clinical and pharmacological trials have been performed, the results have not been encouraging.8 Patients will commonly wear braces and/or use assistive devices such as canes and walkers to preserve mo bility but each of these orthopedic interventions is associated with practical as well as social limitations. Surgery has been shown to successfully treat deformities of the foot as well as foot drop but it is a more invasive option and not always an appr opriate intervention in every case. In some patients, exercise is the recommended therapy but it is still uncertain whether exercise should be considered safe for the general CMT population and , if so, how the frequency, timing, and type of exercise shoul d be selected for each patient.9 In our Phase 1 study , local injection of ACE -083 into the tibialis anterior (TA) of healthy volunteers led to a dose -dependent incre ase in TA muscle volume. Because CMT disease selectively impacts muscles in the lower leg innervated by longer nerve fibers, including the TA, a locally acting agent such as ACE -083 can be can be used to selectively target atrophied muscle that is contrib uting to functional limitations. In CMT patients with lower limb weakness and atrophy of the TA, an increase in TA muscle volume has the potential to increase strength and function associated with ankle dorsiflexion, which could improve a patient’s mobili ty and ultimately their quality of life."

Overview of Study Design Study A083 -03 is a multicenter, Phase 2 study to eval uate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics ( PD), efficacy, and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of ACE -083 in patients with CMT1 and CMTX, to be conducted in two parts. Part 1 is non -randomized, open -label, and dose-escalation ; Part 2 is randomized, double -blind, and placebo -controlled. Patients who have signed the informed consent form ( ICF) and meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study. Duration of Treatment Study duration for a patient enrolled in Part 1 will be approximately 24 weeks, including a 4-week screening period, a 12 -week treatment period, and an 8 -week follow -up period after the last dose. Study duration for a patient enrolled in Part 2 will be approximately 15 months , including a 4 -week screening period, a 12-month treatmen t period ( 6-month double -blind, placebo controlled and a 6-month open -label extension), and an 8 -week follow -up period after the last dose. If a patient has a positive anti -drug antibody (ADA) result after the last visit, the patient will be asked to retu rn for additional A DA testing approximately every 3 months, until a negative result is obtained or the result is considered to be stabilized. Part 1 (non -randomized, open -label, dose -escalation) Part 1 will consist of up to 3 cohorts of 6 patients each an d will evaluate multiple ascending dose levels of ACE -083 administered bilaterally once every 3 weeks for up to 5 doses in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Patients in each cohort will be enrolled in a 4 -week screening period before beginning treatment. For Cohort 1, the dose level will be 150 mg/muscle administered bilaterally. For Cohort 2, the dose level will be based on review of safety data and recommendations made by the Safety Review Team (SRT). The planned dose level for Cohort 2 is 200 mg/mu scle administered bilaterally . For Cohort 3, the decision to enroll patients and the dose level will be based on recommendations of the SRT following review of safety and, as necessary, imaging data for prior cohorts. The maximum possible dose level for Cohort is 250 mg/muscle administered bilaterally . The SRT will provide recommendations to the sponsor regarding the conduct of the current or subsequent cohorts in the study (e.g., dose level) as described in Section 7.2 below. Part 2 (randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled) Prior to the initiation of Part 2, a review of safety and efficacy data from Part 1 will be conducted by the SRT to determine the recommended dose level (maximum 250 mg/muscle) . A total of up to 40 new patients may be enrolled an d randomized ( 1:1 randomization ) to receive either"

Page 28 of 66 CONFIDENT IAL ACE -083 (n= 20) or placebo (n= 20) bilaterally by injection in to both TA muscles . Patients will receive blinded study drug once every 3 weeks for approximately 6 months (9 doses). Patients who complete the double -blind treatment period wil l immediately roll over to open -label treatment of ACE -083, receiving the same dose of active drug, bilaterally in the TA muscle, once every 3 weeks for approximately 6 months (8 doses). In Part 2, the SRT will periodicall y review blinded safety data for each muscle treated. 7.2. Justification for Dose Level ACE -083 was administered into either the rectus femoris (RF) or TA muscle of healthy post-menopausal women in the Phase 1 Study A083 -01 at absolute dose levels per muscle o f up to 200 mg (RF) or 150 mg (TA) as either a single dose or repeated dose every 3 weeks . The estimated ACE -083 (mg/g muscle) within the muscle was calculated using the dose administered to each patient and the size of each patient ’s RF muscle as measure d by baseline MRI. The highest dose of ACE -083 evaluated (200 mg x 2 doses for RF; 150 mg x 2 doses for TA) produced a mean increase from baseline in muscle volume of 14.5% and 8.9% for RF and TA, respectively, at 3 weeks following the last dose. These dose levels were considered safe and generally well tolerated . A starting dose level of 150 mg /muscle is considered appropriate and safe based on the Phase 1 clinical trial results. This starting dose level will protect patient safety and also ensure that the initial exposures achieved within the muscle have the potential to impact efficacy endpoints. All subsequent dose level s (higher or lower) will be determ ined following review of study data and recommendations from the SRT. A maximum absolute dose leve l of 250 mg/muscle following dose escalation has been chosen based on administration feasibility and volume constraints. 7.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment Information about the known and expected benefits, risks, SAEs, and reasonably anticipated AEs of ACE -083 is provided in the IB."

The investigator must notify the sponsor and medical monitor when a patient has been withdrawn from the study. All patients who are withdrawn from the study prior to the end of treatment visit should complete the tests and evaluations (excluding the MRI if it has been don e within 4 weeks of study withdrawal) scheduled for the end of treatment visit (Day 106/ET for Part 1, Day 358/ET for Part 2) at the time of withdrawal and will be asked to return to the clinic to complete the remaining follow -up visit assessment. 9.1. Disconti nuation of Study Treatment Reasons that may lead to discontinuation of study treatment include:  Treatment completed  Adverse event  Patient request (withdrawal of consent)  Death  Lost to follow -up  Pregnancy  Protocol deviation  Study terminated by s ponsor1 9.2. Withdrawal from the Study Reasons that may lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study include:  Study terminated by sponsor1  Patient’s request  Screen failure  Patient’s unwillingness or inability to comply with the protocol  Death  Lost to follow -up  Adver se event 1 The sponsor ma y terminate this study or a dose level after consultation with the investigator and the SRT at any time for safety or administrative reasons. The sponsor will terminate the study if the occurrence of SAEs or other findings suggests unacceptable risk to th e health of the patients."

Treatments Administered Using electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound guidance, each dose of study drug will be administered into the non -tendinous portion of the TA as a series of up to 4 equal -volume injectio ns. The use of EMG or ultrasound guidance will ensure that viable muscle is present at the injection site. If the degree of atrophy or fibro -fatty infiltration poses administration challenges, injections of ACE -083 should be distributed approximately 2 cm apart into viable muscle. Injection site locations as well as measures to avoid adjacent nerves , blood vessels , and prevent intravascular injection are outlined in the IP Handling Guide. The maximum absolute dose level and schedule, based on SRT review, is 250 mg/muscle administered bilaterally by injection into the left and right TA muscles every 3 weeks for up to 5 doses in Part 1 and up to 17 doses in Part 2 . For Part 2, ACE -083 or placebo (normal saline) will be administered blinded study drug every 3 weeks for approximately 6 months (9 doses) . Patients who complete the double -blind treatment period will immediately roll over to open -label treatment with ACE -083, receiving the same dose of active drug, bilaterally in the TA muscle once every 3 weeks f or approximately 6 months (8 doses). The planned dose scheme for Part 1 and 2 is shown in Table 4.

Individual Dose Modification Rules For an adverse event (AE, including injection site reaction) of grade 3 or higher, regardless of relationship to study drug, treatment will be paused and the patient will be monitored weekly. At the discretion of the investigator, dosing may resume upon resolution of the AE to ≤ grade 1 or"

Dose will not be reduced to below 100 mg (Part 1) or 150 mg (Part 2 ). If dosing does not resume within 6 weeks of the last dose given , the patient will be discontinued from treatment. 10.2. Safety Review Team Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Definition:  An SAE , possibly or probably related to study drug OR  An AE, injection site reaction, laboratory parameter abnormality, or vital sign abnormality, possibly or probably related to study drug, and either Grade ≥ 3 (NCI-CTCAE , current version) or Grade ≥ 2 and co nsidered clinically significant Part 1 Dose Escalation Stopping Rules (under SRT review): Dosing at current levels will continue unless the following condition occurs :  ≥ 2 DLTs of the same character in a cohort Safety Review Team: An SRT, comprised at minimum of a principal investigator, medical monitor, and an independent neuromuscular specialist, will meet to review safety and, as needed, imaging data, for each cohort. The review will include all colle cted safety data (and, as necessary imaging data) when at least 4 patients in a cohort have completed at least their Day 22 visit. For both parts of the study, the SRT safety data will include, but not be limited to, AEs, laboratory results (including hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis) and vital signs data to asses s for DLTs and overall safety. The SRT may request review of additional data collected in currently enrolled patients. Based on review of relevant data, the SRT will make one or more of the following recommendations:  Continue enrollment of remaining patients in the current cohort at the current dose level  Open next cohort in Part 1 or open Part 2 of the study at a recommended dose (higher or lower dose level)  Discontinue one or more cohorts in Part 1 , or the study as a whole SRT recommendations for dose escalation in Part 1 will be based in part upon the dose esc alation stopping rules. If a stopping rule is met, a lower intermediate dose may be recommended or the previous dose level will be c onsidered the MTD. The SRT may also recommend no further enrollment in the presence of AEs that do not meet dose stopping rules if the nature of these AEs is deemed a significant risk to patients in a given cohort. For Part 2, the SRT will review blinde d preliminary safety data. Further details on the role of the SRT during Part 2 are included in the SRT Guidelines. 10.3. Concomitant Medications During screening and throughout the study, patient s may take stable doses of medications for chronic conditions tha t are not specifically excluded by the protocol. These medications include:"
36,page_36,"Clinical Study Protocol ACE -083 Study A083 -03 Revision: 03 09 January 2019 Acceleron Pharma Inc. Page 36 of 66 CONFIDENT IAL single agent low dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg daily), intra -articular/topical/inhaled/intranasal physiologic doses of systemic corticosteroids, and topical physiologic androgen replacem ent. Any change in medications potentially affecting muscle strength or function (e.g., creatinine, CoQ10, or systemic beta adrenergic agonist) is not allowed. If there is an immediate clinical need during the study to prescribe a new medication or a new dosage of an existing medication for either a new or chronic condition, concurrent therapy may be administered at the discretion of the investigator. The investigator may consult the medical monitor regarding what constitutes a stable dose or a chronic c ondition. Information regarding concomitant medications will be collected beginning at study screening and will include all medications taken within 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1. Patients are not permitted to take the following: anticoagulation / platel et modifying therapies, systemic corticosteroids, androgens, growth hormone, insulin, or hormone replacement therapy. Additionally, patients must be withdrawn from study treatment if at any time during their participation they receive other investigational compound(s), or start any new experimental or approved therapies related to the treatment of CMT. This withdrawal excludes standard of care procedures and participation in observational research. 10.4. Treatment Compliance Each dose of study drug will be admin istered via injections at the clinical site by the study staff and will be documented in the study record. Monitoring for patient compliance with the treatment regimen is therefore unnecessary. 10.5. Randomization and Blinding Part 1: This is an open -label, dos e escalation phase that does not require randomization. Part 2: Patients who have signed the informed consent and meet all eligibility criteria will be stratified by CMT disease type (CMT1 or CMTX) and then randomized to receive ACE -083 (at a dose level de termined by Part 1) or placebo. The randomization scheme will be computer generated and will be prepared by a statistical group designated by the sponsor. If a patient discontinues the study for reasons other than a safety issue related to ACE -083 and the patien t had not completed visit Day 43 , the patient may be replaced. The replacement patient will receive the same treatment as the patient replaced. Both the replacement and originally allocated patient numbers will be unique numbers. Among study pers onnel, only the pharmacist or his/her designee who prepares the study drug (ACE -083 or placebo), an unblinded clinical monitor designat ed by the s ponsor, and the analytical laboratory will be unblinded to the patient treatment assignments. All other study personnel (including but not limited to investigators, study coordinators, nursing staff, and clinical monitors) and all patient s will remain blinded to the study treatment assignments. The sponsor and the s ponsor’s representatives will also remain blind ed to the study treatment assignments. In the event of a medical emergency for an individual patient in which knowledge of the study drug is critical to the patient ’s medical management, the investigator may break the blind for that patient . However, pri or to breaking the blind, every effort must be made by the investigator to first discuss the need to break the blind with the medical monitor. Further, it must be determined"

Study Drug Study drug is either ACE -083 or placebo. ACE -083 is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of a modified form of human follistatin linked to a human IgG2 Fc domain. Placebo will be sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride for injection). 11.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling ACE -083 drug product is provided as a lyophilized powder contained in stoppered and sealed glass vials. Each single -use vial will be reconstituted wit h sterile water and contains 1.2 mL of ACE -083 solution for injection after reconstitution. ACE -083 drug product solution for injection contains ACE -083 at a nominal concentration of 50 mg/mL . Sterile normal saline for place bo will be supplied by the investigational site’s pharmacist. 11.3. Study Drug Storage ACE -083 should be stored at °C until use. The manufacturer’s directions for saline storage are to be followed, as are standard clinical practices for ensuring sterility. 11.4. Study Drug Preparation Please refer to the IP Handling Guideline, provided separately , for detailed study drug handling, administration, and storage instructions. The manufacturer’s directions for saline handling are to be followed, as are standard clinical practices for ensuring sterility. 11.5. Study Drug Accountability Accountability for study drug is the responsibi lity of the investigator. Investigational clinical supplies must be received by a designated person at the clinical site and kept in a secured location. The clinical site must maintain accurate records demonstrating dates and amounts of study drug receiv ed, to whom it was dispensed ( patient -by-patient accounting), and accounts of any study drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed or returned. Unless otherwise notified, all vials of study drug, both used and unused, must be saved for drug accountability purposes. The used vials may be discarded, per the institution’s standard practice, after a drug accountability assessment has been completed by the clinical monitor. At the end of the study, the sponsor will provide direction for the outcome of all unu sed vials. Following the sponsor’s instructions, the investigator must either return all unused vials of study drug to the sponsor or destroy them at the clinical site. In either case, the outcome must be documented on the drug accountability log. 11.6. Study Drug Handling and Disposal Please refer to the IP Handling Guideline, provided under separate cover, for detailed study drug handling, administration, storage, and disposal instructions."

Adverse Event For this protocol, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation al study in which a patient is administered a stu dy drug (i.e., on or after the Dose 1 Day 1 dose) , which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempor ally associated with the use of the study drug whether or not it is considered related to the study drug. Abnormal laboratory and other abnormal investigational findings (e.g., physical exam, ECG) should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated w ith clinical signs and symptoms, lead to treatment discontinuation, or are otherwise considered clinically relevant by the investigator. In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself. In the case of a fatality, the cause of death is considered as the AE, and the death is considered as its outcome. 13.1.1.1. Unexpected Adverse Events An unexpected AE is an AE that is not described in nature or severity in the IB under the Reference Safety Information. 13.1.1.2. Events Not to Be Considered as Adverse Events Pre-existing medical conditions/signs/symptoms present before the screening period that do not worsen in severity or frequency during the study are defined as baselin e medical conditions, and are not to be considered AEs. 13.1.1.3. Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE (on or after the Dose 1 Day 1 dose ), occurring at any dose, regardless of causality , that:  Results in death  Is life -threatening: life -threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred (i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form)  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existin g hospitalization; however, a hospitalization for an elective procedure will not be considered a SAE  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  Is an important medical event: an important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the"

Page 41 of 66 CONFIDENT IAL patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitaliz ation, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 13.1.1.4. Events Not to Be Considered as Serious Adverse Events Elective hospitalizations to administer or to simplify study treatment or perform procedures are not considered SAEs. Unexpected complicatio ns and/or prolongation of elective hospitalization should be recorded as AEs. 13.1.1.5. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and the investigator iden tifies as related to the investigational product or procedure. Acceleron follows procedures for the expedited reporting of SUSARs consistent with global regulations and associated guidances. 13.2. Severity Investigators must evaluate the severity/intensity of AEs according t o the CTCAE current version, preferentially using the graded scales. If the severity/intensity of a particular AE is not specifically graded, the investigator should apply the general guidelines for determination of Grade 1 through Grade 5 as listed in the CTCAE v4 cover page (reproduced below), using their best medical judgment: Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living ( e.g., preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.) Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately lif e-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living ( e.g., bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden) Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated Grade 5: Death related to AE 13.3. Relationship to Study Drug Investigators must also assess the causal relationship of each AE to study drug. Factors for the assessment of causal relationship include, but are not limited to, temporal relationship between the AE and the administration of study drug, known side effects of study drug, medical history, concomitant therapy, course of the underlying disease and pertinent study procedures."
42,page_42,"Clinical Study Protocol ACE -083 Study A083 -03 Revision: 03 09 January 2019 Acceleron Pharma Inc. Page 42 of 66 CONFIDENT IAL Probabl y: A causal relationship is clinically/biologically highly plausible and there is a plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of study drug and there is a reasonable response on withdrawal. Possibl y: A causal relationship is clinically/biolog ically plausible and there is a plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of study drug. Unlikely: A causal relationship is improbable and another documented cause of the AE is most plausible. Not R elated: A causal relationship can be definitively excluded and another documented cause of the AE is most plausible. 13.4. Recording Adverse Events It is the responsibility of the i nvestigator to document all AEs that occur during the study. Patients will be evaluated and questioned generally f or AEs during the course of the study, . The investigator must report in detail all adverse signs and symptoms which a re either volunteered by patient s or observed during or following the course of investigational product administration on the appropriate CRF page. All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedure results should be recorded as a single diagnosis. All untoward medical occurrences arising after signing of the ICF until a patient is dosed on Dose 1 Day 1 are to be docume nted on the medical history CRF. All AEs occurring on or after the Dose 1 Day 1 dose through Day 141/End of Study visit (Part 1) or Day 393/End of Study visit (Part 2) are to be reported and documented on the AE CRF. All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient and/or in response to an open question from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination , or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the AE CRF. Any clinically relevant changes in laboratory assessments, or other clinical fin dings as described in Section 13.1 , are considered AEs and must be recorded on the AE CRF. AEs are to be followed for resol ution as described in in Section 13.5. It is important that each AE report includ e a description of the event, duration (onset and resolution dates), severity, relationship with ACE -083, any other potential causal factors, any treatment given , or other action taken (including dose delay or discontinuation of study drug ) and outcome. In addition, SAEs should be identified and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented. AEs categorized as SAEs must also be documented using an SAE Report Form as described in Section 13.4.1. Specific guidance can be found in the CRF Complet ion Guide lines provided by the s ponsor or designee. 13.4.1. Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after the first study drug administration on Dose 1 Day 1 until Day 141/ End of St udy visit (Part 1) or Day 393/End of Study visit (Part 2) are to be docu mented on the AE CRF. For all SAEs, an SAE Report F orm must be completed with as much information as possible and submitted within the time frame described in Section 13.5. When new significant information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known, the investigator should record the"

In all instances, the investigator should follow up with patients until the outcome of the SAE is known. 13.5. Reporting Adverse Events As described in Section 13.4 , all AEs must be recorded in the CRF up until the last follow -up visit. All patient s who received at least one dose of study drug, whether they completed the treatment period or not, should complete the end of treatment procedures. All AEs will be followed until clinical database lock (or resolution if it occurs before database lock). All SAEs will undergo active follow -up until the event(s) have returned to baseline status , have stabilized , or until the investiga tor and s ponsor have agree d that follow -up is no longer necessary. Follow -up data for SAEs obtained after clinical database lock will be incorporated into the study drug safety database. If a patient experiences an SAE that is considered to be related to study treatment at any time after the stu dy, it must be reported to the s ponsor. 13.6. Pregnancy Female patients who are of childbearing potential at the time of consent or who become of childbearing potential during study participation must agree to use a high ly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study and for 8 weeks after the last dose of ACE -083. Male patients and their partners must be using a highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study and for 8 weeks afte r last dose of ACE -083. All pregnancies occurring during the study and up to 8 weeks after the last dose of ACE -083 must be reported immediately to the investigator. The i nvestigator must report all pregnancies to the sponsor within 24 hours of notificat ion. A pregnant female participant must discontinue study drug immediately. Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify Medp ace Clinical Safety. At the completion of the pregnancy, the investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e. , postpartum complication, spontaneous ab ortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 13.7. Reporting Serious Adverse Events If an SAE occurs during the reporting period, the investigator must immediately (i.e., within a maximum 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) inform the contract research organization (CRO ) by telephone, fax, or e -mail. All written reports should be transmitted using the study -specific SAE Report Form, which must be completed by the investiga tor following specific completion instructions. Names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers for SAE reporting are located on the SAE Report Form and in the completion instructions provided in the Study Manual. When an SAE (or follow -up information) is reported by telephone, a written report must be sent immediately thereafter by fax or e -mail. Reporting procedures and timelines for follow -up information are the same as for the initially reported SAE."

In all cases, the information provided in the SAE Report Form must be consistent with the data that are recorded in the corresponding sections of the CRF. The investigator/reporter must respond to any reque st for follow -up info rmation or to any question the s ponsor or designee may have on the AE within the same timelines as described for initial reports. This is necessary to permit a prompt asse ssment of the event by the s ponsor an d (as applicable) to allow the sponsor to meet regulatory timelines associated with expedited reporting obligations. Requests for follow -up will usually be made by the responsible clinical monitor or m edical monitor, or in exceptional circumstances , by a pharmacovigilance represent ative who may contact the investigator directly to obtain clarification on a particularly critical event. 13.7.1. Safety Reporting to Health Authorities, Independent Ethics Committees , Institutional Review Boards , and Investigators The s ponsor will send appropriat e safety notifications to health authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The investigator must comply with any applicable site -specific requirements related to the reporting of SAEs involving his/her patient s to the IEC or IRB that approved the study. In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the s ponsor will inform the investigator of “findings that could adversely affect the safety of patient s, impact the conduct of the study, or alter the IEC’s/IRB’s approval/favorable opinion to con tinue the study.” The s ponsor will inform the investigator of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and are considered to be related to study drug (SUSARs). The investigator should place copies of these Safety Reports in the Investigator Site File. National regulations with regard to Safety Report notifications to investigators will be followed. When specifically required by r egulations and guidelines, the s ponsor will provide appropriate Safety Reports directly to the concerned lead IEC/IRB and will maintain records of these notifications. When direct reporting by the s ponsor is not clearly defined by national or site-specific regulations, the investigator will be responsible for promptly notifying the concerned IEC/IRB of any Safety Reports and for filing copies of all related correspondence in the Investigator Site File. For studies covered by the European Union Clinical Tr ials Directive 2001/20/EC, the s ponsor’s responsibilities regarding the reporting of SAEs/SUSARs will be carried out in accordan ce with that Directive and with the related Detailed Guidances."

Pooled A nalyses If applicable, similar analyses will be performed for pooled Part 1 and 2 data for patients at the same dose level. Pooling by the estimated local dose of ACE -083 i n the injected muscle (i.e., mg ACE -083/g muscle) may also be performed. Details of these analyses will be included in the SAP. 14.2.5. Safety Data Unless otherwis e specified, safety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics and individual safety data will be listed. AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Incidence of treatment -emergent AEs will be presented by system organ class and preferred term. AE incidence rates will be described by cohort with and without regard to causality. The frequency of occurrence of overall toxicity, categorized by toxicity grades (NCI -CTCAE, current version) will be summarized. Change from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters , ECG, and vital signs will be summarized across time. Shift tables will be presented for selected laboratory parameters and vital signs. Physical examination results will be presented in listings. 14.2.6. Pharmac okinetic Data Individual patient serum ACE -083 concentrations will be listed and summarized by treatment group . Listings will also include dosing times and actual sampling times relative to dosing. Individual and mean concentration data versus time will al so be pr esented grap hically. PK parameters of ACE -083 will be determined using the standard non -compartmental method. Individual PK parameters will be listed and will be summarized by treatment group . 14.2.7. Anti -drug Antibody Data The results of ADA testing for ACE -083 versus time as well as results following further characterization of positive ADA samples will also be presented. Exploratory analysis will be performed on the potential effect of ADA on ACE -083 PK exposure if ADA tests are determined to be posit ive. 14.3. Determination of Sample Size There is no formal sample size calculation for Part 1. Six patient s in each cohort will provide sufficient data to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy data. The sample size calculation for Part 2 is based upon the ex pected percent change from baseline in total muscle vo lume of the injected TA 3 weeks after the last dose. A 10% difference between ACE -083-treated and placebo groups in the percent change in total muscle volume from baseline is considered to be clinicall y meaningful. The SD is estimated to be approximately 10% for each group based on preliminary MRI data for the ACE -083 treated side of the TA muscle from Part 1 of the Phase 2 study in FSHD patients. Assuming a 2 -sided type 1 error rate of 0.10, a 10% difference in percent change from baseline between the ACE -083-treated and placebo groups in total muscle volume, a standard deviation of 10% for each group, and a 1:1 randomization, 90% power is achieved with a total sample size of n=36 patients (18 active , 18 placebo), based on a standard t -test."

Laboratory samples and functional/strength assessments may be collected up to 24 hours prior to administration of study drug. All visit -day windows should be considered relative to the d ate of the prev ious dose of ACE -083. Actual visit days (e.g., day 1, day 8, day 22) may be different than planned due to windows on visits and potential dosi ng delays. Time of study drug administration is the time of the first injection. 2 Patients who discontinue pri or to the Day 106/ET visit should complete the Day 106/ET visit at the time of discontinuation and return for the remaining f ollow -up period visit. If an MRI has been completed within 4 weeks of discontinuation, it does not need to be repeated as part of the Day 106/ET visit procedures. 3 Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential to be performed and negative result confirmed before dosing. 4 Full physical examination (skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat and neck, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological) , at screening and Day 106/ET; limited physical examination (skin, cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological assessments) for Days 1, 22, 64. 5 Injection site examinat ion including but not limited to evaluating erythema, pain, bruising, bleeding, and other signs of discomfort or skin reactio n to be com pleted at least 30 minutes after injection. 6 Vital signs (weight, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) mu st be taken prior to administration of study drug on dosing days.

Reference the Study Manual for the order of study procedure s. Laboratory samples and functional/strength assessments may be collected up to 24 hours prior to administration of study drug. All visit-day windows should be considered relative to the date of the previous dose of ACE-083. Actual visit days (e.g., Day 1, Day 8, Day 22) may be different than planned due to windows on visits and potential dosing delays. Time of study drug administration i s the time of the first injection. 2 Patients who discontinue prior to the Day 358/ET visit should complete the Day 358/ET visit at the time of discontinuation and return for the remaining follow-up period visit. If an MRI has been completed within 4 weeks of discontinuation, it does not need to be repeated as part of the Day 358/ET visit procedures. 3 Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential to be performed and negative result confirmed before dosing. 4 Includes knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion, and ankle plantarflexion. 5 To be performed at screening if patient ha s not already had testing performed previously. 6 Full physical examination includes skin, head, eye s, ears, nose, throat and neck, lymph node s, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological 7 Limited physical examination includes skin, cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal and neurological assessments 8 Injection site examination including but not limited to evaluating erythema, pain, bruising, bleeding, and other signs of discomfort or skin reaction to be completed at least 30 minute s after injection. 9 Vital signs (weight, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) must be taken prior to administration of study drug on dosing days. Height is collected only at screening. 10 Tests defined in Appendix 2, Table 7. 11 Including but not limited to: insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and serum C-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) 12 If a patient has a positive ADA result at Day 393/EOS, the patient will be asked to return to the clinical site for additional follow-up approximately every 3 month s until a negative or stable result is obtained. 13 PK samples on a dosing day have a ±15 minute window for post-dose sample collection, based on the time of the first injection. Pre-dose samples may be collected up to 4 hour s prior to dosing. 14 ECG is to be conducted ±1 hour of the 4h PK sample. 15 MRI assessments should be completed within 5 days prior to the scheduled dose administration, with the exception of the Day 1 MRI which may be completed within 14 days prior to Day 1 visit. MRI assessments during the follow-up period (Day 358/ET and Day 393/EOS) have a ± 5 day window. 16 10-me ter walk/run, 6-minute walk, 100-meter timed test (Part 2, open-label only; starting at the Dose 10 visit and continuing through to the EOS visit at all timepoint s noted). Tests may be performed within 3 days prior to Day 1 visit. 17 Gait parameter s, Berg balance scale. Tests may be performed within 3 days prior to Day 1 visit. 18 Max imum voluntary isometric contraction testing will be conducted using a handheld dynamometer. Both side s will be tested (right and left). 19 CMTES2 to be assessed by investigator; CMT-HI to be completed by patient 20 Randomization should occur within 24 hour s prior to Day 1 dose. 21 PamSysTM device i s a physical activity monitoring system that will be worn by the patient for the duration of the study . 22 Study drug administration should occur within 21 days (± 3 days) of the previou s dose. 23 If subject s enroll directly into a separate extension study and will receive additional treatment with ACE-083, they do not need to complete the EOS visit. For these subjects, their final Study Visit in this protocol will be the ET visit."
