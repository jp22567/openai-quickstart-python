Rationale: Changed to be consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the global Phase 3 Study M13-549 which was also conducted in the same study population (i.e., population of csDMARD inadequate responders) and to ensure comparability across populations globally."
2,page_2,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 3 The rationale for allowing inclusion of these subjects is that, in subjects with limited exposure < 3 months, inadequate response to treatment with bDMARDs cannot be established given the short duration of treatment. These subjects cannot be considered bDMARD-inadequate responders but should rather be considered csDMARD-inadequate responders. Currently, Study M15-557 does not allow these subjects to enter the study although they may otherwise satisfy entry criteria for the study and may be in need of adequate treatment. In addition, subjects who show response but discontinued bDMARD treatment due to intolerance cannot be considered inadequate responders to bDMARDs and should also be considered for inclusion in this study. ●Update Section 5.2.3.1 , Permitted Background RA Therapy. Rationale: Updated text to provide clarity on csDMARDs that are allowed at Week 24 onwards if a subject fails to meet the LDA criterion for adjustment of subject's background RA therapies. ●Update Section 5.2.3.2 , Prohibited Therapy. Rationale: Updated Subsection ""Vaccines"" to clarify the wash-out period of nasal influenza vaccine. ●Update Section 5.2.4 , Contraception Recommendations. Rationale: Revised Subsection ""Contraception Recommendation for Females"" per sponsor guidelines to improve consistency and provide clarity. Revised Subsection ""Contraception Recommendation for Males"" per sponsor guidelines and to clarify that contraception and sperm donation recommendations are specifically intended to prevent pregnancy during exposure to the investigational therapy. ●Revise Table 3 , Study Activities (Period 1), Revise Table 4, Study Activities – Optional Samples for Exploratory Resear ch and Validation Studies (Period 1 Only) and Revise Table 5 , Study Activities (Period 2). Rationale: Updated text to provide clarity on hsCRP reporting in Period 1 and 2, to define that optional sample for Exploratory Research and Validation Studies will not be collected for subjects in mainland China, to provide clarity and to remain consistent with Amendment 3 changes reflected in the protocol."

To compare the efficacy of upadacitinib versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of subjects from China and selected countries including Brazil and South Korea with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are on a stable dose of conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. 2. To compare the safety and tolerability of upadacitinib versus placebo in subjects from China and selected countries including Brazil and South Korea with moderately to severely active RA who are on a stable dose of csDMARDs and have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. Period 2 To evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib in subjects from China and selected countries including Brazil and South Korea with RA who have completed Period 1. Investigators: Multicenter Study Sites: Approximately 50 Study Population: Adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of RA for ≥ 3 months who also fulfill the 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for RA. Eligible study subjects must have ≥ 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and ≥ 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) ≥ upper limit of normal (central lab) at Screening. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD therapy (restricted to methotrexate [MTX], chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects with inadequate response to hydroxychloroquine and/or chloroquine can only be included if they also have failed (lack of efficacy or intolerability) MTX, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide. Number of Subjects to be Enrolled: Approximately 322"
6,page_6,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 7 Methodology: This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods. Period 1 is a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period designed to compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of subjects with moderately to severely active RA who are on a stable dose of csDMARDs and have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. Period 2 is an open-label 52 week extension period to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib in subjects with RA who have completed Period 1. The study duration will include a 35-day screeni ng period; a 12-week randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled treatment period (Period 1); an open-label 52 week extension period; and a 30-day follow-up period. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups. As indicated below, it is expected that approximately 222 subjects will enter the study from China and 100 subjects from other countries including Brazil and South Korea: !Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 161; 111 from China) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2) !Group 2: Placebo (N = 161; 111 from China) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2) Randomization will be stratified by country and the Chinese population will be up to 80% of the total study population. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD(s) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and must remain on a stable dose until Week 24; the csDMARD dose may be decreased only for safety reasons. Subjects with prior exposure to at most one biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) for RA may be enrolled in the study (up to 20% of total number of subjects) after the required washout period is satisfied and if they have limited exposure (< 3 months) OR response to bDMARD but had to discontinue that bDMARD due to intolerability (regardless of treatment duration). Subjects who are considered bDMARD inadequate responders (lack of efficacy), as determined by the Investigator, are not eligible. At Week 24, if a subject fails to meet the Low Disease Activity (LDA) criterion (LDA defined as CDAI ≤ 10), the investigator should adjust the subject's background RA therapies after assessments for Week 24 have been completed. Starting at Week 24 (after Week 24 assessments have been performed), initiation of or change in corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen/paracetamol, low potency analgesics, or csDMARDs (restricted to oral or parenteral MTX, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine and leflunomide, and restricted to concomitant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the combination of MTX and leflunomide) is allowed as per local label. For RA flare treatment, no more than 3 consecutive days of systemic corticosteroids (maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or its equivalent) is allowed, after which subject should resume their usual daily oral corticosteroid dose. Subjects taking MTX should take oral folic acid throughout study participation. Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen will be based on the Investigator's discretion. Starting at Week 24, at least 20% improvement in BOTH TJC AND SJC compared to baseline is required to remain on study drug. Anyone who does not fulfill this criterion at 2 consecutive visits (starting at Week 24) (see Section 5.2.3.1) must be discontinued from the study."
7,page_7,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 8 Methodology (Continued): Subjects who complete the Week 12 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the 52 week extension portion of the study, Period 2. Subjects who are assigned to upadacitinib treatment in Period 1 will continue to receive upadacitinib in an open-label manner. Subjects who are assigned to placebo in Period 1 will be switched to receive upadacitinib from Week 12 onwards. The primary analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 1 (Week 12) or have prematurely discontinued prior to Week 12. Study sites and subjects will remain blinded to the treatment assignment in Period 1 for the duration of the study. Blood samples will be collected for In Vivo Pharmacodynamic biomarker research at designated time points throughout the study. In Vivo Pharmacodynamic biomarker research samples will not be collected for subjects in mainland China. Where not prohibited by local regulations, optional pharmacogenetic samples, epigenetic samples, transcriptomic and epigenetic samples, plasma samples for proteomic and targeted protein investigations, serum samples for proteomic and targeted protein investigations will be collected for exploratory research and validation studies at designated time points throughout the study.

23,page_23,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 24 3.0 Introduction Rheumatoid Arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. The hallmark feature of RA is an inflammatory process manifested by persistent symmetric polyarthritis of synov ial joints which can ultimately lead to bone erosions, deformity, and disability. Left untreated, or inadequately treated, progressive functional impairment with increasing disability occurs leading to a reduction in quality of life. The prevalence of RA in the general population is approximately 1%, and increases with age in both genders, with women being more prone to developing RA than men. Early therapy with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is the standard of care, including conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) (e.g., methotrexate [MTX], sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and leflunomide), and biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) (e.g., anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and non-anti-TNF biologics). The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends a Treat-to-Target (T2T) approach to initiate therapy immediately after diagnosis of RA with a goal of achieving clinical remission (CR) or low disease activity (LDA), as these are associated with improved long-term outcomes. 1-3 Also, in line with recent advances in early diagnosis, new classification criteria have been developed. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EULAR classification criter ia redefined the paradigm of RA by focusing on features at earlier stages of disease that are associated with persistent and/or erosive disease, rather than defining the disease by its late-stage features. 4 Despite major progress in the treatment of RA, there still remains a large unmet medical need, as only a small percentage of RA patients reach or maintain a status of LDA or CR over time or need to discontinue due to safety or tolerability issues. 5,6 Novel therapies are therefore needed to complement the available interventions to address the unmet need.5-7"
24,page_24,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 25 JAK Inhibitor Evidence suggests that inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated pathways is a promising approach for the treatment of patients with this chronic disease.8 AbbVie is developing a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, upadacitinib, that may address the current needs. The JAK family is composed of 4 family members: JAK1, 2, 3, and Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2). These cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases are associated with membrane cytokine receptors such as common gamma-chain receptors and the glycoprotein 130 transmembrane proteins. 9 Activation of JAK pathways initiates expression of survival factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocyte cellular trafficking and cell proliferation which contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Hence, the JAK family has evoked considerab le interest in the area of inflammatory diseases leading to the development of various JAK inhibitors with different selectivity profiles against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2 which have demonstrated efficacy in individuals with RA. 10-14 Tofacitinib, the first in this class, has been approved in the United States and in other countries for treating moderately to severely active RA patients. Although tofacitinib, a non-selective JAK inhibitor, improves the clinical signs and symptoms, and inhibits structural progression in RA patients, questions regarding the safety profile remain, including serious infections, herpes zoster reactivation, malignancies, and hematologic adverse events (AEs). The second generation of JAK inhibitors, with different selectivity profiles against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2, are in development. 8 Upadacitinib is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA. In an in vitro setting, upadacitinib potently inhibits JAK1 activity, but to a lesser degree, inhibits the other isoforms, JAK2 and JAK3. The enhanced selectivity of upadacitinib against JAK1 may offer an improved benefit-risk profile in patients with RA. The clinical hypothesis is that upadacitinib should be effective in decreasing joint"
25,page_25,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 26 inflammation and damage associated with RA by interfering with JAK1-mediated signaling pathways (i.e., interleukin-6) without causing excessive anemia due to its reduced activity against JAK2 (IC 50120 nM), which is essent ial for erythropoietin signaling. Upadacitinib is also less potent against JAK3 (IC 502.3 μM), an important component of lymphocyte activation and functi on. As such, treatment with upadacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor with reduced JAK3 i nhibition, could result in a decreased risk for infection (including viral reactivation) and/or malignancy compared to a pan JAK inhibitor or less selective JAK inhibitors. Phase 2 Studies with Upadacitinib The Phase 2 program for upadacitinib consisted of 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), both on stable background MTX therapy, in subjects with moderately to severely active RA and one open-label extension (OLE) study (Study M13-538; NCT02049138) for those subjects who had completed either one of the RCTs. Study M13-550 (NCT01960855) enrolled subjects who had an inadequate response to anti-TNF therapy and Study M13-537 (NCT02066389) enrolled subjects who had shown an inadequate response to MTX. A total of 4 twice daily (BID) and 1 once daily (QD) dose regimens of upadacitinib immediate release capsules (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12 mg BID, 18 mg BID, and 24 mg QD) were evaluated. In TNF-inadequate responder (TNF-IR) subjects, who represent the population with the greatest unmet need, the primary endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was significantly greater at all doses of upadacitinib (up to 73%) compared with placebo (35%). In addition, numerically higher proportions of subjects achieved ACR50 and ACR70 responses and LDA (based on Dis ease Activity Score [DAS]28 C-Reactive Protein [CRP] and Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI]) in the upadacitinib dose groups versus placebo. In MTX-inadequate responder (MTX-IR) subjects, the primary endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was significantly greater (up to 82%) at all but the lowest dose"
26,page_26,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 27 of upadacitinib compared with placebo (50%). At all doses of upadacitinib compared to placebo, significantly higher proportions of subjects achieved LDA and CR at Week 12. Safety data are available from the two Phase 2 studies (N = 575) which showed that the types and frequencies of AEs during upadacitinib treatment were consistent with subjects with moderately to severely active RA receiving immunomodulatory therapy. The incidences of AEs were numerically higher in the upadacitinib dose groups, with a trend toward higher rates with higher doses of upad acitinib. The most frequently reported AEs (≥ 5%) in the upadacitinib treated subjects were urinary tract infection, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and nausea. There were 6 subjects (1.3% of total combined populations) with herpe s zoster reactivation distributed across the upadacitinib dose groups, and 2 subjects (1.9%) in the placebo groups. In these two 12 week studies, a total of 2 subjects in the upadacitinib treatment groups reported malignancies. One subject reported non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) and 1 subject was diagnosed with lung cancer after the final scheduled visit, and subsequently died 14 weeks after study complet ion. These events were reported by the Investigators as not possibly related to study drug. Elevations of liver function tests were sporadic with no clear dose-response relationship observed. As observed with other JAK inhibitors, treatment with upadacitinib resulted in an increase in lipids (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] and high de nsity lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]). Among subjects with laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation (as evidenced by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] > upper limit of normal [ULN]), treatment with lower doses of upadacitinib (3 mg BID and 6 mg BID) was associated with improvements in mean hemoglobin relative to placebo. At higher doses, there was a reduction in mean hemoglobin; however, the mean hemoglobin levels remained within normal range throughout the tr eatment period. Phase 3 Studies with Upadacitinib Primary results are available from the first RA Phase 3 clinical trial (Study M13-549 [NCT02675426]) evaluating upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD in subjects with moderate to severe RA. Study M13-549 eval uated upadacitinib compared to placebo in"
27,page_27,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 28 subjects who did not adequately respond to treatment with csDMARDs (same population as Study M15-557). Results show that, after 12 weeks of treatment, both doses of upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg) met the study's primary endpoints of ACR20 and Low Disease Activity (LDA) as well as key secondary endpoints. At Week 12, 64% and 66% of subjects receiving upadacitinib 15 mg (n = 221) or 30 mg QD (n = 219) achieved ACR20, respectively, compared to 36% of subjects receiving placebo (n = 221). Low disease activity, based on DAS28 (CRP), wa s achieved by 48% of subjects receiving either dose of upadacitinib, compared to 17% of subjects receiving placebo. 24 Overall, efficacy data indicate that the higher dose of upadacitinib of 30 mg QD does not provide significant incremental efficacy benefit in a csDMARD-IR RA population compared to 15 mg QD.

28,page_28,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 29 Moreover, response rates (Study M13-549) as measured by ACR20 at Week 12 from csDMARD-inadequate responders which included also subjects with prior exposure to one bDMARD, showed that, for subjects receiving either placebo or upadacitinib 15 mg (treatment arms of Study M15-557), there is no difference between the csDMARD failures without prior bDMARD exposure and those with prior exposure as defined in the Inclusion Criterion 6. 3.1 Differences Statement Study M15-557 differs from other upadacitinib studi es as it is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in the csDMARD inadequate responder population in China and selected countries including Brazil and South Korea. 3.2 Benefits and Risks Despite the availability of various RA therapies, including csDMARDs and bDMARDs, many patients still do not respond adequately to these treatments, or gradually lose response over time. Upadacitinib is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor with the ability to decrease joint inflammation and damage mediated by JAK1 signaling while having minimal inhibitory effects on JAK2 and JAK3. This could potentially minimize some of the reported safety concerns with non-selec tive JAK inhibition which are thought to be mediated by inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathways. The Phase 2 program with upadacitinib as well as preliminary data from the first Phase 3 study in RA demonstrated efficacy for improvement in signs and symptoms of RA and the safety results were consistent with those known to be associated with JAK inhibition. 13-21 Taken together, the safety and eff icacy d ata from th e Phase 2 program and the preliminary safety and efficacy d ata from the first Phase 3 study in RA support further development of upadacitinib in Phase 3 in subjects with RA."

30,page_30,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 31 The study is designed to enroll a pproximately 322 subjects at approximately 50 study centers worldwide to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations. Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled. The study duration will include a 35-day screening period; a 12-week randomized, double-blind, parallel- group, placebo c ontrolled treatment period (Period 1); an open-label 52-week extension period (Period 2); and a 30-day follow-up period (call or visit). Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups. As indicated below, it is expected that approximately 222 subjects will enter the study from China and 100 subjects from other countries including Brazil and South Korea: ●Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 161; 111 from China) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2) ●Group 2: Placebo (N = 161; 111 from China) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2) Randomization will be stratified by country and the Chinese population will be up to 80% of the total study population. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD(s) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and must remain on a stable dose until Week 24; the csDMARD dose may be decreased only for safety reasons. Subjects with prior exposure to at most one bDMARD for RA may be enrolled in the study (up to 20% of total number of subjects) after the required washout period is satisfied and if they have limited exposure to bDMARD (< 3 months) OR response to bDMARD but had to discontinue that bDMARD due to intolerability (regardless of treatment duration) (for washout periods, s ee Inclusion Criterion 7, Section 5.2.1 ).

At Week 24, if a subject fails to meet the Low Disease Activity (LDA) criterion (LDA defined as CDAI ≤ 10) the investigator should adjust the subject's background RA therapies. Starting at Week 24 (after Week 24 assessments have been performed),initiation of or change in corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or adding or increasing doses of csDMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the combination of MTX and leflunomide) is allowed as per local label. Starting at Week 24, at least 20% improvement in BOTH TJC AND SJC compared to baseline is required to remain in the study. Anyone who does not fulfill this criterion at 2 consecutive visits (starting at Week 24) (see Section 5.2.3.1 ) must be discontinued from the study. Subjects taking MTX should take oral folic acid throughout study participation. Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen will be based on the Investigator's discretion. Subjects who complete the Week 12 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the open-label 52-week extension portion of the study, Period 2.

Study Design Screening Period Within 35 days prior to the Baseline Visit, subjects will receive a full explanation of the study design and study procedures, provide a written informed consent, and undergo the screening procedures outlined in Table 3 . Lab values can be re-tested once during the screening period. If the re-tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusionary, the subject will be considered a screen failure with no additional re-screening possible. Redrawing samples if previous samples were unable to be analyzed would not count as a retest since previous result was never obtained. Subjects that initially screen fail for the study are permitte d to re-screen once following re-consent. Lab values can be re-tested once during the re-screening period. For additional re-screening, AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) approval is required. All screening procedures with the possible exceptions noted below will be"

The subject must meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the time of re-screening in order to qualify for the study. There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to re-screen for the study. If the subject had a complete initial screening evaluation including the assessment of an Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON ®Tuberculosis [TB] Gold In Tube test) and/or a purified protein derivative (PPD) test (or equivalent) (or both if required per local guidelines), or chest x-ray and electrocardiogram (ECG), these tests w ill not be required to be repeated for re-screening provided the conditions noted in Section 5.2are met, there are no changes in the subject's medical histor y that would warrant re-testing, and no more than 90 days have passed. Period 1 (12-Week Randomized, Double-Blind Treatment Period) Period 1 will begin at the Baseline Visit (Day 1) and will end at the Week 12 Visit. At the Baseline Visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study and randomized to double-blind treatment. During this period of the study, subjects will visit the study site at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. A ± 3 day window is permitted around scheduled study visits. The study drug dose taken the day prior to the Week 12 visit is considered the last dose in Period 1. Subjects who complete Period 1, but decide not to continue in Period 2 should complete a 30 day follow-up visit after the last dose of study drug. Period 2 (Open Label 52-Week Extension Period) Period 2 will begin at the Week 12 visit after all assessments have been completed. During Period 2, subjects will have a study visit at Weeks 16, 20, 24, 36, 48 and 64/PD. A ± 7 day window is permitted around scheduled study visits. At Week 24, if a subject fails to meet LDA criterion (LDA defined as CDAI ≤ 10) investigator should adjust the subject's background RA therapies.

Postmenopausal is defined as: ●Age ≥ 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause; or ●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL. If the female subject is < 55 years of age AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening. ●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential and protocol-specified contraception is required. ●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post-menopausal status, contraception is not required."
49,page_49,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 50 ●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre-menopausal status, contraception is required, and a serum pregnancy test must be performed (see Section 5.3.1.1 ""Pregnancy test""). For a female subject at any age: ●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required. ●Female subjects who are surgical sterile (defined above) are not of childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is required. A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the following highly effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study Day 1 (or earlier) through at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. ●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectab le) associated with the inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study Day 1. ●Progestogen-only hormonal contracep tion (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study Day 1. ●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation. ●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has receivedmedical confirmation of the surgical suc cess and is the only sexual partner. ●Intrauterine device (IUD). ●Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS). ●True abstinence (if acceptable per local requirements): refraining from heterosexual intercourse when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, pos t-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable)."
50,page_50,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 51 If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the highly effective birth control methods listed above (excluding true abstinence). It is important to note that contraception recommendations described above are specifically intended to prevent pregnancy during exposure to the investigational therapy upadacitinib. The concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etc.) have been prescribed per standard of care prior to study entry and are allowed to be continued during the study. Contraception should conti nue while the subject is on the concomitant csDMARD and that duration of contraception after discontinuation of the csDMARD should be based on the local label. If during the course of the study a woman becomes surgically sterile or postmenopausal (defined above) and complete documentation is available, contraceptive measures as defined above are no longer required. Contraception Recommendation for Males Based on data from animal studies (including a fertility study) there is no effect of upadacitinib on male reproduction. For a male subject who is sexually sterile (vasectomy with medical assessment confirming surgical success) OR has a female partner who is postmenopausal or permanently sterile, no contraception is required. A male subject who is sexually active with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree from Study Day 1 through 30 days after the last dose of oral study drug to practice contraception with: ●Condom use and female partner(s) using at least one of the contraceptive measures as defined in the protocol for female study subjects of childbearing potential."

If a pregnancy occurs, a partner authorization form requesting pregnancy outcome information will be requested from the pregnant partner. It is important to note that contraception and sperm donation recommendations described above are specifically intended to prevent pregnancy during exposure to the investigational therapy with upadacitinib. The concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etc.) have been prescribed per standard of care prior to study entry and are allowed to be continued during the study. Contraception should continue while the subject is on the concomitant csDMARD and that duration of contraception after discontinuation of the csDMARD should be based on the local label. 5.3 Efficacy Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Exploratory Research and Validation Studies, and Safety Assessments/Variables 5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow Chart Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are summarized in tabular format in Table 3 ."

All study data will be recorded in source documents and on the appropriate eCRFs. Informed Consent At the Screening visit, the subject will sign and date a study specific, IEC/IRB approved, informed consent form for the study (i.e., includes both Periods 1 and 2) before any study procedures are performed or any medications ar e withheld from the subject in order to participate in this study. Separate written consent will be required for each subject in order to participate in the optional exploratory research and validation studies, if not prohibited by local regulations. The separate informed consent is not required for subjects in mainland China because optional samples for exploratory research and validation studies will not be collected. Subjects can withdraw informed consent at any time.Details regarding how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.

The PPD Skin Test should be utilized only when a QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Test is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines). The site staff will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate eCRF. If a subject had a negative QuantiFERON ®-TB Gold (and/or PPD) test (or IGRA equivalent such as T-SPOT TB test) within 90 days prior to Screening and source documentation is available, the test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. These cases may be discussed with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director. The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation. Subjects with a negative QuantiFERON ®-TB Gold test (and/or negative PPD TB skin test) and chest x-ray (CXR) not suggestive of active TB or prior TB exposure may be enrolled.

In the assessment of the CXR, the Principal Investigator or their delegate must indicate the presence or absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active TB. If the CXR demonstrates changes suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic scar, apical or basilar pleural thickening) or other findings that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator should contact the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director before enrolling the subject. 12-Lead ECG A resting 12-lead ECG will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Table 3 and Table 5 . A qualified physician will interpret the clinical significance of any abnormal finding, sign, and date each ECG. ECG with QT interval corrected for heart rate using Friedericia's correction formula (QTcF) should be reported (or calculated) and documented in the source documents and later transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF if QTcF prolongation is observed. A valid QTcF cannot be calculated in subjects who have a pacemaker or supraventricular or ventricular conduction abnormalities.

Subjects can have a repeat ECG at any time during the study as warranted based on the opinion of the Investigator. Height and Weight Height will be measured at the Screening Visit only (with shoes off). Body weight will be measured at all scheduled visits except Week 1 as specified in Table 3 and Table 5 . All measurements will be recorded in metric units where applicable. Vital Signs Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in sitting position, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature will be obtained at visits specified in Table 3 and Table 5 . Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate should be performed before blood draws are performed. Physical Examination A complete physical examination will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Table 3 and Table 5 . The physical examination at the Baseline Visit will serve as the baseline physical examination for the entire study. Physical examination abnormalities noted by the Investigator at Baseline prior to the first dose of study drug will be recorded in the subject's medical history; abnormalities noted after the first dose of study drug will be evaluated and documented by the Investigator as to whether or not the abnormality is an AE (see Section 6.1.1.1 for AE definition).

It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained to perform joint assessments. If the independent assessor is not available, the pre-identified back-up assessor should perform such assessments. CDAI The CDAI calculation is required to determine if a subject fails to achieve low disease activity at the Week 24 visit. An Interactive Response Technology (IRT) will calculate CDAI with input from site personnel on jo int counts and the subject's and physician's Global Assessment of RA Disease Activity score. A worksheet will be provided to capture the components required for IRT entry to obtain the CDAI calculation. The calculation used to determine CDAI score at Week 24 is as follows: CDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PtGA (cm) + PhGA (cm) NOTE: Investigator should optimize background RA therapies in subjects who failed to achieve a CDAI ≤ 10. Pregnancy Testing A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all women of childbearing potential at the Screening Visit. The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory. If the serum pregnancy test is positive the subject is considered a screen failure. If the serum pregnancy test is borderline, it should be repeated ≥ 3 days later to determine eligibility. If the repeat serum pregnancy test is: ●Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure; ●Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial; ●Still borderline ≥ 3 days later, this will be considered documentation of continued lack of a positive result and the subject can be enrolled into the study."

The Investigator may discontinue any subject's participation for any reason, including an AE, safety concerns, lack of efficacy, or failure to comply with the protocol. See Section 6.1.7 for toxicity management criteria. Subjects will be withdrawn from the study immediately if any of the following occur: ●Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results or AEs, which rule out continuation of the study drug, as determined by the Investigator or the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director. ●Serious infections (e.g., sepsis) which cannot be adequately controlled within 2 weeks by anti-infective treatment or would put the subject at risk for continued participation in the trial as determined by the Investigator. ●The Investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject. ●The subject requests withdrawal from the study. ●Inclusion or exclusion criteria violation was noted after the subject started study drug, when continuation of the study drug would place the subject at risk as determined by the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director. ●Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages when continuation of the study drug would place the subject at ri sk, as determined by the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director. ●Subject is non-compliant with TB prophylaxis (if applicable) or develops active TB at any time during the study. ●The subject becomes pregnant while on study drug. ●Malignancy, except for localized NMSC or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. ●Subject is significantly non -compliant with study procedures which would put the subject at risk for continued participation in the trial as determined by the Investigator."

Anyone who does not fulfill this criterion at 2 consecutive visits (starting at Week 24) must be discontinued from the study. The Investigator should contact the AbbVie TA MD if a subject experiences a study drug interruption > 7 cons ecutive days during Weeks 1 through 24 or > 30 consecutive days after Week 24 (other than for reasons listed in Section 6.1.7 ) to discuss the management of the subject and possible discontinuation from participation in the study. If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation, the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks. In additio n, if subject is willing, a 30-day follow-up visit/phone call after the last dose of study drug may be completed to ensure all treatment emergent AEs/SAEs have been resolved. Subjects who discontinue the study prematurely after randomization will not be replaced. All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study drug dose and the primary reason for discontinuation of study participation. The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the Investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condi tion. Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the Investigator's best clinical judgment. Lost to Follow-Up For subjects to be considered lost to follow-up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain information on the final status of the subject. At a minimum, two phone calls must be made and one certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source documentation."

The Investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination. Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns. If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the Investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination. 5.5 Treatments 5.5.1 Treatments Administered Study drug will be taken orally once daily, beginning on Day 1 (Baseline), and should be taken at approximately the same time each day.

Each kit label will contain a unique kit number. This kit number is assigned to a subject via IRT and encodes the appropriate study drug to be dispensed at the subject's corresponding study visit. Each kit will be labeled as required per country requirements. Labels must remain affixed to the kits. All blank spaces on the label will be completed by the si te staff prior to dispensing to the subjects. 5.5.2.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drugs Upadacitinib (ABT -494) must be stored at controlled room temperature (15° to 25°C/59° to 77°F). The investigational products are for i nvestigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this study. The study drug supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and stored under the conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or destroyed on site as appropriate. 5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups All subjects will be randomized using IRT. Before the study is initiated, IRT directions will be provided to each site. All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by the IRT at the Screening Visit. For subjects that re-screen, the Screening number assigned by the IRT at the initial Screening visit should be used; a new Screening number should not be requested. Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they continue to meet all of the selection criteria (Section 5.2) at Baseline and are willing to continue in the study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using interactive response technology (IRT) to receive double-blind study drug in one of the following treatment groups.

On dosing days that occur on study visit da ys, subjects should follow the regular dosing schedule (refer to Section 5.3.2.1 regarding Week 1 and Week 2 visits). Each subject's dosing schedule should be closely monitored by the site at each study visit by careful review of the subject's dosing diary. This will ensure that all subjects enrolled into the study maintain their original dosing schedule beginning with the first dose of study drug (Baseline/Day 1). If a subject should forget to take their upadacitinib (or matching placebo) dose at their regularly scheduled dosing time, they should take the forgo tten dose as soon as they remember the dose was missed as long as it is at least 10 hours before their next scheduled dose.

All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the exception of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team), the Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment during this period. In order to maintain the blind, the upadacitinib tablets and placebo tablets provided for the study will be identical in appearance. The IRT w ill provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency. In the event of a medical situation that re quires unblinding of the study drug assignment, the Investigator is requested to contact the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director prior to breaking the blind. However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary which warrants breaking the blind prior to contacting the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director, the Investigator can directly access the IRT system to break the blind without AbbVie notification or agreement. Unblinding is available in the IRT system via the Unblind Subject transaction, which is available only to the Investigator. If the IRT system is unavailable, unblinding may occur by contacting EndPoint technical support via either phone (preferred) or email (support@endpointclinical.com). For country-specific phone numbers, please see the following website: http://www.endpointclinical.com/help-desk/. In the event that the blind is broken before notification to the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director, AbbVie requests that the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director be notified within 24 hours of the blind being broken.

The primary responsibility of th e DMC will be to protect the safety of the subjects participating in this study. A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed. Communications from the DMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments. 5.5.6 Treatment Compliance The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol. The stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol. Subject dosing will be recorded on a subject dosing diary. Subjects will be instructed to return all drug containers (even if empty) to th e study site personnel at each clinic visit. The study site personnel will document compliance in the study source documents. 5.5.7 Drug Accountability The Investigator or his/her representative will verify that study drug supplies are received intact and in the correct amounts. This will be documented by signing and dating the Proof of Receipt or similar document and by registering the arrival of drug through the"

All empty/used study drug packaging will be inventoried by the site. Empty/used study drug packaging should be returned by the subject at each visit for accountability by the site and compliance purposes and new packaging issued as necessary. Site staff will complete study drug accountability via IRT, source documents, subject dosing diaries, and by visually inspecting the packaging whenever possible. After drug accountability has been completed by the site, empty used packaging may be discarded with any subject identifiers r emoved or returned to AbbVie-designated destruction depot. Unused study drug and used packaging wi th remaining study drug will be destroyed on site according to local procedures or regulatio ns, or returned to the AbbVie-designated destruction depot (for those sites that do not meet AbbVie's requirements for on-site destruction). For sites performing on-site drug destruction or using a third party vendor for drug destruction, a copy of the destruction methodol ogy and date of destruction/date prepared for destruction should be maintained at the site's facility. Monitors will reconcile the site's processes, source documents, subject's dosing diaries, IRT or site accountability records, and destruction records to assure site compliance. 5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design 5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups This study includes two periods."
97,page_97,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 98 Period 1 is a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period to compare safety and efficacy of upadacitinib versus placebo in subjects with moderately to severelyactive RA who are on a stable dose of csDMARDs and have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. Period 1 is designed to test s uperiority of upadacitinib versus placebo for achieving the primary endpoint (ACR20) at Week 12, and other secondary efficacy parameters, all on a stable background csDMARD therapy. The purpose of Period 2 is to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD in an open-label fashion in subjects with RA who have completed Period 1. Subjects who are assigned to upadacit inib in Period 1 will continue to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD per original randomization assignment in an open-label manner. Subjects who are assigned to placebo in Period 1 will be switched to receive upadacitinib 15 mg in an open-label fashion. 5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory pro cedures will be utilized in this study. All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with RA. All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted. 5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population The intended study population is moderately to severely active RA patients who have had an inadequate response to prior csDMARD treatment. Key entry criteria are to enroll adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of RA for ≥ 3 months who also fulfill the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA. Eligible study subjects must have ≥6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and ≥ 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, and hsCRP ≥ upper limit of normal (central lab) at Screening. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD therapy (restricted to MTX, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects with"
98,page_98,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 99 inadequate response to hydroxychloroquine and/or chloroquine can only be included if they also failed (lack of efficacy) MTX, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide. 5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study This Phase 3 study will evaluate a single dos e of upadacitinib 15 mg using the once-daily tablet formulation based on the following: The dose selection in this study is based on extrapolation of pre-clinical efficacy models and analyses of PK, pharmacodynamic, safety, and efficacy data from the Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers (single and multiple ascending dose Studies M13-401 and M13-845, respectively) and Phase 2 studies in RA subjects (Studies M13-537 and M13-550). The doses selected for Study M15-557, ABT-494 15 mg QD, dosed up to 15 months, are expected to be efficacious with an acceptable safety profile. Doses of 15 mg QD using the once-daily formulation provide equivalent daily AUC and comparable C maxand C minto 6 mg BID and 12 mg BID, respectively, of the immediate- release formulation tested in Phase 2 studies in subjects with RA. In Phase 2 studies, the 6 mg BID dose was shown to achieve the near maximum efficacy and the 12 mg BID dose was clearly shown to achieve the plateau of efficacy. Results from the first Phase 3 clinical trial (Study M13-549) evaluating upadacitinib in subjects with moderate to severe RA with inadequate response to csDMARD treatment (same patient population as Study M15-557) show that, after 12 weeks of treatment, both doses of upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg) met the study's primary endpoints of ACR20 and Low Disease Activity (LDA) as well as key secondary endpoints. A higher dose of upadacitinib of 30 mg QD however did not provide significant incremental efficacy benefit in a csDMARD-IR RA population comp ared to 15 mg QD. The safety profile from this trial was consistent with that observed in the upadacitinib Phase 2 clinical trials in RA, and no new safety signals were detected. Results therefore indicate that upadacitinib 15 mg QD provides the optimal balance of efficacy and safety in RA."
99,page_99,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 100 The dose selected for Study M15-557, upadacitinib 15 mg QD, dosed up to 15 months, is therefore expected to be efficacious with an acceptable safety profile. 6.0 Complaints A Complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performan ce of a product/device after it is released for distribution. Complaints associ ated with any component of this investigational product must be reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2 ). For AEs, please refer to Section 6.1. For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2. 6.1 Medical Complaints The Investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis throughout the study. The Investigator will assess and record any AE in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the AE to study drug, and any action(s) taken. For SAEs considered as having ""no reasonable possibility"" of being associated with study drug, the Investigator will provide other cause(s) of the event. For AEs to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity. AEs, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded. All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. 6.1.1 Definitions 6.1.1.1 Adverse Event An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a"
100,page_100,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 101 causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicin al (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during the study will not be considered an AE if the surgery/procedure is being pe rformed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the c ondition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE. 6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as an SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE. Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject. Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form."

This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle). Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse For SAEs with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form. 6.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest The following AEs of special interest will be monitored during the study (see detailed toxicity management in Section 6.1.7 ): ●Serious infections;"

In the event of pregnancy occurring in the partner of an enrolled subject, written informed consent for release of medical information from the partner must be obtained prior to the collection of any pregnancy-specific information and the pregnancy will be followed to outcome. 6.1.7 Toxicity Management The toxicity management of the AEs including AEs of special interest consists of safety monitoring (review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodical/ad hoc review of safety issues by a safety data monitoring committee), interruption of study drug dosing with appropriate clinical management if applicable, and discontinuation of the subjects from the study. The management of specific AE s and laboratory parameters is described below. Serious Infections: Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with study drug. Study drug should be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection. A subject who develops a new infection dur ing treatment with study drug should undergo prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject. As appropriate, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the subject should be closely monitored. Re-challenge with study drug may occur once the infection has been successfully treated. Subjects who develop active TB must be discontinued from the study.

If the diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued. Cardiovascular Events (MACE): Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular events should be carefully monitored. These events will be reviewed and adjudicated by an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee in a blinded manner. Malignancy: Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ of the cervix must be discontinued. Information including histopathological results should be queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis. ECG Abnormality: Subjects must be discontinued for an ECG change considered clinically significant and with reasonable po ssibility of relationship to study drug OR a confirmed absolute QTcF value > 500 msec.Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities: For any given laboratory abnormality, the Investigator should assess the subject and apply the standard of care for medical evaluation and treatment following any local guidelines. Specific toxicity management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values are described in Table 8 and may require an appropriate supplemental eCRF to be completed. All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered clinically significant by the Investigator will be followed to a satisfactory resolution.

122,page_122,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 123 data from this study may not be conducted. The following general methodology will be used for the population PK and exposure-response analyses. Population PK analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to dosing. PK models w ill be bu ilt using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach with NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version). The structure of the starting PK model will be based on the PK analysis of data from previous studies. The CL/F and V/F of upadacitinib will be the PK parameters of major interest in the analyses. If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis. The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of different models. 1. The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the alternative model(s). 2. The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more randomly distributed across the line of unity (a straight line with zero intercept and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s). 3. Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters and change in inter-subject and intra-subject error. Once an appropriate base PK model (including inter- and intra-subject error structure) is developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be calculated by the posterior conditional est imation technique using non-linear mixed effects modeling. The relationship betwee n these conditional estimates CL/F and V/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory markers of hepatic of renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.05. After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of covariates"
123,page_123,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 124 from the full model will be employed to evaluate the significance (at P< 0.005, corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 7.88 for one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model. Linear or non-linear relationships of primary PK parameters with various covariates will be explored.Relationships between upadacitinib exposure and clinical observations (primary efficacy variable) will be explored. Exposure-response relationships for secondary efficacy variables and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored. The relationship between exposure (e.g., population PK model predicted average concentrations, area under the curve, trough concentrations, the individual model-predicted PK profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and drug effect will be explored. Several classes of models (e.g., linear, log-linear, exponential, E max, sigmoid E max, etc.) will be evaluated to characterize the exposure-response relationship based on observed data. Results of the PK and exposure-response analyses may be summarized in a separate report prior to regulatory filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of RA, rather than in the CSR. Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate. 8.1.7 Statistical Analysis of Biomarker Data (except for subjects in mainland China) Summary statistics for the in vivo pharmacodynamic biomarkers (including but not limited to NK, NKT, B cells, and T cells) at baseline and post-treatment time points (Weeks 8 and 12/PD in Period 1, and Weeks 16, 24, 36, 48 and 64/PD in Period 2), in addition to change from baseline at each time will be provided; this will include mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, and range for each group. The pharmacodynamic effect of each biomarker between the placebo and upadacitinib treatment groups will be evaluated via a non-linear mixed-effects mod eling approach with Change from baseline of the biomarker as response variable, Treatment, Time, and Treatment × Time interaction as fixed-effects, the corresponding baseline biomarker score as a covariate, and ""subjects nested within the treatment group"" as a random-effect. Other baseline variables such as"
124,page_124,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 125 age, weight, etc., may be considered as appropriate. For biomarkers identified to have significant overall treatment effect via the non-linear mixed effects modeling analysis, dose-response models with the biomarker as a continuous response will be explored. In addition to the above analyses of biomarkers individually, the effect of certain combination of biomarkers on the treatment groups may be explored. If the optional exploratory research variables including an additional panel of prognostic, predictive, and pharmacodynamic biomarkers are evaluated, then those data may be analyzed as follows. The association of bioma rkers to the efficacy and safety endpoints may be explored for each biomarker one at a time, and also for combinations of biomarkers via some multivariate predictive modeling algorithms. Optimal multivariate combinations of biomarkers that associate with efficacy endpoints, subject response/non-response (with respect to appropriate clinical endpoints), and also with safety endpoints may be explored via a variety of statist ical predictive modeling algorithms. Also cut-points for individual biomarkers and optimal combinations of biomarkers that differentiate the subject response with respect to efficacy/safety endpoints may be explored. The significance of these multivariate combinations of biomarkers may be assessed via at least 20 iterations of 5 fold cross-validation. 8.2 Determination of Sample Size The planned total sample size of 322 for this study provides over 90% power for a 21.7% difference in ACR20 response rate (assuming a placebo ACR20 response rate of 36.7%), at two-sided significance level of 0.05 and accounting for a 10% dropout rate. This sample size will also provide at least 90% power for most of the key secondary endpoints, including change from baseline in DAS28(CRP), ACR50 response rate, LDA and CR based on DAS28(CRP), and SF-36 PCS, at two-sided significance level of 0.05 and accounting for a 10% dropout rate."

Data from the ePRO system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's ePRO data. It will be possible for the investigator to make paper print-outs from that media. The ePRO data will be collected by the following method: Tablet Based ●The instrument/scale will be collected electronically via a tablet device into which the subject will directly enter the required pieces of information. The electronic device will be programmed to allow data entry for only the visits specified in the protocol and will not allow for subjects to complete more than one of the same assessment at any one visit. All data entered on the device will be immediately stored to the device itself and automatically uploaded to a central server administrated by CRF Health. The Investigator and delegated staff will be able to access all uploaded subject entered data via a password protected website, up until the generation, receipt and confirmation of the study archive. 11.0 Data Quality Assurance Prior to the initiation of the study, a meeting will be held with AbbVie personnel, the investigators and appropriate site personnel. This meeting will include a detailed discussion of the protocol, performance of study procedures, CRF, subject dosing diary, and specimen collection methods. The AbbVie monitor will monitor each site throughout the study. Source document review will be performed against entries on the CRF and a quality assurance check will be performed to ensure that the investigator is complying with the protocol and regulations."
131,page_131,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 132 All data hand entered in the database will be verified at AbbVie. Any discrepancies will be reviewed against the CRF and corrected on-line. After completion of the entry process, computer logic and manual checks w ill be created by AbbVie to identify items such as inconsistent study dates. Any necessa ry corrections will be made by the site to the eCRF. Computer logic and manual checks will be created to identify items such as inconsistent study dates. Any necessary correc tions will be made to the eCRF. Routine hematology, serum chemistry and serology, and urinalysis, and other tests such as rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, and HBV/HCV testing, will be conducted using a central laboratory (refer to Table 2 and Table 4). The data from these analyses will be electronically transferred from the central laboratory to the study database. Laboratory tests including, but not limited to, urine pregnancy testing and ESR, will be conducted locally by each study site (refer to Table 3 and Table 5 ). Sites will provide AbbVie with laboratory certifications and normal ranges for each local laboratory used. The full name, address, phone number and fax number for each local laboratory will also be included. 12.0 Use of Information Any research that may be done using exploratory research/validation studies samples from this study will be experimental in nature and the results will not be suitable for clinical decision making or patient management. Hence, the subject will not be informed of individual results, should analyses be performe d, nor will anyone not directly involved in this research. Correspondingly, researchers will have no access to subject identifiers. Individual results will not be reported to anyone not directly involved in this research other than for regulatory purposes. Aggregate data from exploratory research/validation studies may be provided to investigators and us ed in scientific publications or presented at medical conventions. Optional exploratory research/validation studies information will be published or presented only in a way that does not identify any individual subject."

Continuation of this study beyond this date must be mutually agreed upon in writing by both the Investigator and AbbVie. The investigator will provide a final report to the IEC/IRB following conclusion of the study, a nd will forward a copy of this report to AbbVie or their representative. The Investigator must retain any records related to the study according to local requirements. If the Investigator is not able to retain the records, he/she must notify AbbVie to arrange alternative archiving options. AbbVie will select the signatory Investigator from the Investigators who participate in the study. Selection criteria for this Investigator will include level of participation as well as significant knowledge of the clinical research, investigational drug, and study protocol. The signatory Investigator for the study will review and sign the final study report in accordance with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products Guidance on Investigator's Signature for Study Reports.

Local Requirements Korea Section 5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations Contraception Recommendation for Females A woman who is postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy) is not considered to be a woman of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations. Postmenopausal is defined as: ●Age ≥ 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause; or ●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL. If the female subject is < 55 years of age AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening. ●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed th at the subject is of childbearing potential and protocol-specified contraception is required. ●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post-menopausal status, contraception is not required. ●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre-menopausal status, contraception is required, and a serum pregnancy test must be performed (see Section 5.3.1.1 ""Pregnancy test""). For a female subject at any age: ●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required."
174,page_174,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 175 ●Female subjects who are surgical sterile (defined above) are not of childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is required. A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the following highly effective met hods of birth control that is effective from Study Day 1 (or earlier) through at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. ●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) associated with the inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study Day 1. ●Progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1. ●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation. ●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant. ●Intrauterine device (IUD). ●Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS). If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the highly effective birth control methods listed above. It is important to note that contraception recommendations described above are specifically intended to prevent pregnancy during exposure to the investigational therapy upadacitinib. The concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etc.) have been prescribed per standard of care prior to study entry and are allowed to be continued during the study.

Contraception Recommendation for Males For a male subject who has a female partner who is postmenopausal or permanently sterile, no contraception is required. A male subject who is sexually active with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree from Study Day 1 through 30 days after the last dose of study drug to practice contraception with: ●Condom use and female partner(s) using at least one of the contraceptive measures as defined in the protocol for female study subjects of childbearing potential. Additionally, male subjects must agree not to donate sperm from Study Day 1 through 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Male subjects are responsible for informing his partner(s) of the risk of becoming pregnant and for reporting any pregnancy to the study doctor. If a pregnancy occurs, a partner authorization form requesting pregnancy outcome information will be requested from the pregnant partner. As described above, contraception should continue while the subject is on the concomitant csDMARD and that duration of contraception after discontinuation of the csDMARD should be based on the local label."

To compare the efficacy of upadacitinib versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of subjects from China and selected countries including Brazil and South Korea with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are on a stable dose of conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. 2. To compare the safety and tolerability of upadacitinib versus placebo in subjects from China and selected countries including Brazil and South Korea with moderately to severely active RA who are on a stable dose of csDMARDs and have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. Period 2 To evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib in subjects from China and selected countries including Brazil and South Korea with RA who have completed Period 1. Investigators: Multicenter Study Sites: Approximately 50 Study Population: Adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of RA for ≥ 3 months who also fulfill the 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for RA. Eligible study subjects must have ≥ 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and ≥ 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, and high-sensitiv ity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) ≥ upper limit of normal (central lab) at Screening. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD therapy (restricted to methotrexate [MTX], chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects with inadequate response to hydroxychloroquine and/or chloroquine can only be included if they also have failed (lack of efficacy or intolerability) MTX, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide.

177,page_177,"Upadacitinib M15-557 Protocol Amendment 3 178 Methodology: This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods. Period 1 is a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period designed to compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of subjects with moderately to severely active RA who are on a stable dose of csDMARDs and have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. Period 2 is an open-label 52 week extension period to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib in subjects with RA who have completed Period 1. The study duration will include a 35-day screeni ng period; a 12-week randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled treatment period (Period 1); an open-label 52 week extension period; and a 30-day follow-up period. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups. As indicated below, it is expected that approximately 222 subjects will enter the study from China and 100 subjects from other countries including Brazil and South Korea: !Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 161; 111 from China) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2) !Group 2: Placebo (N = 161; 111 from China) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2) Randomization will be stratified by country and the Chinese population will be up to 80% of the total study population. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD(s) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and must remain on a stable dose until Week 24; the csDMARD dose may be decreased only for safety reasons. At Week 24, if a subject fails to meet the Low Disease Activity (LDA) criterion (LDA defined as CDAI ≤ 10), the investigator should adjust the subject's background RA therapies after assessments for Week 24 have been completed. Starting at Week 24 (after Week 24 assessments have been performed), initiation of or change in corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inf lammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or csDMARDs (restricted to oral or parenteral MTX, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine and leflunomide, and restricted to concomitant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the combination of MTX and leflunomide) is allowed as per local label. For RA flare treatment, no more than 3 consecutive days of systemic corticosteroids (maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or its equivalent) is allowed, after which subject should resume their usual daily oral corticosteroid dose. Subjects taking MTX should take oral folic acid throughout study participation. Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen will be based on the Investigator's discretion. Starting at Week 24, at least 20% improvement in BOTH TJC AND SJC is required to remain on study drug. Anyone who does not fulfill this criterion at 2 consecutive visits (starting at Week 24) (see Section 5.2.3.1) must be discon tinued from study drug treatment. Subjects who complete the Week 12 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the 52 week extension portion of the study, Period 2. Subjects who are assigned to upadacitinib treatment in Period 1 will continue to receive upadacitinib in an open-label manner. Subjects who are assigned to placebo in Period 1 will be switched to receive upadacitinib from Week 12 onwards. The primary analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 1 (Week 12) or have prematurely discontinued prior to Week 12. Study sites and subjects will remain blinded to the treatment assignment in Period 1 for the duration of the study."

Period 1 is a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period designed to compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of subjects with moderately to severely active RA who are on a stable dose of csDMARDs and have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. Period 2 is an open-label 52 week extension period to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib in subjects with RA who have completed Period 1. The study duration will include a 35-day screeni ng period; a 12-week randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled treatment period (Period 1); an open-label 52 week extension period; and a 30-day follow-up period. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups. As indicated below, it is expected that approximately 222 subjects will enter the study from China and 100 subjects from other countries including Brazil and South Korea: !Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 161; 111 from China) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2) !Group 2: Placebo (N = 161; 111 from China) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2) Randomization will be stratified by country and the Chinese population will be up to 80% of the total study population. Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD(s) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and must remain on a stable dose until Week 24; the csDMARD dose may be decreased only for safety reasons. Subjects with prior exposure to at most one bi ologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) for RA may be enrolled in the study (up to 20% of total number of subjects) after the required washout period is satisfied and if they have limited exposure (< 3 months) OR response to bDMARD but had to discontinue that bDMARD due to intolerability (regardless of treatment duration). Subjects who are considered bDMARD inadequate responders (lack of efficacy), as determined by the Investigator, are not eligible. At Week 24, if a subject fails to meet the Low Disease Activity (LDA) criterion (LDA defined as CDAI ≤ 10), the investigator should adjust the subject's background RA therapies after assessments for Week 24 have been completed. Starting at Week 24 (after Week 24 assessments have been performed), initiation of or change in corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen/paracetamol, low potency analgesics, or csDMARDs (restricted to oral or parenteral MTX, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine and leflunomide, and restricted to concomitant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the combination of MTX and leflunomide) is allowed as per local label. For RA flare treatment, no more than 3 consecutive days of systemic corticosteroids (maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or its equivalent) is allowed, after which subject should resume their usual daily oral corticosteroid dose.
