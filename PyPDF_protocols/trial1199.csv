PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS FO R STUDY 204697 Rationale Prosta te cancer is the most frequentl y diagnosed cancer among men and the second - leading cause of cancer -related death in men. As the growth of prostate cancer is dependent on androgens (mediated through androgen receptor), the primary target of treatment has be en focused on depleting or blocking androgen activity . While many cases of prostate cancer can be treated definitively with a multi -modal approach of surgery , radiation, and/or hormonal manipulation, metastatic prostate cancer remains an incurable disease. The next generation hormonal agents (e.g., abiraterone and enzalutamide), immunotherapy (e.g., sipuleucel -T), and novel chemotherapeutics (e.g., cabazitaxel) have increased the overall survival (OS) of patients with this disease. However, for individuals whose tumors no longer respond to hormonal manipulation (also known as metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer [mCRPC]), current approaches are palliative. The androgen receptor (AR) is a constitutively -expressed transcription factor in cells of the prostate, and upregulates gene expression to control cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The AR is activated b y binding to androgens, a class of steroidal molecules that includes testosterone. Androgen -deprivation therap y (ADT) remains the cornerstone of prostate cancer therap y, even upon the emergence of resistance to primary androgen deprivation achieved b y super stimulation with a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist like goserelin. In this context, direct antagonism of AR (e.g. , by enzalutamide) and/or inhibition of steroid hormone sy nthesis (e.g., by abiraterone) has been demonstrated to provide clinical benefit upon the failure of primary ADT. Despite the success of the next -generation AR -targeted therapies, inherent or acquir ed resistance remains a major clinical challenge in mCRPC. I mportantly , genomic anal ysis identified high frequency of AR pathway alterations in advanced mCRPC patients [ Robinson , 2015], implicating strong dependency on AR signalling, and the continued need for alternate forms of AR inhibition. Recent studies have shown an alternate mode of AR inhibition by targeting a new class of proteins known as bromodomain and extraterminal domains (BET). Studies have demonstrate d that BET inhibition can lead to growth arrest and cell death in a variet y of preclinical models, including models of CRPC. The first-in-human (FIH) study from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), BET115521, evaluated the safet y and preliminary efficacy of single -agent GSK525762, a potent inhibitor of BET proteins, in a number of tumor ty pes including mCRPC. Preliminary data from the futility anal ysis of the CRPC arm indicated there were no partial or complete responses. This data will be further examined as the data co ntinues to mature. The study (204697) proposes to evaluate the combination of GSK525762 with other agents that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of CRPC or metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), including approved agents (e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide et c) as well as investigational agents for mCRPC that have proven to show efficacy and can be combined based on complimentary mechanism of action (immunotherapy like anti - PD1/anti -PD-L1, poly-ADP ribose poly merase (PARP) inhibitors like oleparib/talazoparib or Phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI 3K)/Protein kinase B (AkT)"

As a first step, this study will evaluate the combination of GSK525762 with new generation ADT agents, combining with either abiraterone or enzalutamide, based on the hy pothes is that GSK525762, by inhibiting transcription overdrive, can overcome resistance to secondary ADT. This study will evaluate the safety and clinical activit y in subjects who have progressed after treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, either as first line treatment (subjects treated in this study will be considered mCRPC L ine 2 [L 2, having failed first line treatment with or without one prior line of chemotherapy ]) or on re -treatment after failure of multiple lines of therap y including prior ADT/prior chemotherap y/prior radiation therapy (subjects treated in this study will be considered mCRPC L ine X [L x]). Both populations will be included in both dose escalation and dose expansion; however, assignment during dose expansion will use forced randomizatio n.

16,page_16,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 17Overall Design This stud y is a two-arm, open -label Phase Ibdose escalation and dose expansion cohort study with oral administration of GSK525762 in combination with either abiraterone (Arm A) or enzalutamide (Arm B) in subjects with mCRPC in whom at least one line of treatment w ith abiraterone or enzalutamide has failed. This study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic, and efficacy profiles. Arm A is designed to determine the MTD and RP2D of GSK525762 when given in combination with abiraterone, based upon safet y and clinical response profiles. Arm B is designed to determine the MTD and RP2D of GSK525762 when given in combination with enzalutamide, based upon safety and clinical response profiles. During dose escalation, both treatment arms will follow a modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) design. The design assumes (i) approximately 3 to 6 subjects per dose cohort will complete the dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluati on period and (ii) the true underly ing toxicity rate for GSK525762 in combination with either abiraterone or enzalutamide falls within the range from 25% to 35% and centered at 30%. Subjects included in the study must have progressed, despite previous trea tment with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide (L2 or L x). Subjects will be enrolled based upon their more recent prior treatment (e.g. subjects who were most recently treated with abiraterone will be enrolled into Arm A, and subjects most recentl y treated wit h enzalutamide will be enrolled into Arm B). Because of the concern for potential drug -drug interactions (DDI) between GSK525762 and both abiraterone and enzalutamide, there will be extensive PK sampling, to specificall y address the DDI effects with these drugs. Specificall y, enzalutamide is a known cy tochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inducer, and DDI could potentiall y lower the exposure of GSK525762 levels. Also, GSK525762 is a moderate CYP3A inducer and could potentially lower the exposure of abiraterone, which is a substrate of CYP3A. Therefore, emerging PK data will be used to assist with dose escalation decisions, the decision for MTD and RP2D. A comparison of primary endpoint will be performed between the investigational arms if data warrant. Efficacy data wil l be collected from all subjects. All evaluable subjects treated during dose escalation and in the dose expansion cohorts will be incorporated into the final anal ysis. The totality of data, including safety /tolerability , PK, PD, and efficacy , will be used to determine RP2D. During dose expansion, the study will employ a Bay esian predictive adaptive design that allows the trial to be monitored more frequentl y at multiple stages. Bayesian statistics will be employ ed to calculate the expected utility of the do se (dU) is greater than the clinically significant minimum utility (CSMU) at interim anal ysis for each dose. T he interim analy sis will be conducted for each individual dose and it may be conducted when at least 10 evaluable subjects are available for a giv en dose. After the first interim analysis, the interim analy sis can be conducted after every 10 additional subjects become evaluable."
17,page_17,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 18For the separate interim looks in each combination in expansion cohort, the enrollment for that cohort may be stopped due to futility if the posterior probability that the utility (dU) ≥CSMU ( 25) is small (e.g., less than a 4% chance for the utility to be larger than the CSMU). Decisions made to stop enrolment in any cohort will be based on the totality of the data, includin g safety/tolerability and efficacy . Arm A In Arm A, eligible subjects with m CRPC will be enrolled into two dosing level cohorts to determine the MTDs (and RP2D) of GSK525762 when administered in combination with abiraterone. Eligible subjects include those that are abiraterone -refractory or resistant (including L2 and L x), but the most recent treatment before enrolment into Arm A must be abiraterone (Figure 1). During dose escalation, eligible subjects will be dose d in at least two dose levels to identify the two dose level cohorts to explore in dose expansion. T he approved dose of abiraterone (1000 mg) will be used for all GSK525762 dose level exploration . The initial GSK525762 dose level will be dose level 60 mg(DL60) , which is one dose level lower than the single -agent RP2D. If DL60 does not exceed the MTD, DL80 (GSK525762 given 80 mg QD) will be opened ( Figure 1). If any dose level cohort is opened, but exceeds the maxim um permitted toxicity rate, then additional subjects will not be enrolled at that dose level. Due to emerging data (safety /tolerability /efficacy ), additional dose levels may be explored. These dose levels may either be a lower daily dose level or an inte rmittent dose schedule , either at a dose level where dail y treatment may be intolerable or at a lower dose. For example, if DL60 exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then intermittent dosing at 60 mg dose level (DL60 ALT) and/or a lower daily dose level (DL - 1, 40 mg) may be evaluated. To further explore and identify the MTDs (and RP2Ds), the two most tolerable dose levels may be initiated and randomized by prior lines of therap y (L2 or L x). A total of 30 subjects each may be enrolled into both co horts, and approximately 10 enrolled subjects will be L 2 and 20 subjects will be L x (Figure 1).If only one dose level is tolerable for dose expansion, subjects will be enrolled and not randomized."
18,page_18,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 19Figure 1 Study Schematic Arm B In Arm B, eligible subjects with mCRPC will be enrolled into dosing level cohorts to determine the MTDs (and RP2D) of GSK525762 when administered in combination with enzalutamide. Eligible subjects include those that are enzalutamide -refractory or resistant from second line as well as third line and above (including L2 or L x), but the most recent treatment before enrolment into Arm B must be enzalutamide (Figure 2). Eligible subjects will be administered escalating doses of GSK525762 in combination with the approved dose of enzalutamide (160 mg) . As enzalutamide is a known CYP3A4 inducer, DDI could potentially lower the exposure of GSK525762 active moiety levels by 20%. There fore, subjects will be enrolled at DL80 as the starting dose. During dose escalation, eligible subjects will be dosed in at least two dose levels to identify the two dose level cohorts to explore in dose expansion. The initial GSK525762 dose level will be dose level 80 mg ( DL80) , which is equivalent to one dose level lower than the single -agent RP2D due to expected DDI . If DL80 does not exceed the MTD, DL100 (GSK525762 given 100 mgQD) will be opened ( Figure 2). Ifany dose level cohort is opened, but exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then additional subjects will not be enrolled at that dose level. Due to emerging data (safety /tolerability /efficacy ), additional dose levels may be explored. These dose le vels may either be a lower daily dose lev el or an intermittent dose"
19,page_19,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 20schedule , either at a dose level where dail y treatment may be intolerable or at a lower dose. For example, if DL80exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then intermittent dosing at 80 mg dose level (DL80 ALT) and/or a lower daily dose level (DL - 1, 60mg) may be evaluated. Based on PK anal ysis from DL 80 and DL100 dose escalation cohorts, if the exposure to GSK525762 active moiety is 40% lower than its single agent exposure (determined from GSK525762 80 mg cohort in BET115521 stud y), DL120 may be opened. The study team will carefull y review PK and safet y data from the DL 80 and DL100 levels to determine if it is acceptable to open the DL120 dose level. If DL120 is opened, subjects in DL 120 will begin dosing with GSK525762 at 120 mg and the approved dose of enzalutamide. To further explore and identify the MTDs (and RP2Ds), the two most tolerable dose levels may be initiated and randomized by prior lines of therap y (L2 or L x). A total of 30 subjects each may be enrolled into both cohorts, and approximately 10 enrolled subjects will be L 2 and 20 subjects will be L x (Figure 2).If only one dose level is tolerable for dose expansion, subjects will be e nrolled and not randomized. Figure 2 Study Schematic Treatment A rms and Duration All subjects will receive GSK525762 in combination with either abiraterone or enzalutamide . Subjects will begin combination therap y and continue u ntil unacceptable toxicity , progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, death, or completion of study ."
20,page_20,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 21The total duration of study will depend on recruitment rates, withdrawals due to toxicity or progression or death, and, with an approximate duration o f 2-3 years. For subjects receiving GSK525762 in combination with abiraterone, dail y administration of combination therap y (GSK525762 plus abiraterone) will commence immediately (Day 1) for abiraterone -failed subjects who are still on abiraterone (i.e., no t stopped abiraterone dosing at progression and during screening). However, if these subjects are off abiraterone treatment for more than 3 day s at the time of assignment to a cohort, there would be a lead in period for at least 7 day s of abiraterone (Day -7 to Day 0) before the start of combination treatment (GSK525762 plus abiraterone on Day 1). The lead -in dosing will ensure that abiraterone is at stead y state upon initiation of GSK525762 treatment. For subjects receiving GSK525762 in combination with e nzalutamide, daily administration of combination therap y (GSK525762 plus enzalutamide) will commence immediately (Day 1) for enzalutamide -failed subjects who are still on enzalutamide (i.e. not stopped enzalutamide dosing at progression and during screenin g). However, if these subjects are off enzalutamide treatment for more than 7 day s at the time of assignment to a cohort, there would be a lead in period for at least 28 day s of enzalutamide (Day -28 to Day 0) before the start of combination treatment (GSK 525762 and enzalutamide ). There will be a 14 day lead in period if enzalutamide (Day -14 to Day 0) interruption was less than or equal to 7 day s prior to start of combination treatment (Day 1). The lead -in dosing will ensure that enzalutamide is at steady state upon initiation of GSK525762 treatment. Based upon emerging data, additional subjects may be enrolled above, at, or below the combination doses mentioned previousl y, in order to collect additional safety and PK data. Initial dosing will maintain a f ixed dose of abiraterone (1000 mg dail y) or enzalutamide (160 mg daily ). GSK525762 as a single agent was investigated at the highest dose of 80mg (amorphous tablet)/ 75 mg (bes ylate tablet) once dail y (Recommended Phase 2 Dose, RP2D) in the expansion coho rts of the first time in human solid tumor study (BET115521). Doses beyond the single -agent RP2D may be explored if the drug is tolerated and PK anal ysis demonstrates reduced GSK525762 exposure (Area under concentration -time curve [AUC] and/or maximum obse rved concentration [Cmax]) when administered in combination with enzalutamide. Dose reductions for individual subjects may be required, based on toxicity observed during the study , and the frequency and duration of dose reductions will be reported. If enza lutamide is discontinued for more than or equal to 7 day s, then the maximum dose of GSK525762 should be the single agent RP2D of 80 mg. If enzalutamide is re -started, GSK525762 should remain at 80 mg until after at least 14 days until the dose is escalated , if applicable. Subjects who require permanent discontinuation of either abiraterone or enzalutamide in the combination may continue GSK525762 as a single agent if there is evidence of continuing benefit on treatment. If GSK525762 is continued as a single agent, the maximum dose would be 80mg. Intra -subject dose escalations from the planned starting dose during dose escalation will not be permitted. I ntra-subject dose escalation may be permitted during dose expansion if for the lower dose level only if th at dose is determined to be futile."
21,page_21,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 22Based on emerging information collected from PK, PD and safet y/tolerability data, other dosing regimens (such asintermittent dosing for GSK525762 or staggered dosing of the two drugs) may be explored during the stud y. The decision of which dose combination to identify as the RP2D from either arm will be based on the totality of data, including safet y/tolerability , PK, and an y preliminary efficacy data generated from the study . The study will be considered completed fo r purposes of a final anal ysis when 70% of all the subjects enrolled have progressed or died. Survival follow -up will continue until this 70% event is met. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given for the post -study care of the subject’s medical condition. Type and Number of Subjects Approximately 130 subjects worldwide may be enrolled in the study as a whole. In France, approximately 28 subjects are to be enrolled. During dose escalation, subjects with a histologicall y-confirmed diagnosis of mCRPC will be treated in escalating dose level cohorts until the DL MTD(s) is /areestablished. The total number of subjects required will depend upon the number of escalation steps required to identify the MTD(s). Once safe DL(s) a re identified, the dose expansion phase will open and subjects with a histologically -confirmed diagnosis of CRPC will be randomized based on prior lines of therap y (L2 or L x). For both Arms, each dose level cohort may enroll or randomize up to 30 subjects. Subjects from both dose escalation and dose expansion may be combined to reach 30 subjects.

The clinical activity primary response rate will be defined as the rate of subjects achieving PSA reduction from ba seline ≥50% at 12 weeks or thereafter In assessing clinical activity which demonstrates an initial clinically meaningful response rate, this is defined as follows: A response rate of 30% at 12 weeks or later, relative to a 10% response rate suggesting no activity . This will be conducted by testing the null hy pothesis that P0<=0.1 versus the alternative that P1 ≥ 0.3, assuming the maximum response rate for an ineffective drug is 10% and the minimum response rate for an effective drug is 30%. These h ypothes es are based on observations from a meta -analysis study in subjects who had received prior ADT both in chemo -naïve and prior chemotherap y setting. Chemo - naïve subjects treated with a second ADT (L2 subjects) had rates of ≥50% PSA decline ranging from 25.5% to 36%. Subjects treated with both prior ADT and chemotherap y (Lx subjects) had variable responses of ≥50% PSA decrease which ranged from 4% to 26% in studies with larger subject populations (>30 subjects per study ).Based on these findings, and consider ing a mixed population (L 2 plus L x) in both arms of the study , it is hypothesized that a response rate ≤10% would indicate no benefit for the combination of ADT failure, while a response rate of ≥30% in patients who just progressed on prior ADT will indica te there is a benefit that can be further explored. In addition to the primary endpoint, the efficacy of each combination cohort will be evaluated based on the totality of all efficacy endpoints (primary and secondary ).The following secondary efficacy endpoints will also be considered for drawing conclusions on the clinical activity of the combination(s): Disease control rate (DCR) at 24 weeks CRR based on the following –a) response based on PCWG3 -modified RECI ST 1.1, b) PSA decrease of ≥50% at week 12 or thereafter, or c) CTC count conversion ORR defined as CR and PR rate per PCWG3 -modified RECI ST 1.1 CTC response rate defined as percent of s ubjects having favorable CTC <5/7.5mL at nadir if baseline is or conversion of unfavorable CTC ≥5/7.5mL PSA week 4 response rate defined as percent of subjects achieving ≥30% decrease from baseline PSA at 4 weeks Time to disease progression according to P CWG3 criteria (either b y PCWG3 - modified RECI ST 1.1 or progression in bone or PSA progression with accompany ing progression b y RECI ST 1.1 or bone scan or clinical progression) Radiological PFS per PCWG3 -modified RECI ST 1.1 Amendment 04 applies to all globa l study sites.

INTRODUCTION GSK525762 is a novel inhibitor of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein s currentl y under investigation to treat a number of human malignancies. Enzalutamide and abiraterone are next generation androgen receptor (AR) signalling targeted therapies that have been demonstrated to provide clinical benefit upon the failure of andro gen- deprivation therap y (ADT). Pre -clinically , combined inhibition of BET and AR results in improved effects on tumor cell growth compared to single agent therap y in a subset of prostate cancer models. The current protocol (study 204697) aims to test the s afety, tolerability , PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of this combination when administered concomitantly to human subjects with castrate -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). 2.1. Stud y Rationale In the United States, prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men, affecting an estimated one out of every seven males during their lifetime [ SEER , 2015]. While many cases of prostate cancer can be treated definitively with a multi -modal approach of surgery , radiation, and/or hormo nal manipulation, metastatic prostate cancer remains incurable as patients with this disease become resistant to ADT as well as next generation AR-targeted therapies. Importantly , AR reactivation is one of the top resistance mechanisms in majority of these mCRPC patients, indicating the continued dependency on AR signalling. Recent studies have shown an alternate mode of AR inhibition by targeting a new class of proteins known as BET. These proteins bind to chromatin and regulate gene expression, and precli nical data suggest that combination with next generation AR -therapies may provide therapeutic benefit. The current protocol ( 204697 ) proposes to evaluate the combination of the BET inhibitor GSK525762 with second - generation AR -targeted agents such as enzal utamide or abiraterone in men with metastatic or advanced CRPC who have progressed on at least one line of prior AR - targeted therap y. 2.2. Brief Background Prostate cancer is the most frequentl y diagnosed cancer among men and the second - leading cause of cancer -related death in men [ American Cancer Society , 2013 ]. Over the past decades, the primary target of treatment has been focused on depleting or blocking androgen activity as the growth of prostate cancer is dependent on androgens. Hormonal therap y includes surgical castration, use of gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, AR antagonists, ketoconazole and estrogenic compounds. Despite earl y sensitivity to hormonall y directed therapies and while ma intaining castrate levels of serum testosterone, these tumors often eventuall y progress as CRPC. Once metastatic CPRC (mCRPC) develops, the mean survival time in these patients is approximately 16 to 18 months, indicating the need for novel therapeutic age nts [Karantanos , 2013 ]. The AR is a constitutively -expressed transcription factor in cells of the prostate, and upregulates gene expression to control cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation [Ferraldeschi , 2015; Watson , 2015] .The AR is activated by binding to androgens, a class of steroidal molecules that includes testosterone. Untreated prostate cancer is dependent upon an drogen at least initially for its continued growth. Most androgen production"
30,page_30,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 31occurs in the testes (90 -95%), but the adrenal glands also produce a small fraction of circulating androgens. Thus, over the past decades, ADT remains the cornerstone of prostate cancer therap y, even upon the emergence of castration resistance to primary androgen deprivation achieved b y super stimulation with a GnRH agonist like goserelin. Importantly , AR signaling axis frequentl y remains active despite castration therap y in CRPC, as is clinically evident by the rise in prostate -specific antigen (PSA) and hypersensitivity to even low levels of residual androgens, suggesting that continued treatment directed at the AR signaling axis may provide benefit. In this context, direct antago nism of AR (e.g., by enzalutamide) and/or inhibition of steroid hormone sy nthesis (e.g., b y abiraterone) has been demonstrated to provide clinical benefit upon the failure of primary ADT. Enzalutamide (Xtandi) is an orall y bioavailable, AR signalling inhi bitor approved in the United States (US) and the European Union for the treatment of patients with mCRPC who have previously received treatment with docetaxel, and pre -chemotherap y in the US with mCRPC [ Xtandi , 2015]. Enzalutamide acts on several steps in the AR signaling pathway , including competitive inhibition of androgen binding to ARs and inhibition of AR nuclear translocation and its interaction with deox yribonucleic acid (DNA). Abiraterone (Zy tiga) is an inhibit or of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 17A1 that acts by blocking production of multiple steroid hormones, including alternative androgens that are produced in various tissues and are responsible for ADT resistance [ Zytiga, 2015 ]. Its mechanism of action (MoA) is indirect, and does not interact directl y with AR, but reduces levels of circulating androgen. This indirect MoA means that it cannot be studied in a cell culture model, but the effects in humans on androgen production re sults in the same effects as enzalutamide; down -regulation of AR signaling and clinical response in this AR -driven tumor ty pe. Despite the success of these next -generation AR -targeted therapies, inherent or acquired resistance remains a major clinical cha llenge in mCRPC. I mportantl y, integrative genomic anal ysis identified a potentiall y actionable somatic or germline event in 90% of mCRPC affected individuals, including 63% with aberrations in AR [ Robinson , 2015]. The high frequency of AR pathway alterations in these advanced mCRPC patients imply the strong dependency on AR signaling, and the continued need for alternate forms of AR inhibition. I n addition to AR, alterations were observed in important pathway s includ ing PI3K (49%), wingless -type MMTV integration site family member (Wnt) (18%), cell cycle (21%) and DNA repair (13%) [ Robinson , 2015], suggesting the importance of combinational strategies to suppress various resist ance mechanisms in mCRPC, simultaneously . There are no large clinical trials assessing the efficacy of abiraterone in patients who have previously been treated with enzalutamide and vice versa. Retrospective analy ses suggest that although abiraterone has s ome activit y in this setting, it is limited compared with patients who have not been treated with enzalutamide [ Loriot, 2013; Noonan , 2013]. Conversel y, enzalutamide appears to r etain some activity in patients who have been previously treated with abiraterone. Recent studies have shown an alternate mode of AR inhibition by targeting a new class of proteins known as BET [ Wyce, 2013]. The BET fa mily, comprised of bromodomain 2 (BRD), BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT, recognize acetyl groups on the tails of histones and are critical for recruiting transcriptional machinery necessary for gene expression. BRD4 has"
31,page_31,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 32been shown to interact with AR, and BET inhibiti on abrogated BRD4 localization to a subset of AR target loci and reduced AR -mediated gene transcription, causing suppression of AR signaling [ Assangani , 2014]. Studies have demonstrated that BET inhibition can lead to growth arrest and cell death in a variet y of preclinical models, including models of CRPC [ Wyce, 2013]. The first-in-human (FIH) stud y from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), BET115521, evaluated the safet y and preliminary effi cacy of single -agent GSK525762, a potent inhibitor of BET proteins, in a number of tumor ty pes including mCRPC. Preliminary data from the futility anal ysis of the CRPC arm indicated there were no partial or complete responses. This data will be further exa mined as the data continues to mature. Preliminary safet y and efficacy data is summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N113741_0 7, 2018 ]. This study (204697) propose s to evaluate the combination of GSK525762 with other agents that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of CRPC or mCRPC), including approved agents (e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide) as well as investigational agents for mCRPC that have proven to show efficacy and can be combined based on complimentary mechanism of action (immunotherapy like anti -PD1/anti -PD-L1, PARP (poly -ADP ribose pol ymerase) inhibitors like oleparib/talazoparib or PIK3/AkT pathway inhibitors). As a first step, this study will evaluate the combination of GSK525762 with the new generation ADT agents, combining with either abiraterone or enzalutamide, based on the h ypothesis that GSK525762, by inhibiting transcription overdrive, can overcom e resistance to secondary ADT. As descri bed above, preclinical data suggest that BET proteins act in complex with AR at transcriptional level to mediate androgen signalling. Co -treatment with anti -androgens and BET inhibitors results in significantl y improved tumor growth inhibition compared to single agent therap y in a subset of CRPC models tested (VCAP xenograft model, [Assangani , 2016]. One of the major resistance mechanisms against second generation AR-targeted therapies is the development of AR alter ations including mutations and splice variants (e.g.AR -Vs). I mportantly , AR -V levels were also down -regulated by another small molecule BET inhibitor JQ1 alone or in combination with enzalutamide [Chan , 2015; Assangani , 2016]. Therefore, combining BET with either abiraterone or enzalutamide gives an opportunity for vertical AR inhibition at the receptor as well as transcriptional level, offering a mechanism b y whi ch resistance ma y be overcome. This study will evaluate the safet y and clinical activity in subjects who have progressed after treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, either as first line treatment (subjects treated in this study will be considered mCRPC Line 2 (L2, having failed first line treatment with or without one prior line of chemotherap y) or on re -treatment after failure of multiple lines of therapy including prior ADT/prior chemotherap y/prior radiation therap y (subjects treated in this study will be consider ed mCRPC L ine X (L x)). Both populations will be included in both dose escalation and dose expansion; however, assignment during dose expansion will use forced randomization."

STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design This study isa two-arm, open -label Phase Ibdose escalation and dose expansion cohort study with oral administration of GSK525762 in combination with either abiraterone (Arm A) or enzalutamide (Arm B) in male subjects with mCRPC in whom at least one line of treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide has failed. This study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D based on safet y, tolerabilit y, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy profiles. Arm A is designed to determine the MTD and RP2D of GSK525762 when given in combination with abiraterone, based upon safet y and clinical response profiles. Arm B is designed to determine the MTD and RP2D of GSK525762 when given in combination with enzalutamide, based upon safet y and clinical response profiles. During dose escalation, both treatment arms will follow a modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI ) design [Ji, 2013]. The design assumes (i) approximately 3 to 6 subjects per dose cohort will complete the dose -limiting tox icity (DLT) evaluation period and (ii) the true underl ying"
34,page_34,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 35toxicity rate for GSK525762 in combination with either abiraterone or enzalutamide falls within the range from 25% to 35% and centered at 30%. Subjects included in the study must have progressed, d espite previous treatment with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide (L2 or L x). Subjects will be enrolled based upon their most recent prior treatment (e.g. subjects who were most recentl y treated with abiraterone will be enrolled into Arm A, and subjects most recently treated with enzalutamide will be enrolled into Arm B). Because of the concern for potential drug -drug interactions (DDI) between GSK525762 and both abiraterone and enzalutamide, there will be extensive PK sampling as noted in Section 7.1, to specifically address the DDI effects with these drugs. Specifically , enzalutamide is a known CYP3A4 inducer, and DDI could potentially lower the exposure to GSK525762. Also, GSK525762 is a moderate CYP3A inducer an d could potentially lower the exposure of abiraterone, which is a substrate of CYP3A. Therefore, emerging PK data will be used to assist with dose decisions for MTD and RP2D. The co -primary endpoints will evaluate both safety and clinical activit y of each treatment combination. The primary clinical activity outcome will be defined b y the rate of ≥50% reduction in PSA (PSA50) at 12 weeks or thereafter. Secondary endpoints include: 1) DCR through 24 weeks ;2) CRR based on the following –a) response based on PCWG3 - modified RECI ST 1.1, b) PSA decrease of ≥50%, or c) CTC count conversion ;3) ORR defined as CR and PR rate per PCWG3 -modified RECI ST 1.1; 4)CTC response rate defined as percent of subjects having favorable CTC <5/7.5mL at nadir if baseline is unfav orable CTC ≥5/7.5mL ; 5) PSA week 4 response rate defined as percent of subjects achieving ≥30% decrease from baseline PSA after 4 weeks of study treatment ; 6) time to disease progression according to PCWG3 criteria (either b y PCWG3 -modified RECI ST 1.1or progression in bone or PSA progression with accompan ying progression by RECI ST 1.1 or bone scan or clinical progression ); 7) rPFS per PCWG3 -modified RECI ST 1.1. Other endpoints include OS, number of subjects with reduction in CTC of at least 30%, and PK will be evaluated. Safet y will be evaluated b y Adverse Events (AE), withdrawals due to toxicities, and changes in safety parameters from baseline (e.g., laboratory parameters, vitals, ECG). During dose expansion, the study will employ a Bay esian predictive ad aptive design that allows the trial to be monitored more frequentl y at multiple stages based on the utility score of the dose . Bayesian statistics will be employ ed to calculate the posterior probability that the utility of the dose (dU) is greater than the clinicall y significant minimum utility (CSMU) at interim anal ysis for each dose. T he interim analy sis will be conducted for each individual dose and it may be conducted when at least 10 evaluable subjects are available for a given dose. After the first in terim analy sis, the interim analysis can be conducted after every 10 additi onal subjects become evaluable. For the separate interim looks in each combination in expansion cohort, the enrollment for that cohort may be stopped due to futility if the posterio r probability that the utility (dU) ≥CSMU ( 25) is small (e.g., less than a 4% chance for the utility to be larger than the CSMU). Decisions to stop enrolment for a cohort will be based on the totality of the data, including safet y/tolerability and efficacy (primary and secondary parameters)."
35,page_35,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 36Arm A In Arm A, eligible subjects with m CRPC will be enrolled into two dosing level cohorts to determine the MTDs (and RP2D) of GSK525762 when administered in combination with abiraterone. Eligible subjects include those that are abiraterone -refractory or resistant from second line as well as third line and above (including L2 or L x) chemo -naive or chemo -treated), but the most recent treatment before enrolment into Arm A must be abiraterone (Figure 3). During dose escalation, eligible subjects will be dosed in at least two dose levels to identify the two dose level cohorts to explore in dose expansion. The approved dose of abiraterone (1000 mg) will be used for all GSK525762 dose l evel exploration. The initial GSK525762 dose level will be dose level 60 mg ( DL60) , which is one dose level lower than the single -agent RP2D. If DL60 does not exceed the MTD, DL80 (GSK525762 given 80 mg QD) will be opened ( Figure 3). If any dose level cohort is opened, but exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then additional subjects will not be enrolled at that dose level . Due to emerging data (safety /tolerability /efficacy ), additional dose levels may be explored. These dose levels may either be a lower daily dose level or an intermittent dose level, either at a dose level where daily treatment may be intolerable or at a lower dose. For example, if DL60 exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then a n alternate/intermittent dosing at 60 mg dose level (DL 60 ALT) and/or a lower daily dose level (DL -1, 40 mg) may be evaluated. To further explore and identify the MTDs (and RP2Ds), the two most tolerable dose levels may be initiated and randomized by prior l ines of therap y (L2 and L x). A total of 30 subjects each may be enrolled into both cohorts, and approximately 10 enrolled subjects will be L 2 and 20 subjects will be L x (Figure 3). If only one dose level is tolerabl e for dose expansion, subjects will be enrolled and not randomized. Refer to Section 4.6for further dose information."
36,page_36,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 37Figure 3 Study Schematic Arm B In Arm B, eligible subjects with mCRPC will be enrolled into dosing level cohorts to determine the MTDs (and RP2D) of GSK525762 when administered in combination with enzalutamide. Eligible subjects include those that are enzalutamide -refractory or resistant from second line as well as th ird line and above (including L2 or L x), but the most recent treatment before enrolment into Arm B must be enzalutamide (Figure 4). Eligible subjects will be administered escalating doses of GSK525762 in combinati on with the approved dose of enzalutamide (160 mg) . As enzalutamide is a known CYP3A4 inducer, DDI could potentially lower the exposure of GSK525762 active moiety levels by 20%. Therefore, subjects will be enrolled at DL80 as the starting dose. During dos e escalation, eligible subjects will be dosed in at least two dose levels to identify the two dose level cohorts to explore in dose expansion. The initial GSK525762 dose level will be dose level 80 mg ( DL80) , which is equivalent to one dose level lower than the single -agent RP2D due toexpected DDI. If DL80 does not exceed the MTD, DL100 (GSK525762 given 100 mg QD) will be opened ( Figure 4). If any dose level cohort is opened, but exceeds the maximum permitted toxic ity rate, then additional subjects will not be enrolled at that dose level . Due to emerging data (safety /tolerability /efficacy ), additional dose levels may be explored. These dose levels may either be a lower daily dose level or an intermittent dose"
37,page_37,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 38level , either at a dose level where daily treatment may be intolerable or at a lower dose. For example, if DL80exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then a n alternate/intermittent dosing at 80 mg dose level (DL 80 ALT) and/or a lower daily dose level (DL -1, 60mg) may be evaluated . Based on PK anal ysis from DL 80 and DL100 dose escalation cohorts, if the exposure to GSK525762 active moiety is 40% lower than its single agent exposure (determined from GSK525762 80 mg cohort in BET115521 stud y), DL120 may be opened. The study team will carefull y review PK and safet y data from the DL 80 and DL100 dose levels to determine if it is acceptable to open the DL120 dose level. If DL120 is opened, subjects in DL 120 will begin dosing with GSK525762 at 120 mg and the appr oved dose of enzalutamide. To further explore and identify the MTDs (and RP2Ds), the two most tolerable dose levels may be initiated and randomized by prior lines of therap y (L2 or L x). A total of 30 subjects each may be enrolled into both cohorts, and ap proximately 10 enrolled subjects will be L 2 and 20 subjects will be L x (Figure 4). If only one dose level is tolerable for dose expansion, subjects will be enrolled and not randomized. Refer to Section 4.6for further dose information. Figure 4 Study Schematic"
38,page_38,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 394.1.1. Type and Number of Subjects Approximately 130 subjects worldwide will be enrolled in the study as a whole. In France, approximately 28 sub jects are to be enrolled. During dose escalation, subjects with a histologically -confirmed diagnosis of mCRPC will be treated in escalating dose level cohorts until the DL MTD(s) is /areestablished. The total number of subjects required will depend upon the number of escalation steps required to identify the MTD(s). Once safe DL(s) are identified, the dose expansion phase will open and subjects with a histologically -confirmed diagnosis of CRPC will be randomized based on prior lines of therap y (L2 or L x).For both Arms, each dose level cohort may enroll or randomize up to 30 subjects. Subjects from both dose escalation and dose expansion may be combined to reach 30 subjects. 4.2. Dose Escalation 4.2.1. Treatments A rms and Duration All subjects will receive GSK525762 i n combination with either abiraterone or enzalutamide . Subjects will begin combination therap y and continue until unacceptable toxicity , progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, death, or completion of the study . The total duration of study will depe nd on recruitment rates, withdrawals due to toxicity or progression or death, and, with an approximate duration of 2 to 3y ears. This study will consist of dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts. A mTPI design will be followed during dose escalation to establish safe DLs to move to dose expansion . During dose expansion, subjects who have failed prior abiraterone/enzalutamide - treatment both as L2 as well as L x will be enrolled to either of the following arms: Forced randomization of subjects that are abir aterone -refractory or resistant from L 2 and L x to the two most tolerable dose level cohorts with 1/3 of the subjects from L2 and 2/3 of the subjects from L x: -GSK525762 + abiraterone/prednisone (Arm A). Forced randomization of subjects that are enzalutami de-refractory or resistant from L 2and L x to the two most tolerable dose level cohorts with 1/3 of the subjects from L2 and 2/3 of the subjects from L x:-GSK525762 at RP2D+ enzalutamide (Arm B) For subjects receiving GSK525762 in combination with abirater one, dail y administration of combination therap y (GSK525762 and abiraterone) will commence immediately (Day 1) for abiraterone -failed subjects who are still on abiraterone (i.e, not stopped abiraterone dosing at progression and during screening). However, if these subjects are off abiraterone treatment for more than 3 day s at time of assignment to a cohort, there would be a lead in period for at least 7 day s of abiraterone (Day -7 to Day 0) before the start of combination treatment (GSK525762 and abirateron e). The lead -in dosing will ensure that abiraterone is at stead y state upon initiation of GSK525762 treatment ( Table 2). Based on emerging information collected from PK, PD and safet y/tolerability data, other dosin g regimens (such as BID dosing for both drugs or intermittent dosing for GSK525762 or staggered dosing of the two drugs) may be explored during the study ."

Subject has stopped abiraterone for more than 3 days at time of assignment Subject must initiate lead -in single agent abirateron e dosing for at least 7 days prior to initiation of combination treatment with GSK525762 For subjects receiving GSK525762 in combination with enzalutamide, daily administration of combination therap y (GSK525762 plus enzalutamide) will commence immediately (Day 1) for enzalutamide -failed subjects who are still on enzalutamide (i.e. not stopped enzalutamide dosing at progression and during screening). However, if these subjects are off enzalutamide treatment for more than 7 day s at the time of assignment to a cohort, there would be a lead in period for at least 28 day s of enzalutamide (Day -28 to Day 0) before the start of combination treatment (GSK525762 and enzalutamide). There will be a 14 day lead in period (Day -14 to Day 0) if enzalutamide interruption was less than or equal to 7 day s prior to start of combination treatment (Day 1). The lead -in dosing will ensure that enzalutamide is at steady state upon initiation of GSK525762 treatment (Table 3). Based upon eme rging data, additional subjects may be enrolled above, at, or below the combination doses, in order to collect additional safety and PK data.

Dose Escalation 4.2.2.1. Planned Dose Levels GSK525762 as a single agent was investigated at the highest dose of 80 mg (amorphous tablet)/ 75 mg (bes ylate tablet) once daily (Recommended P hase 2 Dose, RP2D) in the expansion cohorts of the first time in human solid tumor study (BET115521). All doses of GSK525762 refer to the bes ylate tablet formulation. For Arm A, projected dose levels"
40,page_40,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 41of GSK525762 are 60 mg and 80 mg administered once dail y.Due to emerging data (safet y/tolerability /efficacy ), additional dose levels may be explored. These dose levels may either be a lower daily dose level or an intermittent dose level, either at a dose level where daily treatment may be intolerable or at a lower dose. For example, if DL60 exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then a n alternate/intermittent dosing at 60 mg dose level (DL60 ALT) and/or a lower daily dose level (DL -1, 40 mg) may be evaluated. For Arm B, projected dose levels of GSK525762 are 80 mg, and 100 mg admini stered once dail y. A dose of 120 mg may be evaluated in combination with enzalutamide based on emerging PK and safety data. Due to emerging data (safet y/tolerability /efficacy ), additional dose levels may be explored. These dose levels may either be a lower daily dose level or an intermittent dose level, either at a dose level where dail y treatment may be intolerable or at a lower dose. For example, if DL80exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then a n alternate/intermittent dosing at 80 mg dose level (DL80 AL T) and/or a lower daily dose level (DL -1, 60mg) may be evaluated. Projected dose levels of abiraterone and enzalutamide are 1000 mg and 160 mg respectivel y, administered once dail y. No doses will be explored beyond 1000 mg abiraterone or 160 mg enzalutamide, these doses that are considered to be the Maximum Feasible Dose (MFD), unless emerging PK data demonstrate reduced exposure of either drug in combination compared to single agent. As determined from pre -clinical studies, the maximum clinical dose of GSK525762 will not exceed 200 mg. Any GSK525762 dose above 120 mg would require regulatory authority review and approval. 4.2.2.2. Dose -Limiting Toxicity An event will be considered a DLT if it occurs within the first 28 day s of combination treatment (Day 1 to Day 28) and meets one of the criteria listed in Table 4, unless it can be clearly established that the event is unrelated to treatment."

These toxicities will not be taken into account for dose escalation decisions unless, in the opinion of the investigator and the Medical Mo nitor, they represent a dose -limiting toxicity . For all other toxicities and their management, see Appendix 2 . Grade 2 or less: oFatigue oRash oAlopecia"

Maximum Dose Increment The pre -planned dose levels are described in Section 4.2. Only GSK525762 will be dose - escalated at each dose escalation step. 4.2.2.5. Dose Escalation Decisions A data review team, consisting (at a minimum) of the investigator(s), medical monitor(s), safet y physician, pharmacokineticist, clinical representatives, and statistician, will be responsible for determining whether dose escalation should continue as planned according to the mTPI design rules ( Figure 5) [Ji, 2013]. Prior to the dose escalation decision, the data review team will review available relevant data on all adverse events including non -DLT t oxicities, laboratory assessments and other safety evaluations, as well as PK data. The dose decision and rationale for each cohort will be documented in writing with copies maintained at each study site and in the master study files at GlaxoSmithKline (GS K). Dose escalation will follow mTPI dose -escalation procedure. The design assumes (i) approximately 3 to 6 subjects per dose cohort will complete the dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period and (ii) the true underl ying toxicity rate for GSK525762 i n combination with enzalutamide falls within the range from 25% to 35% and centered at 30%. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are based on any observed toxicity in the first 28 days of treatment (please see Section 4.2.2.2). At DL 60, 3 subjects will be enrolled. If no DLT is observed, proceed to next dose level. I f one of the three evaluable subject experiences a DLT, then 3 additional subjects will be enrolled at that dose level. Evaluation of available safet y dat a from at least 6 subjects who have completed a minimum of 28 day s (1 cy cle) at the current highest safe dose level is required prior to expanding a cohort . A modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) design will be implemented ( Figure 5) [Ji, 2013]. The mTPI decision rule will be followed for monitoring safet y until up to 10 subjects have been assigned at the same dose. The design assumes (i) Approximately 3-6 subjects will c omplete the DLT evaluation period and (ii) the true underly ing toxicity rate for GSK525762 in combination with abiraterone or enzalutamide falls with in the range from 25% to 35% and centered at 30%. The monitoring rules guiding dose escalation are provided in Figure 5. Columns provide the numbers of subjects treated at the current dose level, and rows provide the corresponding numbers of subjects experiencing toxicity . The entries of the table are dose-finding decis ions (i.e., E, S, and D) representing escalating the dose, stay ing at the same dose, and de -escalating the dose. If the current dose is at the highest dose level and the decision is E, it indicates that the highest dose level is below MTD and the next subject(s) will be treated at the same dose level. In addition, decision U means that the"
43,page_43,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 44current dose level is unacceptable because of high toxicity and should be excluded from the trial. For example, when one of three subjects experiences toxicity , the decis ion can be located at row 1 and column 3, which is S –to stay at the current dose level. Consequently the next cohort of subjects will be treated at the same dose level currently being used. If zero of three subjects experiences toxicity , the decision is at row 0 and column 3, which is E –to escalate if there is higher available dose otherwise stop dose escalation if there are 6 evaluable subjects on the current dose. Thus, the next cohort of subjects will be treated at the next -higher dose level. If thre e of three subjects experiences toxicity , the decision is DU –to de -escalate to the next -lower dose level and exclude the current dose from the trial, because the high toxicity level is unacceptable. Figure 5 Dose -finding spreadsh eet of the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method The spreadsheet was generated based on a beta/binomial model and precalculated before trial initiation. The letters in different colors are computed based on the decision rules under the mTPI method and represent different dose -finding actions. In addition to actions de -escalate the dose (D), stay at the same dose (S), and escalate the dose (E), the table includes action unacceptable toxicity (U), which is defined as the execution of the dose -exclusion rule in mTPI. The cohort may be expanded up to 10 subjects to further evaluate safet y, pharmacokinetics and tolerability before dose escalation or reduction decision is determined. 4.2.2.6. Alternative Dosing Schedules Alterations may be made t o the schedule of administration and/or PK/PD sampling schedule based on the results of emerging PK, PD, and safet y data. Schedules that incorporate a recovery period may be explored (e.g., 2 weeks on, 1 week off). This approach will be considered if the safety and PK data suggest that a therapeutic exposure cannot be achieved using the initial schedule without excessive toxicity . The starting dose for the alternate schedule will be no highe rthan the maximum tolerated or completed dose level with the init ial schedule. Escalation can then proceed as described in Section 4.2.2 ."
44,page_44,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 45The dosing schedule may also be adjusted to expand a prior dose cohort to further evaluate safet y, pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic findings at a given dose level, or to add cohorts to evaluate additional dose levels. The study procedures for these additional subject(s) or cohort(s) will be the same as that described for other study subjects. Any changes to the dosing schedule may be m ade only after review of all available data and clearance b y the medical monitor(s). An y planned changes will apply to a cohort of subjects and not an individual subject. Changes will be communicated to the site in writing along with justification and data supporting the change. A modified Study Reference Manual ( SRM), including updated Time & Events Table, will be provided to the sites prior to initiation of the alternative regimen. 4.3. Decision to Proceed to Expansion phase Amendment 04 applies to all global study sites. These changes are based on the decision to close out the study and stop all new enrolment as the study met protocol defined interim futility . With the implementation of amendment 04, specific assessments and collection of survival follow -up da ta will no longer be required. Please see Section 7.1for further details. The study will conclude when the last subject has completed/discontinued study treatment and completed the end of treatment visit. Dose escalation will be considered complete when a MTD have been determined, any remaining subjects have completed the 28 -day DLT observation period and have undergone all necessary sample collection procedures scheduled for the first four weeks on therap y (e.g., the on -dose tumor biopsy and any associated blood draws). At that time, all available data (including data from subjects who prematurel y discontinue therap y) will be compiled and summarized. The totality of the data, including safety /tolerabilit y, PK, PD, and efficacy will be used to determine expansion cohort dose for GSK525762 to be administered in combination. Clinical activity data from evaluable subjects treated at or above the dose combination selected as the RP2D will be considered in the anal ysis of efficacy described in Section 9.4.4 . At the completion of dose escalation, an y subjects still receiving therap y with GSK525762 and/or abiraterone/enzalutamide may continue receiving drug(s) until progression, death, withdr awal of consent, unacceptable toxicity , or completion of study as described in Section 5.4. Clinic visits and efficacy anal ysis should continue as described in the Time and Events Table. 4.4. Expansion Cohorts 4.4.1. Type and Number of Subjects All subjects with a histologically -confirmed diagnosis of CRPC will be enrolled. Subjects will be enrolled based upon their most recent prior treatment (e.g. subjects who were most recentl y treated with abiraterone will be enrolled in to Arm A, and subjects most recentl y treated with enzalutamide will be enrolled into Arm B). The total number of subjects required will depend upon the number of escalation steps required to identify the MTD(s). Once safe DL(s) are identified, the dose exp ansion phase will open and subjects"
45,page_45,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 46with a histologicall y-confirmed diagnosis of CRPC will be randomized based on prior lines of therap y (L2 or Lx). For both Arms, each dose level cohort may enroll or randomize up to 30 subjects. Subjects from both dose es calation and dose expansion may be combined to reach 30 subjects. If onl y one DL is opened for dose expansion, subjects will continue to be enrolled and their prior line of therap y (L2 or L x) will be collected, but subjects will not be randomized. Refer t o Section 9.1.1 for the statistical rationale for the number of subjects to be enrolled. During dose expansion, subjects will not be replaced if they prematurel y discontinue therap y. 4.4.2. Dose Selection For both Arms, it is anticipated that the two most tolerable dose level combinations per arm will be carried forward into expansion cohorts. If data warrants, only one dose level combination may be carried into dose expansion. 4.4.3. Statistical Design During dose expansion , each combination cohort will employ a Bay esian adaptive design that allows the trial to be frequentl y monitored with the constraint of both Type I and Type II error rates . This design allows the enrollment to be halted due to futility . For details of the design and decision rules, refer to Section 9.1.2 . Inference stemming from the Bayesian probabilities of efficacy and tolerability in subjects harboring mCRPC are intended to inform decision making. Actual dec isions will depend on the totality of the efficacy and safety data. The decision to terminate a cohort will not depend solely on the results of the statistical model but will take all factors into account, including the results of the model, additional eff icacy parameters, safet y, tolerability , PK, and PD data. In some cases, the enrolment for a cohort won’t stop even if the model suggests a low likelihood of clinically meaningful utility score in that combination. 4.5. Design Justification Dose escalation will establish whether the combination of GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide are safe in targeted dose levels for abiraterone or targeted dose levels for enzalutamide. For each arm, up to 2 dose levels will be taken forward , with a lower and higher GSK5257 62 dose, either as a continuous or intermittent dose administration. F urther evaluation will be conducted by the study team to determine if only 1 dose level will be required per either Arm during dose expansion. By taking forward up to two doses per arm into dose expansion, the study may be able to determine the ideal dose level in combination with abiraterone/enzalutamide that can be defined as the RP2D for each combination. To further establish a potential signal in"
46,page_46,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 47advanced disease, both L2 and L x sub jects will be enrolled. Stratification will be utilized to target a total of 1/3 L2 and 2/3 L x in each dose expansion cohort in both arms. 4.6. Dose Justification 4.6.1. Drug -Drug Interactions The risk of a pharmacokinetic drug -drug interaction between GSK525762 and abiraterone is low; however, the risk of a drug -drug interaction between GSK525762 and enzalutamide is high with an anticipated significant decrease in GSK525762 exposure. Drugs as victim: GSK525762 appears to be primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and does not appear to be metabolized by CYP2C8, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19. Abiraterone acetate is h ydroly zed to active metabolite abiraterone, and the conversion is probably through esterase activity , and is not CYP mediated. Abiraterone is a substr ate of CYP3A4. Drug -drug interaction studies using a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) reduced abiraterone exposure b y 55%, suggesting avoidance of CYP3A4 inducers during abiraterone treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer is warranted clinicall y, the dose of abiraterone should be increased to 1000 mg twice daily ; once the other drug is removed, the dose of abiraterone can decrease to the labelled 1000 mg dail y indication. However, co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) didn’t cause any meaningful clinical effects on the PK of abiraterone. Enzalutamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 to an active metabolite N-desmeth yl enzalutamide and primaril y eliminated by hepatic metabolism. Drug -drug interaction studies using a strong CYP3A4 i nducer (rifampin) reduced enzalutamide exposure by 37%, suggesting avoidance of CYP3A4 inducers during enzalutamide treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be used, the dose of enzalutamide may be increased to 240 mg daily ; if the CYP3A4 inducer is ulti mately discontinued, then the dose can return to 160 mg dail y. Drugs as perpetrator : The potential for GSK525762 to inhibit the clearance of possible co-medications metabolized by major CYP enzymes was considered to be low. An in vitro study in human liv er microsomes with clinically -relevant substrates of CYPs 2B6, 2C8 and 3A4 revealed that GSK525762 did not directl y inhibit these enzymes (I C50 >100 M), nor was there any metabolism -dependent inhibition. Based on in vitro and in vivo data showing reductio n of exposure to GSK525762 following repeated administration, there is a potential for GSK525762 to be a moderate inducer of CYP3A enzy mes. Abiraterone is an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2C8, and in a drug -drug interaction trial, maximum observed concentrati on Cmax and Area under concentration -time curve (AUC) of dextromethorphan (a CYP2D6 substrate) were increased. These studies suggest avoidance of CYP2D6 substrates along with abiraterone; and if alternative treatment cannot be used, consider a dose reducti on of the respective CYP2D6 substrate drug."
47,page_47,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 48Enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer in humans. Co-administration of enzalutamide with substrates for CYP3A4 (midazolam), CYP2C9 (warfarin) and CYP2C19 (omeprazole) r educed the plasma concentration of these respective substrates. Dose adjustments for concomitant strong CYP2C8 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inducers are noted. Thus, avoid concomitant use if possible of a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor; if clinically needed, consider lo wering the dose to 80 mg once dail y. If that drug is subsequently discontinued, then the dose of enzalutamide can go back to 160 mg dail y. 4.6.2. Starting Doses GSK525762 A Phase I/II stud y (BET115521) with GSK525762 (as a single agent) was conducted in subject s with advanced solid tumors, including CRPC. Doses of 2 to 100 mg once dail y and doses of 20 mg,30mg and 40 mg BID were evaluated. The RP2D was determined to be 80 mg QD for GSK525762. Please see Section 5.3 of the GSK525762 Investigator’s Brochure [Gla xoSmithKline Document Number 2011N113741_0 7, 2018 ], which details the clinical experience to date with GSK525762 and clinical safet y data in the solid tumor population up to 100 mg once dail y and in the hematol ogic malignancy population up to 120 mg once dail y. The initial dose of GSK525762 in dose escalation administered in combination with abiraterone will be reduced to 60 mg bes ylate salt tablets, which represents an approximate 20% dose reduction from the si ngle-agent RP2D. At clinically relevant doses, enzalutamide has been shown to be an inducer of CYP3A4, with an 86% decrease in midazolam exposure. Enzalutamide also has the potential to be a clinical inducer and inhibitor of the transport protein P -glycop rotein. The initial dose of GSK525762 in dose escalation administered in combination with enzalutamide will be 80mg bes ylate salt tablets. I t is anticipated that enzalutamide will reduce the steady -state exposure (AUC) to GSK525762 by 60% and to GSK525762 active moiety (GSK525762 + active metabolites) by around 20% (extrapolation of the net effect in GSK525762 exposure due to CYP3A4/ P -gp Induction and P -gp Inhibition). Therefore, the initial dose of GSK525762 in both arms should be approximately equivalen t. Enzalutamide: For enzalutamide (Xtandi), doses ranging from 30 to 600 mg have been administered to subjects with CRPC [ Scher , 2010]. A dose of 160 mg has been studied extensively in Phase 3 studies and has shown su perior clinical activity [Xtandi , 2015]. The currently approved dose of enzalutamide is 160mg orally once dail y.It can be given with or without food and should be taken at the same time each day . Capsules cannot be chewed, dissolved externally or opened. As it is not anticipated that GSK525762 will impact the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide, for the purpose of initial dosing, enzalutamide will be started at the approved dose of 160 mg once dail y orall y."
48,page_48,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 49This same dose will also be used during the lead in period for subjects who have discontinued enzalutamide prior to coming onto this study . Abiraterone: For Abiraterone (Zy tiga), doses ranging from 250 to 2000 mg have been administered to subjects with CRPC [ Attard , 2008]. A dose of 1000 mg has been studied extensively in Phase 3 studies and has shown superior clinical activity [Zytiga, 2015]. The currentl y approved dose of abiraterone is 1000 mg orally once dail y. Additionally , as per abiraterone label, 5 mg twice dail y prednisone must be administered. Administration of Abiraterone orall y is done in a fasted state with the prescribing information suggesting no food 2 hours prior to and for at least 1 hour after abiraterone dosing. Tablets must be swallowed with water and cannot be crushed or chewed. As it is not anticipated that GSK525762 will have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone, for the purpose of initial dosing in t he Phase 1 portion, abiraterone will be started at the approved dose of 1000 mg once dail y orally in fasted conditions with co -administration of prednisone. 4.6.3. Overlapping Toxicities As monotherap y, GSK525762 and enzalutamide/abiraterone have overlapping tox icity profiles, including effects on the hepatic, hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and reproductive s ystems. The potential for additive severity and incidence of these adverse events exists. Due to the anticipated reductive effect that enzalutamide is exp ected to have on GSK525762, the starting dose will remain at 80 mg once dail yin combination with enzalutamide. The likelihood that GSK525762 or abiraterone will have an effect on the PK of the other is low. The AE profiles of both agents, however, contain some common toxicities. To reduce the risk of toxicity and assess the safet y and tolerability of the combination, the starting dose of GSK525762 will be reduced to 60 mg once daily in combination with the approved dose of abiraterone. L ower exposures (eit her via lower dose or intermittent dosing) may be evaluated if the starting doses of either proves to yield unacceptable toxicity . Summaries of findings from both clinical and non -clinical studies conducted with GSK525762 can be found in the Investigator Brochure. GSK525762 data provided in Section 4.6.3 reflects study treatment related AEs across all dose levels administered in the single -agent BET115521 solid tumor study as described in the Investigator’s Broc hure [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N113741_0 7, 2018 ].The data cut - off date was 29 Jan 2018 . Summaries of findings from both clinical and non -clinical studies conducted with enzalutamide/abiraterone can be found in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) package insert. The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol."

Gastrointestinal Safety Findings Enzalutamide :As described i n the enzalutamide FDA package insert (Section 6.1) [Xtandi , 2015], in two randomized clinical trials with CRPC subjects , some of the most commonly reported adverse effects per treatment arm were gastrointestinal, including constipation and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal toxicity was almost predominantly Grades 1 and 2; Grade 3 and 4 level gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in<1% subjects. Abiraterone :As described in the abiraterone FDA package insert (Section 6.1) [Zytiga, 2015], in two randomized clinical trials with CRPC subjects , some of the most commonly reported adverse effects per trea tment arm were gastrointestinal, including constipation, dyspepsia, vomiting and diarrhoea . Gastrointestinal toxicity was almost predominantly Grades 1 and 2; Grade 3 and 4 level gastrointestinal toxicity were observed in<1% subjects. GSK525762: Gastroint estinal effects were frequently the dose -limiting toxicities in non - clinical animal studies of GSK525762. Dogs , rats and mice treated with repeated doses of GSK525762 experienced reduced bod y weight, ulceration/inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tra ct, and abnormal feces. In study BET115521, drug-related GI events were reported, as well. Drug -related nausea was reported in 41%, decreased appetite was reported in 36%, diarrhea was reported in 32%, dysgeusia was reported in 30%, and vomiting was report ed in 27% of subjects. Gastrointestinal toxicity was predominantly Grades 1 and 2; 5% of subjects reported Grade 3 nausea, 4% reported Grade 3 decreased appetite, 3% reported Grade 3 vomiting, and 2% of subjects reported Grade 3 diarrhea. No Grade 4 GIeffects were observed. Monitoring and Management: During clinical studies, medical history , phy sical examination (including weight) and clinical laboratory assessments will be used to identify and assess toxicity in the GI tract. Management guidelines are i ncluded in the protocol for gastrointestinal toxicity . In the event of clinically significant toxicity , treatment will be withheld ,and supportive therap y provided according to standard medical practice. 4.6.3.1.2. Hepatic Safety Findings Abiraterone :As described in the FDA package insert (Section 6.1), in the two randomized clinical trials, Grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST increases were observed in 4% of subjects that received abiraterone. In 1% of subjects, treatment was discontinu ed due to increase in liver enzy mes. Subjects with elevated baseline ALT/AST experienced liver test elevation than those subjects with normal values. GSK525762: In non-clinical animal studies, non -adverse liver changes were observed in rats, mice and dogs including increases in bilirubin levels in rats , increased bile acids in rats and mice and transient , reversible increased in AST and/or ALT in rats and dogs. Hepatocellular necrosis was observed in a single rat at a non -tolerated dose .In the BET115521 c linical trial, liver effects have been noted. Cases of liver events meeting the definition of sever eliver injury based on liver chemistries (AL T ≥3X ULN and Bilirubin"
50,page_50,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 51≥2X ULN) have been reported in study BET115521. Additional complicating factors were rep orted for these cases (e.g. liver metastasis and sepsis) with liver enzy mes trending towards normal levels upon stopping GSK525762. Drug related elevated blood bilirubin was reported in 24%, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation was reported in 11%, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation was reported in 8% of subjects . These drug related hepatic toxicities were predominantly Grades 1 and 2; 7% reported Grade 3 and <1% reported Grade 4 blood bilirubin increased and 2% of subjects reported Grade 3 AST increase. There were no Grade 4 ALT increases noted . Monitoring and Management: Inclusion/exclusion criteria will include hepatic eligibility criteria. All subjects will be monitored for hepatic d ysfunction. Management and stopping criteria are inclu ded in the protocol as described in Appendix 2 and Section 5.4.1 . 4.6.3.1.3. Hematopoietic Safety Findings Abiraterone :As described in the FDA package insert (Section 6.1), abiraterone was associated with anemia in >2% of subjects. GSK525762: In non -clinical studies of GSK525762, ly mphoid / hematologic toxicity was observed in rats , mice and dogs and the effects contributed to t he definition of severel y toxic repeat dose in rats (30 mg/kg). The effects manifested as hy pocellularity in bone marrow, th ymus, spleen and l ymph nodes; decreased spleen and thy mic weight; mild hemoly sis(rat); decreased white cell /l ymphocy te/platelet count and variable and inconsistent changes in multiple red blood cells parameters and reticulocy te counts. Effects were generall y reversible but minimal bone marrow cellularit y was still evident in rats following an off-dose period. In the BET115521 clinica l trial, thrombocy topenia has been observed in subjects with solid tumors mainly at doses of 60 mg and above. Thrombocy topenia was only noted after more than a week of continuous dosing, and platelet counts recovered after cessation of the drug . Drug relat ed thrombocy topenia was reported in 59%, anemia was reported in 29%, international normalized rati o increased was reported in 14%, prothrombin time prolonged in 12% and coagulation factor VII level decreased in 10% of subjects .These AEs were mainly Grade 1 or 2; with Grade 3 thrombocy topenia reported in 22%, Grade 3 anemia reported in 12% and Grade 3 factor VII decrease in 4% of subjects. Grade 4 thromobocy topenia was reported in 16%, anaemia in 1% and factor VII decrease in 4% of subjects. Mild to seve re hemorrhagic events have been observed during the use of GSK525762, primarily during occurrences of moderate to severe thrombocy topenia. Most events have been associated with confounding factors bey ond thrombocy topenia such as disease under study , and/or with metastases to affected areas, low molecular weight heparin use and previous radiation. There have been SAEs noted of decrease in Coagulation Factor VII. Refer to IB for additional details [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N113741_0 7, 2018 ]. Monitoring and Management: Inclusion/exclusion criteria will require appropriate baseline hematologic and coagulation values prior to enrolment. Subjects will undergo"
51,page_51,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 52frequent complete blood count (CBC) measurements, and management guidelines (Appendix 2 ) are included in the protocol to guide dose interruption/reduction decisions. 4.6.3.1.4. General Toxicity Findings Enzalutamide :As described in the enzalutamide FDA package ins ert (Section 6.1), in two randomized clinical trials with CRPC subjects , asthenia/fatigue were reported as a more common adverse reaction in both studies. I n study 1, subjects with mCRPC following chemotherap y, all grades of asthenia/fatigue occurred more commonly (≥2% over placebo; 50.6% vs. 44.4%). In this study , the occurrence of Grade 3 -4 AEs was similar in both the enzalutamide and placebo arms. I n study 2, subjects with chemotherap y-naive mCRPC, all grades of asthenia/fatigue occurred more commonly (≥2% over placebo; 46.9% vs. 33.0%). In this study , the occurrence of Grade 3 -4 was similar in both the enzalutamide and placebo arms. I t was noted that this was the most common AE leading to treatment discontinua tion which occurred in 1% of subjects in both arms. Abiraterone :As described in the FDA package insert (Section 6.1), abiraterone was associated with fatigue in >2% of subjects. GSK525762: In the BET115521 st udy, 25% of subjects reported fatigue and 24% reported asthenia. Most of these AEs were Grade 1 or 2; with Grade 3 asthenia reported in 9% and Grade 3 fatigue in 3% of subjects. No Grade 4 asthenia/fatigue AEs were reported. Monitoring and Management: Medical and previous therapy history will be used to identify and assess whether these effects have been previously experienced by subjects, the severit y and if withholding ADT was required. These affects are generally managed by rest and withholding treatmen t if fatigue is intolerable. 4.6.4. Predicted Single -Agent Toxicities 4.6.4.1. Cardiovascular Safety Findings GSK525762: Reversible changes in the corrected QT (QTc) interval were noted in dogs in single -and repeated -dose studies. I n addition, reversible increases in bi omarkers of cardiac damage (cardiac troponin T, my osin light chain and/or cardiac troponin I ) were also seen in the rat and dog. Despite these QTc and cardiac biomarker changes, there was no evidence of compound -related m yocardial necrosis or other histopa thological changes in cardiac tissue of either species. An internal safety review of categorical analy sis of QTc increase (and decrease) from baseline of 271 subjects dosed up to 100 mg in the BET115521 and up to 120 mg in the BET116183 clinical trials demonstrated a clinically negligible effect on QTc. Based on this analy sis, the entry and stopping criteria have been modified. Monitoring and Management: Subjects will be monitored closely for changes in QTc with 12 -lead ECG and for elevations in plasma tr oponin. Safety ECGs will be performed at the time points specified in Time and Events tables (Section 7.1) using a standard 12 - lead ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate (HR) and measures PR, QRS, QT and QTcF intervals. As clinically indicated , the mean from triplicate ECGs will"
52,page_52,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 53be evaluated . Safet y ECGs will be reviewed b y the investigator on an ongoing basis for safet y purposes. Dosing should not begin until the safet y ECG has been reviewed and no significant abnormalities have been detected. To monitor for cardiom yopathy, echocardiograms will be performed at the time points specified in the Time and Events tables (Section 7.1). Management guideli nes ( Appendix 2) and stopping criteria (Section 5.4.2 and Section 5.4.3 ) are incorporated in the protocol. Laborato ry evaluations for cardiac troponins and electrol ytes (including potassium and magnesium) will be performed at baseline and at regular intervals (as specified in the Time and Events tables), and when clinically warranted during the study treatment. Troponi n I or T (based on availability ) levels will be tested by a local laboratory . Appropriate medical therapy will be provided by the investigator for any clinically significant increase in troponins including withholding or discontinuing the study medication. Appropriate medical management will be instituted to assure that electrol ytes are kept within the normal range. 4.6.4.2. General toxicities Enzalutamide: As described in the enzalutamide FDA package insert, an y enzalutamide related toxicities, as determined by the Investigator, will require at least a one week hold of enzalutamide until a return to ≤Grade 2 toxicity . Monitoring and Management: S ubjects will be monitored according to the management guidelines (Appendix 2 ). 4.6.4.3. Seizure Enzalutamide: As described in the enzalutamide FDA package insert (Section 6.1), in two randomized clinical trials with CRPC subjects , 7 of 800 (0.9%; study 1) and 1 of 871 (0.1%; study 2) su bjects experienced seizure. Monitoring and Management: Exclusion criteria include history of seizure or an y condition that may predispose subject to seizure (e.g., prior cortical stroke or significant brain trauma), and subjects will be monitored. Enzalut amide should be permanently discontinued in subjects who develop a seizure during treatment. 4.6.4.4. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Enzalutamide: As described in the enzalutamide FDA package insert (Section 6.1), there have been reports of PRES in subjects receiving enzalutamide. Monitoring and Management: Subjects will be monitored according to the management guidelines and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is mandated if clinically required .Enzalutamide should be permanentl y discontinued in subjects who develop a seizure during treatment."

Risk A ssessment The toxicities listed below are a summary of those most likely to be observed in clinical practice, or are of special interest. For a full list of predicted and observed toxicities, refer to the GSK525762 IB and the FDA package insert for enzalutamide/abiraterone . 4.6.6. Benefit A ssessment Study 204697 is a Phase I dose -escalation and expansion study , and the first comparative study of a BET inhibi tor in combination with the next generation AR -targeting agents abiraterone or enzalutamide in men with metastatic or advanced CRPC who have progressed on abiraterone or enzalutamide . Both GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide have been administered as s ingle agents to men with mCRPC. Abiraterone and enzalutamide are currently approved as single agent to treat mCRPC. Data from the first in human study with GSK525762 used as a single agent to treat late stage mCRPC subjects is preliminary , but indicates at least minimal activity as evidenced by fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG) -positron emission tomograph y (PET) response and decrease in bone pain. Additional data is being collected at the single agent RP2D. Study 204697 is based on the hy pothesis that adding the BE T inhibitor GSK525762 to androgen deprivation therap y (ADT) will overcome resistance to ADT. If successful, the main benefits are two -fold –i) provides a new treatment regimen for mCRPC that will be an added option for treatment of subjects who fail singl e agent ADT and may prolong survival; ii) for mCRPC patient who fail first line ADT, the scope to delay chemotherap y. 4.6.7. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion The adverse event profile for abiraterone and enzalutamide are well known and guidance is available on th e label for dose modification in the event of defined AEs. The adverse event profile of GSK525762 is evolving, but data is available from more than 150 subjects treated and management algorithms are available for the most common as well as serious AEs. Tot ality of the data indicates that overlapping toxicity in combination will most likely be hepatotoxicity , for which monitoring and stopping rules are built into the study . Extensive PK sampling and adverse event profile will be used to determine dosing levels and RP2D. If an y one of the combinations is found to be tolerable and meeting efficacy targets set out in the study , then a randomized controlled Phase 2 study will be designed to establish the benefits outlined the Section above. This may provide addit ional lines of treatment for subjects with mCRPC who progress on current regimens based on ADT. Taking into account the measures taken to minimise the risk to subjects participating in Phase I clinical trials, and potentially enriching for CRPC subjects wh o may respond to the combination of a BET inhibitor and an AR antagonist, the potential risks identified in association with GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide are justified b y the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to subjects with advanced or metastatic CRPC, who have failed prior therapies."

Subjec ts may be permitted to continue on therapy in the setting of equivocal progression (e.g., rising tumor markers early in therapy in the absence of confirmed radiographic progression, or equivocal radiographic imaging as described in Appendix 5 ) provided that the subject is not experiencing significant toxicity , the investigator believes (and the medical monitor concurs) that the subject may continue to receive benefit, and the subject has no other reasonable option for therap y that will provide long -term control of disease. In addition, study treatment may be permanentl y discontinued for an y of the following reasons: deviation(s) from the protocol request of the subject or prox y (withdrawal of consent by subject or proxy) investigator’s discretion subject is lost to follow -up study is closed or terminated a dose delay of >14 day s unless the investigator and Medical Monitor agree that further treatment may benefit the subject A subject may withdraw from study treatme nt at any time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , behavioural or administrative reasons. All subjects who discontinue from study treatment will have safety assessments at the time of di scontinuation and during post-study treatment follow -up as specified in Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). If a subject withdraws consent from the study , no further assessments will be completed, he/she may request destruction of an y samples taken, and the investigator must document this in the site study records . The following actions must be taken in relation to a subject who fails to attend the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to con tact the subject and re -schedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site must counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study . In cases where the subject is deemed ‘lost to follow up’, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and if necessary a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing addr ess or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical record. Should the subject continue to be unreachable, only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lo st to Follow -up”."
61,page_61,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 62The primary reason study treatment was permanently discontinued must be documented in the subject’s medical records and electronic case report form (eCRF). If the subject voluntaril y discontinues from treatment due to toxicity , ‘adverse event (AE)’ will be recorded as the primary reason for permanentl y discontinuation on the eCRF. Once a subject has permanently discontinued from study treatment, the subject will not be allowed to be retreated. During dose escalation, specific dosing r egimen(s) may be terminated if they are unable to be tolerated in an acceptable proportion of subjects. These regimen(s) will not be carried forward into expansion phase . Any subject receiving a terminated regimen may continue to receive that regimen, so l ong as that subject does not experience unacceptable toxicity , or else be switched to a previousl y cleared dose at the discretion of the investigator after discussion with the medical monitor. During dose expansion , unless a dose level is closed earl y, sur vival follow -up will continue in each cohort until approximately 70% of the total number of subjects have progressed or died . At such time, all cohorts will be closed and any further follow -up on subjects enrolled in each cohort will cease. Subjects who r equire permanent discontinuation of either abiraterone or enzalutamide the given combination may continue GSK525762 as a single agent if there is evidence of continuing benefit on treatment until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, unacceptable tox icity, or closure of the study . At the time of study completion, subjects with radiologicall y confirmed lack of disease progression (dose escalation and expansion phase ) who are still receiving GSK525762 and/or abiraterone/enzalutamide may continue treatme nt through a separate mechanism (e.g., roll -over protocol) to be determined at that time . 5.4.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure subject safet y and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing clinical liver safety guidance). http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guid ances/UCM174090.pdf See Figure 6and Figure 7for liver stopping criteria for subjects without and with liver metastases, respectivel y.

Study Treatment Restart or Rechallenge If subject meets liver chemistry stopping criteria do not restart/rechallenge subject with study treatment unless: GSK Medical Governance approval is granted Ethics and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is obtained, if required, and Separate consent for treatment restart/rechallenge is signed b y the subject Refer to Appendix 7 for full guidance. In France, if stopping criteria is met, subjects will not be allowed to restart or be rechallenged."
64,page_64,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 655.4.2. QTc Stopping Criteria For the purposes of this study , the corrected QT (QTc) is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia ’s formula (QTcF; defined as [QT/(RR1/3)]). QTcF will be used for all subjects for purposes of eligibility , data anal ysis, and withdrawal. The QTcF should be based on averaged QTcF values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 m inute) recording period. Study treatments will be withheld if either of the following occurs: QTcF interval ≥500 msec AND 60msec change from baseline QTcF interval ≥530 msec AND <60msec change from baseline In either case, both GSK525762 and abirater one/enzalutamide will be discontinued unless the benefits of therap y outweigh the risk of rechallenge in the opinion of the investigator, the Medical Monitor, as well as GSK medical governance. In this situation, rechallenge may be permitted (see Appendix 2 for rechallenge guidelines). In France, if stopping criteria is met, subjects will not be allowed to restart or be rechallenged. 5.4.3. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) Stopping Criteria Echocardiograp hy (ECHO) or MUGA scan must be performed at Screening and periodicall y throughout the study as outlined in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). Please refer to the LVEF management guidelines in Appendix 2 of the protocol for further detail. Copies of all scans and cardiology consultations performed on subjects who experience a >10% decrease in LVEF from baseline and whose cardiac ejection fraction is <institu tion’s LLN will be required b y GSK, or designee, for review. Instructions for submitting qualify ing scans are provided in the SRM. 5.4.4. Other Stopping Criteria To monitor for hematologic toxicity , CBCs will be drawn twice during the first week (includes screeni ng), weekly for the next four weeks of study , and then every four weeks, as described in the Time and Events table. Subjects who develop Grade 3 or greater anemia or thrombocy topenia may be monitored more frequentl y, as clinically indicated. Please see Appendix 2 for suggested management of hematologic toxicity . Safety will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Safety Review Team (SRT) which will be compromised of, at a minimum, a medical monitor, GSK Glob al Safety representative, and clinical study representative (including a representative from Biostatistics). All events of potential causalit y, including deaths, SAEs, and Grade 3/4 adverse events, will be carefull y evaluated. If clinicall y significant adv erse events or toxicities are observed in more than one third of the subjects, and/or if deaths related to stud y drug are observed, enrollment may be terminated and/or a lower -dose cohort may be opened or expanded."
65,page_65,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 665.5. Subject and Study Completion A subject wi ll be considered to have completed the study if they are followed until death. Subjects who have not died, and are no longer being followed for survival are considered to have discontinued the study . The End of Study eCRF should only be completed when a subject is no longer being followed. The stud y will be considered completed for purposes of a final anal ysis when 70% of evaluable subjects enrolled have progressed or died. If available, subjects continuing on GSK525762 at the time of final analy sis may be offered the option to continue it through another mechanism (eg, in a rollover trial). Amendment 04 applies to all global stud y sites. These changes are based on the decision to close out the study and stop all new enrolment as the study met protocol defin ed interim futility . With the implementation of amendment 04, specific assessments and collection of survival follow -up data will no longer be required. Please see Section 7.1for further details. The study will conclude when t he last subject has completed/discontinued study treatment and completed the end of treatment visit. 6. STUDY TREA TMENT 6.1. Investigational Product and Other Study Treatment The term ‘stud y treatment’ is used throughout the protocol to describe an y combination of products received b y the subject as per the protocol design. Stud y treatment may therefore refer to the individual study treatments or the combination of those study treatments."

The 20 mg tablet formulation is in development and will be utilized during the planned dura tion of the study. The 5 mg and 25 mg tablet formulation may be discontinued when the 20 mg tablet formulat ion is available. The use of 20 mg tablets will require regulatory authority approvals. b. The 500 mg tablet may be supplied dependent on the availability by Janssen. The use of 250 mg tablet formulation may be discontinued when 500 mg tablet is available 6.2. Treatment A ssignment Subjects will be assigned to receive GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide in an open -label fashion. Subjects will be identified by a unique subject number that will remain consistent for the duration of the study . For Arm A, during the initial evaluation of DL60, approximately 3 to 10 subjects will be enrolled until it is determined that DL 60 does not exceed the MTD. Due to emerging data (safet y/tolerability /efficacy ), additional dose levels may be explored. These dose levels may either be a lower daily dose level or an intermitt ent dose schedule , either at a dose level where dail y treatment may be intolerable or at a lower dose. For example, if DL60 exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then intermittent dosing at 60 mg dose"
67,page_67,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 68level (DL60 ALT) and/or a lower daily dose level (DL -1, 40 mg) may be evaluated). If DL60 has been cleared in dose escalation, approximately 6 to 10 subjects will be enrolled in the DL 80 cohort for evaluation of dose escalation. If any dose level cohort is opened, but exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then additional subjects will not be enrolled at that dose level . Subjects enrolled during dose escalation will continue treatment and will not roll into dose expansion. To further explore and identify the MTDs (and RP2Ds), the tw o most tolerable dose levels may be randomized into 2expansion cohorts and will be based on prior lines of therap y (L2 or L x). A maximum of up to 30 subjects each (in addition to those enrolled in dose escalation) will be enrolled into each dose level coh ort. If either dose level cohort is filled or terminated, then all subjects will be enrolled in the remaining prior treatment -specific cohort until it is filled or terminated. For Arm B, as enzalutamide is a known CYP3A4 inhibitor, and DDI could potentia lly lower the exposure of GSK525762 levels, the planned dose levels are expected to provide equivalent doses similar to those being examined in Arm A. During the initial evaluation of DL 80, approximately 3 to 10 subjects will be enrolled until it is deter mined that DL 80 does not exceed the MTD. Due to emerging data (safet y/tolerability /efficacy ), additional dose levels may be explored. These dose levels may either be a lower daily dose lev el or an intermittent dose schedule , either at a dose level where da ily treatment may be intolerable or at a lower dose. For example, if DL80 exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then intermittent dosing at 80 mg dose level (DL80 ALT) and/or a lower daily dose level (DL -1, 60mg) may be evaluated. If DL80 has been cleared in dose escalation, approximately 3 to 10 subjects will be enrolled in the DL 100 cohort until it is determined that DL100 does not exceed the MTD. If any dose level cohort is opened, but exceeds the maximum permitted toxicity rate, then additional subjects will not be enrolled at that dose level . An additional dose level, DL 120, may be initiated after careful review of the PK and safet y data from the DL80 and DL100 dose levels. If the DL120 cohort is opened, it will enrol approximately 3 to 10 subj ects until it is determined whether DL120 does not exceed the MTD. Subjects enrolled during dose escalation will continue treatment and will not roll into dose expansion. To further explore and identify the MTDs (and RP2Ds), the two most tolerable dose levels may be initiated and eligible subjects may be randomized by prior lines of therap y (L2 or L x). A maximum up to 30 subjects each (in addition to those enrolled in dose escalation) will be enrolled into each dose level cohort. If onl y one dose level is tolerable for dose expansion, subjects will be enrolled and not randomized. 6.3. Planned Dose A djustments There are no pre -planned dose adjustments per protocol. Dose reductions for individual subjects may be required, based on toxicity observed during the stud y (please refer to Appendix 2 ), and the frequency and duration of dose reductions will be reported. Table 6 clarifies the dose reductions for GSK525762 at any plan ned study dose."

If enzalutamide is re -started, GSK525762 should remain at the reduced dose level or the maximum single agent RP2D of 80 mg until after at least 14 days until the dose is escalated, if applicable. Subjects who require permanent discontinuation of either abiraterone or enzalutamide in the combination may continue GSK525762 as a single agent if there is evidence of continuing benefit on treatment. If GSK525762 is continued as a single agent, the maximum dose would be 80mg. Intra -subject dose escalations from the planned starting dose during dose escalation will not be permitte d. Intra-subject dose escalation may be permitted during dose expansion for the lower dose level only if that dose is determined to be futile. Based on dose table ( Table 6)and effect of enzalutamide on GSK525762 , no dose level/ schedule of less than 40 mg QD will be allowed for Arm B. If a subject is on an alternate dosing schedule and requires a de -escalation to 40 mg , then the subject must move to 40 mg QD. During an y dose interruption of GSK525762, abiraterone or enzalutamide m ay be continued at the protocol dose unless dose interruption of these combination products is also required. If GSK525762 is permanentl y discontinued, subject must be discontinued from the abiraterone or enzalutamide treatment and withdrawn from the study . 6.4. Blinding This is an open -label study which does not require blinding. 6.5. Packaging and Labeling GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide will be provided to the sites by GSK. Prednisone will not be supplied by GSK. The contents of the labels will be in acco rdance with all applicable regulatory requirements. 6.6. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability No special preparation of study treatment is required. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study treatment."

A Material Safet y Data Shee t (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the investigator, where this is required b y local laws, or is available upon request from GSK. 6.7. Compliance with Study Treatment A dministration At each visit, an evaluation of subject compliance with taken medication will be performed. The investigator will make every effort to bring non -compliant subjects into compliance. When subjects are dosed with GSK525762 or abiraterone/enzalutam ideat the site, they will receive stud y treatment directl y from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents. The dose of stud y treatment and st udy subject identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing b y a member of the study site staff other than the person administering the study treatment. Compliance of study treatment administration will be assessed through query ing the subject duri ng the site visits, review of subject dosing diaries and documented in the source documents and eCRF. A record of the number of GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide tablets dispensed to and taken b y each subject must be maintained and reconciled with st udy treatment and compliance records. Treatment start and stop dates, including dates for treatment delay s and/or dose reductions will also be recorded in the eCRF. 6.8. Treatment of Study Treatment Overdose For this study , any dose of GSK525762 or abiraterone/ enzalutamide greater than the protocol -specified dose within a 24 hour time period (± 4 hours) will be considered an overdose. GSK does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. In the event of an overdose the investigator (or treating phy sician) should:"
70,page_70,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 71Contact the Medical Monitor immediately Closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities until GSK525762 and/or abiraterone/enzalutamide can no longer be detected s ystemically (at least 28 day s) Obtain a plasma sample for PK an alysis within 3 day s from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case -by-case basis) Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF. Decisions regard ing dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the subject. 6.9. Treatment after the End of the Study Post study treatment will not be provided as part of the protocol. Upon discontinuation from assigned stud y treatment, subjects may receive additional (non protocol) therap y at the discretion of the treating ph ysician. New anti -cancer therap y should be documented on the eCRF. Every effort should be made to comp lete the required withdrawal and follow up evaluations prior to initiating further therap y or dosing of an investigational agent (see Section 7.1for follow -up assessments and procedures). The investigator is r esponsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the subject’s medical condition, whether or not GSK is providing specific post-study treatment. 6.10. Lifest yle and/or Dietary Restrictions 6.10.1. Dietary Restrictions Abiraterone will be administered with no food for 2 h before and 1 h after each dose, whereas Enzalutamide can be taken under fasting or fed conditions. GSK525762 can be taken under fasting or fed conditions, except on serial PK sampling day s (Week [W] 1 Day [D] 1 and W3D1 ) for at least 12 subjects at each dose level , as described below. Subjects should abstain from consumption of Seville oranges, grapefruit, grapefruit hybrids or grapefruit juice and/or pomelos, exotic citrus fruits, from one day prior to the first dose of study treatment until the last dose of study drug. If a subject vomits after taking stud y drug, the subject should be instructed not to retake the dose and should take the next scheduled dose. On serial PK sampling day s (W1D1 and W3D1 for at least 12 subj ects at each dose level), subjects should fast overnight (i.e., at least 8 hours) and should continue fasting until at least 2 hours after administration of GSK525762. Fasting will consist of avoiding the oral ingestion of calorie -containing products; howe ver, ingestion of water is permitted."
71,page_71,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 726.11. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Subjects will be instructed to inform the investigator prior to starting an y new medications from the time of first dose of stud y treatment until the end of the study (Final Study Visit). Any concomitant medication(s), including non -prescription medication(s) and herbal product(s), taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF. The minimum requirement is that drug name, dose and the dates of administration are to be recorded. Additionally , a complete list of all prior anti -cancer therapies will be recorded in the eCRF. Questions regarding concomitant medications should be directed to the Medical Monitor for clarification. If future changes are made to the list of perm itted/prohibited medications, formal documentation will be provided by GSK and stored in the study file. An y such changes will be communicated to the investigative sites in the form of a letter. 6.11.1. Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Subjects should receive full supportive care during the stud y, including transfusion of blood and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, and analgesics, as appropriate. The onl y caveat is that subjects should not receive those medicat ions listed as prohibited in Section 6.11.2.1 . Bisphosphonates and denosumab will be allowed if subjects have been on a stable dose for at least three months prior to receiving the first doses of GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide. 6.11.2. Prohibited Medications and Non -Drug Therapies 6.11.2.1. Prohibited Medications Subjects should not receive other anti -cancer therapy [including chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , investigational therap y, or hormonal therapy (othe r than leuprolide or other luteinizing hormone -releasing hormone ( LHRH) agonists/antagonists)] while on treatment in this study . Requirement for additional systemic anti -cancer therapy will necessitate permanent discontinuation of study drugs. Subjects ma y continue to use Aspirin, but doses are not allowed to be greater than 81 mg per day (or 100 mg, as per country standards) . The use of non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will be excluded, except for when NSAIDs will provide benefit over other analgesics and then to be used with caution including concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors . Subjects taking enz yme-inducing antiepileptic agents or other potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 enzy mes should be transitioned to another agent at least 14 day s (or 5 half -lives, whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study agents."
72,page_72,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 73Anticoagulants at therapeutic doses (e.g., warfarin, direct thrombin inhibitors, etc.) are PROHIBITED from seven day s prior to the first dose of study drug through com pletion of the End of Treatment visit. L ow dose (prophy lactic) anticoagulants are permitted provided that the subject’s PT/PTT values meet entry criteria. As described in Section 4.6, enzalutamide is an inducer of CYP3A, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 at therapeutic concentrations. Medications that have a narrow therapeutic index and that are substrates of CYP3A or CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 should be avoided, as their metabolism may be affected b y co-administration with enzalutamide and result in decreased exposure. 6.11.2.2. Prohibited Non -Drug Therapies Non-drug anti -cancer therapies (e.g., radiation therap y, surgery , and/or tumor embolization) will not be permitted from the screening visit through the post -study follow -up visit. NOTE : Sub jects may receive focal palliative (e.g., for management of pain or other local sy mptom) radiation treatment and/or surgical intervention during this study . Target lesions used for response assessment may not receive focal palliative therap y. An y proposed focal therap y must be approved by the investigator and the Medical Monitor prior to intervention. Subjects will abstain from using herbal preparations/medications throughout the study until the final study visit. Herbal products include, but are not limite d to: St. John’s Wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, deh ydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), y ohimbe, saw palmetto, ginseng, and marijuana. 6.11.2.3. Cautionary Medications Subjects should minimize the use of medications which contain acetaminophen. If a subject requires medication for h yperemesis, due to the potential of serotonin 5 -HT3 receptor antagonists to increase QTcF, p alonosetron (administered per the prescribing information) and oral ondansetron (up to a maximum oral dose of 8 mg TID) are the onl y allowe d drugs in this class (dolasetron and granisetron are not permitted). Drugs with a low risk of causing QTc prolongation (e.g., aprepitant) may be used without restriction. Co-administration of GSK525762 and medications which may have an increased risk of Torsades de Pointes requires extreme caution beginning 14 day s prior to the first dose of study drug until discontinuation from the study . Please reference current list of medications at crediblemeds.org . After starting cautionary medications such as any listed in the refe renced internet link , it is recommended that ECGs are implemented daily until the stead y state of the new medication is reached. If there are ECG abnormalities, implement additional cardiotoxicity monitoring as addressed Appendix 2 . As described in Section 4.6, abiraterone is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 at therapeutic concentrations. Medications that have a narrow therapeutic index and tha t are"
73,page_73,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 74substrates of CYP2C8 or CYP2D6 should be administered with caution, as their metabolism may be affected by co-administration with abiraterone and result in increased exposure. These include thiazolidinediones (e.g., rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) and repaglinide and thioridazine. GSK525762 is a moderate CYP3A4 inducer. Medications that have a narrow therapeutic index and that are substrates of CYP3A4 should be administered with caution, as their metabolism may be affected by co-administration with GSK52 5762 and result in decreased exposure. These include alfentanil, cy closporine, dihy droergotamine, ergotamine, fentan yl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, and theophy lline. GSK525762 is a substrate for breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transporters. Therefore, potent inhibitors of these transporters, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or ketoconazole, should be avoided. GSK525762 i san inhibitor of organic anion transporter 1A1 (OAT1) and organic anion transporter 3 ( OAT3) in vitro. Substrates of these transporters include agents such as methotrexate, penicillin G, and indomethacin. While co -administration of these agents with GSK525762 is not prohibited, they should be used with caution and additional monitoring for a dverse effects should be utilized. Questions regarding concomitant medications should be directed to the Medical Monitor for clarification. 7. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immediate safe ty concerns. Therefore, adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the Time and Events Table, are essential and required for stud y conduct.

Screening and Critical Baseline A ssessments All subjects must sign written I nformed Consent prior to the commencement of any study specific screeni ng procedures. Consent may be obtained up to 28days prior to Week 1 Day 1. Subjects will have a screening period of up to 28days prior to Week 1 Day 1. Evaluations obtained as part of routine medical care and performed during the screening period may be used in place of protocol -specific evaluations. I n addition, disease specific assessments performed within a specified time frame prior to informed consent may be used for the stud y-such as biopsy specimens, prior scans (if done within 28 day s) and ECHO (i f done within 35 day s). Subjects will acknowledge and agree to the possible use of this information for the study by giving informed consent. A patient who is screened but not enrolled, e.g. because entry criteria were not met or enrollment did not occur w ithin the specified time, may be considered for screening again if, for example there is a change in the patient’s medical background or a modification of study entry criteria The following procedures will be performed at the screening visit: Obtain writt en informed consent before an y other study -related procedures are performed. Cardiovascular medical history /risk factors (as detailed in the eCRF) will be assessed at screening. Demographic parameters will be captured: year of birth, sex, race and ethnicit y. Medical/medication/family history will be assessed as related to the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed in Section 5.Medical, surgical, and treatment history including date of first diagnosis, start and sto p dates of treatment/therap y, best response to prior s ystemic therap y, histology, disease progression details (radiological and/or biological) as defined per PCWG3 criteria, and current sites of disease will be taken as part of the medical history and dise ase status. Details concerning concomitant medication will be recorded starting from screening through post -study follow -up. At a minimum, the drug name, route of administration, dose and frequency of dosing, along with start and stop dates should be recor ded. An unscheduled visit may be performed at any time during the study at the request of the patient or as deemed necessary by the investigator. The date and reason for the unscheduled visit will be recorded on the eCRF as well as an y other data obtained (adverse events, concomitant medications and treatments, and results from procedures or tests). Procedures conducted as part of the subject’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood count, imaging studies, etc.) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be utilized for Screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol - defined criteria and has been performed in the timeframe of the study .

Critical Baseline A ssessments Baseline imaging is required for all subjects at screening, as follows: All subjects should have a contrast -enhanced (oral and IV) CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed .Baseline characterization of target -and non - target lesions should be performed as described in Appendix 5 . For subjects with a contraindication to contrast -enhanced CT (e.g., documented allergy to iodinated contrast), then other modalities, such as non -enhanced CT of the chest and gadolinium -enhanced MRI of th e abdomen and pelvis, may be used after discussion with the medical monitor. At each post -baseline assessment, re - evaluation of the site(s) of disease identified b y these scans, using the same imaging modality , is required. An MRI of the brain will be requ ired at baseline, and subjects with untreated central nervous s ystem (CNS) disease will be excluded as described in Section 5.2. A baseline tumor biopsy sample is required for all subjects, as follows: Archival tissue is permitted; however, if no archival tissue is available then a fresh biopsy specimen should be provided. 7.2.2. Visit Windows With the implementation of amendment 04, specific assessments and collection of survival follow -up data will no longer be requir ed. Please see Section 7.1for further details. Screening (baseline to pre -dose ): Screening echocardiogram or MUGA scan should be completed within 35 days prior to first dose of study drugs . All other assessments should be co mpleted within 28days prior to first dose of study drugs. Screening labs collected outside of the 72 -hour window prior to the first dose of study treatment must be repeated before confirming eligibility and completing first dose. Clinical labs performed d uring screening within 72 hours of first dose do not need to be repeated on Day 1. Week 1: Visits for Week 1 Day 1 must be performed on the day indicated. During dose escalation, Week 1 Day 4 assessment may be ± 1 day based on subject and clinic schedule. Week 2: Based on subject and clinic schedule, assessments can be ± 2 days. Week 3: Assessments on Week 3 Day 1 may be delay ed up to 2 day s. During dose escalation, assessments on Week 3 Day 4 may be scheduled ± 2 day s. Note: The Week 3 Day 1 PK collection is timed to permit evaluation of GSK525762 PK at stead y-state dosing (at least 7 consecutive day s dosing prior to collection) . If a subject is not receiving GSK525762 on Week 3 Day 1 as a consequence of a planned drug holiday , then serial PK collection sh ould occur between Week 2 Day 4 and Week 2 Day"

If subject is not receiving GSK525762 on Week 3 Day 1 due to toxicity , then serial PK collection should be rescheduled for a later time point when the subject is aga in being dosed for at least 7 consecutive day s, and the alternate collection date noted in the eCRF. However, in this case a single pre -dose sample should still be collected to evaluate for abiraterone/enzalutamide trough concentration. Weeks 4, 5, and 9: Clinic visits may be scheduled ± 2 day s. The first disease assessment may be scheduled ± 7 day s. Every 4 -week and 8 -week visits after Week 9 until Week 49: After the first disease assessment has been completed, then the clinic visits can be scheduled 7days.During visits with planned PK sample collection, for subjects in the alternate dosing schedule or who have interrupted dosing , the collect ionshould be postponed until the subject has received at least 7 consecutive doses of GSK525762 . Every 12 w eek visits after Week 49: Visit assessments, with the exceptions to limited laboratory sampling as referenced in Section 7.1, will adjust to every 12-weeks, based on clinical judgment. Every 12-week clinic visit s can be scheduled 7 day s. End of Treatment (EOT) visit : should be within 30 day s from last dose of study drugs. If a subject is unable to return to the clinic due to hospitalization, site staffs are encouraged to telephone the subject for assessment of adverse events. 7.3. Safet y Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). Additional time points for safet y tests may be added during the course of the study based on newl y available data to ensure appropriate safet y monitoring.

Clinical Safet y Laboratory Assessments All protocol required laboratory assessments, as defined in Table 11, must be conducted in accordance with the Laboratory Manual, and Protocol Time and Events Schedule. Laboratory requisit ion forms must be completed and samples must be clearly labelled with the subject number, protocol number, site/centre number, and visit date. Details for the preparation and shipment of samples will be provided b y the laboratory and are detailed in the S RM. Reference ranges for all safety parameters will be provided to the site by the laboratory responsible for the assessments. If additional non -protocol specified laboratory assessments are performed at the institution’s local laboratory and result in a c hange in subject management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g., SAE or AE or dose modification) the results must be recorded in the eCRF. Some laboratory assessments can vary throughout the day . It is recommended but not mandated that laboratory assessments are collected at approximately the same time on each clinic day . Refer to the SRM for appropriate processing and handling of samples to avoid duplicate and/or additional blood draws. From the first dose of GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide until 14 day s after the last dose of study treatment, all laboratory tests with abnormal values that are considered clinically significant should be repeated as clinically indicated until the values return to normal (per institutio nal guidelines) or back to the pre -study baseline. If such values do not return to normal within a period judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified."

89,page_89,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 90AEs will also be assessed using select items from the Patient -Report ed Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO -CTCAE) Item L ibrary (Version 1.0) for select subjects, based on the availability of translated versions. The investigator and their designees are responsible for detecting, docu menting and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. 7.3.6.1. Time period and Frequency for collecting A E and SA E information AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of informed consent until the end of stud y visit (see Section 7.3.6.3 ), at the time points specified in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of study treatment but after obtaining info rmed consent may be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF. Any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow -up contact. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to GSK or designee within 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 8 . Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify GSK or designee. NOTE: The method of recording, evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs plus procedures for completing and transmi tting SAE reports to GSK are provided in Appendix 8 . 7.3.6.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the sub ject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include: “How are you feeling?” “Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact?” “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in t his study , since y our last visit/contact?” 7.3.6.3. Follo w-up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non -serious AEs of special interest (as defin ed in Appendix 8 will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes,"
90,page_90,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 91until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 5.4). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 8 . 7.3.6.4. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in Appendix 8 and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV eCRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the eCRF within o ne week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 7.3.6.5. Other sentinel events Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis), or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline , that are felt to be clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator are to be recorded as an AE or SAE, in accordance with the definitions provided. In addition, an associated AE or SAE is to be recorded for an y laborato ry test result or other safet y assessment that led to an intervention, including permanent discontinuation of study treatment, dose reduction, and/or dose interruption/delay . Any new primary cancer must be reported as a SAE. 7.3.6.6. Regulatory Reporting Requiremen ts for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to GSK or designee of SAEs and non -serious AEs related to stud y treatment (even for non -interventional post -marketing studies) is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safet y of a product under clinical investigation are met. GSK has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authorit y and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. GSK will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authorit y, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and investigators. Investigator safety reports are prepared for sus pected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and GSK policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary ."
91,page_91,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 92An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other specific safet y information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from GSK will file it with the IB and will notify the I RB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 7.3.7. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female partners of male subjects will be collected after th e start of dosing and until at least 16 weeks post-last dose. If a pregnancy is reported then the investigator should inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 12 . While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE. 7.4. Pharmacokinetics With the implementation of amendme nt 04, PK samples will no longer be collected. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) anal ysis of abiraterone/enzalutamide and GSK525762 (including relevant metabolite(s)) will be collected at the time points indicated in Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10. The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Subjec ts should be instructed to withhold their dose of orall y administered study drugs, including GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide , until after the pre -dose pharmacokinetic blood sample is collected. The timing of PK samples may be altered and/or PK sampl es may be obtained at additional time points to ensure thorough PK monitoring. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic anal ysis should be collected at the time of a SAE whenever possible. Plasma analy sis will be performed under the supervision of GlaxoSmithKline by an external vendor, the details of which will be included in the SRM. Concentrations of GSK525762 (plus an y relevant metabolite(s)) and abiraterone/enzalutamide will be determined in plasma samples using the currentl y approved bioanalytical methodolog y. Raw data will be archived at the bioanal ytical site (detailed in the SRM). Details of PK blood sample collection, processing, storage and shipping procedures are provided in the SRM. 7.5. Pharmacody namics With the implementation of amendment 04, tumor sampl es will no longer be collected. Tumor samples will be collected pre -dose and on -treatment in order to evaluate c hanges in molecular markers of BET inhibition (e.g., expression of RNA/proteins regulated b y BET) and AR signalling."
92,page_92,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 937.5.1. Tumor Biopsy Collection/Sur gical Procedures In the dose escalation and expansion cohort(s), paired fresh biopsies must be provided pre-(within 28days of the first dose) and on -treatment at the time points indicated from all the subjects. An y fresh on -treatment biops y should be acc ompanied by a whole blood sample collected as close as possible to the time of biopsy (preferabl y within 1h). Subjects providing an on -treatment fresh tumor biopsy must have received at least 4 consecutive day s of GSK525762 prior to the collection of the s ample. Further details regarding sample t ype and processing will be provided in the SRM. I f a potential subject does not have disease amenable to biopsy , participation may occur onl y upon discussion with and approval of the medical monitor; in this situati on, an archival tumor sample retrieved after completion of most recent ADT will be required. Subje cts must have a platelet count of ≥75,000/mm3 and a PT, INR and aPTT that are WNL within 48 hours prior to the post -dose biopsy or an y other planned surgical procedure. If the on therapy biops y is not performed during the defined timeline due to lab abnorm alities or subject status, it should be performed after subject recovery and the next visit as agreed upon with the medical monitor. Further details regarding sample t ype and processing will be provided in the SRM. 7.6. Evaluation of A nti-Cancer Activity With t he implementation of amendment 0 4, CT , MRI, and Bone scan data will no longer be required for disease assessment , and samples for PSA ad CTC -ENU will no longer be collected. See the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1) for the u pdated schedule of assessments. Disease assessment should be managed according to local standard of care. The baseline disease assessment will be completed prior to the first dose of GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide (or first dose of lead in abirater one/enzalutamide). All imaging to support anti -cancer activity will occur every 8 weeks start of therap y for the first 6 months of treatment and then every 12 weeks thereafter until completion of study treatment. Assessment of PSA will occur every 4 weeks until completion of treatment. Evaluation of CTC will occur at Week 5 and then at Week 9 and every 8 weeks thereafter. All evaluations will occur at the final study visit. See the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1) for the schedule of assessments of anti -cancer activity . Assessments must be performed on a calendar schedule and should not be affected by dose interruptions/delay s. For post -baseline assessments, a window of 5 -7 day s is permitted to allow for flexible scheduling (see Section 7.2.2 ). If the last radiographic assessment was more than 14 day s prior to the subject’s withdrawal from study and progressive disease has not been documented, a disease assessment s hould be obtained at the time of withdrawal from study . Subjects enrolled with measurable disease b y PCWG3 -modified RECI SIT 1.1 (Appendix 5 ) and whose disease responds (either CR or PR) should have a confirmatory disease assessment performed no less than 4 weeks after the date of assessment during which the response was demonstrated. The next assessment"
93,page_93,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 94following a confirmatory disease assessment should follow the regular schedule, occurring approximately 4 weeks after the confirmatory assessment. To ensure comparabilit y between the baseline and subsequent assessments, the same method of assessment and the same technique will be used when assessing response. 7.6.1. Disease Progression Endpoint The disease progression endp oint is defined b y 1 or more of the following criteria: Radiographic progression in by PCWG3 -modified RECI ST 1.1 for subjects with measurable disease Bone progression on bone scan according to the PCWG3 criteria (Section 7.6.3 ). PSA progression according to the PCWG3 criteria (Section 7.6.2)accompanied by any of the following: investigator -defined clinical progression or either of the above RECI ST 1.1 or bone progress ion. Subjects are not required to discontinue treatment on the basis of meeting PSA progression alone. In assessing clinical activity which demonstrates a clinically meaningful primary response rate, this is defined as follows: A response rate of 30% at 1 2 weeks or later, relative to a 10% response rate sugges ting no activity . This will be conducted by testing the null hy pothesis that P0<=0.1 versus the alternative that P1 ≥0.3, assuming the maximum response rate for an ineffective drug is 10% and the minimum response rate for an effective drug is 30%. These h ypotheses are based on observations from a meta -analysis study in subjects who had received prior ADT both in chemo -naïve and prior chemotherap y setting. Chemo - naïve subjects treated with a second ADT (L2 subjects) had rates of ≥50% PSA decline ranging from 25.5% to 36%. Subjects treated with both prior ADT and chemotherap y (Lx subjects) had variable responses of ≥50% PSA which ranged from 4% to 26% in studies with larger subject populations (>30 subjects per study ).Based on these findings, and considering a mixed population (L 2 plus L x) in both arms of the study , it is hy pothesized that a response rate ≤10% would indicate no benefit for the combination of ADT failure, while a response rate of ≥30% in patients who just progressed on prior ADT will indicate there is a benefit that can be further explored [ Chi, 2015]. 7.6.2. PSA Response per PCWG3 Criteria Only subjects who have a baseline PSA value and at least one post -baseline assessment will be included in the analy sis of PSA r esponse. PSA Response Rate is defined as proportion of subjects with a decrease of 50% in the PSA concentration from the baseline PSA value determined at least 12 weeks after start of treatmen t and confirmed after ≥4weeks b y an additional PSA evaluation. PSA progression [ Scher , 2016] is defined as:"
94,page_94,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 95If there has been a decline from baseline : time from start of therap y to first PSA increase that is 25% and 2ng/mL in absolute value from the nadir, and which is confirmed b y a second value 3 or more weeks later (i.e., a confirmed rising trend) at least 12 weeks after the start of treatment If there has NOT been a decline from baseline : time from start of ther apy to first PSA increase that is 25% and 2ng/mL in absolute value from the baseline value, determined at least 12 weeks after start of treatment 7.6.3. Radiographic Response per PCWG3 Criteria Lesion assessment method and timing, evaluation of disease, diseas e progression and response will be conducted according to PCWG3 -modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST1.1) [ Scher , 2016; Eisenhauer , 2009] as outlined below and in Appendix 5 of this protocol. Disease assessment modalities may include imaging (CT scan, MRI, bone scan, plain radiograph y) and ph ysical examination (as indicated for palpable/superficial lesions). C ontrast -enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at each disease assessment timepoint is the preferred imaging modality . The same medical imaging modality with the same contrast media should be used for each time point. However, subjects with contrain dication to CT may have other modalities performed as clinically indicated. GSK requires sites to provide electronic copies (upload digital images or images on CD) of scans for all subjects for central storage which may be transferred to a central independ ent imaging center. This includes baseline scans and all scans performed during the course of the study . Evaluation of response and rPFS will be made by the Investigator/site radiologist. GSK may request an independent review of scans. See the SRM for addi tional details. With the implementation of amendment 04, transfer of scans to a central facility is no longer required. Bone progression will be determined as the appearance of 2 new lesions on bone scan and at least an additional 2 bone lesions at the ne xt scan (every 8 weeks). The date of progression is the date of the first scan that indicates the change. Subjects should not be discontinued from study treatment(s) due to the occurrence of bone scan changes in the first 12 weeks that do not meet PCWG3 gu idelines for progression. 7.6.4. Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) per PCWG3 Criteria Baseline CTC enumeration will be asses sed. Unfavorable will be defined as ≥5/7.5mL of blood compared to favorable <5/7.5mL of blood. The number of conversations from unfavorable CTC to favorable CTC will be assessed. Absolute percent change of CTC from baseline will also be assessed. 7.7. Translat ional Research After completion of the clinical trial and/or of an y Interim Anal ysis, investigations may be performed on samples collected during the course of the trial to detect factors or profiles that correlate with response to treatment with the combi nation of GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide or with tumor progression status. The results gained may also be applied to medically related conditions ."
95,page_95,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 96Unless stated otherwise, these investigations may be performed irrespective of whether a response to GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide in combination is observed. Comparative examination of pre -dosing profiles of participants may uncover known or novel candidate biomarkers/profiles which could be used to predict response to treatment with GSK525762 a nd abiraterone/enzalutamide in combination or provide new insights into tumor progression and medically related conditions. Comparative examination of post-dosing profiles in conjunction with pre -dosing profiles may yield known and novel candidate biomarke rs/profiles and new insights which relate to the action of GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide in combination. All samples will be retained for a maximum of 15 y ears after the last subject completes the trial . Novel candidate biomarkers and subsequentl y discovered biomarkers of the biological response associated with tumor progression or medically related conditions and/or the action of GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide in combination may be identified by application of: DNA/gene, RNA and/or protei n anal ysis of tumor tissue or circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Circulating cell free -DNA/RNA anal ysis of blood/plasma. Protein analy sis of plasma and/or tumor tissue samples. 7.7.1. Tumor Biomarker A nalysis To further characterize the subject population, DNA, RNA and/or protein measurements may be utilized to identify predictors of sensitivity or resistance to GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide in combination utilizing baseline tissue (archival tissue or a recent biops y) and tissue obtained at disease progressi on. Amplification of AR and expression of AR -variants (AR -Vs) will be retrospectivel y anal yzed to evaluate correlation with clinical response. 7.7.2. Tumor Tissue With the implementation of amendment 04, tumor samples will no longer be collected. If consent is p rovided b y the subject, an optional progression biopsy (fresh tumor tissue) for subjects who initially responded to combination therapy and then progressed is requested in order to better understand the mechanism of resistance. It is preferable to obtain t he progression biopsy from a new lesion or a lesion which had previously responded and then progressed. Biops y samples from other lesions will be accepted as well. Both soft tissue and bone biopsies will be accepted. Details on sample collection, processin g, storage and shipping procedures for all samples are provided in the SRM. Samples will be analy zed using appropriate technologies including, but not limited to, RNAseq, exome or targeted DNA sequencing, Immunohistochemistry (IHC), and/or quantitative rev erse transcription poly merase chain reaction (qRT -PCR)."
96,page_96,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 97Samples will be analy zed at GSK or a laboratory associated with GSK and retained for a maximum of 15 y ears after the last subject completes the trial. 7.7.3. Circulating Tumor Cells With the implementation of amendment 04, blood samples for CTC enumeration will no longer be collected. Blood samples will be collected and analy zed to enumerate CTCs in circulation at the time points indicated in the Time and Events Tables (Section 7.1). The CTCs may also be utilized for additional analy sis like alterations in AR genes and may include additional genes implicated in the prostate cancer or related to AR signaling pathway . If subject withdraws consent for further treat ment and data collection, all samples collected for the biomarker anal ysis at the time of withdrawal will still proceed for analysis to meet the intended objectives defined in this protocol. Details on sample collection, processing, storage and shipping pr ocedures for all blood and tissue samples are provided in the SRM. 7.7.3.1. CTC Conversion Rate CTC enumeration will be performed at a central laboratory using the anal ytically valid CellSearch s ystem. For subjects with baseline CTC counts of 5 cells per 7.5 mL of blood, a conversion is defined as a decline in the CTC count to <5 cells per 7.5 mL of blood. Genetic analy sis of CTCs may also be performed by other laboratories. 7.7.4. Circulating -Free Tumor DNA /RNA and Soluble Markers With the implementation of amendment 04, blood samples for cfDNA and soluble markers will no longer be collected. Tumor -specific cfDNA levels detected in plasma or serum have been found to correlate with increasing tumor burden and decline following therapy . Furthermore, cfDNA in cancer subject s can harbor many genetic alterations (mutations, microsatellite alterations, aberrant meth ylation), which are generally consistent with the tumor. Thus, tumor - specific circulating cfDNA has the potential to be a useful biomarker of therapeutic response as well as offering a less invasive blood based technique for identify ing predictive biomarkers. Additionally exosomes, released from tumors cells into circulation, contain both DNA and RNA; therefore, exosomes may serve as an additional source of predictive biomarkers or facilitate enrichment thereof. Plasma samples for anal ysis of cfDNA/RNA and soluble markers will be collected at the time points provided in the Time and Events Tables in Section 7.1. If subject withdraws consent for further treatment and data collection, all samples collected for the biomarker anal ysis at the time of withdrawal will still proceed for analysis to meet the intended objectives defined in this protocol. Details on sample collection, processing, storage and shipping procedures for all plasma samples are provided in the SRM."
97,page_97,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 987.8. Genetics With the implementation of amendment 04, if a subject has consented for PGx research but the sample has yet to be collected, this will no longer be require d. An important objective of the clinical study is PGx research. Participation in PGx is optional but all subjects who are eligible for the clinical study will be given the opportunity to participate. Subjects may decline participation without effect on th eir medical care or care during the clinical study . A separate consent signature is required for PGx research. Subjects who provide consent will have a blood sample taken for anal ysis. The presence/absence of genetic variations in host DNA from blood will be analy zed to determine their relationship with response (safet y, tolerability , pharmacokinetics, and efficacy ) to treatment with GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide . 7.9. Value Evidence and Outcomes 7.9.1. PRO -CTCA E With the implementation of amendment 04, the PR O-CTCAE will no longer be completed. Select items of the Patient -Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO -CTCAE ) Item Library (version 1.0) will be administered to select subjects based on the availability of tra nslated versions. 7.9.2. EORTC -QLQ -C30, EORTC -QLQ -PR25 & Brief Pain Inventor y – Short Form (BPI -SF) With the implementation of amendment 04, the quality of life questionnaires will no longer be completed. The effect of GSK525762 and abiraterone/enzalutamide, when given in combination, on symptoms and quality of life will be assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life questionnaire, the EORTC - QLQ -PR25, for evaluating prostate cancer, and the Brief Pain Inven tory-Short Form (BPI -SF). These quality of life tools will be assessed as scheduled in Section 7.1. 8. DATA MANAGEMENT For this study , subject data will be entered into GSK defined eCRFs, transmitted electronicall y to GSK or designee and combined with data provided from other sources in a validated data s ystem. Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable GSK standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data, e.g., removing errors and inconsistencies in the data. Adverse events and concomitant medications terms will be coded using MedDRA ( Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) and an internal validated medication dictionary , GSKDrug."
98,page_98,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 99Electronic CRFs (eC RF) (including queries and audit trails) will be retained by GSK, and copies will be sent to the investigator to maintain as the investigator cop y. Subject initials will not be collected or transmitted to GSK according to GSK policy . 9. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND DA TA ANALYSES Amendment 04 applies to all global stud y sites. These changes are based on the decision to close out the study and stop all new enrolment as the study met protocol defined interim futility . With the implementation of amendment 04, s pecific assessments and collection of survival follow -up data will no longer be required. Please see Section 7.1for further details. The study will conclude when the last subject has completed/discontinued study treatment and completed the end of treatment visit. Any changes to the planned anal yses outlined below will be covered in the Reporting and Analy sis Plan (RAP). 9.1. Hypotheses 9.1.1. Dose escalation With respect to the primary objectives and endpoints, no specific statistical hy potheses are being tested. The primary focus will be on determining the recommended dose for further exploration, based upon the safet y, PK and efficacy profiles of GSK 525762 plus abiraterone or enzalutamide in subjects with CRPC . 9.1.2. Dose expansion cohorts The goal of the trial is to characterize the dose -response curve for both efficacy and safet y and to identify whether there is a dose of GSK525762 with an acceptable combination of efficacy and safet y. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the clinica lly meaningful response rate (% of subjects achieving PSA reduction from baseline ≥50%) at 12 weeks and/or thereafter for the subjects treated at each dose level. The critical safet y endpoint for evaluation in this trial is the percentage of subjects at dose level d who had dose modification due to drug related AEs. The dose modificatio n rate R is a weighted average of the rate of different types of dose modifications: R=0.6R1+ 0.2R2+0.2R3, where R1 is the rate that subjects who withdrew from study treatment due to drug -related adverse events, R2 is the rate that subjects who had dose re ductions due to drug -related adverse events, R3 is the rate that subjects who had dose interruptions due to drug -related adverse events. If a subject had more than one t ype of dose modifications, it will only be counted once in calculation of R and will be counted in the most severe modification category (withdrawal > reduction > interruption). A response rate of 30% or greater is desired while 10% represents a response rate that is clinically unacceptable. With respect to dose modification rate R, a dose m odification rate of 12% or greater represents a dose with unacceptable tolerability ."
99,page_99,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 100If R is lower than 12%, a withdrawal rate higher than 10% also represents a dose with unacceptable tolerability . The response rate and dose modification rate will be join tly assessed using a utility function. For each dose expansion cohort the utility (dU) will be calculated and used for decision making at each interim anal ysis and final anal ysis. At the end of each arm, the dose with the highest probability of having clinically significant utility score may be picked as the RP2D. The totality of the data will be used to assess which dose will be picked as the RP2D. Further details of the calculation of utility function will be provided in RAP. The dose expansion cohort st age of the stud y will employ a Bayesian predictive adaptive design that allows the trial to be monitored more frequentl y at multiple stages. Bayesian statistics will be employ ed to calculate the expected utility of the dose (dU) is greater than the clinica lly significant minimum utility (CSMU) at interim for each dose. The interim anal ysis will be conducted for each individual dose and it may be conducted when at least 10 evaluable subjects are available for a given dose. After the first interim analysis,the interim analy sis can be conducted after every 10 additional subjects become evaluable. The evaluable subjects are defined as the subjects who have had the week 12 or later PSA results or have progressed (per PSA result) or died or permanently disconti nued from the study treatment . For the separate interim looks in each combination in expansion cohort, the enrolment for that cohort may be stopped due to futility if the posterior probability that the utility (dU) >CSMU ( 25) is small (e.g., less than a 4% chance for the utility to be larger than the CSMU). The totality of the data including safet y/tolerability and primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be used to decide whether to stop enrolment within a cohort at an interim analy sis.At the final analysis for each dose combination, the dose will be claimed positive if the posterior probability that the utility (dU) >CSMU ( 25) is at least 20%. However, determination of whether to pursue future development of GSK525762 plus abiraterone or enzalutam ide will be based on the totality of the data including safet y/tolerability , PK, PD and all efficacy endpoints. No formal h ypotheses are set up to compare the activity between the two dose levels. The difference of PSA response rate , composite response ra te and DCR through 24 weeks between two dose levels within the same combination will be reported. The maximum utility dose which is defined as the dose with the highest probability of having clinically significant utility in the same arm will be recommend ed as RP2D for each combination, respectively . The details of the utility function calculations will be discussed in RAP. This calculation is for guidance only , the final decision of RP2D will be based on totality of data."

Sampl e Size A ssumptions Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled/randomized into each combination arms (based on prior therap y) with up to 30 at each DL to collect safet y/tolerability , PK, PD, and clinical activity data. Additional subjects may be enrolled at, or bel ow the combination doses, in order to collect additional safet y and PK data. To determine the maximum sample size for each dose level in dose expansion cohort, Bayesian predictive adaptive design will be used for testing h ypotheses and sample size determi nation: H0: RR≤10% HA: RR≥30% Enrollment into specific cohorts may be halted early based on results from interim analyses incorporating emerging response data. Response data from a minimum of 10 evaluable subjects will be required in a cohort before it may discontin ue enrollment for futility . Data from evaluable subjects treated in the dose escalation cohorts will be analyzed together with expansion cohort subjects treated at the same dose in the same combination for futility analy sis. Simulation studies were conduc ted to evaluate the performance of the Bay esian design using utility function defined in Section 9.1.2 under various assumptions for the distribution of true RR and DL T rates across the cohorts. Operating charac teristics including power, ty pe I error, estimation of the RR, and the probability of halting enrollment at interim analy ses were assessed. When the treatment effect is positive, the design maintains at least 80% power and t ype I error rate ≤0.10 on indivi dual cohort. If both dose level are positive, the chance of advancing to phase 2 is as high as 90%. For more details, please see Section 9.4.6 . 9.2.2. Sample Size Sensitivity Sample size sensitivity assessments are de scribed in the simulations presented in Section 9.4.6 . 9.2.3.

RR will be reported for each cohort alo ng with the exact 95% confidence interval. Waterfall plots will be presented (as per PCWG3 recommendations) that show the maximum percentage of change in PSA from baseline. The following secondary responses will also be considered for drawing conclusions on the clinical activity of the combination(s): Disease Control Rate at 24 weeks Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of subjects with SD , PR or CR at ≥24 weeks . Subjects with unknown or missing response will be treated as non - responders (i.e. these subjects will be included in the denominator when calculating the percentage). Duration of PSA response Duration of PSA response is calculated from the tim e the PSA value first declines b y at least 50% of the Week 1 Day 1 (baseline) value (must be confirmed by a second value) until the time there is an increase of 25% of PSA nadir, provided the absolute increase is at least 2 ng/mL. The increase must be conf irmed by a second consecutive measurement that is at least 25% above the nadir. If the PSA never shows a 25% increase over the nadir value, then the patient will be censored at the last PSA measurement. Duration of PSA response will be summarised by the me dian and presented along its 95% confidence interval. ORR The objective response (ORR) rate is defined as the percentage of subjects with a confirmed complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) at an y time as per PCWG3 - modified RECI ST 1.1 ( Appendix 5 ). Subjects with unknown or missing response will be treated as non -responders, i.e. these subjects will be included in the denominator when calculating the percentage.

108,page_108,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 1099.4.6.2. Software Details Simulations were conducted by the R code provided by Berry Consultants. For each assumed scenario, 1,000 sets of trials were simu lated. Posterior distributions were estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods using 10,000 iterations for each analysis, discarding the first 1,000 iterations for each anal ysis as burn -in. 9.4.6.3. Trial Sample Size and Simulation Scenarios Sample size require ments for halting enrolment at interim analy ses for simulations is based on the number of subjects enrolled; while in practice, they will be based on the number of subjects with available response data. This discrepancy is due to software feasibility , but should not have a significant impact on operating characteristics of the design. Simulations assumed the first interim analysis occurring once 10 evaluable subjects in the same cohort at the same dose level have been enrolled. An average of 5 subjects per month per cohort is assumed. The time from subject entry until the response assessment was performed is assumed to be 12 weeks. For each dose, a maximum 6 subjects will be assigned to the dose escalation stage and if that dose is safe to expand, a maximum of 30 subjects will be assigned to each cohort in total. Although actual enrollment may vary , the estimated enrollment rate of 5 subjects per month per cohort is incorporated into the simulations. It is also assumed that a dose with DLT rate 0.1, 0.3 and 0.4 will have dose modification rate R=0.05, 0.08 and 0.12, respectivel y. The real enrollment rate may vary from the assumed enrollment rate in simulation, but should not impact on operating characteristics of the design. Simulation scenarios and design c haracteristics for one cohort on two dose levels DL1 and DL2 are listed in Table 12under 1000 simulations. The DLT rates and RR listed are listed in the order of DL1 and DL2."

Operation Characteristics The probability of declaring a dose is efficacious and tolerable within an individual cohort if the dose is declared lower than MTD at end of dose escalation stage (power and type I erro r rate) per dose are examined across scenarios for the distribution of assumed true DLT rates and RRs for each dose in the same combination arm. Similar results are expected for the other combination arm. The power is the probability declaring a tolerable and efficacious dose when the true underly ing RR is larger than its corresponding historical control 0.1 and dose modification rate ≤0.12. Ty pe 1 error rate is the probability of declaring a tolerable and efficacious dose within an individual cohort when t he true underl ying response rate is equal to the historical control."
110,page_110,"2015N238310_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 111The power and t ype I error rate on individual dose level are calculated if the dose is determined to be lower than or equal to MTD at dose escalation stage. In the simulations that a par ticular dose is declared over MTD, it won’t be included in the calculation. When the dose is tolerable and efficacious, the design maintains at least 80% power. The t ype I error rate is controlled to <0.12. 9.4.6.5. Stopping Early Table 12also presents the proportion of trials that halt enrolment early for futility across simulation scenarios if expansion cohort starts. Since the stud y requires at least 10 evaluable subjects in a particular cohort at the same dose prior t o stopping early for futility , the ability for a cohort to stop early is largely dependent upon the projected maximum sample size and enrollment rate per cohort. Non-responsive cohorts stop earl y for futility between 55% and 61% of the time. Responsive c ohorts generally have lower than 10% chance stop early for futility . 9.4.6.6. Mean Proportion of advancing to Phase 2 To evaluate the design performance in making the decision of advancing to Phase 2, Table 12listed the probabilities of advancing an y or both of the two doses to Phase 2 after this study . In the scenario where both DLs are safe and positive, there is an 89.3% chance that at least one dose will be picked for RP2D. If the trial data indicates both doses are safe and positive, the utility function calculation discussed in Section 9.1.2 will be used as guidance to pick the best dose to take into Phase 2. When both dose levels are safe but not positive, there is 16% chance that at leas t one dose will be picked as RP2D. 10. STUDY GOVERNANCE CON SIDERATIONS 10.1.

Appendix 5: Guidelines for A ssessment of Disease, Disease Progression and Response Criteria –modified and adapted from PCWG3 guidelines [Scher, 2016] and RECIST 1.1 [Eisenhauer, 2009 ] 12.5.1. Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions All baseline lesion assessments must be performed within 28 day s of randomization. Lesions 10mm in the longest dimension are considered measurable. Lym ph nodes that ha ve a short axis of <10mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed. Lym ph nodes with <15mm and but 10mm short axis are considered pathologic according to clinical discretion, and nontarget Pathological l ymph nodes with 15mm s hort axis are considered measurable and can be selected as target lesions. Per PCWG3 guidelines, documentation of prior progression should be defined as growth of pre -existing lesions, development of new lesions, or both. Documentation of site of progressi on either in a single organ or disease site versus multiple sites should occur. Bone scan lesions should be identified and tracked independently . Per PCWG3 guidelines, documentation of nodal disease should be considered either loco-regional (pelvic) versus extrapelvic (e.g., retroperitoneal, mediastinal, thoracic, other). Visceral disease (e.g., lung/liver/CNS) should be documented separately from nodal disease. Up to 5 measurable lesions can be documented per site of spread (e.g., nodes, lung, liver as sep arate sites). Each of these lesions should be identified, recorded and measured at baseline. These lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either b yimaging techniques or clinicall y). Documentation of progression at entry into trial should be recording as PSA alone, bone with or without nodes by location, nodes by location only or viscera (or other sites). Note: Cystic lesions thought to represent c ystic metastases should not be selected as target lesions when other suitable target lesions are available. Note : Measurable lesions that have been previously irradiated and have not been shown to be progressing following irradiation should not be consider ed as target lesions. Bone scans are standard for PCWG3 guidelines, with documentation of absence or metastasis recorded at baseline. All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target and should also be recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions will be group b y organ. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up."
130,page_130,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 131The following are required at baseline: CT for Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis or MRI for Abdomen/ Pelvis .At each post baseline assessment, evaluations of the sites of disease identified b y these scans are required. Confirmation of CR and PR are required per protocol. Confirmation assessments must be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for res ponse have initially been met and may be performed at the next protocol scheduled assessment. If a confirmation assessment is performed prior to the next protocol schedule assessment, the next protocol scheduled evaluation is still required (e.g. evaluatio ns must occur at each protocol scheduled timepoint regardless of unscheduled assessments). A baseline brain scan is required for all subjects. For subjects without CNS disease at baseline, subsequent brain scans should only be performed as clinicall y indic ated (e.g. symptoms suggestive of CNS progression). 12.5.2. Assessment Guidelines Please note the following: The same diagnostic method, including use of contrast when applicable, must be used throughout the study to evaluate a lesion. Contrast agents must be us ed in accordance with the Image Acquisition Guidelines. All measurements should be taken and recorded in millimeters (mm), using a ruler or calipers. Ultrasound is not a suitable modality of disease assessment. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound, confirmation b y CT or MRI is required. Fluorodeox yglucose (FDG) -Positron emission tomograph y (PET) is generally not suitable for ongoing assessments of disease. However FDG -PET can be useful in confirming new sites of disease where a positive FDG -PET scan s correlates with the new site of disease present on CT/MRI or when a baseline FDG -PET was previously negative for the site of the new lesion. FDG -PET may also be used in lieu of a standard bone scan providing coverage allows interrogation of all likely sites of bone disease and FDG -PET is performed at all assessments. If PET/CT is performed then the CT component can only be used for standard response assessments if performed to diagnostic quality , which includes the required anatomical coverage and prescri bed use of contrast. The method of assessment should be noted as CT on the eCRF. Clinical Examination: Clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photograph y, including a ruler/calipers to measure the size of the lesion, is required [ Eisenhauer , 2009]. CT and MRI: Contrast enhanced CT with 5mm contiguous slices is recommended. Minimum size of a m easurable baseline lesion should be twice the slice thickness, with a minimum lesion size of 10 mm when the slice thickness is 5 mm.

Whenever possible the same scanner should be used [ Eisenhauer , 2009]. Brain Scan :If brain scans are required, then contrast enhanced MRI is preferable to contrast enhanced CT. 12.5.3. Guidelines for Evaluation of Disease Measurable and Non -measurable Definitions Measurable lesion: A non -nodal lesion that can be accuratel y measured in at leas t one dimension (longest dimension) of 10 mm with MRI or CT when the scan slice thickness is no greater than 5mm. I f the slice thickness is greater than 5mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion must be at least double the slice thickness (e.g., if the slice thickness is 10 mm, a measurable lesion must be 20 mm). 10 mm caliper/ruler measurement b y clinical exam or medical photography. 20 mm by chest x -ray. Additionally lymph nodes can be considered pathologicall y enlarged and measurable if 15mm in the short axis when assessed b y CT or MRI (slice thickness recommended to be no more than 5mm). At baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be measured [ Eisenhauer , 2009]. Non-measurable lesion: All other lesions including lesions too small to be considered measurable (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological l ymph nodes with ≥ 10 mm and <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions, which include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pe ricardial effusions , inflammatory breast disease, l ymphangitic involvement of the skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegal y identified by ph ysical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques ( Eisenhauer , 2009). Measurable disease : Measureable lesions are not required at study entry if subject meets PSA requirements for progression (rising PSA values at a minimum of 1 -week intervals or PSA doubling time with at least 3 values available ≥4 weeks apart). . Palpable lesions that are not measurable by radiologic or photographic evaluations may not be utilized as the only measurable lesion. Non-Measurable only disease : The presence of only non-measurable lesions."
132,page_132,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 13312.5.4. Response Criteria Evaluatio n of target lesions Each site of disease should be evaluated independently . Definitions for assessment of response for target lesion(s) are as follows: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. An y pathological lymph nodes must be <10mm in the short axis. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the baseline sum of the diameters (e.g. percent change from baseline). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkag e to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatme nt started (e.g. percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5mm. Not Applicable (NA): No target lesions at baseline. Not Evaluable (NE): Cannot be classified b y one of the five preceding definitions. Note: If lymph nodes are documented as target lesions the short axis is added into the sum of the diameters (e.g. sum of diameters is the sum of the longest diameters for no n- nodal lesions and the short axis for nodal lesions). When ly mph nodes decrease to non-pathological size (short axis <10mm) they should still have a measurement reported in order not to overstate progression. If at a given assessment time point all target lesions identified at baseline are not assessed, sum of the diameters cannot be calculated for purposes of assessing CR, PR, or SD, or for use as the nadir for future assessments. However, the sum of the diameters of the assessed lesions and the percent c hange from nadir should be calculated to ensure that progression has not been documented. If an assessment of PD cannot be made, the response assessment should be NE. All lesions (nodal and non -nodal) should have their measurements recorded even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). I f lesions are present but too small to measure, 5 mm should be recorded and should contribute to the sum of the diameters, unless it is likely that the lesion has disappeared in which case 0 mm should be reported. If a lesion disappears and reappears at a subsequent time point it should continue to be measured. The response at the time when the lesion reappears will depend upon the status of the other lesions. For example, if the disease had reached a CR status then PD would be documente d at the time of reappearance. However, if the response status was PR or SD, the diameter of the reappearing lesion should be added to the"
133,page_133,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 134remaining diameters and response determined based on percent change from baseline and percent change from nadir. Bone lesions with change in intensity of uptake alone do not constitute progression or regression. Pseudoprogression in the absence of sy mptoms or other signs of progression will be excluded. Bone lesion progression will require at least 2 new bone lesions on first post - treatment scan, with at least 2 additional bone lesions on the next scan. I n this instance, the date of the first scan will represent the date of bone progression. Evaluation of non -target lesions Definitions for assessment of response for non -target lesions are as follows: Complete Response (CR): The disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes identified as a site of disease at baseline must be non -pathological (e.g. <10 mm short axis). Non-CR/Non -PD: The persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) or ly mph nodes identified as a site of disease at baseline ≥ 10 mm short axis. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. Not Applicable (NA): No non -target lesions at baseline. Not Evaluable (NE ): Cannot be classified by one of the four preceding definitions. Note: In the presence of measurable disease, progression on the basis of solely non-target disease requires substantial worsening such that even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease , the overall tumor burden has increased sufficientl y to merit discontinuation of therapy . In the presence of non -measurable only disease consideration should be given to whether or not the increase in overall disease burden is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease. Sites of non -target lesions, which are not assessed at a particular timepoint based on the assessment schedule, should be excluded from the response determination (e.g. non-target res ponse does not have to be ""Not Evaluable""). New lesions New malignancies denoting disease progression must be unequivocal. Lesions identified in follow -up in an anatomical location not scanned at baseline are considered new lesions. Nodes that have progre ss to ≥10 mm to <15 mm are pathologic, subject to clinical discretion, and non -measurable. Previously normal l ymph nodes must have grown b y ≥5 mm in the short axis to be considered to have progressed."
134,page_134,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 135Any equivocal new lesions should continue to be follow ed. Treatment can continue at the discretion of the investigator until the next scheduled assessment. If at the next assessment the new lesion is considered to be unequivocal, progression should be documented. Evaluation of overall response Table 14presents the overall response at an individual time point for all possible combinations of tumor responses in target and non -target lesions with or without the appearance of new lesions for subjects with measurable disea se at baseline. Table 14 Evaluation of Overall Response for Subjects with Measurable Disease at Baseline Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response CR CR or NA No CR CR Non-CR/Non -PD or NE No PR PR Non-PD or N A or NE No PR SD Non-PD or NA or NE No SD NE Non-PD or NA or NE No NE PD Any Yes or No PD Any PD Yes or No PD Any Any Yes PD CR=complete response, PR = partial response, SD=stable disease, PD=progressive disease, NA= Not applicable, and NE=Not Evalua ble Note: Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having ""symptomatic deterioration."" Objective response status is determined b y evaluations of disease burden. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When th e evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy ) to confirm the CR. Evaluation of best overall response The best overall response is the best response recorded from t he start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence and will be determined programmatically by GSK based on the investigators assessment of response at each time point. To be assigned a status of SD, follow -up disease assessment must have met t he SD criteria at least once after first dose at a minimum interval of 49 day s. If the minimum time for SD is not met, best response will depend on the subsequent assessments. For example if an assessment of PD follows the assessment of SD and SD does not meet the minimum time requirement the best response will be PD."

Clinical outcomes vary by drug, with nearl y 50% fatalit y with halothane readministered within one month of initial inj ury. However, some drugs seldom result in recurrent liver injury or fatalit y. Risk factors for a fatal drug rechallenge outcome include: hypersensitivity with initial liver injury (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia) [Andrade ,2009] jaundice or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver injury (direct bilirubin >35% of total) subject currently exhibits severe liver injury defined by : ALT 3xUL N, bilirubin 2xUL N (direct bilirubin >35% of total), orINR1.5 serious adverse even t or fatality has earlier been observed with drug rechallenges [ Papay , 2009] evidence of drug -related preclinical liability (e.g. reactive metabolites; mitochondrial impairment [ Hunt , 2010]) Rechallenge refers to resuming study treatment following drug induced liver injury (DILI).

Definition of A dverse Events Adverse Event Definition: An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an yunfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Events meeting AE definition include: Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investi gator. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been pres ent prior to the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae). ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported a s an AE or SAE. However, the signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT meeting definition of an AE include: Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progres sion, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s"

Definitio n of Serious A dverse Events If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease, etc). Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitali zation are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elect ive treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in disability/incapacity NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions."

Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and the occurre nce of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the rela tionship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underly ing diseases, concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also con sult the I nvestigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an a ssessment of causality . There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for ev ery event prior to the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up"

Follow -up of A Es and SA Es The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested by GSK to eluci date as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obligated to assist. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or consultation with other health care professio nals. If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a copy of any post -mortem findings, including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the origi nally completed eCRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within the designated reporting time frames. 12.8.6. Reporting of SA Es to GSK SAE reporting to GSK via electronic data collection tool Primary mechanism for reporting SAEs to GSK wil l be the electronic data collection tool If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for greater than 24 hours, the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool and fax it to the SAE coordinator Site will enter the serious adverse event data into the elect ronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. The investigator will be required to confirm review of the SAE causality by ticking the ‘reviewed’ box at the bottom of the eCRF page within 72 hours of submission of the SAE. After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool (e.g., InForm s ystem) will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study subject or receives updated data on a previousl yreported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off-line, the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or to the SAE coordinator b y telephone. Contacts for SAE receipt can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page."
149,page_149,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 15012.9. Appendix 9: Genetic Research Genetics –Background Naturall y occurring genetic variation may contribute to inter -individual variability in response to medicines, as well as an individual's risk of develop ing specific diseases. Genetic factors associated with disease characteristics may also be associated with response to therap y, and could help to explain some clinical study outcomes. For example, genetic variants associated with age -related macular degene ration (AMD) are reported to account for much of the risk for the condition [ Gorin , 2012] with certain variants reported to influence treatment response [ Chen , 2012]. Thus, knowledg e of the genetic etiology of disease may better inform understanding of disease and the development of medicines. Additionally , genetic variability may impact the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination), or pharmacod ynamics (relationship between concentration and pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) of a specific medicine and/or clinical outcomes (efficacy and/or safet y) observed in a clinical study. Genetic Research Objectives and A nalyses The objectives of the genetic research are to investigate the relationship between genetic variants and: Response to medicine, including GSK525762 and/or abiraterone or enzalutamide, or an y concomitant medicines; mCRPC susceptibility , severit y, and progressio n and related conditions Genetic data may be generated while the study is underway or following completion of the study . Genetic evaluations may include focused candidate gene approaches and/or examination of a large number of genetic variants throughout the genome (whole genome analyses). Genetic anal yses will utilize data collected in the study and will be limited to understanding the objectives highlighted above. Analy ses may be performed using data from multiple clinical studies to investigate these re search objectives. Appropriate descriptive and/or statistical analy sis methods will be used. A detailed description of an y planned anal yses will be documented in a Reporting and Analy sis Plan (RAP) prior to initiation of the anal ysis. Planned analy ses and results of genetic investigations will be reported either as part of the clinical RAP and study report, or in a separate genetics RAP and report, as appropriate. Study Population Any subject who is enrolled in the study can participate in genetic research. Any subject who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from the genetic research."
150,page_150,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 151Study Assessments and Procedures A key component of successful genetic research is the collection of samples during clinical studies. Collection of samples, even when no a priori hypothesis has been identified, may enable future genetic anal yses to be conducted to help understand variability in disease and medicine response. A 6 mL blood sample will be taken for Deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) extract ion. A blood sample is collected at the baseline visit, after the subject has been randomized and provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for collection and shipping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory manual. The DNA from the blood sample may undergo quality control anal yses to confirm the integrit y of the sample. If there are concerns regarding the quality of the sample, then the sample may be destroy ed. The blood sample is taken on a single occasion unless a duplica te sample is required due to an inability to utilize the original sample. The genetic sample is labelled (or “coded”) with the same stud y specific number used to label other samples and data in the study . This number can be traced or linked back to the subject by the investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry personal identifiers (such as name or social security number). Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to 15 years after the last subject completes the study , or GSK may destro y the samples sooner. GSK or those working with GSK (for example, other researchers) will only use samples collected from the study for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed consent form. Samples may be used as part of the developmen t of a companion diagnostic to support the GSK medicinal product. Subjects can request their sample to be destro yed at any time. Informed Consent Subjects who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study . Genetic in formed consent must be obtained prior to any blood being taken. Subject Withdrawal from Study If a subject who has consented to participate in genetic research withdraws from the clinical study for any reason other than being lost to follow -up, the subject will be given a choice of one of the following options concerning the genetic sample, if already collected: Continue to participate in the genetic research in which case the genetic DNA sample is retained Discontinue participation in the genetic research and destroy the genetic DNA sample"
151,page_151,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 152If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for an y reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction within the timeframe specified by GSK and maintain the documentation in the site study records . Genoty pe data may be generated during the study or after completion of the study and may be anal yzed during the study or stored for future anal ysis. If a subject withdraws consent for gene tic research and genot ype data has not been analy zed, it will not be anal yzed or used for future research. Genetic data that has been anal yzed at the time of withdrawn consent will continue to be stored and used, as appropriate. Screen and Baseline Failu res If a sample for genetic research has been collected and it is determined that the subject does not meet the entry criteria for participation in the study , then the investigator should instruct the subject that their genetic sample will be destro yed. No forms are required to complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent and sample reconciliation process. In this instance a sample destruction form will not be available to include in the site files. Provision of Study Results and Con fidentiality of Subject’s Genetic Data GSK may summarize the genetic research results in the clinical study report, or separately and may publish the results in scientific journals. GSK may share genetic research data with other scientists to further scie ntific understanding in alignment with the informed consent. GSK does not inform the subject, family members, insurers, or employ ers of individual genoty ping results that are not known to be relevant to the subject’s medical care at the time of the study , unless required b y law. This is due to the fact that the information generated from genetic studies is generall y preliminary in nature, and therefore the significance and scientific validity of the results are undetermined. Further, data generated in a res earch laboratory may not meet regulatory requirements for inclusion in clinical care. References: Chen H, Yu KD, Xu GZ.

Therefore, the initial dose of GSK525762 in both arms should be approximately equivalent. Revised text: At clinically relevant doses, enzalutamide has been shown to be an inducer of CYP3A4, with an 86% decrease in midazolam exposure. Enzalutamide also has the potential to be a clinical inducer and inhibitor of the transport protein P - glycoprotein. The initial dose of GSK525762 in dose escalation administered in combination with enzalutamide w ill be 80 mg besy late salt tablets. I t is anticipated that enzalutamide will reduce the stead y-state exposure (AUC) to GSK525762 by 60% and to GSK525762 active moiety (GSK525762 + active metabolites) by around 20% (extrapolation of the net effect in GSK525 762 exposure due to CYP3A4/ P -gp Induction and P -gp Inhibition) . , as predicted b y a mechanistic ph ysiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, as part of the SimCYP population -based PBPK simulator incorporating the effects observed on GSK525762 and a ctive metabolites exposures following co -administration with itraconazole Therefore, the initial dose of GSK525762 in both arms should be approximately equivalent.

194,page_194,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 195Appendix 12 -Contraception and Pregnancy Information Rationale for change: Section was not included in original protocol as this is a male only study and contraception language was in Section 6.10.2. After additional safet y review, decision was made to add Appendix per protocol template and to give further information for male subjects and female partners of reproductive potential. References added also in this section but not captured in this section. New text: Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) The list does not apply to male subjects with partners of FRP who are and will continue to b e abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable metho ds of contraception. Contraceptive requirements for male subjects with female partners of reproductive potential (when applicable) Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until 4 month after the last dose of study medication. 1. Sterilization with documentation of azoospermia. The documentation on male sterility can come from the site personnel’s: review of subject’s medical records, medical examination and/or semen analysis, or medical history interview. 2. Male condom plus partner use of intrauterine device or intrauterine system. Note: Hormonal methods of contraception for female partners of FRP are not permitted since the eff icacy of these methods in combination with GSK525762 has not been assessed. Hormone -releasing IUDs are a permitted form of contraception. LHRH -acting agents alone are not considered an adequate form of contraception. These allowed methods of contracepti on are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Collection of Pregnancy Information Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a male study subject who becomes pregnant while participating in"
195,page_195,"2015N238310_04 CONFIDENTIA L 204697 196this study. This applies only to subjects who are randomized to receive study medication. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the female partner directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to GSK within 24 weeks of learning of the partner’s pregnancy Partner will also be followed t o determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to GSK. Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.

BRD4 has been shown to interact with AR, and BET inhibition abrogated BRD4 localization to a subset of AR target loci and reduced AR -mediated gene transcription, causing suppression of AR signaling [Assangani, 2014].

BRD4 has been shown to interact with AR, and BET inhibition abrogated BRD4 localization to a subset of AR target loci and reduced AR -mediated gene transcription, causing suppression of AR signaling [Assangani, 2014]. Studies have demonstrated that BET inhibition can lead to growth arrest and cell death in a variet y of preclinical models, including models of CRPC [Wy ce, 2013]. TheAn ongoing first-in-human (FIH) study from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), BET115521, evaluated is currently evaluating the safet y and preliminary efficacy of single -agent GSK525762, a potent inhibitor of BET proteins, in a number of tumor t ypes including mCRPC. Preliminary data from the futility anal ysis ofthe CRPC arm indicated there were no partial or complete responses. This data will be further examined as the data continues to mature. Preliminary safet y and efficacy data is summarized in the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N 113741_07, 201 68]…. ….This study will evaluate the safet y and clinical activity in subjects who have progressed after treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, either as first line treatment (subjects treated in this study will be considered mCRPC Line 2 (L2, having failed first line treatment with or without one prior line of chemotherapy ) or on re -treatment after failure of multiple lines of therap y including prior ADT/prior chemotherap y/prior radiation therap y (subjects treated in this study will be considered mCRPC Line X (L x)). Both populations will be included in both dose escalation and dose expansion; however, assignment during dose expansion will use forced randomization.

Screening echocardiogram or MUGA scans should be completed within 35 days prior to the first dose of study drugs. Baseline imaging should be completed within 28 days prior tofirst dose of study drugs . All other assessments should be within 2814days prior to first dose of any study drugs. Clinical labs used for screening must be within 72 hours of first does of study drugs. 7. Triplicate ECG sshould be performed at Screening. All other timepoints may be single ECG prior to dosing and evaluated for abnormality prior to administration of dose. Triplicate ECGs would be performed as clinically indicated due to abnormal finding. 14. “PK” = serial PK days. Sample collections should be obtained at the following timepoints: Pre-dose, 30m ±5m, 1h±10m, 3h±30m, 6 to 12 hours and 24 h±2h but prior to dosing. “O” = sample collections to be obtained pre-dose, 0.5-1h post-dose, and an optional sample 4-12h post-dose. “X” = sample collections to be obtained pre-dose as well as 0.5-1h post-dose (note that routine PK is no longer required once the subject has been on study for 26 weeks). PK samples will be split to obtain PK samples for abiraterone and enzalutamide. Abiraterone PK samples will be collected at all PK time points in Week 1 and Week 3 and only at pre-dose at remaining PK visits. Enzalutamide PK samples will be collected at pre -dose for all PK visits. Refer to the SRM for further details. For subjects in alternate dosing schedule, the Week 3 Day 1 extensive PK will need to occur between W2 Day 4 and W2 Day 7 prior to their scheduled dose interruption. For any PK timepoint, subjects should have received GS525762 for at least 7 days prior to their scheduled PK draws. This may require the subject to return earlier than any planned interruption of dosing. Once extensive PK sampling in Week 1 and Week 3 have been collected from at least 12 subjects for each dose and combination cohorts, PK sampling may be reduced for these visits. 15. Paired fresh biopsies must be provided pre-and post-dose at time points indicated. If it is not feasible to obtain a fresh biopsy, an archival sample must be provided. Fresh biopsies should be paired with plasma and whole blood samples for PK and circulating biomarkers collected as close as possible to biopsy (ideally within 1h).Subjects must have a platelet count of ≥75,000/mm3 and a PT, INR and aPTT that are WNL within 48 hours prior to the post-dose biopsy procedures and must have received at least 4 consecutive doses of GSK525762 prior to the collection of the tissue.

PK samples will be split to obtain PK sample s for abiraterone and enzalutamide. Abiraterone PK samples will be collected at all PK time points in Week 1 and Week 3 and only at pre-dose at remaining PK visits. Enzalutamide PK samples will be collected at pre-dose for all PK visits. Refer to the SRM for further details. For subjects in alternate dosing schedule, the Week 3 Day 1 extensive PK will need to occur between W2 Day 4 and W2 Day 7 prior to their scheduled dose interruption. For any PK timepoint, subjects should have received GS525762 for at least 7 days prior to their scheduled PK draws. This may require the subject to return earlier than any planned interruption of dosing.

PK samples will be split to obtain a PK sample for all time points for Week 1 and Week 3 and only pre -dose for other visits for abiratero ne and only for the pre -dose sample for enzalutamide and its active major metabolite analysis. Refer to the SRM for further details. For subjects in alternate dosing schedule, the Week 3 Day 1 extensive PK will need to occur between W2 Day 4 and W2 Day 7 p rior to their scheduled dose interruption. For any PK timepoint, subjects should have received GS525762 for at least 7 days prior to their scheduled PK draws. This may require the subject to return earlier than any planned interruption of dosing. Once exte nsive PK sampling in Week 1 and Week 3 have been collected from at least 12 subjects for each dose and combination cohorts, PK sampling may be reduced for these visits. 13. With the implementation of amendment 04, on treatment and EOT tumor biopsies will n o longer be collected. Paired fresh biopsies must be provided pre -and post -dose at time points indicated.
