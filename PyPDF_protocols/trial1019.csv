Name of Finished Product Rucaparib tablets Name of Active Ingredient Rucaparib camsylate (CO-338) Study Title ARIEL4 (Assessment of R ucaparib I n Ovarian Canc Er Tria L): A Phase 3 Multicenter, Randomized Study of Rucaparib versus Chemotherapy in Patients with Relapsed, BRCA-Mutant, High -Grade Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer Study Number CO-338-043 Study Phase Phase 3 Study Duration Approximately 4 years Ratio nale Globally, ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer and the seventh leading cause of cancer death among women, responsible for approximately 140,000 deaths each year.1 Additionally, it is the second most common gynecologic malignancy worldwide and the leading cause of death attribu ted to gynecological cancer. 2, 3 The standard of care is cytoreductive surgery followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. Despite a 70-80% initial response rate, most women have disease relapse. 3-5 The choice of treatment for relapsed di sease is based on the treatment -free interval relative to last therapy administered , and also prior chemotherapy agents used. The treatment- free interval typically decreases with each course administered and almost all patients will develop acquired resistance, hypersensitivity, or intolera ble toxicity upon repeated courses of treatment, and ultimately will succumb to their disease. Recently, inhibitors of poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase ( PARP ) enzymes, which play critical roles in DNA repair, have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with a breast cancer gene 1 or 2 ( BRCA1/2 ) mutation or other evidence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and have emerged as a new treatment option for relapsed ovarian cancer. Rucaparib is a potent, oral small molecule inhibitor of PARP enzymes (PARPi), including PARP -1, PARP -2, and PARP-3. Rucaparib has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in BRCA1 and BRCA2 homozygous mutant cell lines. These findings provided rationale for the clinical assessment of rucaparib as monotherapy in patients wit h hereditary (germline) and acquired (somatic) deficiencies of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 ."
5,page_5,"Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amendmen t 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 6 The safety and efficacy profile of rucaparib ha ve been evaluated in several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. On 19 December 2016, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administr ation (FDA) granted accelerated approval for the marketing of rucaparib (Rubraca®) for monotherapy treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who have been tr eated with ≥ 2 chemotherapi es. The recommended starting dose of rucaparib is 600 mg twice a day (BID). R efer to the Investigator’s Brochure for updated approval status. The basis for the approval of rucaparib as monotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer are the datasets and analyses for patients with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC), Fallopian Tube Cancer (FTC), or Primary Peritoneal Cancer (PPC) comprising the primary efficacy analysis population. The primary efficacy analysis population included 106 patients pooled from the op en-label, single -arm Phase 2 studies, Study CO-338-010 (Study 10) Part 2A and Study CO-338-017 (ARIEL2) Parts 1 and 2, with BRCA- mutant ovarian cancer ( EOC, FTC, or PPC ), who had received ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, at least 2 of which were platinum-based, and who had received at least 1 dose of 600 mg rucaparib. 6 The primary outcome measure on which approval was based is investigat or-assessed ORR per RECIST v1.1, with ORR by central independent radiological review (IRR) conducted as a supportive analysis. ORR by investigator was 53.8%, while ORR by IRR was 41.5%, confirming the results of investigator assessment for this endpoint. 7 Responses were durable, indicated by a duration of response (DOR) by investigator assessment of approximately 9.2 months. While PARP inhibitors have demonstrated consistent robust c linical activity in patients with relapse d ovarian cancer associated with HRD , prospective studies evaluating efficacy and safety of PARPi versus standard of care chemotherapy have been limited. The primary purpose of this Phase 3 study is to compare the e fficacy and safety of rucaparib versus chemotherapy as treatment for relapsed ovarian cancer in patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation in their tumor. Primary Objective To determine investigator- assessed progression- free survival (invPFS) by RECIST Version 1.1 for rucaparib versus chemotherapy."

The study will enroll patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation in their tumor. All p atients will be requi red to have received at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. P atients with platinum- refractory dise ase (ie, disease progression during or within 4 weeks after last dose of the most recent platinum -based chemotherapy ) and patients who h ave received"

Patients with p latinum -resistant (ie, disease progression ≥ 1 to < 6 months after the last dose of most recent platinum- based chemotherapy) or partially platinum -sensitive disease (ie, disease progressio n ≥ 6 to < 12 months after last dose of most recent platinum -based chemotherapy ) will be randomized 2:1 to receive either rucaparib or weekly paclitaxel. P atients with platinum- sensitive disease (ie, disease progression ≥ 12 months after last dose of most recent platinum- based chemotherapy ) will be randomized 2:1 to receive either rucaparib or platinum- based chemotherapy co nsisting of the Investigator’s selection of monotherapy platinum ( cisplatin or carboplatin) or platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/gemcitabine, or cisplatin/gemcitabine ). A 2:1 randomization to receive either rucaparib or chemotherapy will allow for statistical comparison of PFS, OS, and ORR between the treatment arms and provide access to rucaparib for a larger number of patients who would otherwise receive standard chemotherapy. Stratification by progression -free interval after most recent platinum-containing therapy (ie, platinum- resistant, partially platinum- sensitive, or platinum- sensitive) will occur upon study entry to maintain balance between treatment groups. The chemotherapy agents that were selected as compar ators for this study have demonstrated activity in advanced ovarian cancer. Weekly paclitaxel has robust clinical activity, a favorable safety profile, and is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines for the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer.8-10 Cisplatin and carboplatin are effective single- agent therapies as well as in combination (doublet therapy) with gemcitabine or paclitaxel for treatment of ovarian cancer in patients with platinum- sensitive disease as recommended by NCCN and ESMO guidelines.8, 10, 11 Therefore, these chemotherapies are appropriate comparators to confirm rucaparib benefit for the planned patient population. Screening: All patients, with the exception of those known to harbor a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation (germline or somatic), will be required to provide archival tumor tissue or a screening biopsy for central laboratory analysis prior to enrollment. Tumor analysis will be performed using the Foundation Medicine, Inc (FMI) next generation sequencing (NGS) test. Results of the FMI panel test will be provided to patients who consent to receive this information. Patients with a known deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation (germline or somatic) must also submit archival tumor tissue for central laboratory testing ; however, enrollment is not contingent upon central laboratory analysis o f tissue before enrollment. A local BRCA1/2 mutation result from previous testing will be adequate for enrollment. Patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation who meet all other entry criteria will be e ligible for the study. If archival tissue is not available, the patient may undergo a screening biopsy. Additional screening assessments will include demographics and medical history, prior treatments for serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (and other malig nancies, if applicable), prior and current medication s and procedures, 12- lead ECG, ECOG performance status, local laboratory hema tology, serum chemistry, and CA -125 measurement, serum pregnancy (for women of childbearing potential only), urinalysis, physi cal examination, height, weight, and vital signs"

P atient -reported outcomes (PRO) will be collected using the EORTC QLQ-C30/ QLQ-OV28, and EQ -5D in struments , or other collection format as appropriate . Randomization: Following classification (ie, deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation ) detected by FMI (central laboratory ) analysis or documented local results for deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutation, with confirmation of adequate tumor tissue availability for known deleterious BRCA1/2 mutant patients, and confirmation of all other eligibility criteria in the screening phase, patients will be randomized 2:1 to recei ve rucaparib or chemotherapy. Treatment and Follow- up: Patients will receive treatment with either rucaparib or chemotherapy until disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1, as assessed by the investigator; unacceptable toxicity or inability to tolerate further treatment, as assessed by the investigator ; pregnancy; death ; loss to follow -up; withdrawal of consent; or another appropriate clinical reason. P atients will receive up to a maximum of 8 cycles of platinum monotherapy or doublet therapy and will be followed thereafter until disease progression or other reason for discontinuation. CT scans will be submitted to a central imaging vendor to allow for independent review of PFS. Assessments and procedures during the study will include : AEs ; physical examination s; 12-lead ECG s, vital signs and weight measurements; local laboratory hematology, serum chemistry, and CA- 125 measurement s; serum pregnancy for women of childbearing potential; blood samples for ctDNA and genomic analyses (before dosing in Cycles 1 to 6) ; plasma samples for pharmacokinetic ( PK) analysis; concomitant medications, therapies, and procedures; disease/ tumor assess ments; study drug administration and accountability ; and PRO. Urinalysis will be performed as clinically indicated. Patients randomized to chemotherapy have the option to cross over to receive rucaparib upon radiological progression per RECIST Version 1.1 following Sponsor (or designee) review and approval of the radiology report confirming disease progression. If clinical progression is diagnosed, confirmation of disease progression by radiologic assessment per RECIST Version 1.1 is required before cross over to rucaparib. If a patient randomized to rucaparib has radiologic progression, but continues to derive clinical benefit per the investigator, continuation of treatment beyond progression will be permitted . In such cases, the documented decision to continue will be made jointly between the investigator and the Sponsor (or designee) , and the patient must pr ovide consent within a reasonable timeframe of the documented decision to continue treatment with rucaparib. The patient will continue to have all protocol- required assessments. Patients will be followe d for safety and efficacy assessments for 28 days afte r the last dose of study drug. An optional tumor biopsy will be collected from patients who experience disease progression /discontinue treatment and provide appropriate consent. There will be long- term follow -up (LTFU) assessments every 12 weeks (± 14 days) until death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent, or study closure . Information regarding subsequent treatments , secondary malignancies, and survival will be collected . For patients who have not had radiologic disease progression, LTFU will also inc lude tumor scans every 8 calendar weeks until radiologic disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1, per"

Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amendmen t 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 16 been on study at least 18 months will decrease the frequency of tumor assessments to every 16 weeks (within 5 days before is permitted ). A CA-125 result < ULN will be required to designate a CR. Copies of CT scans (and other imaging, as appropriate) will be collected from all patients for BICR. BICR will r eview CT scans for a given patient in batches throughout the conduct of the study, but not necessarily in real -time. All treatment decisions will be made by the investigator based on local radiology results. Safety Assessments Safety and tolera bility will be assessed based on the following: • Incidence, type, seriousness, and severity of AEs reported; • Clinical laboratory investigations (hematology and serum chemistry); • Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature); • 12-lead ECGs; • Physical examinations; and • ECOG performance statu s Statistical Methods Sample Size Justification Approximately 345 patients will be randomized, with 230 patients randomized to rucaparib and 115 patients to chemotherapy. The median PFS is assumed to be 12 months for rucaparib and 8 months for the comparator. Assuming an accrual over about 3 years; a dropout rate of 2%; with a hazard ratio of 0.65; and at least 275 events, a sample size of 345 patients (230 patients randomized to rucaparib and 115 patients randomized to chemotherapy ) would yield at least 80% power at a two -sided 0.05 significance level. Efficacy Analysis The primary endpoint of invPFS will be analyzed using the stratified C ox proportional hazard method ology. The stratified hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazards model will be used to estimate the HR between the randomized treatment group s. All efficacy analyses will be performed for the Efficacy Population and the intent- to-treat (ITT) Population. The Efficacy Population consists of al l random ized patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation , excluding those identified to have a BRCA reversion mutation, and the ITT Population consists of all randomized patients. In order to preserve the overall Type 1 error rate, the primary endpoint will first be tested in the Efficacy Population. If the primary endpoint in the E fficacy Population is statistically significant, then the primary endpoint in the ITT Population will be tested. If the primary endpoint is significant for both populations, then t he secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested, first in the E fficacy Population and then in the ITT Population in the order specified below for each endpoint. St atistical significance will only be declared for secondary endpoints if the primary endpoint and previ ous secondary endpoints are also statistically significant."

Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amendmen t 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 28 3 INTRODUCTION 3.1 Investigational Product Rucaparib (CO -338) is a small molecule inhibitor of poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] -ribose) polymerase (PARP ) being developed for the treatment of ovarian cancer associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) . Rucaparib has been shown to potently inhibit PARP- 1, PARP -2, and PARP-3 and has de monstrated activity in a background of breast cancer gene 1 and 2 ( BRCA1 and BRCA2 ) mutations in both clinical and nonclinical studies. Clovis Oncology, Inc. (Clovis) is developing r ucaparib for oral administration in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer who have a BRCA mutation based on analysis of tumor tissue DNA. The therapeutic rationale for PARP inhibition with rucaparib in the presence of HRD is induction of synthe tic lethality. 3.2 Background and Rationale for PARP Inhibition Normal cells re pair single-strand breaks in DNA primarily through base excision repair (BER). While there are several variations of BER, all pathways rely on PARP enzymes, of which PARP -1 is the best characterized. S ingle- strand breaks that are not repaired result in stalled repli cation forks and the developmen t of double-strand breaks, which are primarily repaired by homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA, a complex process involving multip le proteins, including those encoded by BRCA1 and BRCA2, as well as RAD51 , Fanconi ane mia core complex, ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ), and ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3 -related ( ATR) protein, among others. Defects in the HRR pathway (ie, HRD) , either as an initiating or late event in carcinogenesis, may be responsible for the genetic instabi lity observed in many cancers . It has been estimated that approximately 50% of high- grade serous ovarian cancer ( HGSOC) has alterations in the HRR pathway . 12 Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (gBRCA1/2 ) are th e strongest known hereditary factors for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), accounting for up to 15% of all EOC.13, 14 Epithelial ovarian cancer patients carry heterozygous deleterious mutations in their germline DNA and develop tumors when the remaining wild -type functional allele is ina ctivated (i e, “second hit”). Approximately 6% to 8% of HGSOC patients have somatic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (sBRCA1/2). 12, 15 However, HRD is not limited to mutations of BRCA1/2 . Approximately 27% of HGSOC patients have an alteration in an HRR gene other than BRCA1/2 or due to other molecular alteration or modification (eg, epigene tic silencing). Inhibition of DNA damage repair in cancer cells, which are intrinsically genetically un stable, represents an attractive opportunity for therapeutic development . Given the overlap in various DNA repair pathways, inhibition of a single pathway is unlikely to have a significant effect . Inhibition of multiple DNA repair pathways in parallel, suc h as having a deleterious mutation in a critical BER gene in the presence of a PARP inhibitor, may lead to cell death, a concept known as synthetic lethality . Normal cells, with only one DNA repair pathway affected by inhibition of PARP, still have an inta ct DNA repai r pathway that can compensate"
28,page_28,"Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amendmen t 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 29 for the defect. This concept of synthetic lethality has been demonstrated in key in vitro and in vivo stu dies, as well as in several clinical trials with PARP inhibitors.16-21 While up to 15% of patients may have a hereditary form of ovarian cancer (based on germline mutations), approximately 6% to 8% of HGSOC patients have sBRCA1/2 mutations . 12, 15 Both gBRCA1/2 and sBRCA1/2 mutations result in HRD, and patients whose tumors harbor these mutations derive clinical benefit fro m PARP inhibitor therapy.22 Collectively, these mutat ions comprise a gro up known as tumor BRCAmut (tBRCAmut). Patients without evidence of a gBRCA1/2 or sBRCA1/2 mutation also derive benefit from PARP inhibit or treatment. 22, 23 The molecular signature associated with PARP inhibitor response in a BRCA wild-type (BRCAwt) setting is not yet fully understood, but may be linked to other mechanisms of HRD . 3.3 Ovarian Cancer Globally, ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer and the seventh leading cause of cancer death among women, responsible for approximately 140,000 deaths each year. 1 Additionally, it is the second most common gynecologic malignancy worldwide and the leading cause of death attributed to gynecological cancer.2, 3 Unfortunately because of delayed presentation and diagnosis, almost 75% of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with stage III/IV disease and 75% of women with advanced stage disease ultimately relapse or die from their disease despite treatment. 1 After initial therapy, most women will have a pro gression -free interval of approximately 1.5 to 2 years, depending on the extent of post- operative residual disease and response to chemotherapy.24 Relapse still occurs ; however, in the majority of cases, and only 10% to 30% of women experience long- term survival.24 Advanced stage disease is associated with a 5 year survival rate of o nly 30% to 40%.2 Approximately 90% of ovarian tumors are surface epithelial in origin, and the papillary serous histology subtype accounts for approximately 75%, of which the large majority (70%) is high- grade. 24 The site of origin of EOC remains unclear. Some studies suggest that serous EOC and pri mary peritoneal cancer (PPC) arise from the fallopian tube epithelium; however, other studies suggest an origin within s tem cells of the ovarian surface epithelium.24-28 EOC, PPC and fallopian tube cancer behave very similarly and are therefore treated in the same way. The medi an age at presentation of EOC is 60 years. Due to the non- specific nature of symptoms, many women present with advanced disease and therefore have a poor prognosis. 3.3.1 Treatment of Ovarian Cancer The standard approach to treatment of advanced HGSOC is cytored uctive surgery (either at time of diagnosis or interval debulking), with the goal of minimizing residual tumor to no visible residual disease, a major prognostic in dicator for improved survival. Six to 8 cycles of platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy is the global standard of care. If initial cytoreduction is not performed, interval de bulking surgery is considered. This surger y may"
29,page_29,"Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amendmen t 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 30 be carried out after 3 or 4 cycles of primary chemotherapy, followed by 3 further cycles of chemotherapy. Platinum analogues, such as carboplatin and cisplatin, are the most active agents, mediating their effects through the formation of inter- and intra-strand cross-links with DNA. 24, 29 Despite a 70 -80% initial response rate, most women have disease relapse.3-5 The choice of treatment for relapsed disease is based on the treatment -free interval relative to last therapy administered and chemotherapy agents used. Platinum -based regimens dominate ovarian cancer therapy and define treatment groups.30 In general, patients whose disease progresses during treatment with a platinum-based regimen are considered to have platinum- refractory disease; patients whose disease relapses within 6 months after the last platinum agent was administered are considered to have platinum- resistant disease; and patients who se disease relapses more than 6 months after last platinum -based therapy was administered are considered to have platinum- sensitive disease. However, t hese cl assifications are somewhat arbitrary as resistance to platinum -based therapy is a time continuum, not a categorical variable, and a status of ‘platinum -resistant’ is not absolu te as it can be partially overcome. In addition, ‘platinum- sensitivity’ was defined when there was no alternative to platinum -based treatment and in clinical practice typically only refers to second -line treatment. These definitions also do n ot take into a ccount the molecular character istics of a patient’s tumor (ie, HRD such as BRCA 1/2 mutations) and thus are used as a guide to define platinum status in this study . Treatment decisions for relapsed ovarian cancer are driven in part by type of response achieved and the duration between completion of treatment and disease r elapse. Patients with platinum- sensitive disease are typically retreated with platinum-based therapy until they no longer respond to or can no longer tolerate such treatment. 3-5 Patients with platinum- resistant disease receive single- agent treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), topotecan, gemcitabine, or weekly pac litaxel, or a combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy (paclitaxel, PLD, or topotecan).31-33 However, these agents have limited utilit y due to poor efficacy (objective response rates ranging 20 -30% with median progression- free survival [ PFS] < 6 months) and significant toxicities. In later lines of therapy, treatment choice is often restricted according to the individual patient situatio n (eg, performance status, organ function, residual toxiciti es from prior treatment, other comorbidities, and patient choice). As many patients experience multiple relapses, prognosis and response to therapy decreases as the interval between last chemother apy exposure and disease relapse shortens. The treatment- free, or specifically the platinum -free interval, provides further prognostic information for patients, as therapeutic options lessen and survival shortens as a patient’s tumor beco mes less responsiv e to repeated courses of platinum -based therapy. Patients wh o have received several prior lines of treatment are known to have strongly dimi nished treatment- free intervals and response rates and the benefits of continued treatment with conventional chemotherapy often does not outweigh the risk of hypersensitivity a nd additional , intolerable toxicity.

PARP inhibitors have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with BRCA1/2- mutant tumors , and have emerged as a new treatment option for relapsed ovarian cancer. In the United States (US ), olaparib was approved 19 December 2014 for treatment of patients with gBRCA1/2 ovarian cancer who had received ≥ 3 prior chemotherapy regimens (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/206162lbl.pdf) based on results of a Phase 2 study. 36 Rucaparib was subsequently approved in the US for use in women with a BRCA mutation (germline or somatic) who had received at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, based on a response rate of 54%. PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy has also been e stablished as an effective strategy for improving outcomes in recurrent, second- line and beyond, platinum- sensitive ovarian cancer. As of January 2019, rucaparib, niraparib, and olaparib were all approved as second -line switch maintenance therapies for ovarian cancer patients in the US37-39 and Europe.40-42 Three randomized, double- blind studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements in median progression- free survival (PFS) as co mpared to placebo in the ITT Population regardless of BRCA1/2 mutation or HRD status (Study 19, NOVA, and ARIEL3).43-45 Study 19 was the first study to show that the outcomes of somatic BRCA (sBRCA) -mutant + gBRCA- mutant patients were the same as gBRCA -mutant patients alone, suggesting that it is appropriate to not diffe rentiate between germline and somatic mutations. These switch maintenance studies also demo nstrated statistically significant benefit in the overall unselected patient population. Recently, olaparib38, 41 and niraparib39, 42 were also approved as front -line switch maintenance for ovarian cancer patients in US and Europe. In the European Union ( EU), olaparib is approved as maintenance treatment following a response to platinum -based chemotherapy in patients with BRCA1/2- mutant (germline or somatic) relapsed ovarian cancer who received at least 2 prior platinum- based regimens.

Olaparib has also demonstrated clinical activity in patients without a BRCA1/2 mutation21, 46, 47; however, the molecular signature associated with olaparib response in those trials was not fully understood. 3.4 Prior Exper ience with Rucaparib Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information for rucaparib. 3.4.1 Nonclinical Experience with Rucaparib The results from nonclinical studies are consistent with the anticipated mechanis m of action and pharmacological effects of PARP inhibition. Further information can be found in the rucaparib IB."

Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amendmen t 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 32 Pharmacological assessment demonstrated that rucaparib is a potent and selective inhibitor of PARP -1, PARP-2, and PARP-3 and has robust and durable in vitro and in vivo activity in multiple BRCA1/2 mutant cell lines and xenograft models. Rucaparib was also active in a BRCA wild -type model, consistent with in vitro data suggesting that rucaparib is active in cells with other defects in HRR throu gh synthetic lethality. In vitro screens suggeste d that rucaparib has a limited potential for off- target effects. Safety pharmacology studies suggest that when given orally, rucaparib poses a low-risk for causing neurobehavioral and cardiac effects in patients. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies , rucaparib demonstrated species-dependent oral bioavailability, moderate plasma protein binding, and large volumes of distribution in nonclinical species. As a P -glycoprotein (P- gp) an d breast cancer resistant protein ( BCRP ) substrate, rucaparib demonstrated minimal penetration of rucaparib- derived radioactivity through the blood- brain barrier. In vitro data suggested slow metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes, with CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 contributing to the metabolism of rucaparib. Rucaparib was mainly excreted in feces in rats and dogs. Rucaparib reversibly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A, and to a lesser extent CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). Rucaparib induced CYP1A2, and down-regulated CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. Rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1) and MATE2 -K, a moderate inhibitor of organic cationic transporter 1 (OC T1), and may inhibit P-gp and BCRP in the gut. Oral dosing of rucaparib in single and repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs resulted in toxicity to the hematopoietic, lymphopoietic, and gastrointestinal (GI) systems. These toxicities were generally both reversible upon recovery and predictive of toxicities observed in patients. Rucaparib was shown to be clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay suggesting potential genotoxicity in humans. Reproductive and development toxicity studies i n rat showed that rucaparib caused maternal toxicity and was embryo-toxic. Although no rucaparib related effects on sperm total count, density, motility, or morphology were identified, based on published studies, PARP inhibitors have the potential to impai r spermatogenesis and reduce fertility. 48-51 3.4.2 Clinical Experience with Rucaparib Information regarding clinical studies with rucaparib is available in the current Investigator’s Brochure. Rucaparib is being evaluated in Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies in patients with advanced cancer who have evidence of HRD . Rucaparib clinical studies have/are evaluating patients with relapsed, high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer in both the treatment and maintenance settings. Rucaparib is also being evaluated as treatment for patients with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC) associated with HRD, both as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab."

Additional studies of rucaparib as monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer therapies are planned in ovarian and prostate cancer, as well as other tumor types. Additional information on t he clinical studies is provided in the rucaparib IB. 3.4.2.1 Overview of Pharmacokinetics and Drug-Drug Interactions Assessment of rucaparib PK in cancer patients showed an approximate dose proportional exposure after once a day ( QD) or twice a day ( BID) dosing, rapid absorption with m aximum plasma concentration ( Cmax) achi eved within 1.5 to 6 hours, and distribution into tissue. The oral bioavailability was 36% and elimination half -life (t 1/2) ranged from 11 to 29.8 hours. Rucaparib was moderately bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. At a dose of 600 mg BID rucaparib, steady state was achieved after approximately 1 week. A high- fat meal increased the C max and AUC 0-24h of rucaparib by 20% and 38%, respectively, as compared with that under fasted conditions. In vitro, CYP enzymes were shown to contribute to rucaparib metabolism. In a preliminary assessment of rucaparib metabolism in patients, rucaparib biotransformation pathways included hydroxylation or oxidation, N-demethylation, deamination, and phase II methylation. A carboxyli c acid metabolite (M324) and a phase II N -methylated m etabolite of M324 (M338) were identified as major metabolites. Drug interactions with rucaparib as a substrate were assessed in a p opulation PK (Pop PK) analysis. CYP2D6 phenotypes (poor metabolizers, i ntermediate metabolizers, normal metabolizers, and ultra -rapid metabolizers) and CYP1A2 phenotypes (normal metabolizers and hyper-inducers) did not significantly impact the steady- state exposure of rucaparib at 600 mg BID. Concomitant administration of strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors did not significantly impact rucaparib PK. Current smokers had overlapping rucaparib exposures as compared to nonsmokers and former smokers. Collectively, the results suggest that CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 play limited role in rucaparib metabolism, and no rucaparib dose adjustment is needed when concomitantly administered with CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. No clinically significant effect of concomitant administration of strong P -gp inhibitors on rucaparib PK was observed. Concomitant treatment with proton pump inhibitors did not show clinically significant effect on rucaparib PK. No dose modifi cation is recommended based on concomitant use of P- gp inhibitors or PPIs. In a “cocktail ” DDI study (CO-338-044), the effects of steady- state rucaparib at 600 mg BID on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, and P- gp were evaluated with single oral doses of sensitive probes (caffeine [CYP1A2], S-warfarin [CYP2C9], omeprazole [CYP2C19], midazolam [CYP3A4], and digoxin [P-gp], respectively). Data suggest that rucaparib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2, a w eak inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. Rucaparib also marginally inhibits P-gp, and the effect is unlikely to be clinically significa nt."

Rucaparib weakly inhibited BCRP and caused mild increases in plasma exposures to ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. In Study CO-338-078, PK of a single- dose rucaparib was compared between cancer patients with normal hepatic function and moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment showed an approximately 46% increase in area under the concentration - time curve from 0 to infinity ( AUC 0-inf) without apparent change in C max. Details of these clinical DDI stud ies are provided in the rucaparib IB. 3.4.2.2 Overview of Efficacy Evaluation of rucaparib efficacy has largely focused on patients with advanced ovarian cancer in both the treatment and maintenance settings. A summary of efficacy data from two fully -enrolled, ongoing single- arm Phase 2 studies (Study CO -338-010 Part 2A; Study CO-338-017 Parts 1 an d 2) evaluating rucaparib efficacy in the treatment setting of ovarian cancer, and from one fully -enrolle d, ongoing Phase 3 study (Study CO-338-014) evaluating rucaparib efficacy compared to placebo in the maintenance setting of ovarian cancer is provided below. Additional efficacy data for rucaparib in ovarian cancer, in other tumors, and in combination with chemotherapy (completed studies in early development) a re provided in the rucaparib IB. In both the treatment and maintenance setting of advanced ovarian cancer, rucaparib administered at the starting dose of 600 mg BID demonstrated robust clinical activ ity. Ovarian Cancer Treatment Indication On 19 December 2016, FDA granted accelerated approval for the marketing of rucaparib (Rubr aca ®) for monotherapy treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with ≥ 2 chemotherapies. The recommended dose of rucaparib is 600 mg BID. The basis for the approval of rucaparib as monotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer are the datasets and analyses for patients with EOC, FTC, or PPC comprising the primary efficacy analysis population. The primary efficacy analysis population included 106 patients pooled from the open- label, single -arm Phase 2 studies, Study CO-338-010 (Study 10) Part 2A and Study CO-338-017 (ARIEL2) Parts 1 and 2, with BRCA- mutant ovarian cancer [EOC, FTC, or PPC ], who had received ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, at least 2 of which were platinum-based, and who had received at least 1 dose of 600 mg rucaparib. 6 The primary outcome measure on which approval was based is investigat or-assessed ORR per RECIST v1.1, with ORR by central independent radiological review (IRR) conducted as a supportive analysis. ORR by investigator was 53.8%, while ORR IRR was 41.5%, confirming the results of investigator assessment for this endpoint. 52 Responses were durable,"

Ovarian Cancer in the Maintenance Setting In the maintenance setting of rucaparib monotherapy for treatment of patients with EOC, FTC, o r PPC, the results of Study CO-338-014 (ARIEL3) clearly demonstrate that rucaparib offers significant benefit compared to placebo. For the primary endpoint of investigator- assessed ( invPFS), the median PFS was significantly prolonged by rucaparib compared to placebo; a result demonstrated across the tBRCA, HRD (tBRCA + non- tBRCA LOH high), and ITT populations (p < 0.0001 for each population). 53 The median invPFS for the 3 analysis populations ranged from 10.8 months to 16.6 months following rucaparib treatment and was consist ently 5.4 months for the placebo group, regardless of the population analyzed, with a hazard ratio (HR) = 0.231 for the tBRCA subpopulation (p < 0.0001), HR = 0.317 for the HRD subpopulation (p < 0.0001), and HR = 0.365 for the ITT population (p < 0.0001). The benefit of rucaparib in terms of tumor response was observed early in treatment. The invPFS results were confirmed by a key, stand-alone secondary endpoint analysis of PFS assessed by blinded independent central review ( BICR; bicr PFS); each population receiving rucaparib had a statistically significant prolonged median bicrPFS compared to placebo. The overall response rate ( ORR) per RECIS T v1.1, as assessed by the investigator, was analyzed in the subgroup of patients who had measurable disease (ie, measurable target lesions) at baseline. In the tBRCA population, the confirmed ORR was 15/40 (37.5%) for the rucaparib group and 2/2 3 (8.7%) f or the placebo group (p = 0.0055). In the HRD population, the confirmed ORR was 23/85 (27.1%) for the rucaparib group and 3/41 (7.3%) for the placebo group (p = 0.0031), and in the ITT population, the confirmed ORR was 26/141 (18.4%) for the ruca parib group and 5/66 (7.6%) for the placebo group (p = 0.0069). Results of the exploratory endpoint of ORR, along with that of invPFS in the non-nested populations, support the clinically meaningful impact of delaying disease recurrence in women with advanced ovarian cancer, and show a further response to rucaparib treatment in patients with measurable disease. 3.4.2.3 Overview of Safety Consistent with the efficacy evaluation of rucaparib, evaluation of rucaparib safety has largely focused on patients with advanced ovarian cancer in both the treatment and maintenance settings. A summary of safety data from 2 fully -enrolled, ongoing single- arm Phase 1/2 studies (Study CO-338-010 Part 2A and Part 2B; Study CO-338-017 Part 1 and Part 2) evaluating rucaparib safety in the treatm ent setting of ovarian cancer, and from one fully -enrolled, ongoing Phase 3 study (Study CO-338-014) evaluating rucaparib efficacy compared to placebo in the maintenance setting of ovarian cancer is provided below.

Integrated Safety Analysis in Ovarian Cancer The most recent integrated safety information for the treatment indication is provided in the rucaparib IB. Pooled safety data are provided as of the 01 September 2017 cut- off date f or the ongoing Studies CO-338-010 (Parts 2A and 2B) and CO-338-017 (ARIEL2; Parts 1 and 2), in which 545 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer received 600 mg BID rucaparib. Safety data in the maintenance setting are provided as of the 15 April 2017 cut-of f date for Study CO-338-014 (ARIEL3), in which a total of 561 patients have been treated (372 patients in the rucaparib group and 189 patients in the placebo group). Patients with ovarian cancer who received 600 mg BID rucaparib in treatment setting as wel l as in the maintenance setting), the most common TEAEs reported were primarily mild to moderate (Grade 1 -2) in severity and include gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain), asthenia /fatigue, decreased appetite, and dysgeusia. The most common TEAE ≥ Grade 3 include anemia/decreased hemoglobin, ALT/AST increased, neutropenia/decreased ANC, and asthenia/fatigue. The laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the TEAEs, with decreased hemoglobin (and associa ted increase in mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin), increased ALT, increased AST, and increased serum creatinine, being most common. Decreased platelets, neutrophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes and increased cholesterol were observed to a lesser extent. The reported elevations in ALT/AST with rucaparib treatment in either the treatment or maintenance settings were not associated with any events of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Effects on cardiac channel activity in vitro and a compreh ensive assessment of the effects of rucaparib on ECG parameters in cancer patients demonstrated a low risk of cardiac effects by rucaparib. Photosensitivity was initial ly reported in the Phase 1 dose- escalation part of Study CO-338-010 (n=6; 10.7%) and based on these reports of photosensitivity, guidance for sun protection was included in rucaparib clinical studies. In the recent integrated safety analysis from 917 patients treated with rucaparib in either placebo -controlled Study CO-338-014 (ARIEL3) and two open- label, single -arm trials (Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-017 [ARIEL2]), 118 patients (12.9%] ) experienced All Grade photosensitivity and 2 patients (0.2%) experienced ≥ Grade 3 (Clovis, data on file). Patients should use typical precautions when going outside, such as applying sunscreen (sun protection factor 50 or greater) and/or covering exposed skin with clothing and wearing a hat and sunglasses. 3.4.2.4 Adverse Events of Special Interest Myelodyspl astic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are considered adverse events of special interest (AESI), as these events have been observed in patients exposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy (eg, platinum and anthracyclines) used for treatment of ovarian cancer as well as with PARP inhibitors , including rucapar ib."

Adverse events (AE s) of pneumonitis have been reported with PARP inhibitor treatment, including in clinical trials evaluating rucaparib. Currently, however, there is a lack of understanding of a mechanistic link between pneumonitis and PARP inhibitor treatment, and causality assessment is often confounded by lack of a consistent clinical pattern as well as other pre-disposing factors, such as cancer and/or metastases in lungs, underlying pulmonary disease, smoki ng history, and/or previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Clovis is seeking to understand whether or not there is a relationship between pneumonitis and rucaparib treatment; thus, Clovis is designating pneumonitis as an AESI to gather data to enable a thorough evaluation and assessment of the event and associated terms specified in Section 10.7 . More informatio n on AESIs is provided in the rucaparib IB. 3.5 Rationale for this Study of Rucaparib PARPi, including r ucaparib , have demonstrated consistent robust clinical activity in patients with deleterious BRCA1/2 -mutant tumors, including in patients with relapsed deleterious BRCA1/2 -mutant (germline or somatic) ovarian cancer . Clinical activity of PARPi versus standard of care chemotherapy has not yet been extensively evaluated in prospecti ve trial s enrolling only patients with known deleterious BRCA1/2 mutant tumors (germline or somatic). Assessment of chemotherapy response in patients with BRCA1/2 mutant tumors has been primarily examined in small retrospective analyses.

The study will enroll patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation in their tumor. All patients will be required to have received at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, with at least one that includes a platinum. P atients with platinum- refractory disease (ie, progression during or within 4 weeks after last dose of the most recent platinum -based therapy ) and patients who have received prior PARPi treatment will be exc luded. 5.1.1 Screening Phase All patients will undergo screening assessments within 60 days prior to randomization . Informed consent may be completed outside the 60- day screening win dow as i nformed consent does not expire , except as required by applicable regul atory requirements, or if withdrawn by the patient. All patients, with the exception of those known to harbor a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation (germline or somatic), will be required to provide archival tumor tissue or a screening biopsy for central laboratory analysis prior to enrollment. Patients with a known deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation (germline or somatic) must also submit archival tumor tissue for central laboratory testing ; however, enrollment is not contingent upon the central laboratory analysis of tissue. A local BRCA1/2 mutation result from previous testing will be adequate for enrollment. Patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation who meet all other entry criteria will be eligible for the study . If archival tumor tissue is not available, the patient may undergo a screening biopsy. Tumor analysis will be performed using a next -generation sequencing (NGS) test by Foundation Medicine Inc (FMI). Results of the FMI panel test will be provided to patients who consent to receive this information. In th e event a BRCA1/2 is identified in tumor tissue, the patient may be referred by the investigator for genetic counsel ing and potential germline testing per institutional guidelines. If the patient chooses to have germline testing, this result will be entere d in the clinical trial database for this study. Additional screening assessments will include demographics and medi cal history, prior treatments for serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (and other malignancies, if applicable), prior and current medications and procedures, 12-lead ECG, ECOG performance status, local laboratory hema tology, serum chemistry, and CA-125 measurement, serum pregnancy (for women of childbearing potential only), urinalysis, physical examination, height, weight, and vital signs measurements, blood samples for ctDNA and genomic analyses, adverse e vents, and radio logic assessment by computed tomography ( CT) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ). Patient -reported outcomes (PRO) will be co llected using the EORTC QLQ- C30/ QLQ-OV28, and EQ- 5D instruments , or other collection format as appropriate ."

Patients experiencing disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1, as assessed by the investigator, will be discontinued from treatment and enter follow -up, unless a patient on rucaparib is still receiving benefit and, jointly, the investigator and Sponsor agree with continued rucaparib treatment. Patients initially receiving chemotherapy have the option to cross over to rucaparib treatment. Patients with rising CA-125 should not be discontinued based on this result alone, but should have a radiologic assessment and be assessed for disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1. If the radiologic assessment does not confirm disease progression, patients should continue on treatment and continue to be assessed by RECIST Version 1.1 per the protocol schedule of assessments. Patients who have been on study at least 18 months will decrease the frequency of tum or assessments to every 16 weeks (within 5 days before is permitted). All CT scans (and other imaging, as appropriate) performed at basel ine, during the treatment period , and at treatment d iscontinuation will be co llected for bicr PFS, which will constitute a supportive analysis. BICR will review CT scans for a given patient in batches throughout the conduct of the study, but not necessarily in real- time. All treatment decisions will be made by the investigator based on local radiology results. Patients will be cont inuously monitored for safety and efficacy . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) with multidisciplinary representation will evaluate safety and efficacy data in compliance with a prospective charter. The IDMC will have access to study data including treatment assignments. Patients randomized to chemotherapy have the option to cross over to receive rucaparib upon radiological progression per RECIST Version 1.1, provided that disease progression is confirmed with supporting documentation and approval is obtained from the Sponsor (or designee). If clinical prog ression is diagnosed, then confirmati on of disease progression by radiologic assessment per RECIST Version 1.1 is required along with Sponsor (or designee) approval of the radiology report confirming disease progression before a patient is considered eligible to cross over to rucaparib. If a patient randomized to rucaparib has radiologic progression, but continues to derive clinical benefit per the i nvestigator, then continuation of rucaparib treatment beyond progression will be permitted . In such cases, t he documented decision to continue will be made jointly be tween the investigator and the Sponsor (or designee) , it must be documented in the patient’s chart, and the patient must provide consent within a reasonable timeframe of the documented decision to continue treatment with rucaparib. Patients wil l continue to have all protocol- required assessments specified in Table 4. 5.1.4 Post-treatment Phase Upon treatment discontinuation, patients will have a treatment discontinuation visit. The following a ssessments will be performed at the discontinuation of treatment to the extent possible: PRO; ECOG performance status ; concomitant medications and procedures; 12- lead ECG; physical examination; vital signs and weight measurements ; hematology and serum"

Concomitant medications and procedures, AE monitoring, and P RO will also be collected followin g the last dose of study drug at the 28 (± 3) days S afety F ollow -up V isit. Ongoing serious adverse events ( SAEs ), AEs of special interest (AESIs), and treatment- related Grade 3/4 AEs will be followed until either resolution or stabilization has been determined or until lost to follow -up. An optional tumor biopsy will be collected from patients who experience disease progression /disco ntinue treatment and provide appropriate consent. The Sponsor (or designee) should be notified of all study terminations as soon as possible. The date and reason for cessation of study drug must be documented in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ) and source documents. After the 28 -day S afety Follow-up Visit, only SAEs considered as potentially related to study drug should be reported per Clovis Pharmacovigilance (PV) requirements and captured in the Clovis PV database. This includes serious reports of pneumonitis or similar events (ie, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, acute interstitial pneumonitis, alveolitis necrotizing, alveolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and organizing pneumonia) , if considered to be related to study drug. After the 28 -day Follow-up Visit, AESIs of MDS and AML, irrespective of causality, should be reported per Clovis PV requirements and captured in the Clovis PV database. • AESIs of pneumonitis or similar events should only be reported up to, but not beyond, the 28- Day Follow -up Visit (28 days after the last dose of rucaparib). Disease/ tumor assessment will continue (using the same methodology as was used at initial study screening [eg, CT scan]) if reason for treatment discontinuation was other than death or disease progression based on radiologic assessment. Disease/ tumor assessment s should continue to be performed every 8 calendar weeks (within 5 days before is permitted) relative to Cycle 1 Day 1 until radiologic disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1, as assessed by the investigator, death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal, study closure, or initiation of subsequent treatment. PRO assessments should also be collected at every cycle for all patients through disease progression in association with the radiologic assessments for disease progression. All patients will be followed for survival, subsequent treatm ents, and monitoring for secondary malignancy every 12 weeks (± 14 days) until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study closure.

Upon formal closure of the study, individual patients who are continuing to benefit from treatment with rucaparib at the time of study closure, and who do not meet any of the criteria for withdrawal, will have the option of receiving rucaparib via another access mechanism . In addition, individuals who are continuing in long- term follow -up (LTFU) may transition to have their LTFU and scans, if applicable, captured via another mechanism. The Sponsor may discontinue the study early for any reason as noted in Section 13.7. 5.4 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of rucaparib versus chemo therapy as treatment for relapsed high -grade serous or endometrioid ova rian cancer in patients who have received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy and have evidence of HRD. There is unmet need in the third- line treatment setting for a therapy that provides benefit and does not add to the cumulative toxicity of prior che motherapy regimens. This study will directly compare the PFS of treatment with rucaparib versus chemotherapy in patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation . Patients with platinum- resistant disease (ie, progressed ≥ 1 to < 6 months after the last dose of platinum) or with partially platinum- sensitive disease (ie, progressed ≥ 6 to < 12 months after the last dose of platinum) will be randomized 2:1 to receive either rucaparib or weekly paclitaxel. P atients with platinum- sensitive disease (ie, progre ssed ≥ 12 months after the last dose of platinum) will be randomized 2:1 to receiv e either rucaparib or platinum- based chemotherapy. The choice of platinum- based chemotherapy will be per Investigator’s discretion; options include monotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin ) or combination therapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel, carboplatin and gemcitabine, or cisplatin and gemcitabine ). These chemotherapy options are among the recommended standard- of-care treatments (per National Comprehensive Cancer Network [ NCCN] and E uropean Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO] guidelines) for patients with relapsed , platinum- sensitive ovarian cancer .8, 10 A 2:1 randomization to receive either rucaparib or chemotherapy will allow for statistical comparison of PFS, OS, and ORR between the treatment arms and provide access to rucaparib for a larger numbe r of patients who would otherwise receive standard chemotherapy. Stratification by progression -free interval after most recent platinum-containing therapy will occur upon study entry to maintain balance between treatment groups. The study drug is open label. B linding of the Investigators and patients is not possible because rucaparib is a tablet taken orally and chemotherapy in this study will be administered via IV infusion. Additionally, the dosing regimens differ, making it impossible to blind the patients to treatment. Rucaparib will be administered as 600 mg BID based upon supportive Phase 1/2 clinical e fficacy and safety. Paclitaxel will be administered as 60 to 80 mg/m 2 (dose per institutional standard of care) on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28- day cycle (with a week"
46,page_46,"Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amendmen t 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 47 break from dosing on Day 22 in each cycle) via IV infusion. This regimen of paclitaxel was selected instead of the conventional 3-weekly schedule as s tudies have shown that weekly administration provides clinical benefit similar to the 3 -weekly schedule and causes less neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy.56-61 Other single -agent and doublet chemotherapy dosage and administration will follow institutional guidelines/Prescribing Information for each agent in 28- day cycles. There is limited data regarding the activity of weekly paclitaxel in patients with BRCA 1/2 mutated ovarian cancer, but the data that are available support the use of this schedul e of paclitaxel in this patient population. A retrospective study has shown that single- agent paclitaxel is active in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer harboring a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation, with ORRs of 60% and 27%, in platinum-sensitive and platinum -resistant disease, respectively . Notably, of the platinum- sensitive patients who received single- agent paclitaxel (15/26), the ORR observed with weekly paclitaxel (60%) was identical to the ORR (60%) observed with standard 3- weekly paclitaxel. 57 In addition, a study conducted by Ang et al, demonstrated a 50% (5/10) RECIST ORR in heavily pretreated patients with BRCA 1/2 mutations who had been treated with olaparib and subsequently re- challenged with weekly paclitaxel .62 Overall, the chemotherapy agents that were selected as comparators for this study have demonstrated activi ty in advanced ovarian cancer. Weekly paclitaxel has robust clinical activity, a favorable safety profile, and is recommended by NCCN and ESMO guidelines for the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer. 8-10 Cisplatin and carboplatin are effective single- agent therapies as well as in combination (doublet therapy) with paclitaxel or gemcitabine for treatment of ovarian cancer in patients with platinum- sensitive disease as recommended by NCCN and ESMO guidelines.8, 10, 11 Therefore, these chemotherapies are appropriate comparators to confirm rucaparib benefit for the planned patient population."

The system should be accessed to record each dispensation of rucaparib and each administration of chemotherapy comparators according to the patient’s randomized treatment. Guidelines for the use of the IRT will be provided to study sites. Study sites should follow local guid elines for the handling of cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.5.1 Rucaparib The starting dose of rucaparib is 600 mg ingest ed BID. Patients may take r ucaparib with or without food . Each dose should be taken with at least 8 oz. (240 mL) of water. Tablets should be swallowed whole without crushing or chewing. Patients should take rucaparib doses as close to 12 hours apart as possible, preferably at the same times every day. If a patient misses a dose (ie, does not take it within 4 hours of the scheduled time), the patient should skip the missed dose and resume taking rucaparib with the next scheduled dose. Missed or vomited doses should not be made up. Dosing with rucaparib may be held or reduced as described in Section 7.5.1.1. Each treatment cycle of rucaparib is 28 days. Patients will b e provided a sufficient quantity of study drug to last until Day 1 of the next treatment cycle. Patients will be instructed to bring their rucaparib tablets and all containers (empty, partially used, and/or unopened) to the next scheduled visit for reconciliation by site personnel. After the last dose of rucaparib is taken (init ial or crossover treatment), the patient will be followed for 28 (± 3) days for safety and efficacy data. 7.5.1.1 Rucaparib Dose Modification Criteria Treatment with rucaparib should be held if any of the following are observed and a dose reduction should be consi dered or implemented. • Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity • Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting, or diarrh ea adequately controlled with systemic antiemetic/antidiarrheal medication administered in standard doses accordi ng to the study center routines). Grade 3 or Grade 4 ALT/AST elevations should be managed as described below . • At the discretion of the investigator, oral study drug may be interrupted or continued if new or worsening unexplained pulmonary symptoms suggestive of pneumonitis"

MANAGEMENT OF ANEMIA If anemia CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 occurs and persists for > 14 days, or a dependence upon blood transfusions occurs, then weekly complete blood counts are recommended until resolution of the anemia to ≤ Grade 1. If after 42 days of treatment interruption anemia has not improved to Gra de ≤ 1, a referral to a hematologist and analysis of the bone marrow according to institutional standard practic e is recommended. • Refer t o Secti ons 10.3 and 10.7 of the protocol for ad ditional information regarding classification and reporting of MDS or AML as an AESI. MANAGEMENT OF RUCAPARIB TREATMENT -EMERGENT ALT/AST ELEVATIONS • Grade 4 ALT/AST elevations: hold rucaparib until values have returned to Grade 2 or better, then resume ruc aparib wi th a dose reduction. Monitor liver function tests weekly for 3 weeks after rucaparib has been restarted. • Grade 3 ALT/AST elevations, in the absence of other signs of liver dysfunction, should be managed as follows: – Monitor liver function tests weekly until improvement to ≤ Grade 2. – Continuation of rucaparib with elevation of ALT/AST up to Grade 3 is permitted provided bilirubin is < ULN and alkaline phosphatase is < 3 x ULN. – If patient has Grade 3 ALT/AST and continues on rucaparib, and levels do not decline within 2 weeks or they continue to rise, treatment interruption and resolution to ≤ Grade 2 will be required before rucaparib can be resumed, either at the current dose or at a reduced dose. Treatment with rucapa rib should be held until the toxicity resolves to ≤ CTCAE Grade 2. Twice daily dosing may then be resumed at either the same dose or a lower dose, per investigator discretion. If treatment is resumed at the same dose, and the patient experiences the same t oxicity, the dose should be reduced following resolution of the event to ≤ CTCAE Grade 2. If the patient continues to experience toxicity, additional dose reduction steps are permitted ; however, the investigator should consult with the Sponsor ’s medical mo nitor before reducing to 300 mg BID. If a patient continues to experience toxicity despite dose reduction steps to 300 mg BID, or if dosing with rucaparib is interrupted for > 14 consecutive days due to toxicity, treatment should be discontinued, unless ot herwise agreed between the investigator and the Sponsor."

Rucaparib treatment must be interrupted if biochemical criteria for suspected DILI are met, according to presence of the following laboratory abnormalities: ALT or AST > 3x ULN AND bilirubin > 2x ULN. While treatment is interrupted, the patient should be evaluated for the presence of confounding factors including malignant disease in the liver, co- administration of other suspect drugs, cholestasis, and viral or autoimmune hepatitis that could have caused the laboratory abnormalities. Other laboratory investigations of liver function such as monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) should be implemented as indicated. If no alternative cause is identified, rucaparib must be permanently discontinued. All cases of possible DILI must be reported as SAEs (see Section 10.9 ) and will be followed until all abnormalities have returned to normal, returned to baseline levels, or an alternative cause is found to explain the combination of the increased transaminases and total bilirubin. MANAGEMENT OF NEW O R WORSENING PULMONARY SYMPTOMS If new or worsening unexplained pulmonary symptoms suggestive of pneumonitis (including, but not limited to, dyspnea) occur, or a deterioration of pulmonary function is observed, and/or radiologic abnormality is detected in t he lungs, and this occurs in the absence of any clear diagnosis, a diagnostic workup (including high resolution CT scan) in consultation with a pulmonologist should be performed in order to rule out pneumonitis. During this time, treatment with rucaparib may be interrupted or continued per investigator discretion. Following investigation, if pneumonitis is not confirmed, treatment with rucaparib may be resumed/continued as deemed appropriate by the investigator and in accordance with the study protocol dire ctions for management of AEs. All confirmed events of pneumonitis should be treated as appropriate per medical judgement and institutional guidelines. If the event resolves and retreatment with ruc aparib is being considered, please consult the Sponsor’s Me dical Monitor. Re -treatment with rucaparib may be resumed at the current or a reduced dose, if appropriate.

The patient must provide additional consent that should be obtained within reasonable timeframe of the documented decis ion to continue treatment with rucaparib. Clinical scenarios where continuation of study drug after radiographic progression may be considered include 1) a patient for whom radiographic progression develops slowly while disease -related symptoms remain well controlled, 2) a patient who experiences progression in a site of disease that is unlikely to adversely affect prognosis (eg, enlargement of a solitary lymph node), or 3) a patient with general disease control but limited progression in sites of disease that can be managed with local therapies such as surgery or radiation. Patients continuing to receive rucaparib will continue to have all protocol required assessments as described in Section 8 . 7.5.6.1 Crossover to Rucaparib Treatment Patients initially rando mized to chemotherapy have the option to cross over to rucaparib treatment upon radiologic disease progression with Sponsor (or designee) approval of the radiology report confirming disease progression, signed consent for crossover, and meeting eligibility for the crossover as listed in Section 6.4. Patients who cross over to receive rucaparib will continue to have all protocol- required assessments as described in Section 8. Crossover to rucaparib can occur aft er toxicities related to chemotherapy have resolved or sufficiently stabilized and patient meets all criteria for initiation of treatment with rucaparib. Initiation of treatment with rucaparib should occur within 8 weeks following radiologic disease progression. 7.5.6.2 Continuation of Rucaparib If a patient receiving rucap arib (either initial randomization or as crossover treatment) has met criteria for radiologic disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1, but the patient continues to derive clinical benefit per the investigator, then continuation of treatment will be permitted . In such cases, the documented decision to continue will be made jointly between the investigator and the Sponsor (or designee) (see Section 7.5.6).

The IRT will be used to manage study drug inventory at all sites. In order to function properl y, the system will require real -time entry of study drug receipt, dispensation, destruction, etc. by study personnel at the study center. The site is responsible for the return or destruction of study drug supplied by the Sponsor as required. Authorization to destroy study drug at the site that has not been dispensed to a patient (eg, expired study drug), mus t be requested from the Sponsor prior to destruction. Any study drug supplied by the Sponsor accidentally or deliberately destroyed must be account ed for. All study drug containers must be accounted for prior to their destruction at the study center, accor ding to institutional procedures fo r disposal of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs. Unused study drug containers should be destroyed on- site if possible. If destruction on site is not possible, supply should be returned to the drug depot. During the course of the study and at completion of the study, the number of study drug containers received, dispensed, returned, and destroyed must be reconciled. For comparator chemotherapy that is sourced locally, the study site should follow local drug accountability pr actices. 7.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy Patients who have received prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor including IV or oral rucaparib or with sing le-agent paclitaxel or nab- paclitaxel are not eligible to participate in this study. During the study, support ive care (eg, antiemetics; analgesics for pain control) may be used at the investigator’s discretion and in accordance with institutional procedu res. Supportive care must be recorded for each patient in the appropriate section of the eCRF. All procedures performed (eg , thoracentesis, etc.) during the study must be documented on the eCRF."

Prior treatment with such excluded anticancer therapies must have been completed > 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug. 7.8.2 Hematopoietic Growth Factors and Blood Products Erythropoietin, darbepoetin alfa, and/or hematopoietic colony- stimulating factors for treatment of cytopenia s should be administered according to institutional guidelines. Transfusion thresholds for blood product support will be in accordance with institutional guidelines. 7.8.3 CYP450 Isoenzyme Inhibitors, Inducers, and Substrates Based on the results from the in vivo CYP interaction study (CO -338-044), rucaparib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2, and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. Caution should be used in patients taking concomitant medicines that a re sensitive substrates of CYP1A2 , CYP2C9, and/or CYP3A ( Appendix 3). Patients taking phenytoin, a CYP2C9 substrate with a narrow therapeutic window, should have therapeutic drug level monitored while using concomitantly with rucaparib. Although in vitro rucaparib metabolism mediated by CYP3A4 was slow, a significant contribution of CYP3A4 in vivo cannot be excluded. Caution should be used for concomitant use of str ong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. 7.8.4 Transporter Inhibitors, Inducers, and Substrates Based on the results from Study CO-338-095, rucaparib weakly inhibited BCRP. Caution should be used for concomitant use of BCRP substrates (eg, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine) . 7.8.5 Bisphosphonates Bisphosphonates are permitted. 7.8.6 Anticoagulants Rucaparib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 in vivo. Caution should be exercised in patients receiving rucaparib and concomitant warfarin (Coumadin). P atients taking warfarin should have INR monitored regularly per sta ndard clinical practice."

O ther concomitant medications, except for analgesics, chronic treatments for concomitant medical conditions, or agents required for life -threatening medica l problems, should be avoided. H erbal and complementary therapies should not be encouraged because of unknown side effects and potential drug interaction s, but any taken by the patient should be documented appropriately on the eCRF. Rucaparib marginally increased digoxin AUC by 20%. Caution should be exercised for patients receiving rucaparib and requiring concomitant medication with digoxin. Patients taking digoxin should have their digoxin levels monitored after starting rucaparib and then regularly per standard clinical practice. Rucaparib marginally increased the C max and mildly increased the AUC of oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgest rel). No clinically meaningful DDIs are expected for concomitant use of oral contraceptives and rucaparib. In vitro, rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of MATE 1 and MATE2-K, a moderate inhibitor of OCT1, and a weak inhibitor of OCT2. As inhibition of these t ransporters could increase metformin renal elimination and decrease liver uptake of metformin, caution is advised when metformin is co -administered with rucaparib. Although in vitro rucaparib metabolism mediate d by CYP3A4 was slow, a significant contributi on of CYP3A4 in vivo cannot be excluded. Caution should be used for concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers."

To participate in t he study, informed consent must be obtained from each potential patient prior to any study activities. The information on the IRB/ ERC-approved consent form should be translated and communicated in the language the patient (or legally authorized representative) can understand. Obtaining written informed consent does not signify the start of the Screening Phase. The first study -specific, screening activity performed after signature of the informed consent form begins the Screening Phase. Informed consent does not expire unless specifically withdrawn by the patient. Analysis of tumor tissue for a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation (germline or somatic) will be performed using Foundation Medicines NGS test. Results of th e FMI test will be provided to patients who con sent to receive this information. In the event a BRCA1/2 alteration is identified in tumor tissue, the patient may be referred by the investi gator for genetic counseling and potential germline testing per institutional guidelines. If th e patient chooses to have germline testing, this result will be entered in the clinical trial database for this study. Additionally, patients participating in the optional tumor tissue biopsy at the time of radiographic disease progression/ randomized treatment discontinuation must provide additional consent for this procedure. Patients who cross over to treatment with rucaparib after radiologic disease progressio n per RECIST Version 1.1 by investigator assessment must provide additional consent to continue treatment, as well as Sponsor (or designee) approval of the radiology report confirming disease progression . Details regarding crossover to rucaparib begin in Section 8.6. Patients randomized to rucaparib with radiologic disease progression who are still r eceiving benefit and are allowed to continue rucaparib treatment must also provide consent for continued treatment. All procedures and assessments are to be completed with in ± 3 days of the scheduled time unless otherwise stated . 8.3 Initial Study Screening Prior to Randomization Following written informed consent, and unless otherwise specified, the following assessments will be performed prior to randomization within the allowable windows of time as indicated below. Assessments perfo rmed within the specified windows, but prior to patient signing informed consent, are acceptable only if confirmed to have been standard of care. Screening procedures may be repeated if the findings/results are considered invalid or not representative of t he patient ’s baseline medical status. When screening procedures are repeated, the rationale should be documented in the source file. 8.3.1 W ithin 60 Days P rior to R andomization • Medical /oncology history, including demographic information (birth date, race, gender, etc.), smoking status, and oncology history, including date of diagnosis for epithelial"

Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amend ment 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 89 9 METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION 9.1 Medical History and Demograp hic/ Baseline Characteristics Basic demographic and baseline characteristics will be collected during screening. In addition to the evaluation of a patient’s medical history in terms of study eligibility, all relevant medical conditions will be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Events that occur after signing of informed consent but prior to initiation of study drug, unless due to a protocol -mandated procedure, should be recorded on the Medical History eCRF. The p atient’s entire oncology history will be collected on the appropriate eCRF including date of diagnosis for epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer (and other malignancy, if applicable), prior surgeries/ treatments received for cancer, dates of treatment administration, be st response achieved, date of progression and how assessed, progression- free interval after last platinum regimen, radiology reports, and gBRCA mutation status (if known). 9.2 Prior and Concomitant Medication Assessments Medications being used by the patient will be recorded as prior medications during screening and as concomitant medications following receipt of the first dose of study drug through the completion of the 28-day S afety Follow-up V isit after t reatment dis continuation. Medications information will be entered in the appropriate eCRF after it is obtained at each study visit. 9.3 Efficacy Evaluations 9.3.1 Disease/ Tumor Assessments Disease/ tumor assessments will be performed during screening (baseline) , at the end of every 8 calendar weeks aft er Cycle 1 Day 1 (within 5 days before is permitted) during treatment, and continue post- treatment every 8 calendar weeks , relative to Cycle 1 Day 1, until radiologically confirmed disease progression by RECIST Version 1.1, as assessed by the investigator, or death (unless these were the reasons for treatment discontinuation) , or initiation of subsequent treatment. Tumor assessments should be performed at the time of treatment discontinuation if the reason was other than death or r adiologically -confirmed disease progression and it has been ≥ 8 weeks since the last assessment . Patients who have been on study at least 18 months, may decrease the frequency of tum or assessments to every 16 weeks (within 5 days before is permitted) . Tumor response will be interpreted using REC IST Ver sion 1.1 ( Appendix 1). Patients who meet GCIG CA- 125 criteria for disease progression should have a radiologic assessment and be assessed by RECIST Version 1.1. If the radiologic assessment does not confirm GCIG CA-125 disease progression, patients should continue on treatment and continue to be assessed by RECIST Version 1.1 per the protocol schedule of assessments. Disease/ tumor assessments should consist of clinical examination and appropriate imaging technique s (ie, computed tomography [CT] scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with"
89,page_89,"Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amend ment 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 90 appropriate slice thickness per RECIST Version 1.1); other studies (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], X -ray, positron emission tomography [PET], and ultrasound) may also be perfor med if required. The same methods used to detect lesions at baseline are to be used to follow the same lesions throughout the clinical study. If a patient has known brain metastases, this disease should be evaluated at each required assessment time. Copies of CT scans (and other imaging, as appropriate) will be collected from all patients for Independent Radiology R eview (IRR) . 9.3.2 Tumor Markers Blood samples to assess CA -125 will be collected at screening, on Day 1 of Cycle 1, at the start of every 2nd cycle thereafter (ie, Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, etc.), at treatment discontinuation, and as clinically indicated. All CA- 125 tests will be performed by a local laboratory. CA-125 < ULN will be required to designate a CR. 9.4 Safety Evaluations 9.4.1 Adverse Event Assessment The investigator has the responsibility for assessing the safety of the patients and for compliance with the protocol to ensure study integrity. Patients will be monitored for AEs during study participation (beginning at the time informed co nsent is obt ained) and until 28 days after the last dose of study drug. After the 28 -day window, only treatment- related SAEs assessed as potentially related to study drug (including serious reports of pneumonitis or similar events, ie, interstitial lung disease, pulmo nary fibrosis, acute interstitial pneumonitis, alveolitis necrotizing, alveolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and organizing pneumonia, if considered to be related to study drug), and the AESIs of MDS and AML irrespective of causality, need to be reported. In the ti me after informed consent is provided but before study drug is administered, AEs/ SAEs are to be recorded if they are the result of a study-related procedure. Any ongoing SAEs, AESIs, or treatment- related Grade 3/4 AEs will be followed unti l resolution or stabilization. AEs and laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE grading system (Version 4.03) and recorded on the eCRF. Complete details for monitoring AEs, including the definition of drug -related AEs, are provide d in Section 10. If a patient discontinues from treatment and begins subsequent anti- cancer therapy, the Sponsor will terminate collection of SAEs, with the exception of the AESIs of MDS and AML. 9.4.2 Clinical Laborator y Investigations Samples for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and serum pregnancy will be analyzed by a local laboratory. Fasting is not required before blood sampling. The panels of laboratory tests to be performed are shown below:"

Hematology results must be reviewed by the investigator before the start of treatment with study drug and ongoing at times testing occurs . Additional and more frequent tests may be performed at the investigator’s discretion. Serum Chemistry: total protein, albumin, creatinine or estimated GFR using the Cockcroft Gault formula, BUN or urea, total bilirubin, alka line phosphatase (ALP), ALT, AST, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate (optional), calcium, phosphorus, and lipid panel (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein [LDL], high density lipoprotein [HDL], and triglycerides), at screening, during treatment at each study visit, and at the treatment discontinuation visit for all patients. Testing of bicarbonate is optional and should be performed when clinically indicated or evaluated through arterial blood gas at the investigator’s judgement . With the exception of bicarbonate, phosphorus, and the lipid panel, serum chemistry results must be reviewed by the investigator before the start of treatment with study drug and ongoing at times testing occurs. Urinalysis: performed locally on a freshly voided clean sample by dipstick for protein, glucose, blood, pH, and ketones. If dipstick findings are abnormal based on the investigator’s judgment , then a microscopic evaluation will be performed to assess the abnormal findings. Urinalysis will be performed at screening only, but may be conducted at other times as clinically indicated. Serum Pregnancy: for women of childbearing potential only. A serum pregnancy test must be performed ≤ 3 days prior to first dose of study drug (a negative result is required before dosing can begin) and at the treatment discontinuation visit. A s erum pregnancy test must be performed ≤ 3 days prior to Day 1 of every cycle during the Treatment P hase, and a serum pregnancy test performed at Treatment Discontinuation . A positive seru m pregnancy test during study participation must be reported to the Sponsor . Refer to Section 10.6 for details. Laboratory reports will be reviewed by the investigator or delegated physician who will then comment on out-of-rang e parameters and assess clinical significance. Clinically significant abnormalities and associated panel results, as well as results of any addit ional tests performed as follow-up to the abnormalities, will be documented on the eCRF as an AE. Refer to Section 10.5 for guidelines on reporting of abnormal laboratory values as AEs. 9.4.3 Vital Signs Vital signs will include blood pressure, heart rate , and body temperature and will be taken after the patient has been resti ng for at least 5 minutes during screening, at study visits during the Treatment Phase , and at the treatment discontinuation visit."

The investigator or qualified designee will review the ECGs locally and assess the results as normal or abnormal (clinically significant or not clinically significant). If it is clinically indicated, ECGs can be performed at other times during the study. 9.4.5 Body Weight and Height Height will be measured during the screening visit only. Weight will be me asured per institutional guidelines during screening, on Day 1 of each cycle, at each study visit prior to chemotherapy administration, and at the treatment discontinuation visit. 9.4.6 Physical Examinations Physical examinations will include an assessment of al l the major body systems. Complete physical ex aminations will be performed during s creening and at treatment discontinuation. Physical examinations at study visits during the Treatme nt Phase will be limited as appropriate. 9.4.7 ECOG Performance Status ECOG per formance status (Appendix 2) will be assessed during screening, at study visits during the Treatment Phase, and at the treatment discontinuation visit. The ECOG performance status should be assessed by the same st udy personnel at each visit, if possible. For eligibility purposes, patients with borderline ECOG performance status should be considered carefully to avoid enrolling patients who may have significant impairment. 9.5 Biomarker Analysis – FFPE Tumor Tissue All patients, with the exception of those known (ie, documented) to harbor a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation (germlin e or somatic), will be required to provide sufficient quantity of archival tumor tissue or a screening biopsy for central laboratory analysis prior to enrollment. A sufficient quantity of archival tumor tissue or tumor tissue from a screening biopsy must be submitted directly to the central laboratory at least 3 weeks prior to the planned randomization for determination of HRD status . Patients with a known deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation (germline or somatic) must also submit archival tumor tissue for central laboratory testing ; however, enrollment is not contingent upon the central laboratory analysis of tissue. A local BRCA1/2 mutation result from"

Sufficient quantity of archival tumor tissue must be confirmed by central laboratory testing in these patients during the study. If archival tumor tissue of sufficient quantity is not available, the patient m ay undergo a screening biopsy. Patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation who meet all other entry criteria will be eligible for the study . Sufficient archival FFPE tumor tissue (enough for 1 x 4 µ m section for H&E and approximately 8 to 12 x 10 µ m sections [unstained], or equivalent) for planne d analyses should be provided. In addition to determining HRD status, gene expression profiling on extracted RNA will be analyzed to classify tumors into gene expression molecular subtypes, which have been shown to associate with patient survival in HGSOC .64 Refer to the Pathology Charter for details. The mos t recently collected tumor tissue sample available that is of adequate quality (at least 20% tumor content with a minimum of 80% nucleated cellular content) must be provided or a new sample acquired. An optional tumor tissue biopsy sample is requested any time after disease progression , crossover to rucaparib, or treatment discontinuation until the start of the next non-study treatment. P atients must provide additional consent for this optional tumor tissue biopsy sample. If disease progression is caused by appearance of a new lesion(s), th e lesion (s) should be prioritized for the optional biopsy. Detailed sample handling instructions are located in the Pathology Char ter. 9.6 Biomarker Analysis – Blood Blood samples will be collected as specifi ed in the Schedule of Assessments during screening, before dosing on Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 6, and at treatment discontinuation from all patients entered in the study for plasma ctDNA and genomic (g/sBRCA) analyses. Blood samples will also be collected at the same times in patients who cross over to rucaparib treatment. Genomic DNA will be extracted from the cellular portion of these blood samples and analyzed to determine whether the B RCA1/2 mutation is germline or somatic prior to final data analysis. Sample collection details are provided in the Laboratory Manual. 9.7 Pharmacokinetics Evaluation For patients receiving rucaparib , plasma samples are to be collected for trough level PK analy sis of rucaparib before the morning dose on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6 as close to 12 hours after the previous dose as possible. If the start of the next treatment cycle is delayed, the PK sample should still be collected during this visit instead of on Day 1 of the delayed start of the next treatment cycle. Samples are not to be collected in patients receiving chemotherapy or crossing over to rucaparib. Refer to the Laboratory Manual for sample collection details for PK samples."

Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amend ment 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 95 10 ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT 10.1 Definition of an Adverse Event An AE is defined as any unt oward medical occurrence in a patient administered a medicinal product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), sympto m, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal product. This includes an exacerbation of pre-existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction, or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere on the eCRF under specific efficacy assessments. Anticipated fluctuations of pre-existing conditions, including the disease under study, that do not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening are not considered AEs. It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur durin g the study. AEs should be elicited by asking the patient a non-leading question (eg, “Have you expe rienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?”). The existence of an AE may be concluded from a spontaneous report of the patient; from the physical examination; or from special tests such as the ECG, laboratory assessments, or other study-specified procedure (source of AE). Symptoms reported spontaneously by the patient during the physical examination would also qualify as an AE (and hence documented on the AE eCRF, not on the physical examination eCRF, which is reserved fo r physical signs or findings). 10.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs at any dose (or, occurs after informed consent is given and prior to dosing if the SAE is related to a study procedure ) that: • Results in death. Any event resulting in death during the reporting period (from date of first dose of study drug through 28 days after last dose) must be treated as an SAE and reported as such. An event related to a study procedure that occurs after informed consent, but prior to dosing that results in death must also be reported as an SAE. • Is life -threatening (patient is at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred) • Requires in -patient hospitalization (formal admission to a hospital for medical reas ons) or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity • Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect • Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse."
95,page_95,"Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amend ment 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 96 10.3 Definition of an Adverse Event of Special Interest AESIs (serious or nonserious) are defined as AEs of scientific and me dical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the Sponsor can be appropriate. Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to characterize and understan d it. Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by the trial Sponsor to other parties (eg , regulators) might also be warranted . Details on the Sponsor ’s currently agreed list of AESIs for rucaparib can be found in the current rucaparib IB. These AESIs are to be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event (see Section 10.10 for reporting instructions) . 10.4 Events or Outcomes Not Qualifying as Serious Adverse Events The following are not considered SAEs and therefore do not need to be reported as such: • Pre-planned or elective hospitalization including social and/ or convenience situations (eg, respite care) • Hospital visits of less than 24 hours duration (eg, patient presents to the emergency room, but is not admitted to a ward) • Overdose of either Clovis study drug or concomitant medication unless the event meets SAE criteria (eg, hospitalization). However, the event should still be captured as a nonserious AE on the appropriate eCRF page • Events of progression of the patient’s underlying cancer as well as events clearly related to progression of the patient’s cancer (signs and symptoms of progression) should not be reported as a n SAE . • Events that meet the SAE criteria (as outlined in Section 10.2 ) and occur after informed consent, but before the first dose of study drug that are considered unrelated to protocol-mandated sc reening procedures. 10.5 Clinical Laboratory Assessments as Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess the clinical significance of all abnormal values as defined by the list of reference ranges from the local laboratory. In some cases, significant changes in lab values within the normal ran ge will require similar judgment. An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as an AE only if any one of the following criteria is met: • an action on the study drug is made as a result of the abnormality • intervention for management of the abnormality is required"
96,page_96,"Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amend ment 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 97 • at the discretion of the investigator should the abnormality be deemed clinically significant 10.6 Pregnancy or Drug Exposure d uring Pregnancy If a patient becomes pregnant during the study the investigator is to stop dosing with study drug(s) immediately. A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or SAE; however, any pregnancy occurring in a study patient or partner of a study patient during study participation or within 6 months of last dosing must be repo rted to the Sponsor using the Pregnancy Report Form within the same timelines as an SAE. A pregnancy should be followed through to outcome, whenever possible. Once the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form should be completed an d reported to the Sponsor. AEs, SAEs, or AESIs that occur during pregnancy will be assessed and processed according to the AE or SAE /AESI processes using the appropriate AE or SAE /AESI forms. 10.7 Recording of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Adverse Events of Special Interest Events that occur after signing of informed consent but prior to initiation of study drug, unless due to a protocol-mandated procedure, should be recorded on the Medical History eCRF; however, events are to be reported as SAEs if serious and related to a protocol-mandated procedure during this time. Any AE that occurs after first dose of study drug through 28 days after receiving the last dose of [study drug] will be recorded on the AE eCRF. In order to avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, the AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than the patient’s own words. Whenever possible, the investigator should combine signs and symptoms that constitute a single disease entity or syndrome into a final diagnosis, if appropriate. For example, fever, cough, and shortness of breath may be reported as pneumonia, if that is a reasonable diagnosis. Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the investigational drug. The action taken and the outcome must also be recorded. SAEs and AESIs that occur during the study or within 28 days after receiving the last dose of study drug, whether or not related to study drug, must be reported immediately (ie, within 24 hours of knowledge of the event or additional information for a previously-reported event ) to the Sponsor/ SAE designee. The contact information for reporting of SAEs/ AESIs can be found on the SAE/ AESI Reporting Form. After the 28 -day reporting window after discontinuation of randomized treatment and/or cross over to rucaparib for patients randomized to chemotherapy, only SAEs assessed as potentially related to study drug need to be reported.

All efficacy analyses will be analyzed for the E fficacy Population and for the ITT Population. The Efficacy P opulation is defined as all randomized patients with a deleterious BRCA mutat ion, excluding those patients identified to have a BRCA reversion mutation. The methodology used to identify patients with a BRCA reversion mutation based on analysis of a blood sample obtained prior to randomization will be detailed in a separate document . All safety analyses will be summarized for all patients who received at least one dose of protocol- specified treatment . This study has a randomized part and a crossover part, and all efficacy, disposition, demographics and baseline, and safety will be pre sented separately for these study parts. Quantitative variables will typically be summarized using frequencies and percentages for appropriate categorizations and may also be summarized using descriptive statistics. For variables summarized with descripti ve statistics, the following will be presented: N, mean, standard deviation , median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be presented using frequencies and percentages. The Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to summarize time -to-event v ariables. If estimable, the 50th (median) percentile with the 95% confidence interval (CI) will be summarized for each randomized treatment group. The stratified hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazards model will be used to estimate t he HR between t he randomized treatment groups. The number of patients with events and the number of censored patients will also be presented. Unless otherwise specified, baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to the first day of study drug administration in each of the study parts. All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS ® System, V ersion 9.4 or higher. Further details around the statistical analys es planned in this study will be outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP ). 11.2 Determination of Sample Size The enrollment planned for this study is approximately 345, with 230 patients randomized to rucaparib and 115 patients to chemotherapy . The medi an PFS is assumed to be 12 months for rucaparib and 8 months for the comparator. Assuming a n accrual over about 3 years; a dropout rate of 2%; with a hazard ratio of 0.65; and at least 275 events, a sample size of 345 patients (230 patients randomized to rucaparib"

The primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints will be tested using a hierarchical step -down procedure starting with the primary efficacy endpoint in the Efficacy Population then testing the primary endpoint for the ITT Population. If the primary endpoint is statistically significant, then the secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested in the order specified below where for each endpoint, first in the E fficacy Population, and then in the ITT Population. In order to preserve the overall Type 1 error rate, statistical significance will only be declared for the secondary endpoints, listed below, if the primary endpoint and previous secondary endpoints are also statistically significant; 1. ORR by RECIST Version 1.1; 2. DOR by RECIST Version 1.1; 3. ORR by RECIST Version 1.1 and CA-125 response; and 4. PRO as assessed by the EORTC QLQ -C30 Global H ealth S tatus score . The stratification factor used for randomization is the progression -free interval after most recent platinum-containing therapy (ie, platinum- resistant, partially platinum- sensiti ve, or platinum- sensitive). All efficacy analyses will be based on the randomization strata given at randomization, however, a sensitivity analysis of invPFS may be performed using the actual strata if patients have been allocated incorrectly. 11.6.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses The primary efficacy endpoint for the study is disease progression according to RECIST Version 1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, or death from any cause for the treatment part. Patients without a documented event of progression will be ce nsored on the date of their last tumor assessment (ie, radiologic assessment) or date of randomization if no tumor assessments have been performed. Patients who withdraw from treatment prior to progression will be followed for disease status and survival w henever possible. The primary endpoint of invPFS will b e analyzed using the stratified C ox proportional hazard method ology. The stratified hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazards model will be used to estimate the HR between the randomized treatment groups. 11.6.2 Secondary Efficacy Analys es The seconda ry endpoint of bicrPFS by RECIST Version 1.1 is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression, according to RECIST v1.1 criteria as assessed by BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

PRO endpoints by EORTC QLQ- C30 and QLQ-OV28 will be summarized according to the scoring manual. Analyses of changes from baseline will be analyzed for each scheduled post -baseline visit and for the final visit for each subscale and total score. Patients t hat do not have both a baseline measurement and at least one post -baseline measurement will not be included. At a given visit, the change from baseline will be compared between the randomized treatment groups using an ANCOVA using the treatment and stratification variable as a categorical factor and baseline measurement for the parameter as a continuous covariate. In addition, further analyses using repeated measures modeling or time to event mi ght be used and will be de scribed in the SAP. 11.6.3 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses The endpoints for exploratory analyses are: • To evaluate PFS of study treatment followed by the subsequent line of treatment (PFS2), defined as the time from randomization to the second event of disease progression or death, as assessed by the investigator ; • To evaluate PRO utilizing the EQ -5D; • To assess molecular changes in tumor samples over time in matched pairs; • To assess circulating ctDNA as a molecular marker of efficacy; • To assess efficacy in BRCA -mutation subgroups (ie, germline/somatic and BRCA1/BRCA2) • To evaluate the impact of gene expression molecular subgroups on PFS and OS; • To evaluate disease control rate (RECIST Version 1.1 CR, PR, and prolonged SD > 12 weeks, by investigator assessment)."

The investigator further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by any employee or agent of the study c enter to any third party or otherwise into the public domain. 13.4 Study M onitorin g On behalf of the Sponsor, a contract research organization ( CRO ) or contract monitor will contact and visit the investigator at the study center prior to the entry of the first patient (unless the Sponsor or the CRO has worked with the center recently, in which case this initial visit maybe waived) and at appropriate intervals during the study until after the last patient is completed. The monitor will also perform a study closur e visit. Visits may also be conducted by Sponsor personnel. In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the investigator must ensure provision of sufficient time, reasonable space, and adequate qualified personnel for the monitoring visits. The visit s are for the purpose of verifying adherence to the study protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of data entered on the eCRF and other documents. The investigato r will make all source data (ie , the various study records, the eCRFs, labor atory test reports, other patient records, drug accountability forms, and other pertinent data available for the monitor and allow access to them throu ghout the entire study period. Monitoring is done by comparing the relevant site records of the patients with the entries on the eCRF (ie, source data verification). It is the monitor’s responsibility to verify the adherence to the study protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data recorded on the eCRFs. By agreeing to participate in the study, the investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of the monitoring visits are resolved. Contact information for the study monitor is located in the investigator file. 13.5 Case Report Forms and Study Data Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff at the site under the supervision of the site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. All so urce documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data. Data recorded in the eCRF should be consistent with the data recorded on the source documents. Clinical data , including AEs, c oncomitant medications, and laboratory data will be entered into Medidata RAVE, a 21 CFR Part 11- compliant data capture system. The data system"
113,page_113,"Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amend ment 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 114 includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, inco mplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents. 13.6 Independent Data Monitoring Committee An IDMC will be established to review safety and efficacy data in compliance with a prospective charter. The IDMC will be comprised of medical oncologists with experience in treating patients with the cancer being studied and a statistician, all of whom are not otherwise involved in the study as investigators. The IDMC responsibilities, authorities, and procedures for this study will be documented in the IDMC charter, which will be endorsed and signed by the IDMC prior to the first data review meeting. Following data review, the IDMC will recommend continuation, revision, or termination of the study and/ or continuing or halting enrollment into a particular subgroup. The IDMC will also ensure the study is beneficial to patients (see Section 11.8). The I DMC wi ll meet at least semi -annually after sufficient data has been collected. The IDMC chairperson may convene a formal IDMC meeting if there are safety concerns. T he Sponsor can also request an IDMC review of safety data. Details regarding the IDMC will be in the committee charter. 13.7 Study Termination and Site Closure Both the Sponsor and the investigator re serve the right to te rminate the study at any time. Should this be necessary, both parties will arran ge discontinuation procedures. In termin ating the study, the Sponsor and the investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interests. Refer to Section 5.3 for additional details. The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for medical or administrative reasons. When feasible, a 30 -day written notification w ill be given. The entire study will be stopped if any of the following apply: • The protocol- specified treatment is considered too toxic to continue the study; • Evidence has emerged that, in the opinion of the Sponsor or the investigator(s), makes the continuation of the study unnecessary or unethical; • The stated objectives of the study are achieved; or • The sponsor discontinues the development of rucaparib . Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patient at the time of discontinuat ion of follow -up must be recorded on the eCRF. All reasons for discontinuation of treatment must be documented. If the study is terminated prematurely, the S ponsor will promptly inform the investigators/institutions, and the regulatory authority(ies ) of the termination or suspension and the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. The investigators will promptly inform"
114,page_114,"Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.

Agreement from the investi gator must be obtained for all protocol amendments and amendments to the informed consent document. The IEC/ IRB must be informed of all amendments and give approval prior to their implementation. The Sponsor will submit any study protocol amendments to the concerned regulatory authorities for approval and keep the investigator(s) updated as detailed in the ICH GCP guidelines. 13.9 Retention of Data The study site will maintain a study file, which should contain, at minimum, the Investigator’s Brochure, the prot ocol and any amendments, drug accountability records, correspondence with the IEC/ IRB and the Sponsor, and other study-related documents. The investigator should have control of all essential documents generated by the site. Source documents must be main tained and m eet standard criteria of source documentation practices to ensure data is attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original or certified copy, accurate, and complete, consistent, enduring, and available (ALCOA+), and any changes to data should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry, and should be explained if necessary (via an audit trail) . The investigator must implement proced ures to ensure the integrity of any data generated. The Sponsor and the investigator will maintain a record of the location(s) of their respective essential documents including source documents. The storage systems used during the trial and for archiving (irrespective of media used) must provide for documentation identification, version history, search and retr ieval. The investigator agrees to keep records and those documents that include (but are not limited to) the identification of all participating p atients, medical records, study -specific source documents, source worksheets, all original signed and dated informed consent forms, copies of all eCRFs, query responses, and detailed records of drug disposition to enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities and the Sponsor or its designees. The investigator should have control of and cont inuous access to the eCRF data. The investigator shall retain records required to be maintained for a period of 5 years following the date a marketing application in an ICH region is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until at least 5 years after the investiga tion is discontinued. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirement(s) or if needed by the Sponsor. In addition, the investigator must make provision for the patients’ medical records to be kept for the same period of time."

Measurable Disease: Tumor lesions: measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accur ately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) with the followi ng: • A minimum size of 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan thickness no greater than 5 mm) • A minimum size of 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions that cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as nonmeasurable) • A minimum size of 20 mm by chest X- ray All tumor measurements must be recorded i n millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be not greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. Nonmeasurable Disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly nonmeasurable lesions, are considered nonmeasurable disease. Lesions considered truly nonmeasurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin and lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. Bone Lesions Bone lesions, cyst ic lesion s, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular comment. Bone scan, PET scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the prese nce or disappearance of bone lesions."
123,page_123,"Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amend ment 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 124 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic- blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components that can be evaluated by cross- sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. Blastic bone lesions are nonmeasurable. Cystic Lesions Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographic ally defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions ( neither measurable nor nonmeasurable) because they are, by definition, simple cysts. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred as target lesions. Lesions with Prior Local Treatment Tumor lesions situated in a previous irradiated area or in an area subjected to other locoregional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. Target Lesions All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, represent ative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and reco rded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measure ments (either by imag ing techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and re ported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response. Nontarget Lesions RECIST Version 1.1 criteria require unequivocal quantification of the changes in tumor size for adequate interpretation of the sum of target lesions. Consequently, when the boundaries of the primary are difficult to delineate, this tumor should not be considered a target lesion. Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment."
124,page_124,"Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol : CO -338-043 Amend ment 2 23 October 2020 Confidential Page 125 Evaluation of Target Lesions Complete Response Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short a xis to < 10 mm. Partial Response At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Stable Disease Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. Progressive Disease At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions Complete Response Disapp earance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Stable Disease/Incomplete Response Persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Progressive Disease Appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions. If tumor markers are initially above the institutional ULN, they must normalize for a patient to be considere d a complete responder. Evaluation of Best Overall Response The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since t he treatment started)."

Patients with global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having symptomatic d eterioration. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression, even after discontinuation of treatment. In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual diseas e from normal tissue. When evalu ation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspiration/biopsy) prior to confirming the complete response status."

Duration of Overall Response The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD is objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. Duration of Stable Disease SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started."

To be evaluable for response by CA-125 requires an elevated baseline value of at least twice the upper limit of normal and at least two additional samples after the start of treatment. A response to CA- 125 has occurred if there is at least a 50% decrease from baseline: 1. in a sample collected after initiation of study treatment AND 2. that is confirmed in a subsequent sample collected ≥ 21 days after the prior sample. The absolute value of this confirmatory sample must be ≤ 110% of the prior sample. The date when the first sample with a 50% decrease from baseline is observed is the dat e of the CA-125 response. In patients who have measureable disease by RECIST Version 1.1 and CA -125, the date of response will be the date of the earlier of the two events. When assessing progression, the objective change in tumor size should be used for tr eatment decisions. For example, if a patient has a reduction in measurable disease, but an increase in CA -125 that suggests progression, treatment should continue."
