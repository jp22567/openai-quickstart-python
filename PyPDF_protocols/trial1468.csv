These USMs aim to mitigate the risk for patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) participating in the GLPG1205 -CL-220 (PINTA) study with regard to the Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID -19) pandemic . To this end, the visit window at the end of the treatment period (Visit 9, Week 26) is enlarged (from -28 days up to +56 days ) including extension of study medication intake , i.e. up to a maximum of 56 days beyond 26 weeks of treatment . The chronic preclinical good laboratory practice toxicology studie s up to a duration of 39 weeks support this approach (see Section 2.1.4 of this clinical study protocol and the Investigator’s Brochure ). Furthermore , the 2 reviews of unblinded PINTA study data by the independent Data Monitoring Committee have not raised any safety concerns . In addition, t he window for the End of Study follow -up Visit 10 (± 4 days) is increased to -7 days up to +28 days. If the originally planned Visit 9 or Visit 10 are postponed , then an alternative approach is to conduct unscheduled remote or home visits at that initial visit date, and thereafter at least every 14 days until the newly scheduled Visit 9 or Visit 10 can be performed on site within the enlarged visit window . Alternative visit strategies applicable for Visits 3 to 8 and the early end of treatment Visit (EOT) are also included in this amendment , as well as the option of direct -to-patient shipment of the Investigational Medical Product (IMP) in case a subject is not able to visit the site for IMP resupply . The measures inte nd to mitigate the impact of the current COVID -19 pandemic for the participating IPF subjects . The objective is to reduce the risk of infection for the participating subjects by increasing the flexibility of study visits and thereby avoiding exposure risk . Due to COVID -19 measures, for individual subjects the overall study duration may be extended up to a maximum of 84 days (12 weeks) from the originally planned duration . The changes made to the general clinical study protocol version 2.0, dated 24-Jan-2020, are described below, with a brief rationale / description of each change and the applicable sections."

Applicable Section: Throughout the protocol The s econdary objective /endpoint s evaluating time to major clinical endpoints has been modified : − “All cause mortality ” will be assessed in addition to only respiratory -related mortality to complement this endpoint . − “Need for placement on the lung transplant list ” was removed because of differences in management of transplants and lists of candidates between countries preventing the analysis as an aligned endpoint . This event has also been removed from the events that will be adjudicated. Applicable Section s: Summary Section 3.2 Secondary objectives Section 4.1.2 Secondary endpoints Section 6.4.3 Clinical Endpoints Section 7.3.4.2 Secondary Efficac y Endpoints Analysis Section 8.2 Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Eligibility criteria − Inclusion criterion 3: The time from first diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has been increased from 3 years to 5 years, to facilitate recruitment to the study considering the longer survival rates after introduction of nintedanib and pirfenidone as standard of care treatments for IPF, and to align with other Phase 3 studies in IPF . The diagnostic guideline used should be that applicable at the time of dia gnosis of IPF. Accordingly, a patient diagnosed in 2015 is eligible using the 2011 American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS)/Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS)/Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) guidelines, but a new diagno sis should follow the 2018 guidelines . The references have been updated. The requirement for subjects receiving treatment with pirfenidone or nintedanib to be on a stable dose for at least 8 weeks before screening, and during screening has been introduced. A stable dose is defined as the highest tolerated dose. − The prednisone (or equivalent) dose allowed has been reduced to ≤10 mg/day (inclusion criterion 3 and exclusion criterion 18) to reduce background medications with drug-drug interaction ( DDI) potenti al (cytochrome P450 3A4 [ CYP3A4 ] inducer) . − All forms of lung biopsy will be accepted, rather than only surgical lung biopsy (inclusion criterion 4). − The definition of disease progression within the last 9 months as assessed by forced vital capacity has been clarified (inclusion criterion 5). − The r equirement for stability of co -medication for pre -existing conditions has been restricted to treatment for chronic diseases and conditions, and the stability of treatmen t relaxed to limit only to clinically relevant changes (inclusion criterion 6 and Section 4.3.4.2) to reflect the real life situation of the patient and to facilitate study participation of IPF subjects . − The requirements for completion of the 6 -Minute Walk Test have been further clarified (inclusion criterion 9) by adding “ without a condition putting the subject at risk of falling during the test ( at investigator’s discretion). The use of a cane is allowed, while the use of a stroller is not allowed at all , under any circumstances ”. − Exclusion criterion 2 has been modified to exclude only a current immunosuppressive condition."
9,page_9,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 10/88 Version 3.00, Final , 20 Confidential Information Amendment 1 Global (dated 24 Jan 2019) − The exclusion criterion 3 hepatitis test requirements have been modulated because GLPG1205 is not a strong immunosuppressor and the risk for hepatitis reactivation is considered to be low . The following changes have been made : − Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibody have been replaced with hepatitis B surface antigen only − Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody testing is re placed with an assay for anti-HCV antibody that is, if positive, confirmed by HCV RNA positivity − “History of hepatitis from any cause with the exception of hepatitis A” has been removed, and replaced with “Su bjects with a resolved hepatitis A at least 3 m onths prior to first dosing of the investigational medicinal product ( IMP) can be included .” − Addition of moderate to severe liver impairment to exclusion criterion 13 to increase the safety of the subjects and to be in line with Section 2.4. − The threshold for creatinine clearance defining abnormal renal function in exclusion criterion 14 has been lowered from <60 mL/min to <30 mL/min, to reflect the advanced age of IPF population and considering the limited renal excretion of GLPG1205 . − Exclusion criterion 15 excludes subjects who underwent major surgery within 3 months prior to screening or who have major surgery planned during the study period . A note that being on a lung transplant list is allowed has been added because being on a list is not associated with a high chance of a lung transplant occurring and should not exclude the patient from treatment in the study. − The minimum interval between participation in a drug, device or biologic investigational research study and this study has been set as within 12 weeks or 5 half -lives of the agent whichever is longer (exclusion criterion 17). − Additional medications have been added to exclusion criterion 19 for subjects on medications with known drug -drug interactions (DDI) with GLPG1205 • Medica tions which are known dual CYP3A4 and CYP 2C19 inhibitors ( non-exhaustive list provided in Appendix 8 ). Rationale: GLPG1205 primary metabolism pathways are CYP3A4 and CYP 2C19. A strong inhibition of those pathways could lead to increased exposure to GLPG1205 and potential safety/tolerability issues. • Medications which are known to be CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 strong inducers ( non- exhaustive list provided in Appendix 9 ). Rationale: GLPG1205 primary metabolism pathways are CYP3A4 and CYP 2C19. A strong induction of these pathway s could lead to decreased exposure to GLPG1205 and lack of efficacy.

SUMMARY Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lethal lung disease for which two oral treatments (pirfenidone and nintedanib) are approved in the European Union (EU) , United States (US) and other regions around the world. These treatments appear to slow disease progression however, the residual decline in lung function (as measured by forced vital capacity [FVC] ) remains substantial. In addition, both compounds are frequently associated with side effects potentially limiting the use in clinical practice. There thus remains a significant unmet medical need for the development of additional therapies targeting different disease pathways that could potentially prove to be more effective by further preventing the decline in FVC with an acceptable saf ety profile. Recent published data suggest the relevance of GPR84 in fibrotic pathways. In humans, first signs of clinical efficacy have been shown in a clinical study in subjects with IPF investigating a compound targeting GPR84 as well as GPR40. It thus can be anticipated that compounds targeting GPR84 could lead to a new class of therapy for IPF. GLPG1205 is a novel, selective, and potent GPR84 antagonist, which has shown a good safety and tolerability profile at the targeted dose of 100 mg once daily ( quaque di e [q.d.]) in clinical studies. Consequently, it seems appropriate to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of GLPG1205 compared to placebo in subject with IPF on top of local standard of care (defined as receiving nintedanib, pirfenidone, or neither nintedanib nor pirfenidone). Objectives: Primary Objective − To evaluate the efficacy of GLPG1205 treatment in subjects with IPF on pulmonary function as evaluated by FVC compared to placebo over 26 weeks. Secondary Objectives − To evaluate the safety and tolerability of GLPG1205 treatment compared to placebo over 26 weeks . − To evaluate the impact of GLPG1205 treatment compared to placebo on time to any major events (whichever occurs first) defined as: • Mortality (all cause and r espiratory -related ) • Hospitalization (all -cause and respiratory -related) − To evaluate the changes from baseline in functional exercise capacity measured by the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), in IPF subjects treated with GLPG1205 compared to placebo at Week 26. − To evaluate the changes in quality of life measures in IPF subjects treated with GLPG1205 compared to placebo over 26 weeks . − To evaluate the PK of GLPG1205 , nintedanib and pirfenidone in IPF subjects."

INTRODUCTION IPF is a chronic, progressive, severely debilitating and ultimately lethal lung disease predominantly affecting elderly male smokers or ex -smokers with a median age of 65 - 70 years [1]. The disease is characterized by progress ive worsening of dyspnea and lung function and is associated with a poor prognosis ( i.e. median survival of 2 -5 years following diagnosis) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] . The estimated IPF pr evalence ranges from 14.0 to 27.9 cases per 100,000 population in the US and from 1.3 to 23.4 cases per 100,000 population in Europe (data from 1990 -2011). The estimated IPF incidence ranges from 6.8 -8.8 cases per 100,000 population in the US and from 0.2-7.4 cases per 100,000 population in Europe [7, 8, 9, 10] . The incidence and prevalence of IPF increases dramatically with age ; and in patients >65 years, the estimated preval ence of IPF is as high as 400 cases per 100,000 people [11]. Over the past decade, extensive research has been conducted to address the unmet medical need for effective IPF treatment. Two treatments (pirfenidone and nintedanib), targeting the biological processes that drive fibrosis, are currently approved in the European Union, the United States, and other regions around the world. • Pirfenidone (antifibrotic, anti -inflammatory and antioxidant treatment marketed as Esbriet®; indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate IPF), was the first drug to be licensed specifically for IPF. Phase III studies had varying results but overall demonstrated that the drug improved progression -free survival and slowed the decline in FVC. Moreover, pirfenidone may have a mortality benefit [12, 13, 14, 15] . The drug was approved in the EU in 2011 and in the US in 2014. • Nintedanib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor marketed as Ofev®; indicated in adults for the treatment of IPF), was initially developed as an anticancer agent. In Phase III studies it significantly reduced the decline in FVC compared with placebo in subject s with IPF . A trend towards a reduc ed death rate was also observed; however, the studies were not powered to detect differences in mortality [16]. The drug was approved in the US in 2014 and in the EU in 2015. Both treatments appear to slow disease progression but are frequently associated with side effects (e.g. gastrointesti nal related side effects) potentially limiting the use in clinical practice [17, 18, 19] . There thus remains a significant unmet medical nee d for the investigation and development of novel IPF treatments targeting disease -relevant pathways . Several other candidate treatments with different mechanism of action are currently in Phase II and III or in earlier phases of clinical development. Consi dering the progressive and irreversible nature of this disease, it is highly desirable to evaluate efficacy of new potential treatments when added on top of the local standard of care. Over the last decade, a growing number of G protein -coupled receptors ( GPCRs) have been identified for which the ligands are energy substrates or metabolic intermediates. Free fatty acids (FFAs) have been reported to activate different GPCRs, including FFA1, FFA2, FFA3, FFA4, and GPR84. These FFA -sensing receptors are propose d to play important roles in the pathophysiology of a variety of diseases, including neuro -inflammatory diseases and metabolic disorders. GPR84 has been described as a pro -inflammatory receptor. The ligand - induced activation of GPR84 mediates both activati on and migration of neutrophils and"

The inhibitory effect can be maintained over 24 hours with q.d. dosing. Ligand binding inhibition (area under the effect -time curve [ AUEC ] and maximum effect [Emax]) was correlated with the exposure to GLPG1205 (C max and average plasma concentration [ Cavg]) in plasma. 2.2.3. Clinical Efficacy So far, only patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis were exposed to GLPG1205 for 12 weeks. The ana lyses revealed no clear evidence of efficacy. 2.2.4. Clinical Safety Administration of single (up to 800 mg) and multiple (up to 100 mg q.d. for 14 days) oral doses of GLPG1205 in healthy male subjects can be considered well tolerated. No deaths, serious adverse events ( SAEs ) or treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to study drug discontinuation were reported. The most frequently reported treatment -related TEAEs were headache and gastrointestinal disorders like nausea and all TEAEs were rated at most m oderate in intensity. None of the treatment -emergent abnormalities in laboratory, electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs parameters or physical examination abnormalities were considered clinically significant by the investigator. Multiple dosing with GLPG1205 200 mg q.d. (first -in-human study - multiple ascending dose [MAD] part) did not show an acceptable safety profile with three subjects discontinuing the study drug due to headache after dosing with GLPG1205. Two subjects in the GLPG1205 200 mg q.d. group showed abnormally high laboratory values for hematocrit, hemoglobin and in red blood cell count, which were considered clinically significant by the investigator. This resulted in 100 mg q.d. being considered as the maximum tole rated dose after multiple dosing , which may be used in future clinical studies with GLPG1205. Administration of a single GLPG1205 100 mg dose in fasted or fed state and co - administration of multiple doses of GLPG1205 100 mg with a single dose of a cocktail of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 substrates was considered well tolerated. Age or administration of a GLPG1205 loading dose (250 mg) did not affect the safety profile of GLPG1205. In a Phase II study in subject s with ulcerative colitis , 63 subjects were dose d with 100 mg GLPG1205 q.d. or placebo for up to 12 weeks. No deaths were observed. Three subjects in the GLPG1205 group presented with treatment -related SAEs: worsening of ulcerative colitis (2 subjects) and macular rash (1), which led to study discontinu ation. In addition, 5 subjects reported SAEs which were not considered treatment -related by the investigator, including worsening of colitis ulcerative (1 subject), anemia (1), worsening of colitis ulcerative and anemia (1), head injury (1) and tendon rupt ure (1). 2.3. CLINICAL S TUDY RATIONALE IPF is a chronic and progressive lethal lung disease for which two oral treatments (pirfenidone and nintedanib) are approved in the EU and US. These treatments appear to slow disease progression however, the residual decli ne of FVC over one year remains substantial, with a further decline of FVC over 52 weeks of 125 mL and 114 mL in INPULSIS I and II (nintedanib) [16], respectively, and around 200 mL in the ASCEND study (pirfenidone) [15]."
24,page_24,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 25/88 Version 3.00, Final , 20 Confidential Information In addition, both compounds are frequently associated with side effects potentially limiting the use in clinical practice. There thus remains a significant unmet medical need for the development of a dditional therapies targeting different disease pathways that could potentially prove to be more effective by further preventing the decline in FVC with an acceptable safety profile [22]. Recent published data suggest the rele vance of GPR84 in fibrotic pathways underlined by GPR84 knock out mice used in models of kidney fibrosis [20]. In addition, PBI -4050 a compound in clinical development targeting both GPR84 and GPR40, has demonstrated first clinical benefit after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with IPF with and without addition of nintedanib [21]. It thus can be anticipated that compounds targeting GPR84 could lead to a new class of therapy for IPF. GLPG1205 i s a novel, selective, and potent GPR84 antagonist that has a good safety and tolerability profile at the targeted dose of 100 mg q .d.in clinical studies . Consequently, it seems appropriate to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK of GLPG120 5 in subject s with IPF. 2.3.1. Dosing Rationale A dose of 100 mg GLPG1205 administered q.d. has been selected to be evaluated for this Phase II study. It is the highest oral dose of GLPG1205 administered in healthy male subjects that can be considered safe and well tolerated for repeated administration . GLPG1205 caused an extensive and sustained reduction in ligand binding to the GPR84 receptor in whole blood, suggesting that the compound could be able to prevent and/or decrease at least one step in neutrophil and macrophage migration and/or activation induced by activation of the GPR84 receptor. The inhibitory effect can be maintained over 24h with q.d. dosing. Ligand binding inhibition (AUEC and E max) was correlated with the exposure to GLPG1205 (C max and C avg) in plasma and at a dose of 100 mg q.d. at least 80% of binding inhibition is expected . GLPG1205 100 mg q.d. was also used in a prior proof of concept study in which GLPG1205 or placebo was administered over 12 week s in 63 subjects with ulcerative colitis . Overall, the intensities of the treatment -related AEs for the placebo and GLPG1205 treatment groups were moderate. There were no clinically meaningful trends in changes from baseline for any vital signs, ECG, or physical examination variables. There were no clinically relevant abnormalities reported on laboratory assessments. GLPG1205 given at repeated doses of 100 mg was, in general, safe and well-tolerated. In light of significant unmet medical need for the investigation and development of novel IPF treatments, GLPG1205 100 mg q.d. is considered an adequate dose for the pr oposed proof of concept study i n subjects with IPF. 2.3.2. Clinical Study Design Rationale This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel group, placebo -controlled, multicenter, exploratory Phase II study including subjects with IPF. The randomized double -blind study design was chosen as it is t he most rigorous method to generate high quality scientific data. In addition, a placebo -controlled study contains internal evidence of assay sensitivity ( i.e. when a difference is demonstrated, it is interpretable without reference to external findings),"
25,page_25,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 26/88 Version 3.00, Final , 20 Confidential Information measures absolute safety and efficacy ( i.e. it measures the total pharmacologically mediated effect of treatment), is very efficient ( i.e. can measure treatment effects with a smaller sample size compared with any other type of controlled study), and minim izes the effect of subject and investigator expectations ( International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ ICH] E10, 2000). The 2:1 randomization to GLPG 1205 100 mg avoids unnecessary exposure of subject s to placebo. The subject eligibility criteria are typical for patient studies in IPF. The disease typically affects elderly subjects, so it was chosen to include subjects aged ≥40 years. Considering the progressive and irreversible nature of this disease, it is highly desirable to evaluate efficacy of new potential treatments when added on top of the local standard of care . Standard of care is defined as receiving nintedanib, pirfenidone, or neither nintedanib nor pirfenidone. Thus , this study will include all IPF subjects , independently of their (prior) use of standard of care. Subjects eligible for this study will be randomized to either GLPG1205 or placebo . Subjects who are either on nintedanib or pirfenidone may vary dosing during the study conduct if needed (e.g. due to dose limiting side effects ) according to the discretion of the investigator. For subjects initially neither on nintedanib nor on pirfenidone , the addition of nintedanib or pirfenidone during the course of the study is allowed. Subjects a re not allowed to use non-evidenced based medication being used to treat IPF (i.e. warfarin ; imatinib ; endothelin inhibitors such as ambrisentan, bosentan, and macitenan; azathioprine ; cyclophosphamide ; cyclosporine A ; methotrexate ; sildenafil ; prednisone at steady dose > 10 mg/day or equivalent glucocorticoid dose ) within 4 weeks before screening and during screening, or planned during the study . Subjects are also not allowed to use any other experimental oral IPF therapy within 12 wee ks or 5 -half-lives of the agent , whichever is longer, prior to screening, or to have participated in an investigational drug antibody / biologic study within 6 months prior to screening . This is necessary in order to avoid any confounding effects these drugs may have on the sa fety, tolerability, PK, endpoints evaluated in the current study. According to the analysis of the course of disease in placebo treated IPF subjects in clinical studies over 12 months by Nathan et al. [23] approximately 9.5% IPF subjects may experience a ≥10% decline in % predicted FVC after 6 months compared with baseline . Nintedanib and pirfenidone have been shown to have a beneficial effect on the rate of decline in lung function. It is anticipated that a potential efficacious effect of GLPG1205 in IPF can be substantiated after this period of time and distinguished from individual courses of the disease in both populations – patients receiving nintedanib, pirfenidone, or neither ninte danib nor pirfenidone. Pirfenidone is primarily metabolized in humans via CYP1A2 with minor contributions from other CYP isoenzymes. A clinical study assessing the effect of GLPG1205 on a CYP1A2 probe substrate (caffeine) demonstrated that there was no impact of GLPG1205 on the CYP1A2 probe substrate (no inhibition nor induction). Pirfenidone is a weak P -glycoprotein (P -gp) inhibitor and is a weak CYP2C9, 2C19 or 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4 inhibitor . GLPG1205 is not an efflux substrate (P -gp, BCRP, multidrug resistance -associated protein 2 [MRP2]) and has multiple CYPs involved in its metabolism (3A4, 2C19). Consequently, the coadministration of GLPG1205 with pirfenidone should not lead to drug interactions however plasma levels of both GLPG1205 and pirfenidone wi ll be measured and tolerability will be closely monitored."
26,page_26,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 27/88 Version 3.00, Final , 20 Confidential Information Nintedanib is a P -gp substrate and the fraction absorbed is metabolized via hydrolytic cleavage by esterases then glucuronidation and to a lower extend by CYP3A4. From in vitro data, GLPG1205 is li kely to be a weak P -gp inhibitor and the likelihood that GLPG1205 may increase exposure to nintedanib can be considered low. In addition, the U S product information for Ofev (nintedanib) states that coadministration with the strong P -gp and CYP3A4 inhibito r, ketoconazole, increased exposure to nintedanib 1.61 -fold based on AUC and 1.83 -fold based on C max in a dedicated drug -drug interaction study. A contra -indication is not warranted but patients should be monitored closely for tolerability. Nintedanib demo nstrated in in vitro studies little or no inhibition of CYP enzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 4A11, and of UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 activities and is a weak inhibitor of P -gp. GLPG1205 is not an efflux substrate (P -gp, BCRP, MRP2) and has multi ple CYPs involved in its metabolism (3A4, 2C19). Consequently, co -administration of GLPG1205 with nintedanib should not lead clinically significant to drug interactions. However, plasma concentration of both GLPG1205 and nintedanib will be measured and tol erability will be closely monitored. 2.4. POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS As IPF is characterized by progressive worsening of dyspnea and lung function and is associated with a poor prognosis . A significant unmet medical need for the investigation and development of novel IPF treatments with different mechanism of action remains for this targeted patient population. Nonclinical data with GLPG1205 have demonstrated efficacy in the 21-day BLM mouse model similar to nintedanib . One other compound (PBI -4050) known to target both GPR84 and GPR40 has shown signals of beneficial efficacy in patients with IPF in an open -label study . GLPG1205 is anticipated to be the first inhibitor of only GPR84 in clinical development to be investigated for the oral treatment of IPF. As there is limited clinical experience with GLPG1205 so far, the investigational medicinal product ( IMP) should not be administered to subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment or hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh B or Child -Pugh C). Based on the bioavailability and safety results of a Phase I study in elderly healthy male subjects of 65 years and older, the IMP was well tolerated and can be administered to elderly subject s. Throughout the study , safety of the individual patient is paramount. The subjects therefore need to be closely monitored by repeated assessment of clinical and vital signs, ECG, and laboratory safety parameters. The allowed disease -related concomitant d rugs were selected to minimize the risk of drug - drug interactions. However, precautions and specific monitoring as per standard medical practice is recommended. The most frequently reported treatment -related TEAEs so far observed in patients or healthy volunteers in clinical studies with GLPG 1205 were headache and nausea and all TEAEs were rated at most moderate in intensity . Potential side effects will be closely monitored and followed -up. In case of intolerance to GLPG1205 the do se may be decreased to 50 mg q.d."

In case where the female partner of a male subject has undergone documented surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, i.e. surgical removal of ovaries, bilateral s alpingectomy or hysterectomy, i.e. surgical removal of uterus) that was performed more than 1 year before screening, then the subject is not required to use an additional form o f contraception. Vasectomized male subjects with female partners of childbearin g potential are not required to use an additional form of contraception providing that surgical sterilization has been successful (documented azoospermia by semen analysis).

In a case where additional concomitant medication needs to be administered or dose adjustments for IPF and other preexisting conditions need to be performed during the study, the risk/benefit to the subject should be carefully assessed and consideration given to the timing of any necessary introduction of new medications. As such, adaptation or initiation of treatment with nintedanib or pirfenid one (both post randomization) or other non-excluded concomitant medications are allowed throughout the study based on the medical need of the individual patient . Note: Subjects receiving either pirfenidone or nintedanib have to be on a stable dose for at least 8 weeks before screening, and during screening. A stable dose is defined as the highest tolerated dose . All decisions on the start and stop of the intake of nintedanib or pirfenidone or the need for dose adjustments during the s tudy will be made by the investigator and recommendations of the respective local SmPCs should be followed, as done in normal clinical practice. In vitro assays indicated an inhibition by GLPG1205 of the drug transporters BCRP and OCT2, at a concentration being equivalent to human exposure of 100 mg GLPG1205. Preliminary in vivo data from a clinical drug -drug interaction study assessing the effect of GLPG1205 on OCT2 and BRCP probe substrates show that there is only clinical ly relevant inhibition of BCRP by GLPG1205 (approximately 3 fold exposure increase), therefore inclusion of subjects with stable chronic illness on stable medications which are transported by known BCRP is not allowed and known BRCP substrates are prohibited during the study. A (non -exhaustive) list of BCRP substrates is provided in Appendix 5 . Inclusion of patients with stable chronic illness on stabl e medications which are transported by OCT2 transporters (less than 2 fold exposure increase observed) should be decided on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the medical history , concomitant medication of the patient and benefit/risk profile . The C RO’s medical monitor or sponsor’s medical lead can be contacted when deemed necessary by the investigator, specifically for medication with a narrow therapeutic index and/or a risk of (un)predictable AEs. This is specifically to be done for medication that is transported by OCT2 and has the risk to prolong QT interval. A (non - exhaustive) list of OCT2 substrates is provided in Appendix 6 . Statins have different pathways involved in their disposition (either via metabolic enzymes and/or via transporters) and since it cannot be ruled out that GLPG1205 could interfere with some of those pathways (leading to cumulative net effect difficult to predict from in vitro studies) and to date, no in vivo clinical drug -drug interaction studies have been conducted yet, there is a need to further monitor subjects who may be on statin background therapy. Monitoring of liver function tests and creatine kinase (CK) is im plemented during the study as per local guidance for statins in clinical practice. The use of medication known to prolong QT interval during the study needs to be based on a benefit -risk evaluation by the investigator, e.g. in the case of atrial fibrillati on. In other situations (e.g. the initiation of macrolides or fluoroquinolones in case of a lower respiratory tract infection), when a medication known to prolong or potentially prolonging QT is indicated , IMP can be interrupted after clinical assessment o f the subject’s profile, including the baseline QTcF and how this has changed over time. If the investigator elects to continue IMP , additional"
35,page_35,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 36/88 Version 3.00, Final , 20 Confidential Information monitoring will be performed as per investigator’s judgment. A non -exhaustive list of medication known to prolon g QT interval is provided in Appendix 10 . All medications that are not allowed in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria shoul d not be used during the study. It is highly recommended that the CRO medical monitor (as per study contact list) or sponsor’s study physician (if the former is not available) are consulted before the initiation of new medications, in particular medication known to prolong QT in terval, and medication known to be transported by OCT2 transporters . All concomitant therapies , as well as their changes occurring during the study are to be recorded on the relevant case report form ( CRF ) page(s), along with the reason for and details of therapy use. All prior surgeries will be recorded on the relevant CRF page(s). 4.3.4.3. Food and Beverage Restrictions The comparison of exposures to GLPG1205 achieved after oral administration of GLPG1205 as a capsule in fed or fasted state (GLPG1205 -CL-102) indic ates that food has no influence on exposure, therefore there is no food restriction in the current study. 4.3.4.4. Other Prohibitions and Restrictions No blood donation is allowed during the study. 4.3.5. Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessments A subject may be withdrawn from the clinical study at any time without the subject’s consent if the investigator or sponsor determines that it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue participation. In such case, the reason for withdrawal will be documented in the source documents, and the subject will be asked to complete the EOT visit and follow -up visit for safety assessments and pulmonary function . Study t reatment should be discontinued by the investigator (preferably after discussion with the CRO medical monitor, for any of the following conditions: − Life-threatening AE or a SAE that places the subject at immediate risk − Serious infections (those requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy an d/or hospitalization) − Arrhythmia or conduction abnormality, including but not limited to prolonged QT interval corrected for the heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF), where the severity is categorized as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 Grade 3 or higher ( i.e. QTcF ≥501 ms or an increase from baseline (Visit 2) in QTcF of >60 ms) on at least 2 separate ECGs at the same visit − Increase in liver function tests: • AST and/or ALT elevations >8x ULN: IMP treatment should be withheld and the LFTs should be repeated. IMP should be discontinued if the results are confirmed • AST and/or ALT elevations >3x ULN and <8xULN: IMP treatment should be withheld. If LFTs do not return to normal within 2 weeks then the IMP should be discontinued. If LFTs return to normal within 2 weeks then IMP could be restarted with close monitoring (e.g. repeat testing twice per week for the first 2 weeks then"
36,page_36,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 37/88 Version 3.00, Final , 20 Confidential Information weekly for the following month). In the event LFTs become abnormal at any subsequent point during the study (i.e. afte r rechallenge) then the IMP should be discontinued. • AST and/or ALT elevations >3x ULN and total bilirubin level (TBL) >2xULN or international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5: IMP treatment should be withheld and the LFTs should be repeated. IMP should be disco ntinued if the results are confirmed. • AST and/or ALT elevations >3x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%): IMP treatment should be withheld, LFT repeated and IMP discontinued if LFT confirmed or if symptoms and signs persist When test results need to be confirmed, the subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal re sults. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history and physical assessment. In addition to repeating AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma - glutamyl transferase (GGT), INR, and alkaline phosphatase. A detailed history, including relevant information (e.g. review of ethanol, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced subject, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure) should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B or C infection and liver imaging (e.g. biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repe at testing with no other cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs. Such poten tial Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs . The investigator may also decide to discontinue IMP (preferably after discussion with the CRO medical monitor, who may consult and must inform the sponsor’s study physician) for any of the following reasons: − Use of concurrent therapy that was not permitted − Noncompliance with the IMP treatment − Noncompliance with the clinical study procedures (e.g. missing more than 2 visits) − Serious or severe AEs − Worsening of disease condition, which in the investigator’s opini on needs an alternative treatment approach not being cove red in the clinical study (e.g. rescue medication) − In case of interruption of IMP for cumulatively >30 days Every effort should be made to keep subjects in the study and on treatment. However, the investigator can consider stopping the treatment with IMP, preferably after consultation with the sponsor’s study physician, in case of concerns about the subject’s safety, major protocol noncompliance, serious or severe AEs or worsening of the disease condi tion, which in the investigator’s opinion needs an alternative treatment approach not being covered in the clinical study (e.g. rescue medication). When IMP is discontinued, the subject will be requested to return for the EOT and EOS Visit s to allow safety Follow - up. Subjects will be informed prior to clinical study entry that they are allowed to withdraw from the clinical study. At any time and for any reason, a subject’s participation in the clinical"
37,page_37,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 38/88 Version 3.00, Final , 20 Confidential Information study may terminate at his/her request without prejudi ce to his/her future medical care. The subject will be encouraged to share the reason(s) for withdrawal so this can be documented in the source documents, and to complete the EOT visit and follow -up visit for safety assessments and pulmonary function , but will not be obliged to do so. Subjects who withdraw from the clinical study without contact with the site (lost to follow - up) should be contacted by the site so that their health status can be assessed and documented in the source documents. The site shoul d make every effort to understand whether the subject is alive, including checking the medical records, contacting general practitioner or relatives, if necessary. All attempts (at least 3) must be docu mented in the source documents. Subjects who drop out before the first administration of the IMP will be replaced. Subjects who stop taking IMP for any reason will not be replaced . The sponsor has the right to terminate the clinical study at any time in case of safety concerns or if special circumstances con cerning the IMP or the company itself occur, making further treatment of subjects impossible. In this event, the investigator(s) and relevant authorities will be informed of the reason for clinical study termination. 4.4. MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS 4.4.1. Randomization At screening, subjects will be assigned a subject identification number using a centralized electronic system (interactive web response system [IWRS]) . When subjects are confirmed to be eligible for the clinical study, the subject will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to GLPG1205 or placebo . Allocation of each subject to a given treatment will be done via IWRS and will be stratified for background standard of care (subjects receiving nintedanib, pirfenidone, or neither nintedanib nor pirfenidone) . 4.4.2. Blinding an d Unblinding This is a randomi zed, double -blind study. The subject, investigator, clinical study coordinator and the entire clinical study team, will remain blinded to treatment assignment. Blinded and packaged medication will be provided to the clinical center. All IMP formulations will be identical in appearance, shape, smell and taste, and packaged in the proper proportion to assure desired dosages a nd maintenance of the blinding. The blind can be broken only if the investigator deems it necessary for t he safety of a subject. The investigator is encouraged to discuss considerations to break the blind with the CRO medical monitor, whenever possible and where the situation allows. However, the responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situati ons resides solely with the investigator. The investigator is not required to discuss unblinding beforehand if he or she feels rapid emergency unblinding is necessary but is required to inform the sponsor in a timely fashion after unblinding has occurred , without disclosing the treatment allocation to the team . The blind can be broken by the investigator via I WRS."
38,page_38,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 39/88 Version 3.00, Final , 20 Confidential Information All subjects who are unblinded while on the clinical study will be withdrawn at the moment of unblinding, with the reason for unblinding given as the reason for withdrawal from the clinical study. If an AE leads to unblinding, the AE will be given as the reason for unblinding , and the AE will be followed up as described in Section 9.3.1 . All subjects who are unblinded should, where possible, complete the EOT visit and the follow -up visit , 4 weeks after EOT . If necessary code -break information ( via IW RS vendor) will be provided to the bioanalytical laboratory responsible for plasma drug determination sample analysis , and the sponsor pharmacovigilance lead for SAE reporting purposes . An unblinded review of data will be performed on a regular basis by an IDMC. See Section 8 for further details. An interim analysis may be performed in order to allow sponsor planning of following clinical studies, while maintaining the blind at an individual subject level . All efforts will be made to restrict the access to results so that personnel involved with the study conduct remains blinded to the extent possible. See Section 7.3.2 for further details. 5. INVESTIGATIONS MEDIC INAL PRODUCTS 5.1. IDENTITY OF THE I NVESTIGATIONS MEDICINAL PRODUCTS The chemical name of GLPG1205 is 9 -cyclopropylethynyl -2-((S)-1-[1,4]dioxan -2-lmethoxy) - 6,7-dihydro -pyrimido[6,1 -a]isoquinolin -4-one. GLPG1205 will be provided as an oral hard gelatin capsule containing 50 mg of G321605 (active ingredient) or a matching placebo. Both active and p lacebo capsule will be identical in appearance , shape, smell and taste . 5.2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTR ATION The following doses will be tested: − GLPG1205 100 mg q.d. (as 2 capsules of 50 mg) − Matching placebo q.d. (as 2 capsules) The IMP is to be taken q.d . at approximately the same time every morning with or without food. Subject s will be instructed to swallow the capsules of GLPG1205 or placebo as a whole with a glass of water and to not chew the drug prior to swallowing. At the baseline visit, IMP will be adm inistered on site after predose assessments have been completed. On all other visit days subjects also need to take their IMP on site. If subjects are taking pirfenidone or ninte danib then these must al so be taken on site at Visit 2, Visit 4 and Visit 8 in order to perform appropriate PK sampling (see Section 6.6). If a subject misses a dose (e.g. because he/she forgot to take the medication), he/she should take the missed dose within 5 hours after the planned intake time. If IMP is not taken within 5 hours after the planned time, the missed dose should be skipped. F or each dose taken, the time, date and number of capsules taken should be recorded in the subject’s diary card. During each visit, the investigator will record a summary of IMP intake data in the CRF."
39,page_39,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 40/88 Version 3.00, Final , 20 Confidential Information In case of an AE at least possibly related to GLPG1205 as per the investigator’s judgement requiring dose reduction, or in the case of intolerance to or toxicity of the IMP, subject s may have their dose of IMP reduced from 2 capsules q.d. (100 mg) to 1 capsule q.d. (50 mg) for the remainder of the study . Shoul d the intolerance or toxicity continue, IMP may be discontinued, and the subject may be withdrawn from the study. In the event of temporary interruption of IMP due to e.g. an AE, IMP can be re -introduced at the investigator’s discretion, depending on the reason for interruption. The investigator should inform the medical monitor immediately of interruption or events leading to interr uption in order to help with subject retention. 5.3. PACK AGING, LABELING AND DISTRIBUTION An IMP kit will consist of 3 Alu/Alu blisters, each containing 12 capsules, packaged in an outer box and labeled with a clinical study -specific label. Each IMP kit contains medication to cover 2 weeks of treatment, includin g spares. All manufacturing, packaging, and labeling operations will be performed according to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products and the relevant regulatory requirements. The distribution will only occur after the required local documentat ion is obtained including clinical study approval by Competent Authorities and the Independent Ethics Committees (IECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), documentation on which the assessment of the investigator’s qualifications was based (e.g. curriculu m vitae) and the signed and dated study agreement and financial agreement. Addendum for IMP Distribution: Direct -to-patient (DTP) shipment of IMP due to Coronavirus disease 19 ( COVID -19) pandemic In case a subject is not able to visit the site for IMP res upply, D TP shipment of IMP can be implemented. DTP IMP shipment will follow the ICH GCP principles and be in compliance with national legislation. DTP IMP shipment will occur from an investigational site to the subject by a logistics provider in a traceable and preferably temperature -controlled manner and will be documented adequately. The patient will be asked to return any un used IMP and empty IMP packages by a logistics provider or during the next on -site visit. 5.4. STORAGE Sites are to store the IMP (GLPG1205 and matching placebo) supplies in a secure area below +30°C (may not be frozen ) until dispensed. Sites will be required to monitor the storage temperature by using at least a min -max temperature -recording device and to keep a minimum to maximum temperature log that is to be completed each working day in order to establish a record of compliance with these storage conditions. The investigator will instruct subjects on how the IMP should be stored at home after it is dispensed. 5.5. TREATMENT COMPLIANCE AND DRUG ACCOUNTABI LITY The pharmacist or designated clinical study personnel will maintain a log of the total amount of IMP received at site, amount dispensed to the subject, and the amount of IMP returned by the subject to the site. Drug supplies for ea ch subject will be inventoried and accounted for"
40,page_40,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 41/88 Version 3.00, Final , 20 Confidential Information throughout the clinical study. At the end of the treatment period these records will be checked against the inventory by the study monitor. All clinical supplies will be stored in locked facilities. Subjects will be given a diary card at every visit in the treatment period starting at Visit 2 (Day 1) to record the following: − From Day 1 through Week 26, subject s will be asked to record the date , time and number of capsules taken − From Day 1 through Week 26, subjects will be asked to record changes in concomitant medication regimen, including new medicines not captured in medication history, use of bronchodilators, use of pirfenidone or nintedanib, and any other concomitant medication used as well as any emerg ing AE. Subjects will be instructed to bring their diary card and to return any unused IMP and empty IMP packages at each visit during the treatment period and/or EOT visit. A summary of the diary card data will be entered in the CRF by the designated sit e personnel. Missed doses should be discussed to try to ascertain the reason(s). Every effort should be made to ensure proper subject dosing. Subjects with a poor compliance (<80% or >120%) will be retrained by the study site. If study drug compliance rem ains <80% or >120% between study visits, the subject will be evaluated for potential discontinuation. Any discontinuation should be done in consultation with the medical monitor. Upon sponsor approval all unused IMP and empty IM P packages should be returne d to the drug supplier/drug depot or will be destroyed at the site. In case of destruction by the site or the supplier/drug depot, an acceptable destruction process should be in place and a destruction certificate should be provided to the sponsor. 6. CLINICAL STUDY ASSESSMENTS Every effort should be made to ensure that CSP -required tests and procedures are completed as described (see Section 6.10). To avoid inter -observer variability, every effort should be made to ensure that all safety and efficacy evaluations are completed by the same individual who made the initial baseline determinations. 6.1. TIMING OF ASSESSMENT S The study assessments will be un dertaken at time points as specified in the schedule of activities in Section 6.10. Screening assessments need to be performed within 28 days before Day 1 and may be split into multiple days or visits. A window of ±2 days is allowed for Visit 3 and 4, a window of ± 4 days is allowed for Visit 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10; and a window of ±6 days is allowed for Visit 9. All visits should preferably be performed in the morning. If an on-site Visit 9 cannot be performed at the scheduled timepoint due to factors related to the COVID -19 pandemic, the visit window and the study medication intake period can be either extended up to +56 days or shortened up to -28 days, t o allow flexibility in scheduling the visit.

In addition: - if the decision to discontinue the treatment was made during an on-site visit, and without any safety findings or ongoing AEs, the EOS Visit may be performed remotely. - if the decision to discontinue the treatment was not made during an on -site visit, or in case of any safety observations or ongoing AEs, an EOS Visit on site is required to monitor the safety of the subject. In addition, remote or home unscheduled visits should be conducted at least every 14 days , until the on -site EOS Visit can be performed. Addendum for Visit 9: Alternative approach due to COVID -19 pandemic • If Visit 9 cannot be conducted on site according to the original schedule of activities (Section 6.10; see also Section 6.1, “Timing of Assessments ”) due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the treatment period can be extended up to +56 days or shortened up to -28 days to enable the conduct of Visit 9 on site. • If the study treatment is prolon ged beyond the originally planned Visit 9 date, remote (e.g., telephone contact, virtual contact) or home unscheduled visits should be conducted at the originally planned visit date, and thereafter at least every 14 days , to closely monitor the patient’s safety until the on -site visit can be performed. • If no on-site visit is possible within the 56 days of treatment prolongation , then a remote or home visit should be planned and conducted within the extended Visit 9 window. However, every eff ort should be made to perform the end of study (EOS) Visit 10 on site. If this is not feasible the medical monitor or sponsor should be contacted. Addendum for Visit 10/EOS: Alternative approach due to COVID -19 pandemic • If Visit 10 cannot be conducted on site according to the original schedule of activities (Section 6.10; see also Section 6.1, “Timing of Assessments ”) due to COVID -19 pandemic, the visit window can be extended up to +28 days or shortened up to -7 days to enable the conduct of Visit 10 on site. • If the Visit 10 window is extended, a remote or home unscheduled visit 28 days after last IMP intake should be conducted and thereafter at least every 14 days , until the on - site visit can be performed . • If within the +28 days of Visit 10 window prolongation no on -site visit is possibl e, and Visit 9/EOT was performed on site without relevant findings and/or safety concerns,"

EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS All efficacy assessments will be performed at the visits specified in the schedule of activities in Section 6.10 (see also Section 6.1, “Timing of Assessments ”). 6.4.1. Pulmonary Function by Spirometry Spirometry will be performed at the study center to assess pulmonary function. Pulmonary function will be measured in a standardized manner , using standardized equipment, and results will be transmitted electronically preferably during the visit (required to do so at first spirometry at baseline [Visit 2] ) and evaluated by a central reader. The following parameters will be measured as part of the spirometry assessme nt: − FVC (mL) and % predicted FVC − FEV 1 (mL) and % predicted FEV 1 − FEV 1/FVC ratio − Forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of exhaled volume (FEF 25-75) The ‘2012 Global Lung Function Initiative Equations’ will be used to calculate the predicted values [25]. 6.4.2. Quality of L ife The SGRQ is a 50 -item paper questionnaire split into 3 domains: − symptoms (assessing the frequency and severity of respiratory symptoms), − activity (assessing the effects of breathlessness on mobility and physical activity), − impact (assessing the psychosocial impact of the disease). Scores are weighted such that every domain score and the total score range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a poorer health -related quality of life . 6.4.3. Clinical Endpoints The time to any of the following clinical endpoints (whichever is first) will be evaluated: − Death (all -cause and respiratory -related) − First h ospitalization (all-cause and respiratory -related ) Clinical endpoint adjudication will be performed by an independent expert (or his/her back -up) who will review and adjudicate these endpoints in a blinded manner (refer to Section 8.2). 6.4.4. Diffusing Cap acity for the Lungs for Carbon Monoxide DLCO will be assessed using a method in compliance with the current ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guideline on DLCO measurements [26] and corrected for hemoglobin using the following formula:"

SAFETY ASSESSMENTS This section describes methods and timing for all safety assessments and recording. Additional assessments (e.g. unscheduled clinical laboratory tests including further testing of already available samples or extra vital signs recordings) are allowed to ensure appropriate collection of safety data and to assess any perceived safety concerns. 6.5.1. Adverse Events The AE reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject signs the I CF and ends at their last follow -up visit. Detailed definitions, severity grades and reporting requirements for AEs and SAEs are found in Section 9. 6.5.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations The following clinical laboratory safety tests will be performed: − Hematology : hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin ( MCH ), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC ), hemoglobin, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, white blood cell differential co unt (absolu te and relative), red blood cell differential count / morphology (if indicated) and platelets − Coagulation : INR, thromboplastin time a nd partial thromboplastin time − Clinical chemistry : glucose, urea, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, phosphorus, AST, ALT, GGT, TBL , alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, CK including isotypes (if needed) , total serum bile acid, albumin, total proteins, triglycerides, cholesterol (total , high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein ), and brain natriuretic peptide − Urinalysis : dipstick: pH, glucose, proteins, blood, leukocytes; microscopic examination of the sediment for cellular elements, casts, crystals, microorganism, miscellaneous elements if indicated − Serology /blood : Hepatitis B surface antigen and HCV antibody (if positive confirmed by HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction assay ), and HIV 1 and 2 antibodies at screening. Positive hepatitis and HIV results should be reported by the invest igator as required by local law − FSH test for females at screening to confirm menopause if applicable − Pregnancy test for females : serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin at screening The clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at visits specified in the schedule of activities in Se ction 6.10 (see also Section 6.1, “Timing of Assessments ”). Reference ranges will be supplied by the central laboratory. At the discretion of the investigator, when following up adverse even ts, additional laboratory parameters may be tested, and additional samples taken. Clinical laboratory values outside the normal range will be flagged and clinical relevance will be assessed by the investigator. Only clinically significant laboratory test a bnormalities as judged by the principal investigator should be recorded as AEs."
51,page_51,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 52/88 Version 3.00, Final , 20 Confidential Information During screening one retest of the following lab values is allowed: AST, ALT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, creatinine and hemoglobin. The total amount of blood to be taken during the clinical study for scheduled laboratory assessments will not exceed 306 mL. This also includes sampling for PK , The details of blood and urine sample handling and shipment inst ructions will be provided in a separate laboratory manual. 6.5.3. Physical Examination Physical examinations will be conducted by a physician, trained physician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation at visits specified in the schedule of activities in Section 6.10 (see also Section 6.1, “Timing of Assessments ”). The person conducting the physical examination will document this in the subject’s medical records. Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as AEs. At screening the phy sical examination will include height and weight, and weight should be measured at Visit 9/EOT and Visit 10/EOS . 6.5.4. 12-lead Electrocardiogram At th e time points specified in the s chedule of activities Section 6.10 (see also Section 6.1, “Timing of Assessments ”), a 12 -lead ECG will be recorded and results will be sent for central reading . ECG recordings will be performed before blood /urine sampling and after subjects rested for 5 minutes in supine position. In case an indwelling catheter is used, ECGs may be recorded after blood sampling, provided that there is at least 30 minutes between catheter insertion and the ECG recording. When cathe ter insertion would fail, the 12 -lead ECG needs to be taken before the venipuncture and at least 30 minutes after the failed attempt. Triplicate ECGs will be performed at baseline (Visit 2 ) only within a time span of 6 minutes, with an approximate 3 -minute interval between ECGs. Parameters to be recorded include the following: heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, uncorrected QT interval, morphology and rhythm analysis (QTcF will be derived during the statistical analysis). ECG parameter normal ranges are presented in Appendix 4 . QTc F will be considered as normal if ≤450 ms (male) and ≤460 ms (female), while subjects experiencing a prolongation of QT cF to ≥501 ms o r an increase from baseline >60 ms should be discontinued from IMP (see Section 4.3.5 ). Immediately after recording, the ECG s will be reviewed by the investigator on clinical significant abnormalities . This immediate review during the visit needs to be documented in the subject’s source. After receipt of the central report, also all flagged ECG abnormalities need to be assessed by the investigator on clinical relevance. All c linically significant abnormal ECG values should be recorded as AEs. 6.5.5. Vital Signs Vital signs ( SBP and DBP , heart rate, oral or tympanic body temperature and respiratory rate) will be recorded in a standardiz ed manner (i.e. after the subject has rested in a supine position for 5 minutes; consistent way of measuring body temperature: all measurements per subject oral or tympanic) at visits specified in the schedule of activities in Section 6.10 (see also Section 6.1, “Timing of Assessments ”).

STATISTICAL METHODS All statistical methods shall be detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) that will be finalized before treatment unblinding and data analysis . All data collected in this clinical study will be documented using summary tables, figures, and /or subject data listings. 7.1. DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE The aim of this proof -of-concept study is to show a trend in treatment difference for t he primary endpoint (change from baseline in FVC over 26 weeks ), therefore no formal sample size calculation was performed . In the following paragraph, the variability of the estimated treatment difference for the proposed sample size of 60 subjects is illustrated. Consider 40 and 20 evaluable subjects in the GLPG1205 and placebo arm, respectively, and an aim of a 50:50 balanced study population being either on nintedanib/pirfenidone or neither. Further, assume for FVC change from baseline at Week 26 a common standard deviation of 200 mL, a true treatment difference of 50 mL in the population receiving nintedanib or pirfenidone and a true treatment difference of 80 mL in the population receiving neither nintedanib n or pirfenidone . Under these assumptions and taking into account 10% dropout, the probability to observe a treatment effect of more than 40 mL in the total study population is 67% and the probability to observe a treatment effect of more than 20 mL is 78%. Approximately 60 subject s are planned to be randomized into the study. 7.2. POPULATION FOR ANALY SES 7.2.1. All Screened Subjects All subjects who signed an ICF . 7.2.2. All Randomized Subjects All subjects who were randomized into the clinical study. 7.2.3. Full Analysis Set All ran domized subjects who have received/used at least 1 dose of IMP. 7.2.4. Per-Protocol Set All full analysis set subjects who did not have a major protocol deviation impacting the efficacy results (as defined in a protocol deviation plan). If needed, the determination of the per-protocol population will be finalized and documented prior to database lock and unblinding. 7.2.5. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set Subset of the safety set, selecting all subjects who have available and evaluable plasma concentration data (e .g. excluding all protocol deviations or AEs that may have an impact on the PK analysis)."

Serious Adverse Events An SAE is defined as an AE that, results in the following: − Death. − Life-threatening (Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at th e time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.). − In-subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. − Persistent or significant disability/incapacity. − A congenital a nomaly/birth defect. − Medically significant (medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious such as important medical events that might not be immediately life -threatening or result in d eath or hospitalization but might jeopardize the subject or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above). 9.1.3. Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information An AE is considered unlisted if t he nature or intensity is not consistent with the applicable product reference safety information. For an IMP, the expectedness of an AE will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the reference safety information part of the IB. 9.1.4. Adverse Events of Special Interest Not applicable. 9.1.5. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance based on the investigator’s judgement, are not considered AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities (e.g. clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) or other abnormal (clinical study specific) assessments (e.g. ECG, radiography, vital signs) that require medical or surgical intervention, are associated with signs and/or symptoms, lead to IMP interruption, modification, or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definit ion as described in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 , respectively. If the labor atory abnormality is part of a syndrome, the syndrome or diagnosis is to be reported (e.g. anemia instead of decreased hemoglobin). 9.2. ASSESSMENT OF ADVERS E EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS The investigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for causa lity and severity. This is the basis for the sponsor’s final review and confirmation of accuracy and completeness of event information and causality assessments."

Assessment of Causality The investigator is responsible for assessing the causal relationship to IMP(s) administration or study procedures (e.g. invasive procedures such as venipuncture) based on her/his clinical judgment. The following decision choice will be used by the investigator to describe the causality assessment between the reported event or laboratory test abnormality and the IMP. − Unrelated: Time relationship to drug intake is improbable. Related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or subject's clinical state. − Unlikely: Time relationship to drug intake is improbable (but not impossible). Concomitant disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations. − Possible: Time relationship to drug intake is reasonable. Event or laboratory test abnormality, could also be explained by disease or oth er drugs. Information on IMP withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. − Probable: Time relationship to drug intake is reasonable. Unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs. Response to withdrawal is clinically reasonable and rechallenge not required. − Certain: Time relationship to drug intake is plausible. Cannot be explained by concomitant disease or other drugs. Response to withdrawal is plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically). Event definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically (i.e. an objective and specific medical disorder or a recognized pharmacological phenomenon). Rechallenge satisfactory, if ethical and necessary. It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment (worsening of the disease by the IMP) should not be conside red as causally related in the context of AE reporting. 9.2.2. Assessment of Severity The severity of AEs should be graded using CTCAE Version 5 . If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (m oderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life -threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency with the CTCAE, these intensity grades are defined in the table below."

For AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions; this may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality. This is upon the investigator’s assessment. If there is a change in intensity (worsening or improvement) of an AE, it must be recorded. 9.2.3. Outcome Each AE must be rated by choosing among: − Recovered /Resolved − Recovered /Resolved with sequelae − Recovering /Resolving − Not recove red/Not resolved − Fatal − Unknown 9.3. INVESTIGATOR REQUIRE MENTS AND INSTRUCTIO NS FOR REPORTING ADVE RSE EVENTS / SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS /PREGNANCIES TO THE SPONSOR 9.3.1. Adverse Events The AE reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject signs the ICF and ends at the subject’s follow -up visit (the last follow up visit after the last dose of IMP). In this period, all new AEs regardless of cause or relationship, derived by spontaneous, unsolicited reports of subjects, by observation and by routine open questioning (such as “How do you feel?”) need to be recorded in the CRF. In case an AE is ongoing at the time of the last follow -up visit, the investigator needs to follow -up on the subject until AE resolution or reasonable stabilization and to document in the subject’s source documentation. No related updates or additional data on the AE should be reported in the CRF."
66,page_66,"Clinical Study Protocol GLPG1205 ­CL­220 Page 67/88 Version 3.00, Final , 30-Apr-2020 Confidential Information If a subject is documented as lost -to-follow -up, ongoi ng/unknown outcome AEs will not be followed up. If the AE meets the criteria for seriousness, the SAE form must be completed and sent to the sponsor within 24 hours (see Section 9.3.2 here after) . 9.3.2. Serious Adverse Events Subjects experiencing an SAE or an emergency situation will be examined by a physician as soon as possible. The subject will remain under observation as long as medically indicated. Appropriate laboratory tests will be performed until all parameters return to normal or are otherwise explained or stable. Any SAEs that occur after the post treatment follow -up visit but within 30 days of the last dose of IMP(s), regardless of causality, should also be reported. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after the CSP -defined follow up period, however, if the investigator learns of any SAEs that occur after clinical study participation has concluded and the event is deemed relevant to the use of IMP(s), he/she should promptly document and report the event to the sponsor at any time by using the SAE form. All SAEs, whether or not deemed drug -related, must be recorded in the CRF and on the SAE form. The investigator must report each SAE immediately, and under no circumstances should this exceed 24 hours following the knowledge of the SAE, as is indicated on Page 2 under “Emergency Contact Information”. The SAE form should at least contain identifiers of the subject and the reporter, SAE term and statement of relatedness to the IMP, and at a later stage i f not yet available within 24 hours, the form needs to be completed with a clearly written narrative describing signs, symptoms, and treatment of the event, diagnostic procedures, as well as any relevant laboratory data and any sequelae. Follow -up and outc omes should be reported and documented in the source documents for all subjects that experience an SAE. It is important that the information provided on the SAE form matches the information recorded on the CRF for the same event. In case an AE is ongoing a t the time of the last follow -up visit, only the SAE form is to be updated, not the CRF. Copies of additional laboratory tests, consultation reports, post mortem reports, hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents should be sent when reque sted and available. Only subject identifiers should appear on the copies, and all names and initials should be blackened and rendered illegible. Follow -up reports relative to the subject’s subsequent course must be submitted until the event has subsided or , in case of permanent impairment, until the condition stabilizes. 9.3.3. Pregnancy All initial reports of pregnancies in partners of male subjects included in the clinical study must be recorded and documented in the source documents (after specific informed con sent is provided, see Section 10.4.2 ). The investigator must report each pregnancy immediately after getting knowledge about this on the pregnancy f orm, and under no circumstances should this"

All pregnancies should be followed up until delivery or pregnancy interruption. The investigator will contact the subject /partner of the subject at the expected time of delivery for follow -up and for information regarding the outcome of the newborn. Abnormal pregnancy and/or newborn outcomes are considered SAEs and must be reported using the SAE form. 9.4. SPONSOR REPORTING RE QUIREMENTS Depending on relevant local legislation or regulations, including the applicable U S Federal Drug Administration Code of Federal Regulations, the EU Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) and relevant updates, and other country -specific legislation or regulations, the sponsor may be required to expedite to worldwide regulatory agencies reports of SAEs, serious adverse drug reactions, or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). The sponsor or a specif ied designee will notify worldwide regulatory agencies and the relevant IEC/IRB in concerned Member States of applicable SUSARs as outlined in current regulations. Assessment of expectedness for SAEs will be determined using reference safety information section in the IB or relevant local label as applicable. All concerned investigators will receive a safety letter notifying them of relevant SUSAR reports associated with any IMP(s). The investigator should notify the IEC/IRB of SUSAR reports as soon as is practical, where this is required by local regulatory agencies, and in accordance with the local institutional policy. 10. SPONSOR’S AND INVEST IGATOR’S RESPONSIBIL ITIES This clinical study is conducted in accordance with the current applicable regulations, ICH - Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) Guideline E6, EU Directive 2001/20/EC and its updates, and local ethical and legal requirements.

The investigator should take measures to prevent acci dental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in a n ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP. These documents should be retained for a longer period however if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any clinical study documents before having obtained a written approval of the sponsor. If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any documentation relating to this clinical study, the investigator must permit access to such reports. The subject is granting access to his/her source data by signing the informed consent. Any difficulty in storing original documents must be discu ssed with the monitor prior to the initiation of the clinical study. 10.2.4. Participation Cards If the subjects are not under 24 -hour supervision of the investigator or his/her staff (out - subjects), they must be provided with a subject participation card indicat ing the name of the IMP, the clinical study number, the investigator's name and a 24 -hour emergency contact number. The subject should be advised to keep the participation card in his/her wallet at all times. 10.3. CONFIDENTIALITY The subject will receive all in formation as required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation, namely the identity and contact details of the controller, the contact details of the data protection officer, the clinical research purposes, the legal basis for the processing, the recip ients of the personal data, the transfer of the personal data to third countries and respective safeguards, the retention periods, the fair processing of his data, and all his/her data subject’s rights. All details are listed in the ICF. All information co ncerning the product and the sponsor’s operations (such as patent applications, formulae, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data or formulation information supplied to the investigator by the sponsor and not previously published) is considered conf idential by the sponsor and should not be disclosed by the investigator to any third party without the sponsor’s prior written approval. The investigator agrees to use this information only in accomplishing the clinical study and will not use it for other purposes. In order to permit easy identification of the individual subject during and after the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for keeping an updated Subject Identification Code List. The monitor will review this document for completeness. However, the investigator must guarantee the subject’s anonymity will be maintained. Therefore, in order to ensure subject confidentiality, the Subject Identification Code List will remain at the center and no copy will be made."

During the course of clinical study at least the fo llowing documents will be provided to the IEC/IRB per local requirements: − Changes to the IB − Reports of AEs that are serious, unlisted and associated with the investigational drug (in compliance with IEC/IRB, per local requirements) − CSP amendments − Informed consent revision(s) CSP amendments and applicable ICF revisions must promptly be submitted to the IEC/IRB for review and approval prior to implementation of the change(s), except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the clinical study subject s, or according to local requirements. The IEC/IRB is responsible for continuous review of the clinical study. Where required by IEC/IRB per local requirements, at least once a year the investigator will provide the IEC/IRB with a progress report to allow review of the clinical study. Additional progress reports should be provided according to local legal requirements. These requests and (re) approvals, if applicable, should be documented in writing. 10.4.2. Informed Consent The investigator or designated personnel must explain the clinical study and the implications of participation (e.g. objectives, methods, anticipated benefits, and possible risks) to potential subjects according to applicable regulations prior to any clinical study related activity. Subjects wil l be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the clinical study at any time. They will be informed that choosing not to participate or to withdraw from the clinical study will not have an impact on the care the subjec t will receive for the treatment of his/her disease. In case the subject is unable to read and write, an impartial witness must confirm the informed consent. The subject will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and to ask additional questions. After this explanation and before entry in the clinical study, consent should be appropriately recorded by means of the subject's personally dated signature (or, if applicable, by the signature of an independent witness who certifies the subject's consent in wri ting) and by the investigator’s signature. After having obtained the consent, a copy of the signed and dated informed consent must be given to the subject. If new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to participat e in the clinical study, the subject will be informed in a timely manner by means of an updated ICF. This amended ICF will be signed and dated by the subject (or, if applicable,"

The diagnostic criteria for IPF, published as the Fleishner Society White Paper [28], will be used to determine eligibility of the subject for the study . In case a historical lung biopsy is available, this will be used as complementary information and will allow confirmation of UIP -IPF in certain cases. An algor ithm to be used by the radiologists and the histopathologist to determine eligibility is available in the relevant manual."
