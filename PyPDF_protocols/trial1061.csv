The schedule of events is presented in Table 1 for the Pre -Screening and Screening periods and in Table 2 for the Treatment through the Long-term Follow-up periods. Study flow diagrams for subjects who received either a course of 4 cycles, 6 cycles , or 8 cycles of first -line systemic anti -cancer therapy are presented in Appendix 5, Figure 4, Figure 5 or Figure 6, respectively . A study flow diagram for subjects who have had local regional therapy after first-line systemic anti -cancer therapy is presented in Appendix 5, Figure 7. Pre-screening period : The Pre -screening period of up to 151 days (Day -180 to Day -29) commences at the time the subject and/or their legally authorized representative sign the Pre-screening informed consent form (ICF)/assent form . The Pre -screening per iod ends at the time the subject and/or their legally autho rized representative sign the Main Study ICF /assent form. Before any Pre-screening procedures are performed, subjects aged ≥18 years or legally authorized representatives of subjects <18 years will provide written consent on the Pre -screening ICF, and subjects aged 12 to <18 years will provide written assent . At the time of Pre -screening, s ubjects must still be receiving treatment with first-line systemic anti -cancer therapy . The following will be evaluated during the Pre- screening visit: • Radiographic d isease response assessment obtained at the standard-of- care time point by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 • Immunohistochemistry (IHC) test for the presence of NY -ESO -1 in an a rchival tumor tissue or fresh tumor tissue biopsy (tumor tissue may be from a n archived sample obtained within 18 months before signing the Pre- screening ICF/assent form ) Once the investigator confirms 1) the subject has no evidence of progression ( using RECIST v1.1) and 2) the IHC test results for NY -ESO -1 are positive (≥1% expression), the n the subject and/or their legally authorized representative will sign the Main Study ICF/assent form. Screening period : The duration of the Screening period of up to 28 days (Day -28 to Day -1) a nd begins on the date the subject and/or their legally authorized representative sign the Main Study ICF /assent form and ends at time of randomization. After satisfying the Pre -screening criteria, subjects aged ≥18 years and legally authorized representatives of subjects <18 years will provide written consent on the Main Study ICF, and subjects aged 12 to <18 years will provide written assent for study participation. Once the appropriate Main Study ICF/assent form is signed , subjects will undergo additional eligibility assessments and the investigator will confirm the re is no evidence of progression (using RECIST v1.1). The disease status will be assessed by the investigator (using RECIST v1.1) through comparison of the most recent baseline images obtained during Screening to both 1) the images obtained prior to initiation of first- line systemic anti -cancer therapy and 2) the images obtained per standard-of- care during first -line systemic anti-cancer therapy to confirm there is no evidence of progression prior to randomizat ion. Investigator assessment of radiographic images confirming best response (stable disease [ SD] or better) to first- line systemic anti -cancer therapy using RECIST v1.1 will be entered into an electronic c ase report form (eCRF) . Subject s who have a tumor response of SD with evidence of ≥15% to 20% increase in tumor burden will be submitted for Central Review to adjudicate the investigator’s assessment of tumor response prior to randomization. Radiographic images from both Screening and Pre- Screening will also be submitted to an independent review committee (IRC) for storage. The stored images will be available for evaluation by a central reader, if requested by the sponsor. After completion of Screening assessments and confirmation that the subject has met all eligibility requirements, the subject will be random ly assigned to one of the treatment arms using a central randomization system on Day 1. 05FM43"

Clinical Trial Protocol: IMDZ -04-1702 19 September 2018 v2.1 DK Confidential Page 5 of 94 Treatment period : The Treatment period will begin on the day of randomization ( Day 1), which is to be within 28 days after the last dose of first -line systemic anti -cancer therapy or the last day of local regional therapy, if applicable, and will continue until investigator- determined progressive disease (PD) (using RECIST v1.1), unacceptable toxicity, or 1 year after the first dose, whichever occurs first. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be random ly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following centrally randomized treatments: o Arm A: Placebo o Arm B: CMB305 An interactive response technology (IRT) system will use the following stratification factors at the time of randomization: o Disease status at screening : locally advanced unresectable (LAUR) vs metastatic o Tumor response during screening : stable disease (SD) /partial response (PR) vs complete response (CR) /no evidence of disease (NED) o Baseline presence of anti -NY-ESO -1 antibody (yes vs no) Subjects who are randomly allocated to the placebo arm will not be permitted to cross- over to the CMB305 -containing treatment arm at any time before study closure. Tumor imaging assessments will be performed every 8 weeks after Day 1 and radiographic evidence of disease progression will be determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of study treatment but without objective evidence of disease progression (symptomatic deterioration) will be considered as having PD for the purpose of determining PFS. Radiographic im ages (e.g., computed tomography [CT] scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] ) will also be submitted to an independent review committee (IRC) for storage and will be available for evaluation by a central read er, if requested by the sponsor. Details for the collection and evaluation of radiographic images are included in the Radiology Manual provided to the study sites. Tumor biopsy samples for NY- ESO -1 expression will be obtained from all subjects during the Pre- screening period (either archival tumor tis sue or a fresh biopsy sample). All subjects will provide peripheral blood samples for anti-NY-ESO -1 antibody assay for stratification during s creening. Quality of life will be assessed up to 12 months from Day 1 . Safety will be monitored by evaluating the frequency and severity of adverse events ( AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), clinical laboratory abnormalities, immunogenicity , and persistence . Local laboratory test values will be used for treatment decisions and subject care; central laboratory test values will be used in the analysis of safety. In addition, at only select US sites, the following will be collected: Peripheral blood sample s for the anti -NY-ESO -1 T cell and antibody assay s will be obtained prior to start of study treatment from subjects on Day 1, Day 92, and Day 365 for subject s who have not had a progression event . A tumor biopsy will be obtained at screening , Day 92, and Day 365 for subject s who have not had a progression event. An additional tumor biopsy at time of progression event will be encouraged. Post-treatment period (for subjects who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression): The Post -treatment period will begin at the end of treatment and will continue until investigator -determined radiographic PD (using RECIST v1.1) is documented. Subjects will continue to undergo imaging until the time of disease progression . At the time of disease progression, subjects will enter the Long- term Follow-up period. 05FM43"

All analyses of this set will be based on the randomized treatment arm to which the subjects are assigned . Efficacy analyses performed on the ITT set will be considered to be the primary indicator of efficacy. • The EE set consists of all subjects without major protocol violations, who have received at least 1 dose of study drug, and have the baseline and at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment available. The EE set will be analyzed according to the treatment received. Efficacy analyses performed in the EE set will be considered to be supportive. • The Safety set consists of all subjects taking any amount of study drug. The Safety set is the primary set for safety analyses including AEs and clinical laboratory data. Study t reatment exposure also will be summarized using the Safety set. Analyses performed in the Safety set will be considered to be supportive. Primary Efficacy Analyses: The 2 primary efficacy endpoints of PFS and OS will be compared between CMB305 and placebo. OS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. PFS by investigator’s assessment is defined as the time from randomization to the investigator -determined (using RECIST v1.1) date of disease progression or death. Radiographic images will be collected and assessed using RECIST v1.1 until the time the subject begins a new line of treatment. For the purpose of the PFS analysis, any one of the following events, whichever occurs first, will be used: • Disease progression p er RECIST v1.1 (See Ap pendix 1, Table 7 [ Eisenhauer 2009]) • Symptomatic deterioration (global health deterioration) as described by RECIST v1.1 • For subjects with NED at the time of randomization, any new malignant lesion that occurs after randomization per RECIST v1.1 (See Appendix 1, Table 8.) Otherwise, subjects who do not have disease progression or have not died will be censored at the date when the last tumo r imaging assessment determines a lack of progression. If a subject b egins a new anti-cancer therapy or has radiotherapy , surgery , or other local regional therapy at a lesion site prior to documented progression, the subject will be censored at the last assessment where the subject was documented as progression free prior t o the intervention. Subjects with 2 or more missing response assessments (except for subjects with symptomatic deterioration) prior to a visit with documented progression (or death) will be censored at the last visit where the subject was documented to be progression free. Progression- free survival by investigator’s assessment, will be the primary PFS analysis. P rogression -free survival by independent radiological review will be the supportive analysis. The null hypothesis, which is that there is no difference in OS/PFS between CMB305 and placebo, will be tested using a stratified log- rank test stratified by : disease status at screening (locally advanced unresectable versus metastatic), tumor response during screening (PR/SD versus CR/ NED) and baseline presence of anti -NY-ESO -1 antibody (yes versus no). The null hypothesis will be rejected, and it will be concluded that OS/PFS on CMB305 is superior to that on placebo in subjects with synovial sarcoma if the 1-sided p value at the final analysis for the stratified log -rank test is less than the pre- specified alpha of 0.0125 as discussed above in the Multiple Comparisons section. The associated HR and its 2 -sided 97.5% and 95% confidence interval (CI) will be provided using the stratified Cox proportional hazard model. The Kaplan- Meier curve will summarize OS/PFS graphically by treatment arm. Tabular summaries of the Kaplan -Meier curves, including the median, will be provided by treatment.

The final PFS analysis will be conducted when a total of 141 PFS events occur. The final OS analysis will be conducted when a total of 179 deaths occur. Secondary Efficacy Analyses: The secondary efficacy endpoints of TTNT, DMFS, ORR, and QoL using the EQ -5D-5L or EQ -5D-Y will be compared between treatment arms. The secondary efficacy endpoints will only be evaluated if at least 1 of the 2 primary efficacy endpoints demonstrate superiority for CMB305 over placebo. Furthermore, to control the overall family -wise Type I error rate at 1 -sided α = 0.025 for the secondary efficacy endpoints, the secondary efficacy endpoint of TTNT will be tested first at 1 -sided alpha of 0.025. DMFS will be tested at 1 -sided alpha of 0.025 only if TTNT shows signif icant improvement. Exploratory Analyses: The baseline anti -NY-ESO -1 immune response and histologic and molecular changes in peripheral blood and tumor tissue and their association with clinical outcomes will be explored. In addition, a relationship between an induced anti -NY-ESO -1 immune response as well as tumor tissue changes during study treatment and clinical outcomes will be evaluated using peripheral blood and tumor tissue biopsies collected during study treatment at select sites. Safety Analyses: Safety will be assessed primarily based on reported AEs. A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE with an onset on or after the initiation of study treatment, or a pre -existing condition that worsens after initiation of study treatment (i.e., incr ease in severity). Medical events of interest , immune- mediated events and AE s that occur more than 30 days after the last dose, and that are deemed as related to the study drug will be included as TEAEs. TEAEs occurring from the time of the first dose through 30 days after the last dose of the study drug and medical events of interest, immune -mediated events and related AEs will be summarized. All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs® (MedDRA v20.0 or newer ). TE AEs will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, treatment, and will be further categorized by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCA E [v4.03 or newer ]) grade, and by relationship to the study drug. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be reported as AEs. The incidence of each AE will be provided as the total number of subjects that experience the AE, as well as the percentage of the population that this represents. If an AE is reported more than once during treatment for a given subject, the worst grade of severity and the most conservative relationship will be presented in the summary tables. AEs will also be listed for individual subjects, along with information regarding onset, duration, grade, relationship to the study drug, and outcome. AEs that lead to withdrawal from study treatment will be listed and summarized. Tabulations and listings of SAEs and deaths will also be generated. It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess the clinical significance of all abnormal values obtained from the local laboratory as defined by the list of reference ranges from the investigational site local laboratory. In some cases, significant changes in local laboratory values within the normal range will require similar judgment. An abnormal laboratory value performed by the local laboratory that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as an AE only if any one of the following criteria is met: • An action on the study drug is made as a result of the abnormality • Intervention for management of the abnormality is required • At the discretion of the investigator should the abnormality be deemed clinically signi ficant 05FM43"

The DMC will review safety data periodically during the study and will evaluate the results of final PFS analysis and a planned interim OS analysis to assess futility with the possibility of a recommendation for stopping the study early because of futility . The OS non -binding f utility boundary is set to be HR=1.0. It will be conducted at 67% of information time (120th death event from the 179 required death events for final OS analysis). If deemed necessary by the DMC, unblinded data may be reviewed on a case-by- case basis.

(IMDZ) is developing a first- in-class in vivo dendritic cell (DC) - targeting active immunotherapy, designated as CMB305 and shown in Figure 1, which combines 2 different safe and active immunotherapy products administered sequentially in a “prime-boost” vaccination regimen to maximize the immune response against NY -ESO -1. One product is LV305, a lentiviral vector (LV) derived from the ZVex platform that encodes the NY -ESO -1 cancer testes antigen and is designed to “prime” the immune system by targeting RNA antigen delivery to DCs in vivo. The other product is G305, an immune system “boost” component, which is a recombinant NY- ESO -1 protein admixed with the adjuvant g lucopyranosyl lipid A stable emulsion (GLA -SE), an agonist of toll- like receptor 4 (TLR4) that is highly expressed on DCs. The tumor antigen targeted by the CMB305 regimen is the cancer testes antigen, NY-ESO -1, which is virtually absent in healthy tissues, but is expressed in many tumor types and often associated with a worse prognosis ( Gnjatic 2006; Nicholaou 2006; Jungbluth 2001a ; Komarov 2017). Figure 1 CMB305 Prime/Boost Regimen Each LV305 dose = 4×1010 vg; each G305 dose = 5 μg dose of GLA plus 250 μg of NY -ESO -1 protein. Development of CMB305 addresses multiple shortcomings of prior cancer vaccines including vaccines targeting DCs ex vivo ( Sabado 2017; Anguille 2014). The CMB305 mechanism of action is based on the selective in vivo targeting of DCs (LV305) to generate killer T cells and the generation of CD4 T cell “help” by the “boost” component, G305, to induce a broad and 05FM43"

CMB305 -induced anti -NY-ESO -1 immune responses become detectable mainly during the third month of administration. Compared with other vectors previously used for immunization, such as adenovirus or vaccinia, LV305 selectively transduces the NY-ESO -1 RNA antigen to DCs, is replication -incompetent, which minimizes inflammation, and selectively activates the transduced DC to enhance its antigen presentation capabilities ( Butler 2011). These attributes of LV305 contribute to its favorable safety profile and its association with potentially superior and long- term memory anti-NY-ESO -1 immune responses. 1.1.2 Overview of Data Generated from Initial Clinical Development of CMB305 Individual components of the CMB305 regimen, LV305 and G305, were first evaluated in separate phase 1 studies, followed by a phase 1 study of the CMB305 regimen: • ID-LV305-2013-001 is a phase 1, open- label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of intradermally (ID) administered LV305 in subject s with locally -advanced, relapsed, or metastatic cancer expressing NY -ESO -1 • G305/ IDC-G305-2013-001 is a p hase 1 , open- label , multiple ascending dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the intramuscular (IM) NY-ESO -1 protein with GLA-SE adjuvant in subject s with unresectable or metastatic cancer expressing NY -ESO -1 • IMDZ -C131 is a phase 1, open- label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ID or subcutaneously (SC) administered CMB305 in subject s with locally -advanced , relapsed, or metasta tic cancer expressing NY -ESO -1 Based on the mechanism of action , rapid tumor shrinkage is not expected from CMB305 therapy, and clinical benefit should be assessed beyond disease progression as determined by conventional RECIST. Thus, CMB305 clinical development is focused on understanding long-term benefit including overall survival (OS) in the early clinical studies . While subject s with different NY-ESO -1+ solid tumors including several types of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) have been enrolled in the LV305-2013-001 and IMDZ-C131 clinical studies, subject s with synovial sarcoma emerged as the primary focus of clinical development due to the uniformly high expression level of NY- ESO -1 in these tumors. Thirty- four NY -ESO -1+ subjects with synovial sarcoma were treated on studies LV305-2013-001 and IMDZ-C131. The vast majorit y of subjects with synovial sarcoma in both studies received prior systemic chemotherapy, had metastatic disease, and a high level of NY- ESO -1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) ( Somaiah 2017a ; Somaiah 2017b), which is associated with a worse prognosis ( Nicholaou 2006; Jungbluth 2001a ; Van Tine 2016; Komarov 2017). 05FM43"
25,page_25,"CMB305 Immune Design Corp. Clinical Trial Protocol: IMDZ -04-1702 19 September 2018 v2.1 DK Confidential Page 25 of 94 Induction of anti- NY-ESO -1 immune response is an important pharmacodynamic marker of activity for LV305 and CMB305, and possibly a predictive marker of a better clinical outcome. LV305 and CMB305 resulted in anti- NY-ESO -1 immune responses and extended tumor growth stabilization in subjects with NY-ESO -1+ sarcoma. However, CMB305 induced stronger and broader immune responses than LV305 alone such as : stronger T cell responses in each ELIS POT , in more samples per subject and in more subject s; induction of anti- NY-ESO -1 antibodies (not observed with LV305); and antigen spreading in more than 35% of subject s versu s less than 20% of subjects who were treated with LV305. Other NY -ESO -1 vaccine trials reported an association of (1) induction of anti -NY-ESO -1 immune responses with improved survival in subjects with ovarian cancer and melanoma ( Szender 2017; Odunsi 2012), and (2) integrated anti- NY-ESO -1 immune responses with survival in subjects with melanoma (Yuan 2011). Safety has been established for two dose levels of LV305 (1×1010 vector genomes (vg) /mL and 4×1010 vg/mL) in combination with G305 ( 5 µg GLA -SE plus 250 µg NY -ESO -1 protein) in the previous IMDZ -C131 study. In the IMDZ -C131 study, the dose of the LV305 component of CMB305 was increased from 1×1010 vg to 4×1010 vg (1×1010 vg single injection in each upper extremity and each lower extr emity, total 4 injections administered subcutaneously) . The G305 dose is unchanged (5 µg GLA -SE plus 250 µg NY -ESO -1 protein) . This increase in LV305 dose is being implemented to maximize potential clinical benefit of CMB305 without compromising safety. The dose at 4x1010 vector genomes has been evaluated in Arm E of IMDZ -C131. Nine subjects with soft tissue sarcoma were evaluated at this higher dose of LV305. No Serious Adverse Events, Medical Events of Interest, or Dose- Limiting Toxicities were reporte d. The data were reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and this Committee regarded LV305 to be well tolerated and to continue the study at the (4×10 10 vg/mL) and G305 ( 5 µg GLA -SE plus 250 µg NY -ESO -1 protein) . Data for each component, LV305 and CMB305, are discussed because the LV305 component is essential for priming the anti- NY-ESO -1 immune response in subject s receiving the CMB305 regimen . Long -term follow-up approaching 24 and 12 months for studies LV305-2013-001 and IMDZ -C131, respectively, indicate that LV305 and CMB305 therapy may lead to a substantial improvement in OS in subjects with NY-ESO -1+ synovial sarcoma who received multiple prior therapies compared with the published survival data. F or subjects with synovial sarcoma enrolled in the LV305-2013-001 study, median OS has not yet been reached ; and for the IMDZ -C131 study, m edian OS is 19.3 months. The 12-month OS rate is 84% and 73%, and the 18-month OS rate is 76% and 55% on LV305-2013-001 study and IMDZ-C131 study, respectively (Somaiah 2017a ). Overall, OS for subjects with NY-ESO -1+ STS, including those with synovial sarcoma on LV305 and CMB305 therapy, compares favorably with currently approved agents for recurrent STS where OS ranges from 12.4 to 13.5 months, and, more specifically, for metastatic synovial sarcoma where median OS after 1 or 2 lines of prior chemotherapy is reported at 11.7 and 7.8 months , respectively (Savina 2017 ).

Clinical Trial Protocol: IMDZ -04-1702 19 September 2018 v2.1 DK Confidential Page 26 of 94 CMB305 therapy avoids serious toxicity with a significantly improved safety profile when compared with available systemic therapy for subjects with synovial sarcoma. Biomarker data analyses from studies LV305-2013-001 and IMDZ-C131 showed that subject s who developed an anti- NY-ESO -1 immune response measured by either T cells or antibodies had a trend to a better OS when compared with subject s without an induction of immune response. This effect on OS was evident in subject s who had an increase in anti -NY-ESO -1 immunity from baseline and in those who developed a de novo immune response while on therapy. Thus, the induction of anti- NY-ESO -1 immune response by CMB305 therapy appears to convey a survival advantage compared with subjects without an induction of immune response . 1.1.3 Synovial Sarcoma: An Ultra- Rare Disease with a Serious Unmet Medical Need Synovial sarcoma, a distinct STS subtype, which affects younger subject s, is an ultra- rare disease (United States [ US] incidence of between 900 −1000 subject s) wi th a high unmet medical need (Lange 2014; Thway 2014). Currently, there is no therapy approved specifically for subject s with synovial sarcoma. Instead, therapies approved for the heterogeneous group of STS are often used and are associated with clinical outcomes that vary by sarcoma subtype. Synovial sarcoma is a distinct subtype of STS with a pathognomonic translocation t(X;18) resulting in SS18- SSX1, SS18 -SSX2, and rarely SS18- SSX4 fusion transcripts with distinct clinical features and outcomes ( Ladanyi 2002; Lange 2014 ). B cell lymphoma 6 corepressor rearrangement ( BCOR ) upregulation is emerging as a common downstream pathway for synovial sarcoma with either typical SS18-SSX transcript or with rare fusion variants, such as SS18L1- SSX ( Kao 2017). Approximately one-third of synovial sarcomas occur in childhood, and the peak incidence is in the third decade of life, with nearly 50% of synovial sarcomas occurring in subject s younger than 30 years of age ( Ferrari 2004; Lange 2014). Metastatic disease occurs in approximately 50% of subject s at the time of diagnosis with 80% of subject s having pulmonary lesions ( Spurrell 2005 ). Greater than 80% of synovial tumors express NY-ESO -1, which is associated with a worse prognosis ( Nicholaou 2006; Jungbluth 2001a ; Van Tine 2016; Gnjatic 2006; Komarov 2017). Though subject s with synovial sarcoma are often younger, have better performance status, and relative chemosensitive disease, survival outcomes remain limited in subjects with non- curative, locally -advanced unresectable disease, and metastatic disease. There is a paucity of published literature on expected outcomes for subject s with synovial sarcoma, and no prospective randomized trial has demonstrated benefit in this population. For subject s with non-curative locally -advanced disease or metastatic disease, chemotherapy is a palliative treatment in the vast majority of cases. In this setting, toxicity should not outweigh the potential benefits resulting from chemothera py (Sleijefer 2005 ). National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guidelines version 2.2017 and European Society f or Medical Oncology (ESMO ) Clinical Recommendations 2008 for STS recommend palliative chemotherapy as the primary treatment for unresectable disease or disseminated metastases . NCCN guidelines include 05FM43"

Clinical Trial Protocol: IMDZ -04-1702 19 September 2018 v2.1 DK Confidential Page 27 of 94 single agents (e.g., dacarbazine, doxorubicin, epirubicin, or ifosfamide) or anthracycline- based combination regimens (doxorubicin or epirubicin with ifosfamide and/or dacarbazine) for subject s with unresectable locally -advanced or metastatic disease. NCCN guidelines for subject s with tumors that become resectable upon completion of first -line chemotherapy (amenable to local regional therapy) are intentionally non- specific ( NCCN ). The survival of subject s with STS and metastatic disease is comparable to those who develop delayed metastatic disease. There is no improved survival observed for subject s with metastectomy ( Kane 2002). A phase 3 study of doxorubicin alone versus the combination of intensified doxorubicin plus ifosfamide in advanced or metastatic STS showed no difference in the primary endpoint of OS , 14.3 months versus 12.8 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.83 with a 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67–1.03) but a significantly higher secondary endpoint of median progression- free survival ( PFS) with the combination regimen , 7.4 months versus 4.6 months (HR = 0.74 with a 95% CI = 0.60–0.90). The overall response was 26% (2% complete response [CR] , 25% partial response [PR] ) for the combination therapy and 14% (1% CR, 13% PR ) for single -agent doxorubicin. Fifty percent of subjects completed 6 cycles on the doxorubicin-alone arm versus 51% of subject s on the combina tion arm ( Judson 2014). A recent phase 2 study of doxorubicin plus olaratumab versus single-agent doxorubicin demonstrated a median PFS of 6.6 months and median OS of 26.5 months for subjects with STS. The median number of infusions was 7 in the doxorubicin plus olaratumab arm versus 4 infusions in the doxorubicin single- agent arm (Tap 2016). The NCCN guidelines recommend combination therapy with doxorubicin and olaratumab for use in STS histologies for which an anthracycline-cont aining regimen is appropriate. The combination of olaratumab and doxorubicin now replaces doxorubicin alone as a first-line treatment option ( Helwick 2017). Ifosfamide is an active regimen with acceptable toxicity ( van Oosterom 2002) and has demonstrated significant activity in treating advanced sarcomas with a response rate (RR) of approximately 30% when used as a single agent ( Rosen 1994). Standard- dose ifosfamide is active in the first- line treatment of subject s with advanced STS (overall response rates [ORRs] of 10%–25%) (Riedel 2012). In a single -center retrospective analysis, t he median number of cycles of high-dose ifosfamide was 4 ( Rahal 2012) , and in a phase 3 trial of ifosfamide administered in 2 schedules, 20% of subjects receiving a dose of 3 g/m 2 and 30.8% receiving a dose of 9 g/m2 completed 6 cycles ( Lorigan 2007 ). Ifosfamide is the only drug that consistently shows RRs similar to doxorubicin without the cardiotoxicity. Synovial sarcoma in particular is thought to be highly sensitive to ifosfamide ( Tascilar 2007 ). A limited number of retrospective reviews have evaluated first- line practice patterns in synovial sarcoma. In a post- hoc analysis of a prospectively gathered database of subject s with synovial sarcoma, the frequency of different first -line chemotherapy regimens showed that 33% received combination ifosfamide/doxorubicin (RR 58.6%), 27% received single -agent ifosfamide (RR 25%), and 18% received single -agent doxorubicin (RR 25%) ( Spurrell 2005). In a review of 15 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer prospective first -line synovial sarcoma trials , 35.8% of subject s received combination i fosfamide/ doxorubicin (ORR 32.2%) 05FM43"
28,page_28,"CMB305 Immune Design Corp. Clinical Trial Protocol: IMDZ -04-1702 19 September 2018 v2.1 DK Confidential Page 28 of 94 and 13.4% of subject s received single -agent ifosfamide ( ORR 33.3%). Even though not statistically significant, ifosfamide seemed to be the most active drug when compared with anthracycline alone ( Vlenterie 2016) . In a single -institution retrospective review of subject s with synovial sarcoma treated with high -dose ifosfamide, the ORR was 44% and median PFS was 11.6 months ( Rahal 2012). A recent observational study on patterns of care and outcomes in synovial sarcoma found that of 188 subject s treated, 37% did not receive an anthracycline in the first line and 61% did not receive polychemotherapy. The authors concluded that a combination of doxorubicin with a second drug, such as ifosfamide, should be used only after careful discussion with the subject on the benefit/risk ratio of this approach, particularly when tumor shrinkage is expected to improve the symptoms or clinical benefits ( Savina 2017). This study also reported 49% of subject s received some form of local regional therapy of metastatic disease. One of the factors associated with a higher probability of 5-year survival w as locoregional treatment of metastases (OR = 7.41; 95% CI, 4.42–12.41). However, no guidelines exist on how to best integrate local regional therapy ( Savina 2017). Preliminary IMDZ clinical data demonstrate that CMB305 may provide an advantage over or complement available approved therapies for subjects with synovial sarcoma. CMB305 therapy leads to extended tumor growth arrest in NY- ESO -1+ subject s who have evidence of progression prior to start of treatment. Long -term follow -up of phase 1 subjects indicat e that CMB305 therapy may lead to a substantial improvement in OS in subject s with NY-ESO -1+ synovial sarcoma who received multiple prior therapies when compared with the published survival data (Savina 2017). Importantly, CMB305 therapy avoids serious toxicity with a significantly improved safety profile when com pared with available systemic therapy for treatment of subject s with synovial sarcoma. 2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to : • Evaluate the efficacy of CMB305 versus placebo using: o PFS, by investigator assessment, using RECIST v1.1 o OS 2.2 Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of this study are to : • Evaluate the efficacy of CMB305 versus placebo using: o Time- to-next treatment (TTNT) o Distant metastasis -free survival (DMFS) o Objective response rate (ORR) ( defined by RECIST v1.1) 05FM43"

To be eligible, subjects must be receiving a first -line systemic anti- cancer therapy for unresectable locally -advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma and have no evidence of progression at the time of randomization. The study will consist of 5 periods: Pre- screening , Screening , Treatment , Post- treatment , and Long -term Follow -up. The schedule of events for the Pre-s creening and Screening periods is presented in Table 1 and the schedule of events for the Treatment through the Long- term Follow -up periods is presented in Table 2. Study flow diagrams for subjects who received a course of 4 cycles, 6 cycles , or 8 cycles of first -line systemic anti- cancer therapy are presented in Appendix 5, Figure 4, Figure 5, or Figure 6, respectively. A study flow diagram for subjects who have had a local regional therapy after first -line systemic anti- cancer therapy is presented in Appendix 5, Figure 7. 3.1.1 Pre-screening Period The Pre- screening period is up to 151 days (Day -180 to Day -29) and commences at the time the subject and/or their legally authorized representative sign the Pre-screening informed consent form (ICF)/assent form . The Pre- screening period ends at the time the Main Study ICF/assent form is signed . Before any Pre-screening procedures are performed, subjects (aged ≥18 years) and legally authorized representatives of subjects <18 years will provide written consent on the Pre-screening ICF and subjects aged 12 to <18 years will provide written assent. At the time of Pre-screening, subjects must still be receiving treatment with first-line systemic anti- cancer therapy. The following will be evaluated during the Pre- screening visit: • Radiographic disease response assessment obtained at the standard -of-care time point by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 05FM43"

After satisfying the Pre -screening criter ia, subjects (aged ≥18 years) and legally authorized representatives of subjects <18 years will provide written consent on the Main Study ICF and subjects aged 12 to <18 years will provide written assent for study participation. Once the appropriate Main Study ICF/assent form is signed, subjects will undergo additional eligibility assessments and the investigator will confirm there is no evidence of progression (using RECIST v1.1). The disease status will be assessed by the investigator (using RECIST v1.1) through a comparison of the most recent baseline images obtained during Screening to both 1) the images obtained prior to initiation of first- line systemic anti- cancer therapy and 2) the images obtained per standard -of-care during first -line systemic anti- cancer therapy to confirm there is no evidence of progression prior to randomization. Investigator assessment of radiographic images confirming best response (stable disease [ SD] or better) to first -line systemic anti- cancer therapy using RECIST v1.1 will be entered into an electronic case report form (eCRF). Subject s who have a tumor response of SD with evidence of ≥15% to 20% increase in tumor burden will be submitted for C entral Review to adjudicate the investigator’s assessment of tumor response prior to randomization. Radiographic images from both Screening and Pre- screening will also be submitted to an independent review committee (IRC) for storage. The stored images will be available for evaluation by a central reader, if requested by the sponsor. After completion of Screening assessments and confirmation that the subject has met all eligibility requirements, the subject will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment arms using central randomization system on Day 1. 3.1.3 Treatment Period The Treatment period will begin on the day of randomization (Day 1), which is to be within 28 days after the last dose of first -line systemic anti- cancer therapy or last day of local regional therapy , if applicable, and will continue until investigator -determined progressive disease (PD) (using RECIST v1.1), unacceptable toxicity, or 1 year after the first dose, whichever occurs first. 05FM43"

Tumor imaging assessments will be performed every 8 weeks after Day 1 and radiographic evidence of disease progression will be determined b y the investigator using RECIST v1.1. Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of study treatment but without objective evidence of disease progression (symptomatic deterioration) will be considered as having PD for the purpose of determining PF S. Radiographic images (e.g., computed tomography [CT] scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) will also be submitted to an IRC for storage and will be available for evaluation by a central reader, if requested by the sponsor. Details for the collection and evaluation of radiographic images are included in the Radiology Manual provided to the study sites. Tumor biopsy samples for NY- ESO -1 expression will be obtained from all subject s during the Pre-screening period as described in Section 3.1.1 (either archival tumor tissue or a fresh biopsy sample). All subjects will provide peripheral blood samples for anti- NY-ESO -1 antibody assay at the screening visit for stratification. Quality of life will be assessed up to 12 months from Day 1 . Safety will be monitored by evaluating the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), clinical laboratory abnormalities, immunogenicity and persistence of LV305. Local l aboratory test values will be used for treatment decisions and subject care; central laboratory test values will be used in the analysis of safety. In addition, at only select US sites, the following will be collected: Peripheral blood samples for the anti- NY-ESO -1 T cell and antibody assay s will be obtained prior to start of study treatment from subjects on Day 1 , Day 92, and Day 365 for subject s who have not had a progression event.

All laboratory tests to be performed are listed in Table 4. g Blood for anti -NY-ESO -1 T cell assessments to be collected only for subjects on prior to dosing on Day 1 and Day 92 only at select US sites. Additional blood samples for immunity assessments will be drawn for any subject who has no evidence of tumor progression by RECIST v1.1 at 1 year at the same select US sites. h For circulating tumor genomics, please see lab manual. i For FCBP , serum and confirmation urine pregnancy testing will be performed by the local laboratory prior to dosing on Day 1; results must be negative. Serum pregnancy testing will be performed by the local laboratory prior to dosing on Day 92; results must be negative . Pregnancy testing will be performed more frequently as required per local regulatory authority. j Vital sign measurements will include body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure. On the day of each dosing, vital signs will be obtained no more than 60 minutes before dosing and 30 minutes after dosing (±10- minute window). k Once the Screening physical examination has been conducted, a simple symptom -directed physical examination should be performed for all subsequent visits. Measurements of body weight will be obtained at every visit . l Beginning in the Treatment period, imaging will be performed at 8 -week intervals after Day 1 administration of the first dose of the study drug for up to 1 year or until the time investigator -determined progressive disease, using RECIST v1.1, is documented. m QoL assessments will be conducted at the study site. In addition to the screening QoL assessment, the QoL assessment will be obtained on Day 1 prior to the first dose of study drug, at Day 92, and at 6 months and 12 months after Day 1. All subjects, regardless of their disease response status, will continue to have QoL assessments performed fo r 12 months after Day 1. n All AEs and SAEs will be collected until 30 days after administration of the last dose of the study drug. Information on any SAEs and new malignancies that come to the attention of the site staff that are considered at least possib ly related to CMB305 will be collected until the time of last subject contact. o After Day 92, G305 or placebo will be given on Day 14 8 and at 8-week interval s as a boost for up to 1 year, or until unacceptable toxicity, or investigator -determined progressive disease, using RECIST v1.1, is documented, whichever occurs first . AEs will be reported at the subsequent visit and until at least 30 days after the last dose. p Peripheral blood will be collected at the following times after administration of the first dose of study drug on Day 1: no sooner than Day 92 (3 months) but up to 4 months; 6 months up to 9 months; and 1 year up to 15 months; and then yearly at no sooner than every 12 months but not more than 15 months up to the time of study closure. If all pos t-treatment assays are negative during the first year, then the yearly samples should be archived. Samples will be used for an assay to test for persistence of LV305. q The Day 92 biopsy may be obtained within ±2 weeks of Day 92, Day 365, and at time of progression event will be encouraged at the same selected US sites per footnote “ g”. r Survival status will be obtained by any means, which includes, but is not limited to, public records where allowed per local authority, telephone contact, during an in- clinic visit, chart review, or via communicating with an individual (e .g., family, friend, referring health care provider) who is knowledgeable of the subject’s survival status. More frequent survival status updates may be obtained at the request of the sponsor. 05FM43"

Clinical Trial Protocol: IMDZ -04-1702 19 September 2018 v2.1 DK Confidential Page 38 of 94 3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group Synovial sarcoma is commonly grouped together with other STS subtypes, and while it constitutes a small subgroup of subject s within clinical studies, therapies for all types of STS are commonly used as the standard treatment for subject s with synovial sarcoma. Because STS comprises multiple tumor histologies (more than 50 histologic subtypes), patterns of care and respective clinical outcomes vary considerably by histologic subgroup ( Van Tine 2016; Lee 2016; Reichardt 2014; Skafida 2017). No therapy has been approved specifically for treatment of subject s with synovial sarcoma. Currently available systemic anti- cancer therapies carry significant safety risks when used as single agents or even greater risk when administered in combination regimens. These safety risks include cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, nausea/vomiting, and fatigue. The aforementioned toxicities can cause significant subject morbidity and may require hospitalization and/or the use of supportive care measures such as high-dose steroids, antibiotics, and transfusions ( Lee 2016). Per NCCN, maintenance therapy refers to treating a subject with an anti- cancer therapy after maximal response to first-line induction therapy ( NCCN ). The goal of maintenance therapy should be to improve OS or subject QoL when compared with no treatment ( Schilsky 2011). This should be an appropriate setting to study the efficacy of CMB305 in synovial sarcoma subject s. Though a ll subject s with advanced synovial sarcoma will inevitably pr ogress , PFS following the initial response to first- line systemic anti- cancer therapy ranges from 6 to 8 months with up to two-thirds of subjects experiencing SD or a response ( Judson 2014). Once maximum benefit has been achieved by therapy, treatment is often stopped, and subjects receive no therapy until subsequent progressive disease. Some of the subject s who were deemed unresectable prior to the first -line systemic anti- cancer therapy may undergo local regional therapy upon its completion . After such local regional control procedure, subject s will receive no therapy until progression. CMB305 has a well -tolerated safety profile compared with other active systemic anti- cancer therapies and should not increase cumulative toxicities due to systemic anti- cancer therapy when administered in the proposed maintenance setting, which makes CMB305 an attractive option for subject s. Further, use of CMB305 is well-tolerated and therefore not anticipated to impact the ability to administer subsequent lines of alternative therapies in subject s after disease progression. This phase 3 trial design in the maintenance setting , where no other options for treatment of synovial sarcoma are approved, will use a placebo in an effort to minimiz e bias. There are circumstances that justify the use of placebo, one of which is when there is no approved standard therapy ( La Vaque 2001). Placebo controls are justified for “first-generation” drugs designed to fill a gap in the therapeutic armamentarium ( Orentlicher 2001). The use of a placebo in a double- blind, randomized, controlled trial is the most rigorous test of treatment efficacy for evaluating a medical therapy ( Castro 2007). Because there is no standard or approved therapy for subject s with synovial sarcoma who have no evidence of progression on first- line systemic 05FM43"
39,page_39,"CMB305 Immune Design Corp. Clinical Trial Protocol: IMDZ -04-1702 19 September 2018 v2.1 DK Confidential Page 39 of 94 anti-cancer therapy, the use of a placebo in this trial is warranted. This trial will evaluate whether CMB305 active therapy is better than observation alone (i.e., placebo). Advantages for the use of placebo in the control arm of this trial include: • Lowers the risk of altering the natural history of a subject’s tumor progression so that there is a true comparator arm • Minimizes confounding factors and bias • Reduces the potential of study withdrawal The study will be stratified by response to first-line treatment to maintain balance between arms. The strata will allow for statistical impact of subject s who have received local regional therapy. In addition, subjects on the study are not forgoing any standard therapy, which minimizes risks and allows for blinded analysis of not only efficacy but also of QoL and the safety of CMB305. In summary, there remains a high unmet medical need for subject s with locally -advanced unresectable or metastatic synovial sarcoma who have no evidence of progression. Currently, there is no disease -specific therapy approved specifically for the indication of synovial sarcoma based on the underlying biology or subtype specific activity. Therapeutic options that are approved for the broader STS indication have limited efficacy in subject s with synovial sarcoma and are often associated with significant toxicities. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach on how to develop and evaluate a new targeted therapy that is safe for this ultra- rare subject population with a high unmet medical need. 3.3 Study Duration and Dates Subject participation is inclusive of the Pre -screening, Screening, Treatment, Post- treatment, and Long -term Follow -up periods. The Pre- screening period is up to 151 days (Day -180 to Day -29) and begins from the time the subject and/or their legally auth orized representative sign the Pre-screening ICF/assent form to the time the Main Study ICF/assent form is signed . The Pre-screening period can start as early as the first dose of first -line systemic anti-cancer therapy. The duration of the Screening period is 28 days (Day -28 to Day -1) and begins on the date the subject and/or their legally authorized representative sign the Main Study ICF/assent form and ends at time of randomization . The screening window may be extended up to 56 days by the sponsor, if a patient is recovering from toxicity related to first line systemic anti- cancer therapy, or completing local regional therapy, or baseline imaging needs adjudication to determine eligibility . The Treatment period will begin on the day of randomization (D ay 1), which is to be within 28 days after the last dose of first -line systemic anti- cancer therapy or the last day of local regional therapy , if applicable, and will continue until investigator -determined radiographic PD 05FM43"

LV305 is a DC- targeting viral vector that encodes the full -length gene of the NY-ESO -1 cancer testes antigen. G305 consists of the recombinant full-length NY- ESO -1 protein adjuvanted with the synt hetic TLR4 agonist GLA. 5.1.1.1 LV305 The LV305 product (priming component of the vaccine regimen) is a purified DC-tropic, replication -incompetent, integration -deficient, third- generation LV generated from our ZVex vector platform, which encodes the NY- ESO -1 canc er testes antigen. Like other third-generation 05FM43"

Clinical Trial Protocol: IMDZ -04-1702 19 September 2018 v2.1 DK Confidential Page 45 of 94 LVs, ZVex is devoid of all HIV 1- derived accessory proteins, except for Rev (regulator of expression of virion proteins [Lentivirus accessory protein]), and is encoded by a split genome with a deletion in the U3 region (ΔU3, for self-activation of the 3´LTR) ( Dull 1998). The ΔU3 deletion is a self -inactivating mutation that: (1) prevents transcription of the full- length vector genome from reversed transcribed double-stranded DNA vectors in the infected target cell (Miyoshi 1998), and (2) minimizes the risk of insertional activation that can occur when a 3´LTR can function as a promoter after integration. In addition, the ZVex vector platform has been pseudotyped with a modified Sindbis virus envelope protein (SINVar1) ( Morizono 2010) to selectively target DCs. LV305 is formulated in Tris buffer containing 5% sucrose and 50 mM L-arginine at pH 7.5. The LV305 drug product is produced at the nominal concentration (product strength) of 1 × 10 10 vector genomes (vg)/mL, 1.4 mL per vial. 5.1.1.2 G305 The G305 product (immune-boosting component of the vaccine regimen) is composed of the recombinant NY- ESO -1 protein admixed with GLA in a stable emulsion. G305 is supplied in a 2-vial configuration. One vial contains the formulated NY- ESO -1 protein and the second vial contains the adjuvant, GLA- SE. 5.1.1.2.1 NY-ESO -1 NY-ESO -1 is a protein of 182 amino acids, produced in E scherichia coli. The theore tical molecular weight of the recombinant NY -ESO -1 protein is 18,146.5 daltons.

LV305 and its placebo will be identical in appearance; G305 and its placebo s will be identical in appearance. All study treatments (CMB305 or placebo) will be labeled with the study number, a unique number, and any additional information required in accordance with government regulations. Further details will be contained in the Pharmacy Manual provided to study sites. The blind may be broken in case of a medical emergency when unblinding the treatment is necessary to manage the treatment of a subject. The investigator has the ability to perform unblinding immediately according to emergency unblinding procedures. 5.6 Treatment Modification and Discontinuation There are no protocol allowed dose reductions or increases. 5.6.1 Treatment Interruptions If less than a full dose of a study treatment component (LV305 or G305) is ad ministered ( eg, less than the four (4) injections of LV305/placebo), document the injections that were administered and the reason the other injections were not administered.

Study treatment will resume according to sched ule if drug-related toxicity improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 4 weeks of onset. If Grade 2 toxicity stabilizes based on the investigator assessment (subject is asymptomatic and controlled), study treatment may resume after consultation with and approval by the Sponsor. 5.6.3 Treatment Discontinuation Permanent discontinuation of a study treatment component (LV305 or G305) responsible for an adverse event should be considered following discussion with the Sponsor if any of the following drug related adverse events are experienced: • Severe or life-threatening drug- related adverse events; • Grade 2 or above drug related adverse events which persist without improvement for >4 weeks. With Investigator and Sponsor agreement, subject s with a drug- related adverse event still at Grade 2 may continue in the study only if asymptomatic and controlled. For subjects who experience a recurrence of the same ≥Grade 3 drug -related adverse events with rechallenge of study treatment component (LV305 or G305), a consultation between the Spons or and Investigator will occur to determine whether therapy with study treatment component responsible for the event should be discontinued. A subject who experiences the same drug- related serious adverse events ( SAE ) of the same Grade or higher with rechallenge, therapy with study treatment component responsible for the event must be discontinued immediately. 5.7 Concomitant Therapy Except for excluded medications ( Section 5.8), medications for symptoms and supportive management are permitted.

Two informed consents/assents will be used. The Pre-s creening ICF/assent form will allow for IHC testing of the tumor sample (fresh or archival) for the presence of NY -ESO -1, and review of the tumor images (CT or MRI) collected before and after administration of the first dose of first- line systemic anti- cancer therapy. The Main S tudy ICF/assent allows for participation in the study and must be signed before initiation of any Screening study -related procedures. Before the Main S tudy ICF/assent can be signed, results of IHC testing for the presence of NY- ESO -1 (≥1% expression) must be available from the central laboratory , and the investigator-evaluated tumor response ( SD or better using RECIST v1.1) to first- line systemic anti- cancer therapy must be documented. Prior to any involvement in study- related activities, an institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee ( IEC)-approved written ICF /assent must be signed and dated by the subject and/or by the subject’s legally acceptable representative according to local regulations. Documentation of local regulations regarding what constitutes legally acceptable representation should be filed at the study site. A copy of the signed and dated ICF and any other required forms to meet local or country-specific regulations must be given to the subject and the legally acceptable representative. During the consent process, the person obtaining consent must inform the subject of all elements of the study. No protocol-specific procedures, including screening procedures, are to be performed until the subject has signed and dated an IRB/IEC -approved ICF/assent . The study begins with the signing and dating of the Main Study ICF/assent form . 6.2 Demographics and Medical History Subject demographic data such as age, sex, ethnicity (where legally allowed), and race will be obtained during Screening. The subject’s clinically significant and relevant medical history will be obtained at Screening. The medical history should include (but not be limited to) clinically significant and relevant medical history with following body systems: head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT), neurologic and psychiatric, endocrine and metabolic, dermatological, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, hematolog ic, lymphatic, hepatic and renal, 05FM43"

Medical history data will be reviewed and updated, as appropriate, at Day 1. 6.3 Efficacy Assessments 6.3.1 Tumor Imaging and Response Subjects will have imaging performed at the time points stipulated in the schedule of events (Table 1 and Table 2). For individual subjects, the same imaging method should be used for all subsequent image collections throughout the study. The preferred method of imaging is via CT scan with intravenous (IV) contrast (MRI may also be considered as indicated). The slice thickness of image s obtained at Pre- screening (i .e., after treatment with first- line systemic anti- cancer therapy) , Screening, or while on study must be the same size or smaller than the slice thickness of the image obtained prior to administration of the first dose of first- line systemic anti- cancer therapy used to document all lesions present during staging of the synovial sarcoma. All images must include windows of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Brain images will be obtained if symptoms or signs suggest central nervous system involvement. Bone images will be obtained if symptoms, signs, or history suggest bone involvement by metastatic disease. All images will be evaluated by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 measurement criteria expressed as PR, CR, SD, or PD (see Appendix 1). Radiographic images ( e.g., CT scan or MRI) will also be submitted to an IRC for storage and will be available for evaluation by a central reader, if requested by the sponsor. Subjects who have a tumor response of SD with evidence of >15% to 20% increase in tumor burden will be submitted for evaluation by a central reader for adjudication. The Radiology manual includes complete details for the collection, storage, and evaluation of images. 6.3.1.1 Imaging at Pre- screening For subjects to be eligible for study participation, the investigator must confirm no evidence of disease progression whil e the subject is receiving treatment with first- line systemic anti- cancer therapy for unresectable locally -advanced or metastatic disease. During the Pre-screening period, imaging will be performed per standard -of-care and all target and non- target lesions documented before initiating first-line systemic anti- cancer therapy using RECIST v1.1. The images obtained during Pre -screening will be compared with images obtained before the start of first- line systemic anti- cancer therapy , which should have been obtained no more than 60 days prior to administration of the first dose of first- line systemic anti- cancer therapy. For a subject who has no digital images available but has a documented response classification per RECIST v1.1, a radiologist’s report certifying no disease progression may be used in individual cases after prior approval by the sponsor. 05FM43"

The images obtained at Screening will be compared with both images obtained at Pre- screening and images obtained before the start of first- line systemic anti-cancer therapy to ensure that no disease progression has occurred . Subject s who have a tumor response of SD with evidence of ≥15% to 20% increase in tumor burden will be submitted for central review to adjudicate the investigator’s assessment of tumor response prior to randomization. For individual subjects, the imag es obtained during the Screening period must have been collected using the same imaging method used for all images . Radiographic images at Screening (e.g., CT scan or MRI ) will also be submitted to an IRC for storage and will be available for evaluation by a central reader, if requested by the sponsor. Details for the collection and evaluation of radiographic images are included in the Radiology Manual. 6.3.1.3 Imaging During Treatment to the Time of Disease Progression Tumor imaging assessments will be performed and evaluated every 8 weeks after Day 1 until investigator -determined PD (using RECIST v1.1) is documented. Disease progression will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. For each subject, the images obtained during the Treatment period must have been collected using the same imaging method for all images during the Pre- screening and Screening periods . Subjects who have a global deterioration of health status that is attributed to progressive disease and leads to discontinuation of study treatment , but who are unable to provide radiographic evidence of disease progression (symptomatic deterioration) , will be considered as having PD at the time of documented global deterioration of health for the purpose of determining PFS. Radiographic images (e.g., CT scan or MRI) will also be submitted to an IRC for storage and will be available for evaluation by a central reader, if requested by the sponsor. Details for the collection and evaluation of radiographic images are included in the Radiology Manual. 6.3.2 Immune Response Assessments Results for anti-NY-ESO -1 plasma antibody must be available for subject stratification at the time of randomization. In addition, at select US sites, pre - and post- treatment anti- NY-ESO -1 plasma antibodies may be used for exploratory analyses. Pre- and post- treatment blood and tumor samples will be collected for exploratory analyses of potential biomarkers of CMB 305 immunogenicity and clinical tumor response as shown in Table 3. Circulating tumor genomics will be collected for exploratory analyses of potential immune response effect on tumor growth. 05FM43"

This includes any untoward signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) or symptoms experienced by the subject from the t ime of enrollment until 30 days post administration of the last dose of the study drug (i.e., CMB305). Safety will be evaluated for all treated subjects using the NCI -CTCAE v.4.03 or newer. Safety assessments will be based on medical review of both solicited and spontaneously reported AEs, including symptoms, physical examination findings, vital signs, laboratory findings, ECGs, and tre atment discontinuations due to AEs. The nature, severity, and frequency of AEs will be monitored on an ongoing basis for risk assessment and to determine if risk management interventions are warranted ( e.g., expedited notification of safety findings to investigators, IRBs /IECs , or regulators; update of Investigator’s Brochure and ICF risks and re-consenting study subjects ; revision of safety monitoring procedures; revision of eligibility criteria or other study procedures). 6.4.7.1 Adverse Event Collection Period All enrolled subjects will have periodic assessment of clinical and laboratory AEs. All AEs , SAEs , and MEOIs will be collected until at least 30 days after administration of the last dose of the study drug (i.e., CMB305). MEOIs, immune- mediated events and secondary malignancies (regardless of causality) to be reported through 90 days following last IP dose/cessation of treatment or 30 days after initiation of new anti- cancer therapy, whichever is earlier, need to be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of event in the same manner as outlined for SAEs. A ll SAEs and new malignancies that come to the attention of the site staff and are considered at least possibly related to CMB305 will be collected until the time of last subject contact.

At each study visit (including unscheduled visits), the investigator, or designee, will determine whether any AEs have occurred. Each AE will be reported in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF page and classified according to t he criteria in Section 6.4.7.4 , Section 6.4.7.6, and Section 6.4.7.7. If known, the diagnosis should be recorded, in preference to the listing of individual signs and symptoms. Any pre- existing conditions that are detected as part of the initial screening procedures will be reported in the medical history and not as an AE. However, pre-existing conditions that worsen after enrollment should be reported as an AE. Adverse events will be reported to the FDA and applicable regulatory authorities in accordance with the requirements outlined in 21 CFR §312.32 and ICH guidelines . Progression of cancer is not considered an AE unless it is considered to be drug- related by the investigator. Deaths due to cancer progression will not be reported as expedited events. The investigator will continue to monitor the subject until any new, changed, or worsened AE resolves, returns to baseline, or until the investigator and IMDZ agree that follow -up is no longer nec essary. AEs must be followed until resolution whenever possible. 6.4.7.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting If an SAE occurs, IMDZ will be notified within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigator. In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, IMDZ must be notified immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE information. In the rare event that the investigator or designee does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately, the investigator or designee must report the event within 24 hours of their awareness and document the time of when his/her first awareness occurred. For all SAEs, the investigator or designee is obligated to pursue and provide information to IMDZ in accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above. In addition, an investigator may be requested to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an expedited fashion. This information may be more detailed than that captured on the AE case report form. In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of causality. New SAEs experienced by subjects during the Screening period (pre- study treatment) will be reported to IMDZ if the events are considered related to study procedures. New SAEs determined to be related to study tests or procedures (not including cancer- related events) and any hospitalizations determined to be related to study tests or procedures that are experienced by subject s from the time of signing the Main Study ICF/assent form until Day 1 (start of CMB305 05FM43"

From Day 1 until 30 days after administration of the last dose of the investigational product (i.e., CMB305) , any new SAE will be noted on the SAE form and eCRF. After that point, any AE that comes to the attention of the site staff that may be causally related to study drug, i.e., CMB305, (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the drug) will be reported to IMDZ.

MEOIs that are identified from the date of first dose throug h 90 days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days after the initiation of a new anti- cancer therapy, whichever is earlier, need to be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the event in the same manner as outlined for SAEs (see Section 6.4.7.3). Subjects should be assessed for the occurrence of possible MEOIs before administration of each dose of study treatment. Laboratory result s should be evaluated, and subjects should be asked about any signs and symptoms experienced that are suggestive of an immune- related event. If laboratory test results or symptoms indicate possible immune -related MEOIs, then additional testing should be performed to rule out other etiologic causes. If no other cause is found, then the MEOI will be considered to be immune- related. 6.4.7.5 Definition s of Adverse Event Adverse Event (AE)—Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment, or procedure, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this regimen .

Progression of cancer is not considered an AE unless it is considered to be drug- related by the investigator. Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) —Any AE that occurs, or an existing condition that worsens in severity, after administration of the first dose of the study drug. Medical Event of Interest (MEOI) —Selected non -serious AEs are classified as MEOIs. The following treatment- emergent immune -mediated event is an MEOI for CMB305: • Pneumonitis As NY- ESO -1 is only detected in certain testicular cells in healthy individuals ( Gnjatic 2006), the following male genitourinary -related events are MEOI s for CMB305: • Prostatic pain • Groin pain • Testicular pain • Epididymo -orchitis MEOIs for this study include the following: • An overdose of the sponsor’s investigational product that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results • Results from protocol- specified or u nscheduled laboratory results showing simultaneous: o Increased ALT and/or AST ≥3× ULN, o Increased serum total bilirubin ≥2× ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase) and o No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased aminotransferase enzymes and total bilirubin , such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of causing the observed injury. Note: These criteria are based upon available reg ulatory guidance documents. The purpose of these criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic test results that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The site guidance for assessment and follow -up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). During study conduct, additional new MEOIs may be identified by the Sponsor based on their clinical and laboratory features and understanding of underlying pathophysiology of the adverse events and will need to be reported as such. Such events may include dermatologic, endocrine, neurologic, gastrointestinal, respiratory and musculoskeletal toxicities, which are possibly 05FM43"

Such adverse events may be delayed and wide ranging in terms of organs affected and severity. Unexpected Adverse Event —An AE is “unexpected” when its nature (specificity), severity, or frequency are not consistent with the known or foreseeable risk of AE associated with the research procedures described in the protocol, Main Study ICF/assent form , or the Investigator Brochure . Serious Adverse Event (SAE) —Any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: • Death • A life -threatening AE • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Note: Hospitalizations not to be reported as SAEs include admissions for planned medical/surgical procedure (such as scheduled tumor excision or debulking surgery) or routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status documentation (e.g., routine colonoscopy) or admission for social purposes such as lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respite, or family circumstances. • A persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect • Is a medically important condition that is judged by a health care professional as serious The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, and it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. Disability refers to a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life function. • Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. These may also be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; or blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. For reporting in this study, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via an investigational medicinal product is considered a serious adverse event. When there is doubt regarding an AE meeting the criteria for an SAE, the investigator should default to reporting the AE as an SAE. There are special circumstances in which an SAE reporting form is used to communicate important clinical trial safety observations that may not constitute an SAE. 05FM43"

For reporting purposes, an overdose will be cons idered, regardless of adverse outcome, as an important medical event. All cases of overdose must be reported immediately to the sponsor. 6.4.7.6 Adverse Event Severity All AEs will be evaluated according to the NCI -CTCAE v4.03 (2010) or newer (http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf) For AEs not listed in this reference scale, severity will be assessed by the investigator according to the criteria in Table 5. Table 5 Adverse Event Severity Assessment Grade 1 (Mild) Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated Grade 2 (Moderate) Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADLa Grade 3 (Severe) Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospita lization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADLb Grade 4 (Life threatening) Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated Grade 5 (Death) Death related to AE ADL = activities of daily living; AE = adverse event a Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. b Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to enable an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 6.4.7.7 Relationship The investigator will report his or her interpretation of the relationship between an AE and the study treatment on the basis of their clinical judgment and the definitions in Table 6. 05FM43"

Note that it is not appropriate to invoke “you can’t rule it out.” Not related AEs that are considered clearly not causally related to study regimen, or for which there is a clear alternative explanation AE = adverse event If there is any question whether or not an AE is possibly, probably, or definitely related, the investigator should default to conservatism in categorization. Similarly, the investigator should default to conservatism by calling an AE an SAE if there is doubt regarding the serious nature of an AE , if it meets one of the definitions described above. 6.4.7.8 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events Clinically significant laboratory test result s, in the opinion of the investigator, will be considered AEs and will be reported as shown in Section 6.4.7. It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess the clinical significance of all abnormal values as defined by the list of reference ranges from the local laboratory. In some cases, significant changes in laboratory values within the normal range will require similar judgment. An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as an AE only if any one of the following criteria is met: • An action on the study drug is made as a result of the abnormality • Intervention for management of the abnormality is required • At the discretion of the investigator should the abnormality be deem ed clinically significant 05FM43"

Before enrolling FCBP in this clinical trial, all FCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug administration and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. Male subjects must be advised of the importance of their female partners avoiding pregnancy during the male subject’s participation and for 3 months after the last dose of the study drug. All subjects (men and women) must sign an ICF documenting this discussion. All FCBP must have a negative pregnan cy test within 2 weeks prior to the study regimen initiation. If the pregnancy test is positive, the subject must not be enrolled in the study. In addition, all FCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they suspect they might b e pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation. If following initiation of study dosing, it is subsequently discovered that a trial subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant within 1 month before or 4 months a fter, study regimens will be permanently discontinued, and the subject will be followed as possible by the investigator or designated health care professional to determine pregnancy outcomes for both mother and baby. If a male subject enrolled in study has a female sexual partner who becomes pregnant after initiation of the study, then the study subject should be asked by the investigator (or designated health care professional) for permission to approach his pregnant partner to follow-up to determine outco mes for both mother and baby. 6.4.9 HIV Screening Assessment As part of study eligibility, subjects are required to have a negative HIV screening test at baseline. LV305 is an engineered lentivirus vector and is therefore derived from HIV . It is not known if treatment with LV305 will result in seroconversion of subjects to positive with HIV screening. Vectors derived from lentiviruses share some, but not all, of the proteins that are recognized in several screening blood tests for HIV. Secondary confirmatory assa ys such as Western Blot will demonstrate that the normal complement of HIV proteins is not present (unless, of course, the subject has developed true HIV infection). The informed consent document informs subjects regarding the possibility of positive HIV s creening test after study treatment. Subjects enrolled in the study will be provided with a card from the study sponsor describing the possibility of a screening test becoming positive and the importance of confirmatory testing. In the event a study subject should have a screening HIV test performed and it returns a positive result, the site should inform and consult IMDZ for recommendations on the most appropriate confirmatory test to use. 05FM43"

Investigators should promptly identify signs and symptoms of AEs representing an immunologic etiology and provide appropriate treatment. If an MEOI that is considered grade 2 or higher (with the exception of alopecia or vitiligo) occurs, subsequent doses of CMB305 should be withheld. CMB305 dosing should resume only after consultation with the sponsor. The occurrence of any immune- mediated event will be evaluated by the data monitoring committee ( DMC ). The immune-mediated event of pneumonitis will be captured as an MEOI; procedures for reporting MEOIs are provided in Section 6.4.7.4. 6.5 Removal of Subjects from the Trial or Study Drug Unless consent is withdrawn and the subject is unwilling to continue with safety follow-up, the subje ct is lost to follow -up, or the study is terminated, all efforts should be made to continue tumor and quality of life assessments as well as safety monitoring of all subjects. Subjects who withdraw prior to the end of the study should be followed for new AEs for at least until 30 days after their last dose of study drug, i.e., CMB305. If the subject withdraws prematurely and is unwilling to continue safety follow-up, any subsequent SAE that may be causally related to study drug (i .e., CMB305) that comes to the attention of the site staff should be reported to IMDZ. Information for long-term survival status should be obtain ed by any means, which includes, but is not limited to, public records where allowed by local authority, telephone contact, during an in-clinic visit, chart review, or via communicating with an individual (e .g., family, friend, referring health care provider) who is knowledgeable of the subject’s survival status. More frequent survival status updates may be obtained at the request of the sponsor. 6.5.1 Removal from Trial While subjects will be encouraged to continue participation in the study for safety follow-up, subjects MUST be discontinued from the study for the following reasons: 1. Pregnancy within 1 month before or 4 months after study regimen administration (NOTE: All FCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant [e.g., missed or late menstrual period] at any time during study participation .) 2.

Study treatment will be discontinued upon commencement of subsequent systemic anti-tumor therapy. No unblinding will be permitted for subjects who continue study treatment beyond progression. 6.6 Appropriateness of Measurements The measurements of efficacy and safety in this study are standard measurements widely used and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant. The safety measurements evaluated in this study are those used in most clinical studies, including the assessment of AEs. 05FM43"

The study is powered at 90% with 179 death events required to detect a HR of 0.59, which corresponds to a 41% reduction in the risk of death, and an approximately 69% increase in median survival compared with a placebo median survival of 20 months, and uses a 1-sided log-rank test, with an alpha of 0.0125, a 1:1 randomization ratio, and an interim OS non-binding futility analysis with boundary of HR = 1.0 at 67% of information time (120 death events from the 179 required death events for the final OS analysis). A total of 248 subjects will yield the 179 events required, under the assumption of 24 months for enrollment (25% of subjects enrolled in the first year and 75% of subjects enrolled in the second year) plus 42 additional months of follow-up. With 141 PFS events, the study is powered at 90% to detect a HR of 0.55, which corresponds to a 45% reduction in the risk of PFS events (either disease progression or death ), and an approximately 8 2% increase in median PFS compared with a placebo median PFS of 4 months, and uses a 1 -sided log-rank test, with an alpha of 0.0125, and a 1:1 randomization ratio. 7.2 Analysis Set s For the purpose of statistical analysis, there are 3 analysis set s: Intent -to-Treat set (ITT), Efficacy Evaluable set (EE), and Safety set . • The ITT set consists of all subjects randomized. All analyses of this set will be based on the randomized treatment arm to which the subjects are assigned . Efficacy analyses performed in the ITT set will be considered to be the primary indicator of effic acy. • The EE set consists of all subjects without major protocol violations, who have received at least 1 dose of study drug, and have the baseline and at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment s available. The EE set will be analyzed according to the treatment received. Efficacy analyses performed in the EE set will be considered to be supportive. • The Safety set consists of all subjects takin g any amount of study drug. The Safety set is the primary set for safety analyses including AEs and clinical laborator y data. Study treatment exposure also will be summarized using the Safety set. Efficacy analyses performed in the Safety set will be considered to be supportive. 7.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Subject disposition and characterist ics including demographics, disease duration and stage at Screening , and re levant medical history will be summarized for the purpose of characterizing the subject populatio n by treatment arm and establishing basel ine comparability of the rand omized treatment arms. 05FM43"

Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. Progression- free survival by investigator’s assessment is defined as the time from randomization to the investigator -determined (using RECIST v1.1) date of disease progression or death. Radiographic images will be collected and assessed using RECIST v1.1 until the time the subject begins a new line of treatment. For the purpose of PFS analysis , any one of the following events, whichever occurs first , will be used: • Disease progression per RECIST v1.1 (See Appendix 1 Table 7 [ Eisenhauer 20 09]) • Symptomatic deterioration (global health deterioration) as described by RECIST v1.1 • For subjects with NED at time of randomization, any new malignant lesion that occurs after randomization per RECIST v1.1 (See Appendix 1 Table 8) Otherwise, subjects who do not have disease progression or have not died will be censored at the date when the last tumor imaging assessment determines a lack of progression. If a subject begins a new anti -cancer therapy or has radiotherapy, surgery, or other local regional therapy at a lesion site prior to documented progression, the subject will be censored at the last assessment where the subject was documented as progression free prior to the intervention. For subjects with NED at study entry, the appearance of a new malignant lesion as per RECIST v1.1 is defined as an event of progression for the purpose of PFS analysis.

PFS, by investigator’s assessment, will be the primary PFS analysis. P FS by independent radiological review will be the supportive analysis. The null hypothesis of no difference in OS/PFS between CMB305 and placebo, will be tested using a stratified log -rank test stratified by: disease status at screening (locally advanced unresectable versus metastatic), tumor response during screening (PR/ SD versus CR/ NED), and by baseline presence of anti -NY-ESO -1 antibody (yes versus no)). The null hypothesis will be rejected , and it will be concluded that OS/PFS on CMB305 is superior to that on placebo in subjects with synovial sarcoma if the 1- sided p value at the final analysis for the stratified log -rank test is less than the pre- specified alpha of 0.0125 as discussed in Section 7.10, Multiplicity . The associated HR and its 2 -sided 97.5% and 95% CI will be provided using the stratified Cox proportional hazard model. The Kaplan -Meier curve will summarize OS/PFS graphically by treatment arm. Tabular summaries of the Kaplan -Meier curves, including the median, will be provided by treatment. The 1- year and 18 -month OS/PFS rate will be provided by treatment. The final PFS analysis will be conducted when a total of 141 PFS events occur. The final OS analysis will be conducted when a total of 179 deaths occur. A pre -planned sensitivity analysis will be performed based on the number of cycles and type of prior therapy (neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery and/or radiotherap y). 7.7.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses: The secondary efficacy endpoints of TTNT, DMFS, ORR and QoL using the EQ -5D- 5L or EQ-5D-Y will be compared between treatment arms. The secondary efficacy endpoints will only be evaluated if at least one of the primary effic acy endpoints demonstrates superiority for CMB305 over placebo . Furthermore, to control the overall family -wise type I error rate at 1-sided α = 0.025 for the secondary efficacy endpoints, the secondary efficacy endpoint of TTNT will be tested first at 1-sided alpha of 0.025. DMFS will be tested at 1-sided alpha of 0.025 only if TTNT shows significant improvement. 7.7.2.1 Time to Next Treatment Time to next treatment is defined as the time from randomization to start of post- study treatment anti-cancer therapy. Su bjects who do not start post- study treatment anti- cancer therapy will be censored at their last known date of being alive. TTNT will be analyzed using the same methods described for OS/PFS. In the event that the percent of subjects with competing events in either arm exceeds 3%, the cumulative incidence estimates , and Gray’s test will be the main TTNT compar ison between the treatment arms. 05FM43"

QoL (EQ-5D- 5L or EQ -5D- Y) scores will be compared between the treatment arms using a mixed model. 7.8 Safety Analysis Safety will be assessed prim arily based on reported AEs. A TEAE is an AE with an onset on or after the initiation of study treatment, or a pre- existing condition that worsens after initiation of study treatment (i.e., increase in severity). Medical events of interest, immune -mediated events, and AEs that occur more than 30 days after the last dose, and that are deemed as related to the study drug, will be included as TEAEs. TEAEs occurring from the time of the first dose through 30 days after the last dose of the study drug and medical events of interest, immune -mediated events and related AEs will be summarized. All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs ® (MedDRA v20.0 or newer). TE AEs will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, by treatment , and will be further categorized by NCI-CTCAE (v4.03 or newer) grade, and by relationship to the study drug. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities , as measured by either the local or central laboratory, will be reported as AEs. The incidence for each AE will be provided as the total number of subjects that experience the AE, as well as the percentage of the population that this represents. If an AE is reported more than once during treatment for a given subject, the worst grade of severity and the most conservative relationship will be presented in the summary tables. AEs will also be listed for individual subjects, along with information regarding onset, duration, grade, relationship to the study drug, and outcome. AEs that lead to withdrawal from the study treatment will be listed and summarized. Tabulations and listings of SAEs and deaths also will be generated. Treatment exposure will be provided by treatment arm.

The incidence of prior and concomitant medication usage will be summarized by treatment arm, by therapeutic drug class , and generic drug names. 7.9 Exploratory Analysis The baseline anti -NY-ESO -1 immune response and histol ogic and molecular changes in peripheral blood and tumor tissue and their association with clinical outcomes will be explored. In addition, a relationship between an induced anti- NY-ESO -1 immune response as well as tumor tissue changes during study treatme nt and clinical outcomes will be evaluated using peripheral blood and tumor tissue biopsies collected during study treatment at select sites . 7.10 Multiplicity The study is to be conducted with PFS and OS as 2 primary endpoints with the goal of a regulatory approval based on PFS or OS . The overall type I error probability is specified to be 1-sided 0.025 with success for either of the 2 primary endpoints defining study success using the Bonferroni method to specify that each endpoint will be evaluated using a type I error probability of 1-sided 0.0125 in order to protect the overall type I error. 7.11 Data Monitoring Committee and Interim Analysis A data monitoring committee will be established with the responsibility of safeguarding the interest of study subjects and maintaining the overall integrity of the study. The DMC will review safety data periodically during the study as described unde r Section 8.17 (Data Monitoring Committee) of this protocol and will evaluate the results of final PFS analysis and a planned interim OS analysis to assess futility with the possibilit y of a recommendation for stopping the study early because of futility. The OS non-binding futility boundary is set to be HR = 1.0. It will be conducted at 67% of information time (120 th death event from the 179 required death events for final OS analysis). If deemed necessary by the DMC, unblinded data may be reviewed on a case- by-case basis. The sponsor will remain blinded to study treatment until either 1 of the 2 primary endpoints is met or until the study has been stopped early. Details of DMC function will be governed by a DMC Charter developed by the sponsor and accepted by DMC members. 05FM43"

The investigator or investigator’s designee will provide background information on the study, including t he benefits and risks of the investigative regimen. The investigator or investigator’s designee will also encourage the prospective subject to ask questions about the study and will provide the prospective subject with sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate. Verification of the signed ICF or assent will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. The original signed ICFs and assents will be filed with the subject ’s records and/or in the Investigator Study File (or equivalent) . A copy of th e signed consent or assent must also be provided to the subject, and, if the subject is under 18 years of age, to the subject’s legal guardian . The subject ICF and assent template s that have been provided for this study may be revised by an investigator or an IRB /IEC based on the local requirements. However, all changes requested by an investigator or an IRB /IEC , even those that are not substantial and/or do not affect the rights, safety or welfare of a subject, must be approved by IMDZ or its designee. The subject ICF and assent must be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent. Any revision of these documents must be approved by the IEC/IRB before they can be used in the study. Subjects must be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to their willingness to continue participation in the study. The communication of this information should be documented by having all parties concerned sign and personally date the revised ICF or assent. 8.9.1 Assent for Subjects Under the Age of Consent (Pediatric Subjects) For all subjects who are under the age of consent (i.e., pediatric subjects under 18 years of age); the written informed consent of a legal ly acceptable representative is required. Pediatric subjects who can understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study must also give their assent in writing via the assent document, as appropriate , and per local or institutional requirements. 8.10 Subject Confidentiality All study documents, including the study protocol and eCRFs, are the confidential property of IMDZ and should be treated as such. All subjects screened for the study will be documented in a screening log in compliance with the requirements of individual study sites. Subjects not enrolled into the study will be documented as such in the screening log together with the reason for not having been enrolled. The investigator wi ll maintain a personal list of subject names and subject numbers (Subject Identification List) for participants in the study to enable records to be identified at a later date. These records should be retained in a confidential manner for the duration stipulated by applicable regulatory requirements. Subject names shall not be revealed to IMDZ or its 05FM43"

Only the subject identifier will be recorded in the eCRF, and if the subject’s name appears on any other document, it must be redact ed and replaced with the subject identifier before a copy of the document is supplied to IMDZ or its authorized representatives. Clinical sites will comply with local laws regarding anonymization of subject identifiers, as required. In the event of acciden tal communication of subject names or other inappropriate identifying information, immediate steps to redact the information from all study files will be implemented, with appropriate documentation in the subject study file. The ICF will include a statemen t that all study findings, irrespective of the medium on which they are stored, will be handled in strictest confidence in accordance with applicable data protection laws (e.g., the European Data Protection Directive [95/46/EC] and the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]), and will be evaluated by the sponsor and/or a competent regulatory authority in an anonymized form. The subjects are also to be informed that their medical records may be audited or inspected by qualified delega tes from the sponsor or a competent regulatory authority. The subject’s written consent authorizing direct access to his medical records, and computer processing and publishing of his anonymous personal data, must be obtained prior to participation in the study. 8.11 Quality Control and Assurance IMDZ performs quality assurance checks on all clinical studies that it sponsors. Before the enrollment of any subject in this study, IMDZ (or its authorized representative) and the investigator will review the protocol, the Investigator Brochure, the eCRF s and instructions for completing them, the procedure for obtaining informed consent or assent , and the procedure for reporting AEs/SAEs. Site monitoring visits will be performed by IMDZ (or its authorized representative) on a regular basis pursuant to its monitoring plan. During these visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source documents. After the e CRFs are received by IMDZ (or its authorized representative), they will be reviewed for safety information, legibility, completeness, accuracy, and logical consistency. The data will be entered into a database. Additional computer programs that identify selected protocol deviations, out-of-range data, and other data errors may be used to help monitor the study. As necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to the investigator. Data entered in the eCRF will be source verified for accuracy and completeness. In addition, protocol compliance and compliance with FDA regulations and ICH GCP guidelines will be verified. 8.12 Study Files and Materials Before the start of any study -related procedures, all essential documents specified by ICH GCP and other applicable regulations must be available in the relevant fil es maintained by IMDZ (or its authorized representatives ) and the investigator. An Investigator Study File prepared by the sponsor (or its authorized representatives), containing all applicable documents for use at the study site, will be made available to the investigator before the start of the study.

The respective files will be kept and updated by the sponsor ( or its authorized representatives ) and the investigator, as applicable. All study documentation and materials maintained in the Investigator Study File at the study site must be available for inspection by the sponsor’s study monitor (or its authorized represen tatives ) to determine that all required documentation is present and correct (see Section 8.15). The study may be audited or inspected by an authorized representat ive from IMDZ or a competent regulatory authority (see Section 8.15). 8.13 Monitoring of the Study The investigator at each site will allow the sponsor’s study monitor (or its authorized representatives) reasonable access to the eCRFs and direct access to related source documents for monitoring purposes as frequently as the sponsor deems necessary. These documents include records of tests performed as a requirement for p articipating in the study as well as other medical records required to confirm information contained in the eCRF, such as past medical history and secondary diagnoses. Before each monitoring visit, the investigator ( or its authorized representatives) shoul d record all data generated since the last monitoring visit in the eCRF. The investigator and other relevant personnel at each study site will be expected to cooperate with the sponsor’s study monitor to assist in providing any missing information. The stu dy monitor will require access to the Investigator Study File to ensure completeness of all documentation required for the study. The study monitor will ensure that the investigator at each site has been provided with adequate means for organization and filing of study documentation. The date on which the study monitor ( or its authorized representatives ) visits the study site will be recorded in the Site Visit Log. During monitoring visits, the study site’s coordinator (if applicable) and the investigator should be available, the source documentation should be accessible, and a suitable environment should be provided for the study monitor to review study related documentation. The main objectives of monitoring visits conducted by the study monitor include: • Resolution of any problems • Examination of all study documentation for completion, adherence to the study protocol, and possible AEs • Clarification of inconsistencies or missing data • Verification of study data against source documents • Checks that investigator obligations have been fulfilled 05FM43"

The IRB/IEC must approve all substantial protocol amendments prior to their implementation. If required by applicable local regulatory requirements, the local regulatory authority must also approve all substantial protoc ol amendments prior to their implementation. A “non-substantial” amendment of a study protocol includes minor corrections or clarifications that have no significant impact on the way the study is to be conducted and has no effect on the safety of participating subjects (e .g., change in study monitor, contact details ). If required by applicable local regulatory requirements, the IRB/IEC , and/or the local regulatory authority should be notified of all non-substantial protocol amendments. The substantial and non-substantial protocol amendments will be integrated into an updated study protocol at the discretion of the sponsor if the changes to the original study protocol are numerous, or if required by applicable regulatory requirements. 8.15 Audits and Inspections The study may be audited or inspected by authorized representatives from IMDZ or a competent regulatory authority. In the event of an audit by the sponsor, the investigator must make all study-related documentation available to the auditor(s). Regulatory a uthorities may request access to all study related documentation, including source documents, for inspection and copying in keeping with applicable regulations. The sponsor will immediately notify the investigator (or vice versa) of an upcoming audit or inspection. If an audit or inspection occurs, the investigator and relevant personnel at the study site must allocate sufficient time to discuss the findings and any relevant issues. 8.16 Electronic Case Report Forms and Study Records The investigator is responsi ble for maintaining adequate and accurate medical records from which information will be transferred into the study electronic data capture (EDC) system . The eCRFs should be completed by a trained study team member at the investigative site. 05FM43"

No data will be recorded directly on the eCRF without additional source documentation. Data/corrections entered will be signed or initialed by the study personnel undertaking that procedure. Only complete eCRFs, reviewed and signed by the investigator indicating his/her assurance of the accuracy of all recorded data, will be accepted. It is expected that the investigator and his/her staff will cooperate with the monitoring team and provide any missing data in a timely manner. Information on the eCRF will be verifiable to source documents. Other records that will be considered source documents include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinic charts, radiographic data, laboratory reports, and pathology reports. Copies of source documents that should be sent to IMDZ or its authorized representative, if requested, include hospital or clinic records , radiog raphic data, laboratory reports, pathology reports, operative summaries , and discharge reports . Other source documents may include hospital discharge summaries, if available, or information in lieu of a discharge summary, such as discharge orders or progress notes; any relevant notes pertaining to AEs, additional surgical procedures , or deaths and autopsy reports. Any documentation sent from the site should be redacted to exclude subject identifying information. 8.17 Data Monitoring Committee A DMC will be established to provide independent review of safety data and to assure that the risk to subjects is minimized , in addition to the 2 interim efficacy analyses described under Section 7.11 (D ata Monitoring Committee and Interim Analysis) of this protocol. Th e DMC will review all related and unexpected ( i.e., expedited) SAEs as individual cases arise and will perform periodic reviews of all AEs, laboratory results, and subject discontinuations. If deemed necessary by the DMC, unblinded data may be reviewed on a case -by-case basis. Safety data will be collected and monitored on an ongoing basis throughout the study. IMDZ will summarize all available safety and laboratory data on all subjects at regular intervals (approximately every 3 months for the first 50 subjects, then approximately every 6 months ) during the study, as specified in the DMC charter. IMDZ and the DMC will conduct separate reviews of these data for any safety trends that might impact the treatment of subjects . The DMC may convene on an ad- hoc basis to evaluate any urgent safety issues. Upon request, the DMC will be granted access to any available data pertinent to the issues under evaluation. An independent DMC Service Group will provide cumulative data, as specified in the DMC charter, to the DMC for review, including clinical laboratory values, AEs, SAEs, MEOIs , and subject discontinuations. 05FM43"
