Ai Conti 55051 Castelvecchio Pascoli, Barga (Lucca) Italy Product Name: NAInvestigational Product:Kedrion intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 10% Title of Study: A Phase III, Open -label, Prospective, Multicenter Study to Assess Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Kedrion Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) 10% in Primary Immunodeficiency Disease (PID) Patients. Study Period: Approximately 13 months, including a 21 or 28 days screening period, a 48 weeks treatment period, and 3 or 4 weeks follow -up (depending on treatment regimen)Clinical Phase:Phase III Study Centers: This study will be conducted at approximately 15 study centers in 2 countries, Canada and the United States. Background and Rationale: Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) occur in individuals with a genetic defect in the immune system. As a consequence, patients are affected by recurrent protozoal, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections (Picard C, 2015). Antibody deficiencies, also referred to as B -cell or humoral immunodeficiencies, comprise the largest group of PIDs. This is a group of disorders characterized by an impaired ability to produce specific antibodies in response to antigen. Many of these disorders are caused by mutations in the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes or in genes involved in the regulation of B- cell growth and differentiation. Still, the molecular basis of most cases remains unknown. The first antibody deficiency and best studied is X -linked agammaglobulinemia ,which is caused by mutations in the Bruton tyrosine kinase (Bruton OC 1952; Bonilla FA, 2003). Loss -of-function mutations in this gene lead to a block in B -cell maturation, a near -total absence of B -cells in the periphery, and panagammaglobulinemia. Other autosomal recessive gene defects may lead to similar phenotype. Patients with agammaglobulinemia typically present with symptoms in early childhood but are usually well for the first 9 to 12 months of life because th ey are passively protected by transplacentally acquired IgG from their mothers. When symptoms present, they commonly appear as recurrent pyogenic infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, meningitis, conjunctivitis, pneumonia, and pyoderma mainly due to Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Rosen FS, 1995). Infrequently enteroviral infections with a chronic meningoencephalitis and a syndrome resembling dermatomyositis are present. Patients are also prone to mycoplasma pneumoniae infections."

Ai Conti 55051 Castelvecchio Pascoli, Barga (Lucca) Italy Product Name:NAInvestigational Product:Kedrion intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 10% The largest group of patients with antibody deficiency is classified as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 50,000. Diagnosis of CVID is based on the exclusion of other known causes of humoral immune defects (Resn ick ES, 2012). It is defined principally as low IgG (often with low IgA) together with a significant impairment of specific antibody production in response to bacterial vaccine or natural infectious challenge (Conley ME, 1999; Cunningham -Rundles C, 1999). Males and females are equally affected and presentation is most common at the ages of 20 to 40 with only about 20% of patients diagnosed in childhood. While some genetic defects have been shown to cause CVID, in most patients the molecular defect remains unknown. Signs and symptoms of CVID are generally that of recurrent pyogenic sino -pulmonary infections. The patients are also prone to infection with enteric pathogens, such as Giardia lamblia infection, and a variety of autoimmune disorders (Resnick ES, 2012). Polyclonal Ig preparations of human origin, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products, have historically been used as replacement therapy to reduce the frequency of serious bacterial infections in patients with PID. Prior to the introduction of IVIg therapy, patients suffering from hypogammaglobulinemia and agammaglobulinemia due to PID experienced approximately 4 or more serious acute bacterial infections each year. However, maintenance of a trough serum level of ≥ 5g IgG/L controls most recurrent infections and their chronic complications, improving the patients’ quality of life (Roifman CM, 2008). The study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Kedrion IVIg 10% (KIg10) in patients with PID, in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “Guidance for Industry: Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetic Studies to Support Marketing of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) as Replacement Therapy for Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency; June 2008” an d European Medicines Agency (EMA) “Guideline on the clinical investigation of human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration (IVIg); EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 3”and “Guideline on core SmPC for human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous ad ministration (IVIg); EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/2007 Rev. 5 .”"

Primary Safety Objective To assess the safety of KIg10 in the overall study population from day 1 to week 51/52. Pharmacokinetic Objective s To assess distribution, metabolism, and elimination of KIg10 total IgG, IgG subclasses, and antigen specific IgGs at steady state in 20 adult PID patients with different dosing schedules. To evaluate trough concentrations of total IgG and compare to IVIg trough concentrations prior to the study entry. Study Design: This is a phase III, open -label, prospective, single arm, historically controlled, multicenter study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and PK of KIg10 in patients, aged 2 to 70 years at the time of screening, and affected by PID. Enrollment of the 2 to 11 year-old pediatric patients will be delayed until acceptable safety and efficacy of KIg10 for the PID treatment of adolescents (12 to 17 years) or adults are demonstrated.All patients will receive an intravenous infusion of KIg10 every 21 days or 28 days (dep ending on the treatment regimen determined by their attending physician) for a period of 48 weeks at the study site. The first infusion of KIg10 will mark the beginning of the investigation period and enrollment . Visits will be performed every 21 (±3) days or 28 (±4) days after each infusion until week 51, or 52 (i.e., study termination visit), depending on the patient’s treatment schedule (please refer to the table below)."

Additionally, a 1- sided 95% confidence inte rval (CI) will be produced for the proportion of infusions with 1 or more temporally -associated AEs (including AEs determined not to be product -related) using an exact binomial method. Due to the clustered nature of the data, a Design Effect will be applie d to the CI. An analysis of variance method will be used to calculate the Intra Cluster Correlation Coefficient (Wu ,2012). For this analysis, safety will be declared if the upper 1 -sided 95% confidence is less than Other methods that take in account the clustered nature of the data could be performed (e.g., Generalized Estimating Equation). Further details will be provided in the SAP. Pharmacokinetic analysis of total IgG, IgG subclasses, and selected specific IgG antibody levels will be done by non -compartmental analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be derived from serum IgG levels and summarized descriptively, taking into account doses of the drug. Trough levels for all patients will be summarized relative to dosing interval and age category . The frequency of patients with trough concentrations < 6g/L will be estimated for each infusion number, dose level, and age category, as well as overall. All other data will be reported descriptively. Trough concentrations for total IgG at steady state achi eved by the study drug will be compared to IVIg trough concentrations prior to the study entry using statistical model. Interim PK analysis will be performed when approximately adult patients (in order to have 20evaluable patients )complete intense PK sampling before and after infusion 5 for the 28 -day schedule and infusion 7 for the 21 -day schedule. Data Safety Monitoring Board: A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established for this study. The DSMB will be independent from Sponsor and Investigators. The primary responsibilities of the DSMB are to periodically monitor, review and evaluate the safety and infection data collected during study conduct. The DSMB will be asked to review the full documentation for specific AE sand determine whether they meet the criteria for acute serious bacterial infections (as described in protocol Section 8.1.1 , Serious Bacterial Infections), defining the study’s primary endpoint. Furthermore DSMB will be asked to review safety and efficacy data (in terms of IgG trough levels) on at least adolescent or adult patients with 3 infusions (i.e., 3 months of exposure).

BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety ,and pharmacokinetic s (PK) of the Kedrion 10% immunoglobulin preparation for intravenous administration (hereafter KIg 10) in patients with primary immunodeficiency disease ( PID), in accordance with Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) guideline “Guidance for Industry: Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetic Studies to Support Marketing of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) as Replacement Therapy for Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency; June 2008” and European Medicines Agency ( EMA )guideline s “Guideline on the clinical investigation of human nor mal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration ( IVIg); EMA/CHMP/BPW P/94033/2007 rev. 3”and “Guideline on core SmPC for human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous adm inistration (IVIg); EMA/CHMP/BPW P/94038/2007 Rev. 5 .” KIg10 is a ready- to-use liquid normal immunoglobulin ( Ig, 100 mg/m L) developed by Kedrion S.p. A.from source plasm a obtained in the U nited States (US). The KIg10 manufacturing process includes 4 manufacturing steps, which are effective for viral removal/inactivation . The quality attributes, biological characteristics, and biological activity of the KIg10 product meet requirements of both US and European pharmacopoeias . In addition to the release testing, process intermediates, drug substance, and drug product are further character ized by physicochemical standpoint . 2.1 BACKGROUND Primary immunodeficiency disease occur sin individuals with a genetic defect in the immune system. As a consequence, patient s are affected by recurrent protozoal, bacterial, fungal , and viral infections (Picard C, 2015 ).Antibody deficiencies, also referred to as B -cell or humoral immunodeficiencies, comprise the largest group of PIDs. This is a group of disorders characterized by an impaired ability to produce specific antibodies in response to antigen. M any of these disorders are caused by mutations in the Iggenes or in genes involved in the regulation of B -cell growth and differentiation. Still, the molecular basis of most cases remains unknown. The first antibody deficiency and best studied is X -linked agammaglobulinemia ,which is caused by mutations in the Bruton tyrosine kinase (Bruton OC, 1952 ;Bonilla FA, 2003) . Loss-of-function mutations in this gene lead to a block in B -cell maturation, a near -total absence of B -cells in the periphery, and panagammaglobulinemia. Other autosomal recessive gene defects may lead to similar phenotype. Patients with agammaglobuline mia typically present with symptoms in early childhood but are usually well for the first 9 to 12months of life because they are passively protected by transplacentally acquired IgG from their mothers. When symptoms present, they commonly appear as recurr ent pyogenic infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, meningitis, conjunctivitis, pneumonia ,and pyode rma mainly caused by Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae"
33,page_33,"Confidential Page 34 of 115Kedrion S.p.A. Protocol Code KIG10_US3_PID01 Version 4,30-November-2020 Amendment 2 to Version 2, 17 -January-2019 Confidential (Rosen FS, 1995 ). Infrequently enteroviral infections with a chronic meningoencephalitis and a syndrome resembling dermatomyositis are present. Patients are also prone to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. The largest group of patients with antibody deficiency are classifi ed as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 50,000. Diagnosis of CVID is based on the exclusion of other known causes of humoral immune defects (Resnick ES, 2012 ). It is defined principally as low IgG (often with low IgA) together with a significant impairment of specific antibody production in response to bacterial vaccine or natural infectious challenge (Conley ME, 1999; Cunningham -Rundles C, 1999) . Males and fem ales are equally affected ,and presentation is most common at the ages of 20 to 40 with only about 20% of patients diagnosed in childhood. While some genetic defects have been shown to cause CVID, in most patients the molecular defect remains unknown. Sign s and symptoms of CVID are generally that of recurrent pyogenic sino -pulmonary infections. The patients are also prone to infection with enteric pathogens, such as Giardia lamblia infection, and a variety of autoimmune disorders (Resnick ES, 2012 ).A number of studies have demonstrated the steadily decreasing incidence of infection with increasing frequency of IVIgadministration in CVID patient s. In PID diseases with primary a ntibody deficiency and bacterial infections ,lifelong replacement therapy with IgG is require dand necessary to reduce incidence (frequency) and severity of infections and prevent long -term d eterioration principally in pulmonary function s. Treatment recommendation is that patien ts with primary antibody defici ency should be treated with IVI gat astarting dose of 400 -600mg/kg every 3 to 4 week s(Jolles S, 2015) .Less frequent treatment, or use of lower doses, is not substantiated by clinical data. Each patient may demonstrate his or her own individual response to therapy, and experience dramatic differences in the frequency and severity of infections with moderat e changes in the dose of IVIg (Shapiro RS ,2017) .Patients suffering from a serious acute infection often benefit from booster doses of IVI g. Ultimately, IVI gdosage must be individualized based upon the response of the patient (frequency of infection episodes) and potential serious complication of the primary disease ( e.g.,bronchiectase s). Quality of Life The direction of healthcare is moving toward patient satisfaction scores and perception of health. Quality of life (QoL) assessment is valued not only by patients, as they are able to directly contribute to the evolution of their care, but is also cons idered a measure of efficacy. Quality of life data areused to provide evidence to be used in making critical clinical decisions; it influences managed care, formulary, and purchasing decisions; and positively contributes to the body of scientific knowledge. Contemporary studies of IVIG in treatment of PID patients need to address QoL as an outcome measure to provide information to providers, patients, and payers ( Routes J, 2016). The Pediatric Quality of Life"

Protocol Code KIG10_US3_PID01 Version 4,30-November-2020 Amendment 2 to Version 2, 17 -January-2019 Confidential Inventory™ (PedsQL™ ) is a self -rated and proxy -rated questionnaire, and both versions include 23 items (Varnj JW, 2005) . 2.2 RATIONALE Polyclonal Igpreparations of human origin, including IVIg products, have historically been used as replacement therapy to reduce the frequency and severity of serious bacterial infections in patient s with PID. Prior to the introduction of IVIg therapy, patients suffering from hypogammaglobulinemia and agammaglobulinemia due to PID experienced approximately 4 or more serious acute bacterial infections each year. Howev er, maintenance of a trough serum level of ≥ 5 g IgG/L controls most recurrent infections and their chronic complications, improving the patient s’ quality of life ( Roifman 2008 ). With this clinical trial ,Kedrion provide smore treatment choice in the area of IgG therapy for PID patients and new insight regarding QoL prior to initiation of treatment compared to QoL following the initiation of KIg10 .After perform ing the clinical trial and successive authorization of KIg10 in PID, Kedrion will take a part in stability for IVIgmarket’s supply and will confirm tolerability of IgG therapy as state of art treatment of these patients . Performing this clinical trial ,Kedrion makes a higher scientific guarantee for using IgG in PID patients and at the same t ime provides the availability on various IgG production lines, allowing selection between different IgG products as to which is the most suitable (Feldmeyer L, 2010) . This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety ,and PK of KIg10in PID patients. Furthermore this study will, for the first time, assess QoL and health care utilization data in PID patients. The results obtained from this study will support the licensure of the product for the treatment of adult patients affected by PID. 2.3 BENEFITS AND RISKS Replacement Igtherapy is standard practice for patient s with PID. Most patients receive IVI g infusions at intervals of 3 or 4 weeks. Reductions in hospitalization and infection rates have been well documented in patient s receiving high dose (> 400 mg/kg every 3 weeks) IVI g, and maintaining trough levels of IVI gabove 5 g/L is considered a reasonable standard of care (Roifman CM, 2008 )."

Protocol Code KIG10_US3_PID01 Version 4,30-November-2020 Amendment 2 to Version 2, 17 -January-2019 Confidential The main goal of replacement therapy in PID is to provide sufficient level of missing Ig to fight against common bacterial agents .To provide quantitative data about sufficient level sof IgG in PID patients during the clinical trial with KIg10, PK sampling will be performed. Determination of Ig levels through the PK parameters in PID patients is desirable for several important reasons . First, p erforming PK assessment in PID patients provides data about biological integrity of IVI g, measuring total Ig G level . Assessment of PID PKparameters equips clinicians with the tools to rationally design IVI gtherapeutic regimens (dosing) in order to maximize clinical benefit s. Second, PK profile of specific immunoglobulins (Igs) (e.g.,antibodies against bacterial antigens (as H.influenz ae and toxins ), provide sindirect proof that the IVIgadministered in the study contains sufficient level of specific antibodies against the most common bacterial antigens which cause damage tothe organs (primarily the lungs). The expected adverse events ( AEs) occurring with IVIgtreatment have been described in the “Guideline on core SmPC for human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration (IVIg), EMA/CHMP/BPW P/94038/2007 Rev. 5”, in literature ,and in clinical trials with PID patients (Schro eder HW , 2012) . The incidence of AEs considered to be related to the study IVI gin earlier PID trials ranged f rom 5 -27.6 % (Schroeder HW , 2012) . Safety monitoring during this trialwill be manage dthrough different levels of caution. After all screening procedures have been conducted and reviewed by the site principal investigator , the patient’s eligibility assessment will be carried out by the CRO’s Medical Monitor , who will consu lt the study principal investigator for confirmation as needed, based on key proto col inclusion and exclusion criteria to promote appropriate patient enrollment and data quality. Sites should submit specific Screening information as soon as possible after theScreening Visit , but only when all required information is available, for review by the Medical Monitor prior to proceeding to the Baseline visit. Patients who are deemed eligible by the Medical Monitor will be allowed to proceed in the study. Initially the trialwill include adult PID patients and adolescents in whom data will be collected .The data of at least 10 patients with at least 3 infusions (i.e.,3 months of exposure) will be reviewed by a Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB), and after positive evaluation ,Kedrion intends to continue studying the efficacy and safety of KIg10 in the young age group of PID patients (children < 12 years of age ). There is no risk to the patient in completing QoL questionnaires and self -reported health care utilization. Completion of questionnaires and reporting of data could be beneficial in determining the continuous utilization of IVIg in the treatment of PID. The selected study centers are h ighly specialized centers with previous experience inthe treatment of PID patients with IVI gaswell as wit h experience in clinical trials . Patients will have diaries ,and local medical staff will contact them tocheck on their well-being when they"

All patients will have the first infusion of IgG at a lower infusion speed which may be gradually increased based on individual experience and tolerance . Higher infusion speed might play an important role in det ermining the safety profile of the product (Cherin P, 2016) . The following adverse reactions are known occasionally to be associated with IVI gproducts: chills, headache (which is the most frequent AE described in previous clinical trials with IVI g in PID patients , range 22 -52% of patient s) (Schroeder HW , 2012) , dizziness, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia, low blood pressure, and moderate low back pain. Rarely, Igtherapy may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated cases, anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous administration. Cases of reversible aseptic meningitis (Schroeder HW , 2012 ),and rare cases of transient cutaneous reactions (including cutaneous lupus erythematous –frequency unknown) have been observed with hum an normal Ig. Reversible hemolytic reactions have been observed in patients, especially those with blood groups A, B, and AB. Rarely ,haemolytic anemia requiring transfusion may develop after high dose IVIg treatment .A specific test for early detection of hemolysis will be performed during this clinical trial (see Section 8.2.3 ,Clinical Laboratory Analysis ).The appearance of Coombs positivity after infusion of t he study IVI gs occurred in few clinical trials. The proportion of patients that became Coombs -positive after infusion varied from 8.5 to 47%. However, none of the patients in any of earlier t rials developed evidence of hemolysis or anemia (Schroeder HW , 2012) . Increase in serum creatinine level and/or acute renal failure have been observed (in most patients with pretreatment known damage of kidney function ). Very rarely , thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have been observed .In previous clinical trials with PID patients only 1serious AE(SAE) ofthrombosis was reported (Moy JN, 2010). If thrombosis occurs ,arterial thrombosis is present in about 80% of all patients after using IVIg, and venous thrombosis is seen in the remain ing number of patients. There are different risk factors which could play an important role in developing this SAE after IVI gadministration. R isk factors connected directly with patient characteristics are advanced age, pre -existing vascular risk factor in general, immobilization ,or hereditary hypercoagulability conditions. S ome co -medications andrisk factors directly related toIVIgproduct and method of administration for the first ever infusion of IVI garelarge dose, high infusion rate, and presence of contaminants in IVI g product such as activated factor XI, factor XII orpre-kallicrein activator (Cherin P,2016) .The careful monitoring of patients treated with IVI gfor thrombosis is necessary, even i fthe risk for thrombosis is small, not only in the first few days after the infusio n of IVI g, but also several weeks later (Sentinel Blo odSCAN study , 2017 ).Very rarely, cases of Transfusion"

Processing of each specimen is to be completed by a qualified site member and in accordance with the study -specific Clinical Specimen Laboratory Manual. Testing of clinical specimens will be performed by a designated laboratory. Refer to the study -specifi c Clinical Specimen Laboratory Manual for additional details. Blood Specimens A total of approximately 25 to 35 mL of blood will be drawn from all patients at screening ,baseline, Study Visits 11 and 17 (for 21 -day infusion patients), Study Visits 9 and 13 (for 28 -day infusion patients, and at the study termination visit (Week 51/52). At each PK time point (Visit 4 for 21-day infusion patients and Visit 7 for 28- day infusion patients, approximately 20 to 25 mL of blood will be drawn. At all other visits, approximately 10 mL of blood will be drawn. In addition, a pretreatment serum sample at the screening visit and a serum sample at the study termination visit (retention sample s) from each patient will be taken and stored at a temperature ≤ -70°C at the central laboratory for at least 2 years following study closure (last patient last visit), for viral safety and possible future viral testing. The blood samples collected from young/small children enrolled in this study will not exceed the recommended safety limits based on child’s size (Toronto Hospital for Sick Children Research Ethics Board) to avoid placing children at unreasonable risk of severe anemia and its complications ( Howie SRC, 2011 ). Existing guidelines for blood sample volume limits (ranging from 1 to 5% of total blood volume within 24 hours and up to 10% of total blood volume over 8 weeks) are consistent with the limited evidence available on “minimal risk” to childre n.This specification is met if children are over 12.2 kg and should be fulfilled for children ≥2 years of age. Urine Specimens Urine will be collected for pregnancy testing in females of child bearing potential at screening. In addition, urinalysis will be performed in all patients ateach visit, including the screening visit and the study termination visit (week 51/52) . NOTE: If clinical specimens other than those listed above are to be collected, specif ic purpose, date of collection and amount of sample, must be recorded in the source document and in the eCRF (as unscheduled visits)."

If safety concerns arise during the study that indicate the study should be stopped, the Sponsor will ter minate the study (21CFR 312.56[ d]). Safety concerns that will be evaluated by the S ponsor and the DSMB will include the following: Serious or life -threatening adverse drug experiences that are clearly related to the investigational product. Unexpected adverse drug experience related to treatment with the investigational product. Suspected thrombotic events . In addition, conditions that may warrant study termination at a particular site, include, but are not limited to, the following (21CFR 312.56 [b]): The discovery of unexpected and significant or unacceptable risks for the patients in the study, usually ar ising due to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) violations. A decision of the sponsor to suspend or terminate enrollment at a site due to low/no recruitment, noncompliance, or GCP issues. If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor will inf orm the investigators, the Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ) and the FDA promptly of the termination or suspension and the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Patient s may be withdrawn from the study according to Investigator discretion as described in S ection 4.8,Premature Withdrawal from Study . 4.7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE The DSMB will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of trial participants, assessing the safety and efficacy of the interventions during the trial, and for monitoring the overall conduct of the clinical trial. The DSMB will provide recommendations about continuing or terminating the trial on ethical grounds."

Protocol Code KIG10_US3_PID01 Version 4,30-November-2020 Amendment 2 to Version 2, 17 -January-2019 Confidential TheDSMB will be advisory to the Sponsor clinical trial team . The sponsor clinical trial team will be responsible for promptly reviewing the DSMB recommendations, to decide whether to continue or terminate the trial and to determine whether amendments to the protocol or changes in study conduct are required. The DSMB will be asked to review the full documentation for specific AEs and determine whether they meet the criteria for acute serious bacterial infections ( as described in S ection 8.1.1 , Serious Bacterial Infections ), defining the study’s primary endpoint. Furthermore , the DSMB will be asked to review safety and efficacy data (in terms of IgG t rough levels) on at least 10 adolescent or adult patients with 3 infusions (i.e., 3 months of exposure). After a positive evaluation ,Kedrion intends to continue studying the efficacy and safety of KIg10 in the young age group of PID patients (children < 12years of age). DSMB will also review data that are indicative of intravascular hemolysis. The DSMB will be independent from Sponsor and Investigators providing their expertise and recommendations. Functions and organization of DSMB are described in the DSMB Charter. 4.8 PREMATURE WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY Patient s may withdraw or parent/legal guardian may withdraw a child at any time, without any prejudice or negative impact on the patient’s further treatment. The patient or parent should contact the I nvestigator immediately and notify him/her that they are leaving the study. If possible, the reason for withdrawal for all patient s who do not complete the 12 -month treatment period, including those who are withdrawn after screening but prior to their first infusion, will be recorded in the source documentation. For details regarding withdrawals due to infusion AEs, refer to Section 7.1.1 , Method of Administration. The I nvestigator may withdraw a patient from the study in the following cases: For safety reasons, such as a severe AEor SAE, that does not justify continuation in the study in the opinion of the investigator. For a protocol violation that jeopardizes perform ance of the study . The patient does not comply with the protocol . Continued participation will pose a risk to the patient. Pregnancy ."

In the event of patient withdrawal, site personnel should attempt to collect the patient study diary (completed through the day of withdrawal, if available). The Investigator or study coordinator must notify the Sponsor/clinical research organization ( CRO ) immediately when a p atient has been withdrawn. The circumstances above are referred to as premature withdrawal from the study, and the reason for premature withdrawal should be clearly documented and detailed in the source documentation. The Investigator should make every attempt to evaluate the patient’s safety, including resolution of ongoing AEs, at the time of premature withdrawal. If a patient wants to withdraw from the study before all doses are administered or prior to the last planned study visit, the patient will be asked to be followed for safety for the duration of the study. When a patient withdraws, or is withdrawn, from the study, the procedures described in this section should be completed if possible. The reasons for premature withdrawal from the study include: AE, death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow -up, administrative reason, and protocol deviation. These reasons are described in greater detail below. 4.8.1 ADVERSE EVENT For any patient withdrawn from study participation prior to the planned Study Termination Visit, it is important to determine if an AE was associated with the reason for discontinuing the study. This AE must be identified on the AE e CRF page by indicating “Withdrawn from study due to AE.” Any ongoing AEs at the time of study withdrawal must be followed until resolution or stabilization. Patient s who develop a n SAE judged to be possibly or probably related to the study product should not receive subsequent treatment . 4.8.2 DEATH For any patient withdrawn from study participation due to death, this should be noted on the Study Termination eCRF page, and the associated SAE that led to the death must be reported. 4.8.3 WITHDRAWAL OF CONSEN T The patient and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) can withdr aw consent for participation in the study at any time without penalty or loss of benefit to which"

Protocol Code KIG10_US3_PID01 Version 4,30-November-2020 Amendment 2 to Version 2, 17 -January-2019 Confidential the patient is otherwise entitled. Reason for early termination should be deemed as “withdrawal of consent” if the patient withdraws from participation due to a non-medical reason (i.e., reason other than AE). 4.8.4 LOST TO FOLLOW -UP For patient s who fail to show up for final clinic visits, or for 3 consecutive clinic visits , study staff are encouraged to make at least 3 documented attempts to contact the patient/patient’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) by telephone and at least 1 documented written attempt to contact the patient/parent(s)/legal guardian(s) to encourage the completion of study termination procedures. These efforts to contact the patient should be r ecorded in the source document. 4.8.5 ADMINISTRATIVE REASO N Examples for patients withdrawn from the study due to administrative reason can include: Sponsor decision to terminate the study, patient meeting a pre- specified withdrawal criterion, patient discontinuation for insurance issues, moving, no time, etc. This reason should be noted in the Study Termination eCRF page and any ongoing AEs at the time of study withdrawal must be followed until resolution/stabilization. If the clinical study is prematurely terminated by the Sponsor, the Investigator has to promptly inform the study patient s and local Independent Ethics Committee (I EC)/IRB and should assure appropriate therapy and follow up for the patient s. All procedures and requirements pertaining to the archiving of study documents should be followed. All other study materials (study medication/ devices, etc) must be returned to the Sponsor or its designee (See Section 7.4 , Destruction of Used [or Partially Used] and Unused Study Drug). 4.8.6 PROTOCOL C OMPLIANCE Protocol compliance is the adherence to all the trial- related requirements, G CP, and the applicable regulat ory requirements. Investigators will apply due diligence to avoid protocol noncompliance . Under no circumstances should the Investigator contact the Sponsor or its designee, if any, monitoring the study to request approval of a protocol noncompliance , as no authorized deviations are permitted. If the Investigator feels a change to the protocol would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by the Sponsor and approved by the I EC and health authorities it cannot be implem ented (s ee Section 15.5 ,Protocol Amendments )."

STUDY PROCEDURES The sections below provide an overview of the procedures that are to be followed in enrolling, evaluating , and following up the patient s who participate in this clinical study. The timing of study procedures is summarized in Table 1.1 , Time and Events Table for 28-dayInfus ion Schedule and Table 1.2, Time and Events Table for 21-day Infusion Schedule . 6.1 INFORMED CONSENT/ASS ENT/AUTHORIZATION TO ACC ESS PERSONAL HEALTH INFO RMATION ""Informed consent ""is the voluntary agreement of an individual or his/her legal guardian(s) to participate in research. Consent must be given with free will of choice, and without undue inducement. The individual must have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature of the proposed research, the anticipated risks and potential benefits, and the requirements of the research to be able to make an informed decision. ""Assent"" is a term used to express willingness to participate in research by persons who are by definition too young to give inform ed consent but who are old enough to understand the proposed research in general, its expected risks and possible benefits, and the activities expected of them as patient s. Assent by itself is not sufficient, however. If assent is given, informed consent m ust still be obtained from the patient 's parent(s) or legal guardian(s). Local laws define who constitutes a ""child,"" and such definitions dictate whether or not a person can legally consent to participate in a protocol. ""Authoriz ation to access personal h ealth information ""isthe voluntary authorization of an individual or his/her legal guardian(s) to individual’s personal data (related to the clinical trial) processing by the Sponsor, the Investigator or their delegates. ""Processing ""means any operation or set of operations, which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultat ion, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. Informed consent of the patient or of the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) , assent of patient and authorization to access personal health information ( i.e.Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act for US and Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act forCanada ) following local IRB/ IEC guidance must be obtained before conducting any study-specific procedures (i.e., all of the procedures described in the protocol).

Protocol Code KIG10_US3_PID01 Version 4,30-November-2020 Amendment 2 to Version 2, 17 -January-2019 Confidential authorization to access personal health information should be documented in the patientsource document. The signed and dated informed consent, assent ,and authorization to access personal health information (personally signed and dated by the patient/parent/legal guardian and by the Investigator) must be retained by the I nvestigator as part of the study records in the patient source document. A copy of the signed and dated informed consent, assent ,and authorization to access personal health information will be given to the patient or patient ’s legally authorized representative. Addition al specifics regarding the informed consent , assent ,and authorization to access personal health information processes are located in S ection 15.2,Informed Consent Procedures . If the patient /parent (s)/legal guardian(s) isunable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed consent , assent, and authorization to access personal health information discussion. An impartial witness is defined as a person who is independent from study conduct, who cannot be unfairly influenced by those involved with the study, who attends the informed consent process if the patien t or the patient's legally acceptable representative cannot read, and who reads the ICF and any other written information supplied to the patient . After the written ICF and any other written information to be provided to patient s, is read and explained to the patient/parent (s)/legal guardian (s)and after the patient/parent (s)/legal guardian (s)has verbally consented to the patient ’s participation in the study and, if capable of doing so, has signed and personally dated the ICF, the witness should sign and personally date the consent form. By signing the consent form, the witness attests that the information in the consent form and any other written information was accurately explained to, and apparently understood by, the patie nt/parent (s)/legal guardian (s)and that informed consent was freely given by patient /parent (s)/legal guardian (s). 6.2 SCREENING VISIT Once the informed consent/assent form(s) and authorization to access personal health information have been signed and dated by the patient/parent/legal guardian and by the Investigator (Section 15.2, Informed Consent Procedures ), for those patients who meet enroll ment criteria, the fol lowing procedures will be perfo rmed at the screening visit. 1.Medical history including infection shistory, tolerance of previous IgG treatment , antibody response to pneumococcal vaccination (when available) , documented last 3 commercially available IVIginfusions before the study entry . 2.Collection of prior medications."

All screening procedures should be performed within 3 or 4 weeks (depending on treatment regimen) of the first KI g10infusion. 6.3 PATIENT IDENTIFICATION Patient s who consent to participate inthe study will be assigned a unique Patient identification ( ID)number. The Patient ID will be in the format xx -yy composed of the study center number (xx) and patient number (yy). The center number will be assigned by the Sponsor. The patient number will be assigned sequentially by the Investigator beginning with 01 at each site. The st udy center is responsible for recording all the different codes assigned to the patients in order to avoid errors such as missing subsequent numbers or assigning identical codes to different patients. The patient’s IDnumber must be included in all study d ocuments (e.g., on the eCRF, on the sample containers, on the card where the administration of the medicinal product is recorded, etc.). The Investigator is responsible for keeping the patient register up to date, in order to avoid the erroneous attributio n of numbers (repetitions, skips). The IDnumber should be used to identify a given patient in all study documents (e.g., eCRFs, documents for submission of trial material, accounting records for the drug, etc.)."

All patients in the study will be treated for a period of 48 weeks according to the dose and schedules reported in section sbelow . Patient enrollment will be considered complete with the completion of the Study Eligibility Form in the eCRF. 6.5 TREATMENT REGIMEN All patients will receive an intravenous infusion of KIg10at the same dose and interval as used for their previous IVIg maintenance therapy. KIg 10 will be administered every 21 or 28 days for a period of 48 weeks (depending on the treatment regimen) . The dos age should be calculated so that the amount administered should match the patient’s previously individualized dosing regimen , to maintain a trough level of ≥6 g/L (200to800 mg/kg of body weight), in accordance with “Guideline on core SmPC for human norm al immunoglobulin for intravenous administration (IVIg) ; EMA/CHMP/BPW P/94038/2007 Rev. 5.” The first infusion of KIg10 will be based on the patient’s baseline weight. The patient’s weight will be measured and recorded at screening , baseline and before every infusion at clinic visit forpediatric patients ,andat screening, baseline and weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 for adults , to determine if a dose adjustment is required. Variations in body weight of up to ± 10% will not require a dose adjustment. V ariations in excess of ±10% may require a dose adjustment at the discretion of the Investigator , providing a rationale for his/her choice. In any case, dosage adjustment should be maintained within the standard dos age regimen , unless clinically required otherwise. Patients will be treated at the site for each infusion (see Table 1.1, Time and Events Table for 28 -day Infusion Schedule and Table 1.2, Time and Events Table for 21- day Infusion Schedule )."

TREATMENT OF PATIENT S The study drug used in this study must be stored separately from other drugs and medications in a secure location under appropriate storage conditions with temperature monitoring. All KIg10vials must be checked for expiration date prior to use. Expired drug must not be administered to patient s. 7.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDI CINAL PRODUCT Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) 10% solution will be administered . 1 mLof solution for infusion contains: Hum an plasma proteins mg 100 of which immunoglobulin G (IgG) at least 96%. For details on product composition please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.The solution is filled into50mLtype II glass vials. All study product shall be properly packaged for the clinical study and provided by the Sponsor in compliance with the arrangements made with the Investigator. 7.1.1 METHOD OF ADMINISTRA TION Before administration, the solution must be allowed to reach room tempe rature. The average time to reach room temperature after storage at C is approximately hours. Once a vial has been put outside the refrigerator must be used within the same day. Once opened the product must be used immediately . The study drug will be administered intravenously. Prior to infusion of KIg10, the Investigator or his/her delegate must ensure that the patient is adequately hydrated. The bottle should not be shaken because excessive shaking will cause foaming (existing foam does not prevent use as foam will stay in the bottle). The product should be visually inspected for particulate matter, turbidity and discoloration, prior to administra tion. Products which are not clear or have sediment must not be used. A slight yellow discoloration is not of concern.CCICCI CCI"

If well tolerated, the rate of administration may be increased to a maximum of 8 mg/kg/min ute(2mg/kg/min – 0.02 mL/kg/min; 4 mg/kg/min –0 .04mL/kg/min; 6 mg/kg/min –0.06 mL/kg/min; 8 mg/kg/min – 0.08 mL/kg/min) at 30 minute intervals. Subsequent infusions: infusions will proceed at an initial rate of 2mg/kg/min ute(0.02 mL/kg/min) for 15 minutes. If well tolerated, the rate of administration may be increa sed to a maxi mum of 8 mg/kg/min ute (4mg/kg/min – 0.04 mL/kg/min; 6 mg/kg/min – 0.06 mL/kg/min; 8mg/kg/min – 0.08 mL/kg/min) at 15 minute intervals. If an AE occurs, either the rate of administration must be reduced to the previous step or the infusion stopped. The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the AE. Patient s should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions during the infusion since there have been reports of thrombotic events and non- cardiogenic pulm onary edema (Transfusion -Related Acute Lung Injury [ TRALI ]) in patient s administered IVI g products. If TRALI is suspected, appropriate tests will be performed for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and the patient serum . Patient s may be treated with different lots of KIg10 over the course of the 48-week treatment period. Different lots may not be mixed for a single infusion. 7.1.2 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR USE Specific information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, AEs, and other pertinent information on the investigational product that may impact CCI"

For intravenous application only. Potential complications can often be avoided by ensuring thatpatients : are not sensitive to human normal Ig by initially injecting the product slowly (with regards to the infusion rate, relevant section of the study protocol must be strictly followed); are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. In particular, patients naive to human normal Ig, patients switched from an alternativ e IVIg product or when there has been a long interval since the previous infusion should be monitored at the hospital during the first infusion and for the first hour after the first infusion, in order to detect potential adverse signs. All other patients should be observed for at least 20minutes after administration. In all patients, IVIg administration requires: adequate hydration prior to the initiation of the infusion of IVI g; monitoring of urine output; monitoring of serum creatinine levels; avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics. In case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped. The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the adverse reaction. Infusion reaction Certain severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (e.g. headache, flushing, chills, myalgia, wheezing, tachycardia, lower back pain, nausea, and hypotension) may be related to the rate of infusion. The recommended infusion rate given in the study protocols must be closely followed. Patients must be closely monitored and carefully observed for any symptom s throughout the infusion period. Adverse reactions may occur more frequently: in patients who receive human normal Igfor the first time or, in rare cases,"

Protocol Code KIG10_US3_PID01 Version 4,30-November-2020 Amendment 2 to Version 2, 17 -January-2019 Confidential when the human normal Ig product is switched or when there has been a long interval since the previous infusion; in patients with an untreated infection or underlying chronic inflammation. Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions are defined according to Gell and Coomb’s classification which categorizes hypersensitivity reactions into four subtypes (Uzzaman A, 2012). Hypersensitivity reactions are rare. Anaphylaxis can develop in patients who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin . In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.Thromboembolism There is clinical evidence of an association between IVIg administration and thromboembolic events such as myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident (including stroke), pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis which is assumed to be related to a relative increase in blood viscosity through the high influx of Ig in at- risk patients. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) isdefined as an acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia and detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values with at least 1 value above the 99 thpercentile upper reference limit and at least 1 of the following (Thygesen K, 2018): Symptoms of myocardial ischemia New ischemic ECG changes Development of pathological Q waves Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy (not for types 2 or 3 MIs) Caution should be exercised in prescribing and infusing IVIg in obese patients and in patients with pre -existing risk factors for thrombotic events (such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic episodes, patients with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disor ders,"
67,page_67,"Confidential Page 68 of 115Kedrion S.p.A. Protocol Code KIG10_US3_PID01 Version 4,30-November-2020 Amendment 2 to Version 2, 17 -January-2019 Confidential patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, severely hypovolemic patients, patients with diseases thatincrease blood viscosity). In patients at risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions, IVIg products should be administered at the minimum rate of infusion and dose practicable. Acute renal failure Acute renal failure isdefined according to AKIN/KDIGO criteria (Thomas ME, 2015). Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients receiv ing IVI g therapy. In most cases, risk factors have been identified, such as pre- existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypovolemia, overweight, concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products or age over 65. Renal parameters should be assessed prior to infusion of IVIg , particularly in patients judged to have a potential increased risk for developing acute renal failure, and again at appropriate intervals. In patients at risk for acute renal failure, IVIg products should be administered at the minimum rate of infusion and dose practicable. In case of renal impairment, IVI gdiscon tinuation should be considered. While reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of many of the licensed IVIg products containing various excipients such as sucrose, glucose and maltose, those containing sucrose as a stabiliser accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number. In patients at risk, the use of IVI g products that do not contain these excipients may be considered. Aseptic meningitis syndrome Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) isdefined as meningeal inflammation - i.e. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis ≥5 cells/mm3 -not related to an infectious process (Tattevin P, 2019). Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported to occur in association with IVIg treatment. The syndrome usually begins within several hours to 2 days following IVIg treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per mm 3, predo minantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/d L. AMS may occur more frequently in association with hig h-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg treatment."
68,page_68,"Confidential Page 69 of 115Kedrion S.p.A. Protocol Code KIG10_US3_PID01 Version 4,30-November-2020 Amendment 2 to Version 2, 17 -January-2019 Confidential Patients exhibiting such signs and symptoms should receive a thorough neurological examination, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. Discontinuation of IVIg treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae. Haemolytic anaemia IVIg products can contain blood group antib odies that may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells (RBCs) with Ig, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction (Coombs’ test) and, rarely, hemolysis. Hemolytic anaemia can develop subsequent to IVIg therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration. IVIg recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hemo lysis. Neutropenia A transient decrease in neutrophil count and/or episodes of neutropenia, someti mes severe, have been reported after treatment with IVIgs. This typically occurs within hours or days after IVIg administration and resolves spontaneously within 7 to 14 days. Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) In patients receiving IVIg, there have been some reports of acute non- cardiogenic pulm onary oedema TRALI. TRALI is characterised by severe hypoxia, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, cyanosis, fever and hypotension. Symptoms of TRALI typically develop during or within 6 hours of a transfusion, often within 1- 2 hours. Therefore, IVIg recipients must be monitored for and IVIg infusion must be immediately stopped in case of pulmonary adverse reactions. TRALI is a potentially life -threatening condition requiring immediate intensive- care-unit management. Interference with serological testing After the administration of Ig the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient’s blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g., A, B, D may interfere with some serological tests for red cell antibodies for example the direct antiglobulin test ( DAT, direct Coombs ’test)."

Patient s meeting criteria for positive blood culture but without 2 or more of the sepsis criteria listed above will be classified as having bacteremia. cA blood culture positive for growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria meningitides , or Haemophilus influenzae , in combination with CSF leukocytosis and/or glycorrhachia, can serve to confirm the diagnosis of acute bacterial menin gitis. dFor the diagnosis of pneumonia in adults, commonly at least 2 of the listed symptoms and/or signs should be present in conjunction with at least one laboratory and one imaging studies diagnostic element. However, for the purposes of counting serious infect ion episodes in a clinical trial of IVIg, the finding of a new pulmonary infiltrate with consolidation on chest x -rayis considered sufficient. To establish the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia for pediatric patients, most of the same diagnostic criteria l isted may be used, with the following exceptions: Because pediatric patient s may not produce a sputum specimen for culture, blood cultures or serology may be substituted to identify the etiologic bacterial pathogen. In infants age 3 to 24 months, fever is defined as a rectal temperature >38.3ºC (101ºF). In children > 2 years, fever is more commonly defined as a rectal temperature > 38ºC (100.4ºF). In pediatric patient s, elevations of WBC counts > 15,000/mm3are frequent but could be variable in patient s with bacterial pneumonia, or leukopenia with WBC count < 5000/mm3may be observed, usually associated with severe infection. e A deep expectorated sputum gram stain is recommended to demonstrate the presence of microorganisms on examination of 10 -20 oil i mmersion microscopic fields and < 10 squamous epithelial cells and > 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes at 10X low power magnification to determine suitability of sputum culture. 8.1.2 IgGLEVELS During the clinic visit the pre-infusion IgG levels will be evaluated.

SAFETY REPORTING RUL ES 9.1 DEFINITIONS 9.1.1 ADVERSE EVENT /ADVERSE DRUG REACTIO N An AEis “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment’’ Directive 2001/20/EC. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AnADR is “any untoward and unintended responses to an IMPrelated to any dose administered .”The definition of ADR covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and abuse of the product. The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and KIg10. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 9.1.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS A SAE is “any AE that, at any dose: results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizati on, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect .” These characteristics/consequences have to be considered at the time of the event. For example, regarding a life-threatening event, this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Some medical events may jeopardise the patient or may require an intervention to prevent one of the above characteristics/consequences. Such events (hereinafter referred to as ‘important medical events’) should also be considered as ‘serious’ in accordance with the definition."

Protocol Code KIG10_US3_PID01 Version 4,30-November-2020 Amendment 2 to Version 2, 17 -January-2019 Confidential A non-serious AEis an AE that does not meet the above criteria. 9.1.3 UNEXPECTED ADVE RSE DRUG REACTIONS An unexpected adverse reaction is an “adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s brochure for an unauthorized investigational product or summary of product characteristics for an authorized product). ’’ Reports which add significant information on the specificity, increase of occurrence, or severity of a known, already documented serious adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. 9.1.4 CAUSALITY CORRELAT ION The Investigator should evaluate the association between the AE and the on-going treatment using information found in the Investigator ’s Brochure in conjunction with the patient ’s pre -existing medical conditions and concomitant medications and the tim ing of the AE relative to the administration of KIg10. Any AE will be reported as “Related” or “Not Related” to KIg10 in accordance with the following definitions, elaborated from those of the World Health Organization: Related: Any event which falls into one of the below definitions (certain, probable or possible), it should be considered as “Related” to study drug. Certainly Related A clinical event (including laboratory test abnormalities): occurring in a plausible time relationship to drug administration ; which cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs; which response to withdrawal of the drug (de- challenge) is clinically plausible ; which must be definitively associated pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfac tory “re -challenge” procedure, if necessary ."

Protocol Code KIG10_US3_PID01 Version 4,30-November-2020 Amendment 2 to Version 2, 17 -January-2019 Confidential Probably related: A clinical event (including laboratory test abnormalities): with reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug; unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemic als; which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (de- challenge) ; “re-challenge” information is not required to fulfilthis definition. Possibly related: A clinical event (including laboratory test abnormalities): with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug; which could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals ; information on drug withdr awal may be lacking or unclear . Not related: An event for which sufficient information exists to conclude that the etiology of the event is unrelated to KIg10. Please note that this definition is intended to be used when the exclusion of drug causality of a clinical event is supported by the existence of an alternative cause (e.g.,concomitant medications, medical history , concomitant diseases, disease under study, or other) which should be clearly specified with additional details. If a possible correlation cannot be excluded, the definition to be used is “Related .” 9.2 REPORTING METHODS Any serious andnon-serious AE must be communicated to Kedrion or its designee .

The data collected on this secure website are assimilated into an electronic data capture (EDC) system. The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks. The Investigator or designated delegate must review data entered and electronically sign the eCRFs to verify their accuracy. Access to the EDC for data entry or review will require training and distinct individual access code assignments to those site staff members who will be entering study data and those involved in study oversight who may review study data. Data are collected within the EDC system, to which the Sponsor and site monitors have exclusively “read only” access. 12.2 DATA CLARIFICATION The Investigator must review and electronically sign the eCRFs to verify their accuracy. Correction to data on eCRFs will be tracked via an audit trail within the web based EDC system. Each correction will be identified by the person making the change and will include time, date, and reason for change. If corrections are made to a previously and electronically signed e CRF, the Investigator must confirm and endorse the changes. As part of the conduct of the trial, the Sponsor may have questions about the data entered by the site, referred to as queries. All corrections and clarifications will be entered into the EDC system and will be identified by the person entering the information, the reason for the change, as well as the time of the changes made. If changes are made to a previously and electronically signed eCRF, the Investigator must confirm and endorse the changes. 12.3 DATA PROTECTION Spon sorand its designee respect the patient s’ rights to privacy and will ensure the confidentiality of their medical information in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations."

The Investigator is responsible for maintaining a patient ID log. This confidential patient ID code provides the link between named patient source records in the patient file and anonymous CRF data provided to Sponsor . The Sponsor requires that each Investigator retain all study related documents for a minimum of 25 years after the study completion ( last patient last visit )in alignment with the current applicable guidelines. If the study is discontinued, or if no application/license is to be filed or if the application/license is not approved for such indication, records should be retained for 25years after the investigation is discontinued or as per local regulations, whichever is longer. The Investigator could be relieved of this responsibility by transferring the documentation custody to another person who is a member of the trial center and who will accept the conservation responsibility. In this case the Sponsor should be informed about the custody transfer, preferably within 10 days from the date of transfer. It is prohibited for study documents to be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor . Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party, or move them to another location, the Sponsor must be notified in writing."

To enable the use of data, the Investigator should supply the Sponsor with the complete results of the tests, all the study data and the access to all study documents. Asthe exclusive owner of the results obtained, the Sponsor acknowledges the importance of the diffusion of medical data and, therefore, encourages their publication on reputed scientific journals and the diffusion during seminars and conferences. The Investigator may publish the trial results only following the relative authorization from the Sponsor. The eventual absence of the Sponsor authorization should be adequately motivated. Any results of the medical research on Kedrion’s products and/or the publication/oral diffusion/relevant manuscripts will be examined and discussed by the Investigator and Kedrion representative 60 days before the submission for the publication or presentation during a conference. The due diligence should be offered to the Sponsor’s legitimate interests, or the paternity of the manuscript, obtaining an excellent patent protection, coordinating and keeping the exclusive nature of the submission to the health authorities, coordinating with other studies on- going in the same area , and protecting the confidential data and information. The Sponsor should receive the copy of each publication proposed. Kedrion’s comments should be issued without any exceeding delay and not beyond 60 days. In case of publication or presentation of the material of multicentre clinical trials, Kedrion should act as a coo rdinator and referee. The individual Investigators of a multicentre trial cannot publish or submit data which are considered to be common to such a study without the consent of the other Investigator s and the previous review of Kedrion. In the case of a disagreement between the participants in the multicentre trial, Kedrion will be the final arbiter. Kedrion’s comments should be issued with no extra delays. Whenever they are not accepted, the senior author of the manuscript and the Kedrion’s representatives should meet to discuss and find a common position for the final written text and/or the character of the publication. The above mentioned procedure also applies to data pertaining to prematurely discontinued or not completed studies. The results of the Investigator s can be divulged to third parties fr omthe trial team only with the paper version and only after Kedrion’s approval .

The changes to the protocol may be performed only after consultation and agreement with the Sponsor and the Investigator . The only exception is when the Investigator deems that the patients’ safety may be impaired without an immediate action. In these cases, the immediate approval of the IRB/IEC should be required and the Investigator should inform the Sponsor and the Competent Authority within 5 working days after the occurrence of the eme rgence. All the changes thathave an impact on the risk of the patients or on the objectives of the study or require a change of the Informed Consent should receive the approval of the IRB/IEC before their implementation. An administrative change of a study protocol is a minor correction or clarification that has no significant impact on the way the clinical study is to be conducted and no effect on patient safety (e.g., change of telephone number(s), logistical changes). Protocol amendments must be approve d by the Sponsor , health authorities where required, and the IRB/ IEC."
