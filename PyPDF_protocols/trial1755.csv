Protocol SAR-202 V7, 09 November 2018 Page 12 of 61 Confidential 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH), characterized by an increase in the size of the prostate, is a complex and progressive disease common in aging men. An estimated 50% of men have BPH by the age of 60 years, and 90% by age 85 [ Berry et al 1984; Roehrborn 2005 ]. Men with BPH have increased prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) which may require treatment and potentially surgery. In addition, a very large proportion of this patient pop ulation with symptomatic BPH have other symptoms such as sexual dysfunction that have been shown to increase with advancing age [ Rosen et al 2005]. Mechanical obstruction by the enlarged prostate, dynamic obstruction cau sed by the tone of the prostatic smooth muscle and the reaction of the bladder are thought to contribute to the symptoms of BPH [ Roehrborn 2005]. Men with BPH may experience lower urinary tract symptoms and serious compli cations of urethral obstruction [ Hollingsworth & Wilt 2014 ]. Histologically, BPH is characterized by an increased number of both epithelial and stromal cells in the periurethral area of the prostate. It is understood tha t androgens, growth factors, neurotransmitters and other cell interactions play a role in the development of this condition [Cunha et al 2004]. Approved medical therapies for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of BPH include three drug classes: (1) selective alpha -blockers such as terazosin, tamsulosin, doxazosin, and silodosin (2) 5 -α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) finasteride and dutasteride 3) phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor ( PDE5i), tadalafil. While alpha-blockers and PDE5i’s provide rapid relief in the form of improved urinary flow rate, their effects do not reduce the overall risk of BPH -related complications. It is known that androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a key role in development of BPH, and that block ade of this signaling decreases prostate volume and BPH related urinary tract symptoms. 5-ARIs (finasteride and dutasteride) impact the underlying disease by affecting dihydrotesterone, the primary androgen involved in normal and abnormal prostate growth. Through this inhibition, prostate size is decreased, thereby reducing the risk of acute urinary retention and BPH -related surgery while providing symptom control [ Andriole et al 2004; Smith & Carlson 2009 ]. Therefore, actively decreasing the size of the prostate through reduction of androgen signaling arguably plays an important role in the reduction of long -term risks associated with BPH progression. Targeting the AR may therefore provide a reasonable therapeutic appro ach for treatment of BPH. OPK-88004 acts as an oral, tissue -selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), with antagonist effects on the prostate while providing anabolic effects on body composition. In vitro research studies have demonstrated tissue sele ctivity of OPK-88004 on the human AR (hAR). The proposed mechanisms for the tissue selectivity of SARMs include the role of 5α -reductase, tissue-specific expression of co -regulators, differences in the complexes formed by the AR in anabolic and androgenic tissues, and the tissue -specific role of intracellular signaling cascades [Narayanan et al 2008]. Nonclinical and clinical data supports the use of OPK -88004 to treat the signs and symptoms of BPH in men. In vitro and animal data support that OPK -88004 serves as a potential antagonist to testosterone on the prostate and at similar doses provides anabolic activity on muscle and bone."
12,page_12,"OPK -88004 Transition Therapeutics Ireland Ltd. Protocol SAR -202 V7, 09 November 2018 Page 13 of 61 Confidential In an orchidectomized rat model treatment with OPK -88004 at 3 to 30 mg/kg/day in the pr esence of testosterone demonstrate that OPK -88004 antagonizes the androgenic effects of testosterone on the prostate by decreasing prostate and seminal vesical weights. Further, in chronic toxicology studies OPK -88004 decreased prostate weight in naïve, n on-orchidectomized rats and dogs. The loss in weight was more pronounced in dogs relative to rats. In dogs treated with doses from 3 to 300 mg/kg/day, a decrease of 60 -80% in prostate weight was associated with prostate atrophy at 6 and 12 months. These observations were supported in a phase 2 trial, where treatment of elderly men for 12 weeks at 5 mg daily showed a trend of decrease in PSA levels. These data suggest that OPK -88004 acts as a selective androgenic antagonist on the prostate. The treatment with OPK -88004 may be expected to improve lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH and reduce the risk of urinary retention by affecting the excessive growth of the prostate. In a gonadectomized rodent model, OPK -88004 demonstrated anabolic effects on muscle and osteoanabolic properties on bone mass and biomechanical strength. In a multipl e dose trial, healthy subjects exposed for 28 days to OPK -88004 demonstrated clinically and statistically signiﬁcant increases in LBM and calf area. This was accompanied by changes in bone biochemical biomarkers consistent with a bone anabolic increase. In a phase 2 trial in men with ED, OPK -88004 has shown improvement on body composition parameters including lower extremity muscle strength and power, LBM and fat mass after 12 weeks of treatment. The concomitant effect of OPK -88004 on LBM and muscle stre ngth may decrease loss of physical function and fatigue common in older men with BPH. Human clinical studies show an acceptable safety profile for OPK -88004 in that observed effects were considered monitorable and reversible. Development of an androgen tha t can effectively treat the distressing symptoms of BPH and improve body composition changes would be an innovative clinically beneficial therapeutic option for men with moderate to severe BPH -LUTS and enlarged prostate. As the US population ages both the incidence and prevalence of BPH is increasing and subsequently there is a greater need for suitable treatment options [ Parsons 2010 ]. 1.2 Nonclinical Studies OPK -88004 is a potent and selective modulator of the hAR with no significant cross reactivity against other nuclear hormone receptors. In toxicology studies, OPK -88004 was generally well tolerated for up to 6 months in rats and for up to 12 months in dogs, with no compound -related mortality or adverse clinical signs. OPK -88004 demonstrated no drug -related effects at doses up to 1000 mg/kg in gastrointestinal (GI), renal, pulmonary, and cardiovascular function studies. OPK -88004 -induced pharmacological effects are consistent with agonist activity on the AR in repeat -dose toxicological studies. Noteworthy effects of OPK -88004 included reversible changes in the reproductive cycle and in reproductive tissues of males and females. Functional effects related to these changes in rats included reduced sperm count, decreased f ertility, and reduced embryo viability. OPK -88004 was teratogenic in mice. Overall, treatment -related findings were, in general, consistent with effects on androgen -responsive tissues and alterations in the hypothalamic -pituitary -gonadal (HPG) axis and r eproductive cycling.

OPK -88004 was negative in a battery of genotoxicity tests. 1.3 Previous Human Experience To date, six clinical trials have been completed with OPK -88004, five phase 1 clinical trials and one phase 2 clinical trial. A total of 353 subjects have been exposed to OPK -88004 of which 200 subjects have received concurrent doses of OPK -88004 and tada lafil (5 mg and 10 mg tablet) once a day. Across these studies, OPK -88004 was well tolerated with a satisfactory safety profile at single doses up to 1000 mg, at multiple doses up to 75 mg for 28 days and at 5 mg for 12 weeks. Once -daily treatment of com bination of OPK -88004 with 5 mg and 10 mg tadalafil for 12 weeks was also well tolerated with a satisfactory safety profile. Potential reproductive effects were monitored clinically by sperm evaluation in the phase 2 trial. Treatment differences across the treatment groups were not considered to be cli nically meaningful. In clinical studies, OPK -88004 showed improvement on body composition parameters. In a multiple dose study healthy subjects exposed for 28 days to OPK -88004 demonstrated clinically and statistically signiﬁcant increases in LBM and calf area. This was accompanied by changes in bone biochemical biomarkers consistent with a bone anabolic increase. Empirical pharmacodynamics models demonstrated a positive exposure -response relationship for LBM and N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type 1 (P1NP). In a phase 2 trial, OPK -88004 showed improvement on body composition parameters, lower extremity muscle strength and power, LBM, fat mass and bone mineral density and biochemical biomarkers after 12 weeks of treatment. Significant increase in LBM and lower extremity muscle power (measured by the stair climb) was observed at the 5 mg dose. Results from clinical studies completed to date suggest that OPK -88004 acts as a selective AR modulator with antagonist effect on the prostate and agonist e ffects on some tissues, supporting the data generated in animal models. 1.4 Rationale for the Study OPK -88004 has demonstrated the potential to reduce prostate size that can prevent progression of LUTS secondary to BPH and reduce the risk of urinary retentio n.

Protocol SAR -202 V7, 09 November 2018 Page 15 of 61 Confidential concomitant effect of OPK -88004 on LBM and muscle strength may decrease loss of physical function and fatigue common in older men. Human clinical studies show a favorable safety profile for OPK -88004 in that observed effects were con sidered monitorable and reversible. These findings formed the basis for the proposed evaluation of OPK -88004 as a treatment for the signs and symptoms associated with BPH. In this first trial for this indication , the effects of OPK -88004 on PSA will be assessed in a BPH patient population with PSA levels of >1.5 ng/mL and prostate volumes >40 cm3 and <80 cm3 and signs and symptoms of BPH. Serum PSA levels and safety parameters will be the primary endpoints. The trial will evaluate the safety of two doses of OPK -88004 on this patient population . The trial is doub le- blinded to permit assessment of more subjective markers of safety compared to placebo treatment . Information available for the 5 -ARI dutasteride suggest s that effects on prostate volume may be observed within three months of treatment. The length of t reatment in this trial (16 weeks) is thus adequate to observe changes in PSA, reflecting changes in prostate volume . 1.4.1 Rationale for Dose Selection Based on nonclinical and clinical data on effect of OPK -88004 on prostate size, clinical doses selected to be administered in this trial are 15 mg or 25 mg daily for 16 weeks . These doses are expected to result in a clinically meaningful reduction in PSA levels and prostate size . A reduction in prostate volume of ≥15% has been reported to be associated with clinically significant improvement in clinical scores and maximum urinary flow rate [Gormley GJ 1992 ]. Prostate size has not been measured in previous clinical trial s with OPK -88004, however PSA data obtained from clinical studies support the selected dose levels. A trend of decrease in PSA levels relative to placebo was observed in healthy males exposed to OPK -88004 at doses of 15 and 25 mg daily for 4 weeks (study GPBC). In study GPEC, treatment of elderly men with OPK -88004 at 5 mg daily showed a trend of decrease in PSA levels in those subjects with baseline levels of PSA ≥2.5 ng/mL, indicative of prostate hyperplasia. There was no effect in this study of 1 mg O PK-88004 following 12 weeks treatment. Population PK modeling showed that dose levels of 15 and 25 mg w ill provide sufficiently separated exposure profiles . For all of the safety pharmacology, general toxicology and reproductive toxicology studies, safety margins of at least 4-fold are in place with the exception of developmental toxicity in mice, which is 0 .6-fold.

Approximately 115 men with BPH will be enroll ed in the study, randomized 1:1:1 across three arms (placebo, OPK -88004 15 mg, or OPK -88004 25 mg). The trial will be conducted at approximately up to 35 sites within the US. The study duration for individual subjects will be up to 24 weeks and will incl ude three phases:  a screening period ( up to 4 weeks , including 1 -week washout if required) ,  a treatment period (16 weeks) , and  a follow -up period (4 weeks) The design for study SAR -202 is illustrated in Figure 1 . Figure 1 Study Design for SAR -202 Study procedures and timing are outlined in the Study Event Schedule ( Appendix 1 ). Subjects will be r andomized and receive their first dose of study drug at visit 2. They will begin the once daily oral dosing regimen and return every 4 weeks to the study site during the 16 -week treatment period. Assessments during the study period will include vital signs, laboratory testing, weight, adverse events (AEs), concomitant drugs, and study drug compliance. Efficacy assessments will include serum PSA, LBM and fat mass by DXA scans , CCI"

Protocol SAR -202 V7, 09 November 2018 Page 18 of 61 Confidential 3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group The study is designed to evaluate the effect on PSA, safety and PK of OPK -88004 doses for 16 weeks. Prostate volume will be assessed indirectly by PSA level . Results from the MTOPS (Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms) and CombAT studies [McVary 2005; Roehrborn et al 2010 ] suggest that men with larger prostate volume may experience earlier LUTS improvement with 5 -ARI therapy, so subjects with prostate volume >40 and <80 cm3 will be investigated in this phase 2 trial. Safety measures including AEs, clinical laboratory measurements (lipids, chemistry, hematology, coagulation, HbA1c, fasting glucose and insulin, hormone panel, CRP, and urinalysis), physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs and semen analysis will be obtained. A sparse sampling strategy is employed to assess the PK of OPK -88004 in this patient population. The primary efficacy endpoint in this trial is PSA levels, an indirect measure of prostate volume, after 16 weeks treatment. Size is the most sensitive marker for an effect on the prostate, and reduct ion in prostate volume is believed to underlie improvement in urinary flow and associated symptoms. This study has been designed to provide over 80% power to detect a 30% reduction of PSA from baseline for any OPK -88004 dose when compared with placebo. Experience with the ARIs finasteride and dutasteride suggest that a reduction in prostate size may be measurable within three months after starting treatment, and that the effect increases further and is thereafter maintained with continued treatment, there fore assessment after 16 weeks treatment is appropriate in this initial study to assess effects on PSA. The 16 -week treatment period may also provide data on a variety of secondary and other efficacy endpoints, including measures of body composition . Androgenic effects of OPK -88004 will be assessed by measurements of LBM and fat mass (by DXA). The selected dose levels may have a positive effect on measurements of body composition . 3.3 Study Du ration and Dates The study duration for individual subjects will be up to 2 4 weeks, and will include a screening phase of up to 4 we eks (including 1-week washout if required) , a 16 -week treatment period and a 4-week follow -up period.

Randomized treatment assignment and randomization numbers are assigned via IWRS/IVRS. Randomization is stratified by prostate volume <60 cm3 or ≥60 cm3 and LUTS severity (total IPSS [Q1 -Q7] of <16 or ≥16). Following randomization, study drug will be disp ensed in a double-blind manner. The sponsor and all clinical site personnel ( investigator, pharmacist, etc) are blinded to the treatment group for each subject. Subjects also are blinded to the treatment they receive. 5.2 Description of Treatment(s) OPK-8804 and matching placebo are provided in HDPE bottles with child -resistant closures containing 30 capsules per bottle (see Section 5.9). 5.2.1 OPK-88004 Dosage form: capsule for oral administration Dose strength: 15 mg and 25 mg per capsule Description: size 2 white gelatin capsule Nonactive components: pregelatinized starch, dimethicone Storage conditions: room temperature (15 to 30oC, 59 to 86 oF) 5.2.2 Placebo Dosage form: capsule for oral administration Dose strength: 0 mg per capsule Description: size 2 white gelatin capsule Nonactive components: pregelatinized starch, dimethicone (capsule contents) Storage conditions: room temperature (15 to 30oC, 59 to 86 oF) 5.3 Treatments Administered Study drug should NOT be administered to individuals known to be allergic to any component of the drug. All subjects should be observed for allergic reaction following study drug administration. All allergic reactions will be documented as AEs in the source documents and the electronic case report forms (eCRF). On day 1 (visit 2), eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms, namely 0 mg (placebo), 15 mg or 25 mg OPK -88004. Subjects will receive one bottle of study drug at visits 2, 3, 4 and 5."

The dose may be taken with or without food. At visit s 3 and 5, the subject will take the dose of study medication while at the site in order to facilitate PK sampling. 5.5 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups Enrollment and assignment to investigational product will be accomplished using IWRS/ IVRS (an automated web randomization system) in a 1:1:1 ratio. 5.6 Blinding Capsules used in the study will be identical in appearance to maintain double -blind status. Study drug will be managed using IVRS/IWRS. Each user will have a unique username and passcode to access the system. In an emergency, when knowledge of the treat ment assignment for the subject is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject, the Investigator may unblind the subject. Prior to unblinding, the investigator should make every effort to contact the sponsor or designee before proceedi ng with the unblinding process if possible. If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded without sponsor or designee’s prior knowledge, the sponsor must be notified immediately. Each site will be provided with a sealed envelope containing a six -digit code that can be entered into the IVRS/IWRS to unblind a subject’s treatment assignment. To preserve the double -blinding of the study a minimum number of sponsor personnel will have access to the randomization scheme and treatment assignments before the study is complete. The investigator will be blinded to post-randomization laboratory values for HDL-C, hematocrit, hemoglobin, testosterone (total and free), and PSA. PSA increases from baseline >1.4 ng/mL and hematocrit values >54 % will be flagged to investigators. 5.7 Concomitant Therapy Treatment with medications that are excluded in the entry criteria is not permitted. None of the excluded medications may be taken during the study without the approval of the in vestigator and sponsor. Since OPK-88004 is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, inhibition of this enzyme may result in increased plasma drug conce ntrations. As such, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 is prohibited. A list of prohibited medicat ion is provided in Appendix 2. Doses of other prescription medications for treatment of concurrent medical conditions should remain stable during the study whenever possible. If the need for additional concomitant medication arises, inclusion or continuation of the patient may be at the discretion of the investigator after consultation with the sponsor - designated medical monitor."

A detailed medical history, vital signs (include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate), height, weight and 12-lead ECG will be obtained at visit 1. 6.2 ECG Collection and Reporting For each patient, 12 -lead ECGs will be collected a ccording to the schedule of events (Appendix 1). 12-lead digital ECGs will be obtained after 10 minutes in supine rest. Whenever vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments should occur in the following order: 12 -lead ECG, vital signs, and then blood draws. Skin preparation should be thorough and electrodes should be placed according to standard 12 -lead ECG placement. ECGs will be digitally recorded and printed on paper. The printed paper ECG will be used for “real time” bedside ECG assessment by the invest igator (or designee) who will be responsible for the overall interpretation, determination of the clinical significance, and subject eligibility based on the ECG findings. ECG interpretation categories are: Normal ECG, Abnormal ECG – not clinically signif icant, Abnormal ECG – clinically significant ECG. The original ECGs will be retained in the subject’s records at the site. All digital ECG records will also be submitted to the cardiovascular core lab, which will perform the digital ECG analysis and inte rpretation in this study using standard methodology. If the central reviewer identifies an abnormality, per the study alert criteria, the investigator will be notified who will review the ECG and report any AEs as necessary. The following variables will b e reported: HR, RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcB, and QTcF intervals. The investigator may add extra 12 -lead ECG safety assessments if there are any abnormal findings or if the investigator considers it is required for any other safety reason. 6.3 Semen Analysis A semen analysis (total sperm count, sperm concentration, sample volume and pH, sperm motility and morphology ) will be performed at baseline (visit 2) and at the end of treatment (visit 6) or early termination (ET) for subjects willing and able to produce a measu rable semen sample. Local procedures will be followed. A follow-up semen analysis at 3 months post-treatment will be done in those subjects with a decrease in sperm concentration >50% from baseline. 6.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests 6.4.1 Laboratory Parameters Clinical laboratory tests to be assessed are indicated in Table 1."

Additional blood draws may be needed for unscheduled visits. Single redraws for samples resulting in values outside eligibility criteria ranges may be performed during screening, a nd the medical monitor may be consulted as necessary. Missed samples should be drawn whenever possible, and laboratory samples not collected should be noted as a protocol deviations and reported to the site ’s IRB if necessary (see Section 12.8). The investigator will provide a limited access, temperature monitored space for the study drug and a -20°C or -70°C space for respective ser um and plasma aliquots. Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report . Any clinically significant abnormal results will be reported as an AE (see Section 8.1). Blood samples for PK analyses will be collected from all randomized subjects in accordance with the study schedule. Only samples from subjects assigned to treatment with OPK -88004 will be analyzed for drug conc entration. Date and time of each sample and of the last OPK -88004 dose prior to PK blood draw must be clearly recorded. Drug concentration information that would unblind the study will not be reported to study sites or blinded personnel while the study is blinded. Bioanalytical samples collected to measure investigational product concentration will be retained for a maximum of 1 year following last subject visit for the study. 6.5 Dispensing Study Drug Study drug will be dispensed to the subject at visits 2, 3, 4, and 5 according to instructions supplied by the IWRS/IVRS .

Laboratory values blinded to the investigator (see Section 5.6 and Table 1) will be reviewed by sponsor medical monitor(s) and periodically by the DSMB. The investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of subjects during the study. The investigator remains responsible for following through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatm ent or the study, or that caused the patient to discontinue before completing the study. The subject should be followed until the event is resolved or explained. Frequency of follow -up evaluation is left to the discretion of the investigator. In addition to records of observations made at specific times, unexpected signs and symptoms and concomitant medications will be recorded in the clinical trial records throughout the study. 8.1 Adverse Events All AEs, including SAEs occurring after the subject signs the ICF through the subject’s final visit will be reported and monitored. AEs that occur following first administration of study drug are treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs). Any clinically significant (CS) abnormal laboratory results, physical examination findings, ECGs, and vital signs will be reported as an AE. The investigator is not obliged to follow -up with subjects for AEs or SAEs that begin after study completion, however if an SAE is reported to the investigator after a subject has completed the study, and it is ‘reasonably related’ to the study drug, then the investigator will report it to the sponsor and its IRB. Investigators will be instructed to report their as sessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedures or study drug via the eCRF. 8.1.1 Severity The intensity of the AE will be rated by the investigator as mild, moderate or severe using the following criteria:  Mild: Symptoms causing no o r minimal interference with usual social and functional activities  Moderate: Symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social and functional activities  Severe: Symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities It should be noted that the clinical severity and seriousness of an AE are not synonymous, eg, a severe headache is not classified as serious until it meets the required elements as a n SAE."
34,page_34,"OPK-88004 Transition Therapeutics Ireland Ltd. Protocol SAR-202 V7, 09 November 2018 Page 35 of 61 Confidential The maximum severity attained for each AE reported will be re corded in the eCRFs . 8.1.2 Relationship The investigator decides whether they interpret the observed AEs as either related to disease, to the study medication, study procedure or other concomitant treatment or pathologies. To assess the relationship of the AE to the study drug, the following terminologies are defined:  Definitely related: a d irect cause and effect relationship between the study treatment and the AE is likely. The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration, abates on discontinuation of the drug (dechallenge), and/or is confirmed by reappearance of the reaction on repeat exposure (rechallenge)  Probably related: the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration, abates on discontinuation of the drug (d echallenge), and/or cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state  Possibly related: a cause and effect relationship between the study treatment and the AE has not been demonstrated at this time and is not prob able, but is also not impossible. The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or by other therapies administered to the subject.  Unrelated: the AE is definitely produ ced by the subject’s clinical state or by other therapies administered to the subject. All “related”, “probably related” and “possibly related” AEs and SAEs will be defined as related to study drug. 8.2 AEs of Special Interest (AESI) The following Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) of varying clinical significance will be used to determine the tolerability of OPK -88004 doses selected for this clinical trial. All AESIs should be captured and reported via eCRF. All AESIs that meet the definition of an SAE (Section 8.4) must be reported as an SAE. 8.2.1 Clinical Laboratory Testing for Hematology and Lipids Clinical laboratory testing will be conducted on all subjects as per Schedule of Events (Appendix 1). New abnormal findings or worsening of the baseline conditions detected following treatment visits (visit 2 or later visit ) will be recorded as AESIs on the appropriate eCRF page. 8.2.1.1 Hematology Increase in total number of RBC count will be monitored for potential androgen-induced erythrocytosis. Blinded hematocrit values >54% will be flagged to the investigator and may lead to subject discontinuation (see Section 7.1)."

Protocol SAR-202 V7, 09 November 2018 Page 36 of 61 Confidential 8.2.1.2 Lipid Changes Fasting lipid panel will be monitored for clinically significant changes in lipids (LDL-C, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein A1 etc). HDL-C values are blinded to the investigator. 8.2.2 Cardiovascular Events Deaths (CV and non -CV), nonfatal MIs, and nonfatal strokes that occur during the treatment period or follow-up period will be reviewed by the sponsor-designated medical monitor. Investigative sites will also be asked to report any cases of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or hospitalization for unstable angina to the s ponsor medical monitor as well to ensure that all true stroke and MI events are captured. Cardiovascular event definitions will be based on the Standardized Definitions for Cardiovascular and Stroke Endpoint Events in Clinical Trials and the ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF Expert Consensus Document Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarctio n [Thygesen et al 2012 ]. 8.2.3 ECG After enrollment, if a clinically significant increase in the QT/corrected QT (QTc) interval from baseline or other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline is identified, the subject will be assessed by the investigator for symptoms ( eg, palpitations, near syncope, syncope) and to determine whether the subject can continue in the study. The investigator or qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change in subject management is needed and must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluation. ECGs will be stored at the inve stigation site. Any treatment emergent clinically significant ECG finding should be reported as adverse event in the eCRF. 8.2.4 Semen Analysis Since androgens can impact sperm counts, semen analysis is being performed as baseline and at visit 6/ET in subjects willing and able to produce a measurable semen sample. A follow-up semen analyses at 3 months post -treatment will be done in those subjects with a decrease in sperm concentration >50% from baseline. 8.2.5 Testosterone and Steroidal Androgen Events Subjects will be monitored for fluid retention (edema), sleep disturbances , emotional and psychological effects such as depression and anger, breast enlargement and breast pain, increased acne and increased sex drive (libido). 8.3 PSA Subjects with PSA increase from b aseline >1.4 ng/mL should be re -tested immediately, and if confirmed, repeated in 4 weeks. If this value remains elevated , the subject should be referred to a urologist for further evaluation . The subject may remain on study drug , at the discretion of the investigator. 8.4 Serious Adverse Events An SAE is defined by the investigator or sponsor as any AE oc curring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:"

Protocol SAR -202 V7, 09 November 2018 Page 37 of 61 Confidential  death,  life-threatening AE,  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitaliz ation,  a persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.5 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 8.5.1 Initial Report All SAEs occurring from the time of signed informed consent until 30 days following the last administration of study drug must be reported to Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any AE that meets any of the aforementioned serious criteria). All SAEs that the investigator considers related to study drug occurring after the 30 - day follow -up period must be reported to the sponsor. To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) system for the study. Wh en the form is completed, Medpace Safety personnel will be notified electronically and will retrieve the form.

Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol and the justification for making the change will be described in the statistical analysis plan (S AP) or clinical study report ( CSR ). . The SAP will be finalized before database lock. The clinical SAP will detail the statistical methodology to be used and will outline the statistical programming specifications, tables, and listings. The SAP will desc ribe the variables and populations, anticipated data transformations and manipulations, and other details of the analyses not provided in the protocol. Data from screen failures will not be presented. Data from enrolled subjects will be presented in data listings by treatment group. A subject who is randomized but does not receive study drug will be included in the data listings but excluded from all data summaries. All observed assessments, will be included in the data listings. Continuous data will be presented with number of observations (n), mean, and median , standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum. Frequencies and percentages will be used for summarizing discrete (categorical) data. Data that are reported as missing wi ll be presented as missing in the data listings and treated as missing in all data summaries. No imputations for missing data will be made unless otherwise specified for endpoint derivation. No adjustments for multiplicity will be performed due to the ex ploratory nature of this study. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a two -sided alpha level of 0.05 and/or two - sided 95% confidence interval (CI), unless otherwise stated. 11.2 Determination of Sample Size Approximately 115 subjects will be enrolled in the study, randomized 1:1:1 across three arms (placebo, OPK -88004 15 mg, or OPK -88004 25 mg). The primary efficacy objective is to evaluate the ability of OPK -88004 doses to reduce PSA compared to placebo from baseline to week 16. From historical data, the treatment difference of percent reduction of PSA from baseline to week 16 endpoint between any OPK -88004 dose and placebo is over 30% with common standard deviation <40%. With a sample size of 28 completed subjects per treatment grou p, the power for the test significance of PSA reduction for any OPK -8804 dose compared to placebo is over 80%. A dropout rate of 10% from randomization to study completion is anticipated CCI CCI"

Baselin e and demographic characteristics will be summarized for this population. The Safety Population will include subjects in the Randomized Population who receive at least 1 dose of randomized study medication. All safety analyses will be conducted based on t he Safety Population. The modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population will include all subjects in the Safety Population who have a baseline efficacy measurement and have at least 1 post -randomization measurement for the appropriate efficacy endpoint . The mITT Population is the primary analysis population, and all efficacy analyses will be performed using the mITT Population. The Per -Protocol (PP) Population will include all subjects in the mITT Population who complete the 16 -week, double -blind treatment pe riod without any significant deviations from the protocol procedures. The PP Population will be used to assess robustness of the primary analysis results. A final listing of all subjects to be excluded from the PP Population will be completed prior to unblinding the study database. 11.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group. Categorical variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages. For categorical variables, comparisons between treatment groups will be assessed using a Pearson Chi -Square test. Continuous variables will be summarized by means and SDs. For continuous variables, comparisons between the treatment groups will be performed using a one -way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with treatment as the fixed effect. 11.5 Study Drug Exposure, Compliance, and Concomitant Therapies Concomitant medication/therapy verbatim terms will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary version March 2017E or higher. The number and percentage of subjects taking concomitant medications will be summarized by Anatomical & Therapeutic Chemical classification and preferred term for each treatment group. Listings of all prior and concomitant medications will be pr ovided. Total exposure days to study medication will be summarized by treatment group. Overall percent compliance to study medication, calculated as percent of doses taken relative to doses scheduled to be taken, will be summarized by treatment group. 11.6 Primary E fficacy Analysis The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is :"

This endpoint will be analyzed based on mITT Population. Analysis of the percent change from baseline of PSA to week 16 endpoint will be performed using a MMRM, implemented using SAS® Proc Mixed. The factors in the model will be treatment, prostate volume stratification group, and IPSS stratification group, visit, and the treatment group by visit interactions and ba seline PSA as a covariate. Treatment difference between OPK -88004 doses and placebo at week 16 will be estimated from the MMRM model, as well as confidence intervals and p -values. Sensitivity analysis of the percent change from baseline of PSA to week 16 endpoint will be performed using ANCOVA modeled with treatment, prostate volume stratification group and IPSS stratification group as fixed effects and baseline PSA as a covariate. Additional covariates may be added and will be detailed in the SAP. The efficacy analysis of the primary efficacy variable will be repeated on the PP Population to test the robustness of the analysis on mITT Population. Descriptive statistics by treatment for PSA, and percent change from baseline at the 16 -week endpoint will be presented using all observed data with no imputations and no elimination of patients with protocol violations. The descriptive statistics will be presented by visit. 11.7 Safety Analysis Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for all safety variables, including AEs, clinical laboratory measurements (lipids, chemistry, hematology, coagulation, fasting HbA1c, glucose and insulin, hormone panel, CRP, and urinalysis), vital signs, physical ex aminations, ECGs, and semen analysis.

For each event classification term, the number of subjects experiencing a TEAE with that classification term will be tabulated. The number of subjects experiencing treatment -related TEAEs will also be tabulated. Treatment -related TEAEs are defined as TEAEs that are indicated by the investigator on the CRF to be treatment -related. If a subject reports the occurrence of a particular event more than once, the most severe of those events will be included in the summary tables of TEAEs, and the most severe of the related events will be included in the summa ry tables of treatment -related events. Discontinuations due to TEAEs and SAEs will be listed by subject and summarized by treatment group. Analysis comparing the incidence of TEAEs of particular interest and the incidence of treatment - related TEAEs of pa rticular interest will be performed using Fisher’s exact tests across all groups in the study. Summary statistics will provided by treatment group for clinical laboratory measurements, vital signs, ECGs, and semen analysis at baseline and post -baseline v isits, including the change from baseline to each visit."

Protocol SAR -202 V7, 09 November 2018 Page 51 of 61 Confidential 12.3 Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with GCP (ICH GCP) and all applicable laws and regulations including the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (Edinburgh 2000, with Note of Clarification, Tokyo 2004) and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines . In accordance with applicable country -specific regulations, the sponsor will obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory authority(ies) prior to initiating the study in that country. 12.4 Subject Information and Consent The investigator will obtain a written informed consent form for each subject prior to the performance of any study -related proce dures. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the subject fully understands the nature of the study, potential risks and benefits of participating, including answering any questions the subject may have throughout the study and sharing in a timely manner any new information that may be relevant to the subject ’s willingness to continue participation in the study . The investigator will ensure that the ICF is signed and dated by each subject and that documentation of consent being obtained will b e recorded in the subject’s medical record/source documents. As used in this protocol, the term “informed consent” includes all consent and assent given by subjects . 12.5 Subject Confidentiality Subject confidentiality will be strictly held in trust by the study investigators, their staff, the sponsor and their authorized representatives. This confidentiality includes clinical information relating to participating subjects and their biological sample testing. The study protocol, documentation, data, and a ll other information will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party, without prior written approval of the sponsor. Authorized representatives of the sponsor, contract research organizations (if applicable), study monitors, employees of government authorities (eg , US FDA or other), and IRB members may inspect all study -related documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the subjects in this study. The investigator and clinical study site will permit access to such records. No information that would permit the identification of a specific individ ual will be provided for entry into the study database or study report. Study documentation submitted to the sponsor will identify study participants by study code and initials.

Protocol SAR-202 V7, 09 November 2018 Page 52 of 61 Confidential 12.6 Case Report Forms and Study Records This study will utilize an electronic data capture system for the management of clinical data. Data capture and management will be consistent with applicable ICH/GCP guidelines. All data collected during the study for subjects will be recorded in an individual, subject -specific electronic case report forms (eCRF) as part of an electronic data capture (EDC) system. Access to the electronic sys tem will be restricted and users will only be able to access the system via authorized individual accounts. The sponsor or designee will provide training to the investigative site on the EDC system and eCRFs. All eCRFs will be completed as soon as data are available in the source for each subject. As electronic data capture will be utilized, instructions, training records, and a log will be maintained to identify the designated site personnel who can enter data and/or sign off on an eCRF. A subject eCRF must be completed for each subject who signs a consent form and undergoes randomization. To ensure the quality of the clinical data across all subjects and sites, a Clinical Data Management review will be performed by the sponsor or designee on subject data entered or integrated into the EDC system. During the review, subject data will be checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent discrepancies. In addition, the data will be reviewed for adherence to the protocol, and ICH/GCP. Moreover, all data from external sources, eg, central laboratory and PD processing/analysis will be reconciled with subject eCRF data. To resolve any questions arising from the Data Management review process, data queries and/or data clarification notifications will b e generated via the EDC system for completion and resolution. The investigator will sign and date the indicated places on the eCRF via the EDC system’s electronic signature. These signatures will indicate that the investigator reviewed the data on the eCRF, the data queries, and the data clarifications and agrees with the content. 12.7 Safety Monitoring A study level safety review will be conducted to monitor and assess safety data collected during the study. Specifically, any signs or trends indicating p otential underlying safety issues will be identified. The safety review will be scheduled regularly and reviewed by the sponsor- designated medical monitor. More details will be provided in the safety review team (SRT) plan including the type of safety da ta, frequency of review, and unblinding plan if necessary. The sponsor will monitor safety within time frames mandated by company procedures. The medical monitor will periodically review:  Trends in safety data and laboratory analysis  Serious and non-serious adverse events including adverse events of special interest ( see Section 8.2) In the event that safety monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding the subject or at a group level, the study team will follow the company procedures for unblind ing and safety reporting, respectively."

Protocol SAR -202 V7, 09 November 2018 Page 53 of 61 Confidential 12.7.1 Data Monitoring Committee An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMB) consisting of one statistician and two clinicians with appropriate expertise will monitor the study at regular intervals, and may make recommendations for changes to the conduct of the trial to reflect safety concerns . Specific responsibilities and activities of the DSMB will be defined in the charter to be ratified at the organizational meeting of the DSMB. 12.8 Protocol Deviations Protocol deviations are any intentional or unintentional change from an IRB approved protocol that was not approved by the IRB prior to initiation of the change. The investigator is responsible for ensuring protocol and study compliance by all study staff members. Deviations from protocol will be documented in subjects’ study records. The sponsor requires that all major protocol deviations be reported to the IRB. In addition, the investigator is responsible for adhering to his/her IRB’s protocol deviation reporting requirements. 12.9 Retention of Data The investigator/institution will maintain all CRFs and all source documents that support the subject data collected, and all study documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial and as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement. The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential documents must be retained until at least two years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region or at least two years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be retained for a longer period if requir ed by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If the responsible investigator reti res, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the study, the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new custodian. Under no circumstances shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor. 12.10 Publication and Disclosure Policy Data derived from the study are the exclusive property of the sponsor.
