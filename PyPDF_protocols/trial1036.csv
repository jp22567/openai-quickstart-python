Amendment 2(31 January 2018 ) This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The overall reason for the amendment: The overall reason for the amendment is to remove the interim analysis from the 54135419SUI3002 protocol ; to clarify that Module 3 Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT) is an exploratory objective; to modify the timing of screening procedures in Figure 1 to be consistent with the Time and Events Schedule; to clari fy which potential subjects are not excluded from participation in the 54135419SUI300 2study due to having a positive screening test for prescribed psychostimulants that are permitted during the study ; and updated text regarding the presentation of nasal examination data . Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale: The interim analysis was removed from the 54135419SUI3002 protocol to ensure that the study has sufficient numbers of subjects from key global regions/countries needed to support global health authority registration. Synopsis Overview of Study Design ; 3.1. Overview of Study Design; 11.2. Sample Size Determination; 11.3. Efficacy AnalysesDeleted text stating that a n interim analysis will be conducted w hen 60% of randomized subjects have completed Day 2 of the double -blind phase. Synopsis Statistical Methods; 11. 9. Independent Data Monitoring Committ eeThe follow ing text was deleted from the Synopsis Statistical Analysis section (Interim Analysis subsection): A 2-stage group -sequential design with 1 interim analysis will be implemented to allow for early stopping if there is significant evidence of efficacy or futility based on the interim analysis after 60% of the subjects have been randomized and have completed Day 2 of the double- blind phase. If the study is not stopped based upon the interim analysis, it will be continued until the maximum sample size (224 subjects) has been reached. An external independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will provide recommendations about stopping or continuing the study based on the results of an interim efficacy and safety analysis. Section 11.3, Interim Anal ysis w as removed. As a result, the numbered headings following Section 11.3 w ere updated. Cross -references to Section 11.3 Interim Analysis (in Sections 3.1 [Overview of Study Design] , 11.2 [Sample Size Determination] , 11.3 [Efficacy Analyses] ) were also deleted. The follow ing text was modified in Section 11.9 Independent Data Monitoring Committee (strikeout text deleted): An external Independent Data Monitoring Committee will be established to monitor data on an ongoing basis to ensure the continuing safety of the subjects enrolled in this study.

The committee will meet every 6 months to review safety data and will meet once to review efficacy data after the interim analysis has been com pleted . After the reviews, the IDMC will make recommendations regarding the continuation of the study or, in the case of the interim analysis for efficacy, to either stop the study due to efficacy or futility . The details will be provided in a separate IDMC charter. Synopsis Secondary Efficacy Endpoints; 10.2 Discontinuation of Study Treatment/Withdrawal From the Study ; 11.3. Efficacy AnalysisIn the Synopsis (Secondary Efficacy Endpoints), d eleted text stating that 1 interim analysis for efficacy and f utility will be performed. The follow ing bullet point text w as removed from Section 10.2 Discontinuation of Study Treatment/Withdrawal From the Study : Study is terminated by the sponsor for futility Section 11.4, Efficacy Analysis became Section 11.3 since the Interim Analysis section was deleted. 5. Treatment Allocation and BlindingThe follow ing text was deleted in the Blinding subsection: How ever, if an interim analysis is specified, the randomization codes and, if required, the translation of ran domization codes into treatment and control groups will be disclosed to those authorized and only for those subjects included in the interim analysis. Rationale: Module 3 SIBAT My Current Thinking assessment was changed from a secondary to an exploratory objective as Module 3 My Current Thinking was not designed as a stand -alone endpoint .

Study PopulationText in this section modified as follows (bold text added) for consistency with exclusion criterion #5: Subjects with a recent history (< 6 m onths) of moderate or severe substance or alcohol use disorders will be excluded to ensure the subject’s depression is not attributed to substance or alcohol use (ie, substance -induced depressive disorder). Rationale: The text was updated to amend the duration of hospitalization without the need for discussion with the Sponsor and to clarify that shorter or longer hospitalizations should follow local practice. 9.1.3. Double- blind Treatment PhaseText w as rev ised as follows (bold text added; strikeout text deleted): Subjects will remain in the inpatient psychiatry unit for a recommended duration of 5 days, with shorter or longer hospitalizations permitted if clinically warranted per local standard of care . The discharge decision will be made based upon the investigator’s judgment that the subject is no longer imminently suicidal and meets standard discharge criteria per local practice. Discharge before after less than 5 day s must be discussed and approved by th e sponsor’s medical monitor. The investigator must discuss in advance the need for continued hospitalization beyond 107days and thereafter on a w eekly basis with the sponsor’s medical monitor.

Subjects will then be followed up w eekly for the next two weeks (Days 46 and 53) and every two weeks for the re st of the follow -up period (Days 67 and 90). 3.1. Overview of Study Design, Figure 1Figure 1 has been revised to include remote contacts at Days 28 and 35 during the follow - up phase. Rationale: The text regarding discontinuation of study treatment was m odified to add that if the legal status of a subject changes during the study and the subject’s participation can no longe r be considered voluntary, then he/she will be discontinued from study treatment. 10.2. Discontinuation of Study Treatment/Withdrawal From the Study The follow ing bullet point was added to the list of reasons for which a subject ’s study treatment will b e discontinued: Change in the in -patient hospitalization status from voluntary to involuntary as a result of a judicial or other legal administrative order Rationale: The text regarding discontinuation of study treatment was modified to include worsening of underlying condition as an example of a safety or tolerability reason which would result in discontinuation of study treatment. 10.2. Discontinuation of Study Treatment/Withdrawal From the Study Worsening of underlying condition was added as an example of a safety or tolerability reason which would result in discontinuation of study treatment. Bold text added as shown below : The investigator believes that for safety reasons or tolerability reaso ns (eg, adverse event or worsening of underlying c ondition ) it is in the best interest of the subject to discontinue study treatment Rationale: Exclusion criteria were revised to explicitly specify a detailed list of important medical conditions which are exclusionary.

Epidemiology studies suggest that nearly 60% of those who die by suici de suffer from affective disorders, and at least one-half of people who complete suicide are depressed at the time of their deaths. Although MDD with imminent risk for suicide is a potentially lethal condition that requires immediate intervention, there is no approved treatment. The current standard of care is hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication. However, hospitalization is temporary and not completely effective, and the risk for suicide remains high in the weeks after discharge. Asstandard antidepressants may take up to 4 -6 weeks to exert their full effect, there is a significant unmet therapeutic need for effective drugs with rapid onset of effect. Ketamine and esketamine (the S-enantiomer of ketamine) are approved and widely used for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia via intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) administration. The anesthetic effects of esketamine are attributed to the blockade of ionotropic N-methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors. Janssen Research & Development (JRD) is developing intranasal esketamine as an antidepressant therapy. The mechanism of action of esketamine is distinct from conventional monoaminergic antidepressant treatments, and esketamine profoundly affects fast excitatory glutamate transmission, increases brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, and stimulates synaptogenesis. In addition, a higher NMDA receptor binding affinity of esketamine compared to ketamine allows a lower volume of medication to be administered via the n on-invasive and rapidly -absorbed intranasal route. The current study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine in addition to comprehensive standard of care in subjects with MDD who are at imminent risk for suicide as a pivotal Phase 3 study in support of regulatory agency requirements for registration of intranasal esketamine. OBJECTIVE S, ENDPOINTS, AND HYPOTHESIS Primary Objective The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 mg compared with intranasal placebo in addition to comprehensive standard of care in reducing the sympt oms of MDD, including suicidal ideation, in subjects who are assessed to beat imminent risk for suicide, as measured by the change from baseline on the Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at 24hours post first dose . Key Secondary Objective The key secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of intran asal esketamine compared with intranasal placebo in reducing severity of suicidality as measured by the clinical global impression of severity of suicidality revised version (CGI -SS-R) at 24 hours post first dose. Other Secondary Objectives The other secondary objectives are:  To evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine compared with intranasal placebo in remission of MDD (defined as MADRS total score ≤12) at 4 hours and 24 hours post first dose, and through the end of the double -blind treatment p hase (Day 25).

OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter study . A target of 224 male and female subjects , 18 to 64 years of age, with MDD presenting to an emergency room (ER) or other permitted setting and assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide will be enrolled in this study . The study will consist of a screening evaluation performed within 48 hours prior to the Day 1 intranasal dose (if possible, screening should occur within 24 hours prior to the Day 1 intranasal dose) , immediately followed by a 25-day double -blind treatment phase (Day 1 to 25), and a 65-day follow -up phase (Day 26 to Day 90). The total study duration for each subject will be approximately 13 weeks. On Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase, approximately 224 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatments: intranasal esketamine 84 mg (n = 112) or intranasal placebo (n = 112), admini stered two times per week for 4 weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25). Randomization will be stratified by study center and by the physician’s assessment of the subject’s need of standard of care NCT03097133"

The first dose of study medication will be administered in the ER or other permitted setting, including the inpatient psychiatric unit. All subjects will be treated in the context of comprehensive standard clinical care, including hospitalization and the initiation or optimization of antidepressant treatment, which will be determined by the treating physician(s). The standard of careantidepressant treatment will be initiated or optimized for all subjects on Day 1. After the first dose (ie, starting with the Day 4 dose or later), a one-time dose reduction to intranasal esketamine 56 mg or intranasal placebo is allowed if a subject is unable to tolerate the intranasal esketamine 84 mg or placebo dose assigned at randomization. No further dose adjustment is allowed during the double -blind treatment phase. Dose titration/adjustments of newly initiated or optimized standard of care antidepressant treatment should occur during the first 2 weeks of double -blind treatment (ie, by Day 15), with doses remaining stable thereafter through the end of the double -blind phase (Day 25). During the follow -up phase, the antidepressant treatment will be managed based on clinician’s judgment. Subjects will remain in the inpatient psychiatry unit for a recommended duration of 5 days, with shorter or longer hospitalizations permitted if clinically warranted per local standard of care. Discharge before 5days must be discussed and approved by the sponsor’s medical monitor. Following discharge from the inpatient psychiatric unit, subsequent visits for the double -blind treatment phase will be conducted twice - weekly at an outpatient psychiatric facility through Day 25. During the follow -up phase, subjects will be monitored twice weekly for the first two weeks (Day s 28, 32, 35, and 39) after study drug treatment. Subjects will then be followed up weekly for the next two weeks (Days 46 and 53) and every two weeks for the rest of the follow -up period (Days 67 and 90). Efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetic, biomarker , and pharmacogenomic evaluations will be performed as described in the Time and Events Schedule. The primary efficacy evaluation is the MADRS, the keysecondary evaluation isCGI-SS-R, and other efficacy evaluations include the SIBAT, BHS, EQ -5D-5L, QLDS, and TSQM -9. Safety evaluations include monitoring and collection of adverse events and concomitant therapies, physical examination, nasal examination, body weight, height, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, clinical laboratory tests, SIBAT, MOAA/S, and C ADSS . Blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of esketamine, noresketamine, and other metabolites if warranted. Blood samples will be collected for biomarker evaluations. Pharmacogenomic blood samples will be collected from subjects who consent separately to this component of the study (where local regulations permit). Subject participation in pharmacogenomic research is optional. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will be commissioned for this study.

On Day 1, subjects will be randomized to treatment with either intranasal esketamine 84 mg or intranasal placebo, administered two times per week for 4 weeks. Intranasal treatment sessions should not take place on consecutive days. Food will be restricted for at least 2 hours before each administration of study medication. Drinking of any fluids will be restricted at least 30 minutes before the first nasal spray on each dosing day. If the subject has nasal congestion on the dosing day, an intranasal decongestant can be used to reduce congestion, or with the exception of the Day 1 dose, the dosing day may be delayed (per the permitted visit window; see the Time and Events Schedule). If an intranasal decongestant is used to reduce congestion, it cannot be used within 1 hour prior to intranasal study drug dosing. The first dose of study medication will be administered in the ER or other permitted setting that has appropriate staffing to manage acutely suicidal subjects. If the first dose is administered in the ER, it is recommended that the subject not be transferred from the ER to the inpatient psychiatric unit after the postdose assessments (approximately 4 hours in length) are completed. Subjects who have been admitted directly into the inpatient psychiatric unit due to immi nent risk for suicide or transferred from a medical unit (following medical stabilization for recent suicide attempt) will receive their first dose of study medication in the inpatient psychiatric unit. Subjects will remain in the inpatient psychiatry unit for a recommended duration of 5 days, with shorter or longer hospitalizations permitted if clinically warranted per local standard of care . Following discharge from the inpatient psychiatric unit, subsequent visits for the double -blind treatment phase will be conducted twice -weekly at an outpatient psychiatric facility through Day 25. On all outpatient intranasal dosing days, all subjects must remain at the clinical site until study procedures have been completed and the subject is ready for discharge per clinician’s assessment. The minimum time required for postdose monitoring is 1.5hours. Subjects should be accompanied when released from the clinical study site. Subjects must not drive a car or work with machines for 24 hours after study drug dosing. On each dosing day: Subjects will self-administer 1 spray into each nostril (ie, a total of 2 sprays using 1intranasal device) at each of the following 3 time points: t = 0, 5 minutes and 10 minutes; time = 0 is defined as the time of the first 100-μL spray. Subjects will use a separate intranasal device at each of these 3 time points (ie, a total of 3 devices). Sprays to each nostril should be de livered in rapid succession at the scheduled time points . NCT03097133"

No further dose adjustment is allowed during the double -blind treatment phase. The subject would receive the decreased dose at all remaining dosing days. Standard of Care Antidepressant Treatment All subjects will be treated in the context of comprehensive standard clinical care, including hospitalization and the initiation or optimization of antidepressant treatment, which will be determined by the treating physician(s) based on clinical judgment and practice guidelines. The standar d of care antidepressant treatment (antidepressant monotherapy or antidepressant plus augmentation therapy) will be initiated or optimized for all subjects at the time of randomization on Day 1. Subjects who are on antidepressant monotherapy from Day 1 should remain on antidepressant monotherapy through the end of double -blind phase (Day 25) whereas subjects who are on antidepressant plus augmentation therapy from Day 1will remain on antidepressants plus augmentation therapy through the end of double -blind phase (Day 25). Eligible subjects may or may not be receiving antidepressants at the time of study entry. Dose titration/adjustments of newly initiated or optimized standard of care antidepressant treatment should occur during the first 2 weeks of double -blind treatment (ie, by Day 15), with doses remaining stable thereafter through the end of the double -blind phase (Day 25). Subjects who are currently taking a recently initiated antidepressant treatment at screening (initiated <2 weeks prior) may continue taking the antidepressant at the current dose or at an optimized dose (dose adjustment is allowed during the first 2weeks of double -blind treatment) through the end of the double -blind phase (Day 25), if deemed clinically appropriate by the investigator .During the double -blind treatment phase, the investigator needs to consult with the sponsor’s medical monitor in advance if additional changes on antidepressant treatment are clinically indicated. During the follow -up phase, the antidepressant treatment will be managed based on the clinician’s judgment. EFFICACY EVALUATIONS The primary efficacy evaluation will be the MADRS total score. The assessment will be performed using the Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS. The other secondary and exploratory efficacy evaluations include the SIBAT, BHS, QLDS, EQ-5D-5L, TSQM -9, and HRUQ. PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS Venous blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of esketamine , noresketamine, and other metabolites if warranted. Plasma collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation may additionally be used to evaluate safety or efficacy aspects that address concerns arising during or after the study period. BIOMARKER AND PHARMACOGENOMIC (DNA) EVALUATIONS Blood samples will be collected for exploratory analysis of biomarkers (protein, metabolites, and RNA) related to immune system activity, HPA axis activation, neurotrophi c and metabolic factors. Exploratory analyses may be performed for additional biomarke rs as well. A pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected to allow for pharmacogenomic research, as necessary (where local regulations permit) .Subject participation in the pharmacogenomic research is optional. MEDICAL RESOURCE UTILIZATION Medical resource utilization data, associated with medical encounters, will be collected using the Healthcare Resource Use Questionnaire (HRUQ). The HRUQ includes information regarding utilization NCT03097133"

SAFETY EVALUATIONS Safety evaluations include monitoring and collection of adverse events and concomitant therapies, physical examination, body weight, height, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, pulse oximetry, clinical laboratory tests, and nasal examination . Although the SIBAT will be an efficacy evaluation, it will also inform the safety evaluation to detect potential effects on suicidal ideation and behavior throughout the study. The CADSS will be administered to assess treatment -emergent dissociative symptoms , andthe MOAA/S will be used to measure treatment -emergent sedation. STATISTICAL METHODS Subject Information The primary efficacy and safety analysis se ts are defined below.  Full analysis set: The full analysis set will include all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of double -blind study medication and have both a baseline and a post dose evaluation for the MADRS total score.  Safety analysis set: The safety analysis set will include all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of double -blind study medication. Sample Size Determination The maximum sample size for this study was calculated assuming an effect size of 0.45 for the MADRS total score at 24 hours post first dose (Day 2), a one -sided significance level of 0.025, and a drop -out rate at 24 hours of 5%. Approximately 112 subjects will need to be randomized to each treatment group to achieve 90% power . The effect size used in this calculation was based on results of the ESKETINSUI2001 study where the effect size for the change from baseline to Day 2 was 0.65 (mean difference between treatment groups of -7.2 and a pooled SD of 11.02) for MADRS total score. Given that the ESKETINSUI2001 study was a Phase 2 study carried out in only one country, the maximum sample size for this Phase 3 study was determined using a smaller effect size of 0.45 to allow for greater variability that can be expected for a study conducted globally . Efficacy Analysis Primary Estimand The primary estimand, the main clinical quantity of interest to be estimated in the study, is defined by the following 3 components: Population: subjects with MDD who are at imminent risk of suicide Endpoint: change fro m baseline to 24 hours post first dose (Day 2) in the MADRS total score Measure of Intervention: the effect of the initially randomized treatment that would have been observed had all subjects remained on their treatment until Day 2 of the double -blind ph ase. The primary analysis will be based on the full analysis set and the MADRS total scores collected at Day 2. NCT03097133"

The model will include factors for treatment, center, standard of care antidepres sant treatment (ie, antidepressant monotherapy or an antidepressant plus augmentation therapy), and baseline MADRS total score as a covariate. A point estimate and 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference will be provided. Since subjects are hospitalized at the time of the primary endpoint, it is anticipated that missing data will be infrequent . However, if a subject has a MADRS total score at a time earlier than 24 hours post first dose but does not have the 24 hour value, the earlier value will be used for the primary efficacy analysis .In addition, descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) of the primary efficacy variable will be provided by study center. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The analysis of th e key secondary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline for CGI -SS-R at 24 hours post first dose (Day 2), will be performed using an ANCOVA model on the ranks of change with factors for treatment, center, standard of care antidepressant treatment (ie, antidepressant monotherapy or an antidepressant plus augmentation therapy) and baseline CGI-SS-R (unranked) as a covariate .The treatment difference will be estimated using the Hodges -Lehmann estimate, which is the median of all possible paired differences for the change from baseline for CGI -SS-R at 24 hours. The multiplicity with regard to testing multiple endpoints (the primary and the key secondary) will be controlled by a fixed sequence testing procedure, ie, the key secondary hypothesis will be tested only after the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint is rejected. The secondary efficacy endpoints, proportion of subjects with remission (MADRS total score ≤12) and the proportion of subjects achieving resolution of suicidality (CGI -SS-R score of 0 or 1) at each visit during the double -blind phase will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel chi-square test adjusting for center and standard of care antidepressant treatment (ie, antidepressant monotherapy or antidepressant plus augmentation therapy). Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to the particular visit of the double -blind phase will not be considered to have remission or resolution of suicidality. Changes from baseline over time in MADRS total score, BHS, and QLDS total scores will be analyze d based on last observation carried forward (LOCF) data using an ANCOVA model with treatment, center, and standard of care antidepressant treatment (ie, antidepressant monotherapy or an antidepressant plus augmentation therapy) as factors and baseline valu e as a covariate. Additionally, the change from baseline in MADRS total score at Day 25 will be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with baseline MADRS total score as a covariate, and treatment, center, standard of care antidepressant treatment (ie, antidepressant monotherapy or antidepressant plus augmentation therapy), day, and day-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects, and a random subject effect. Comparison of esketamine versus placebo will be performed using the appro priate contrast. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the treatment differences will be provided. Missing data will be closely monitored and additional sensitivity analyses will be specified in the SAP, if necessary. Ranks ofchanges from basel ine over time for CGI-SS-R and CGI-SR-Iwill be analyzed based on LOCF data using an ANCOVA model with treatment, center, and standard of care antidepressant treatment (ie, antidepressant monotherapy or an antidepressant plus augmentation therapy) as facto rs and baseline value (unranked) as a covariate.

Descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) will be provided for continuous variables and frequency distributions will be provided for categorical variables. Pharmacokinetic Analyses Plasma esketamine and noresketamine concentrations will be listed for all subjects. All concentrations below the lowest quantifiable concentration or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration database. All subjects and samples excluded from the analysis will be clearly documented in the study report. Population PK analysis of plasma concentration- time data of esketamine may be performed using nonlinear mixed -effects modeling. Data may be combined with those of other selected studies to support a relevant structural model. Available baseline subject characteristics (demographics, laboratory variables, genotypes, race, etc.) will be tested as potential covariates affecting PK parameters. For the parameter estimates, the standard error and 95% confidence interval will be provided. This will be determined after the population pharmacokinetic modeling of the data is completed. Details will be given in a population PK analysis plan and the results of the population PK analysis will be presented in a separate report. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses The relationship between MADRS total score (and possibly selected adverse events and additional pharmacodynamic parameters), and PK metrics of esketamine may be evaluated. The results of the pharmacokinetic /pharmacodynamic analyses may be reported separately. Biomarker and Pharmacogenetic Analyses Biomarkers will be tabulated by treatment and summary statistics will be calculated. Posttreatment changes in biomarkers over time will be summarized by treatment group. Associations between baseline levels and changes from baseline in selected biomarkers and clinical endpoints will beexplored. Exploratory analyses may include comparison of biomarker measures between the treatment groups and correlation with baseline and change from baseline biomarker values in the efficacy and other measures. Exploratory analyses may be performed for additional biomarkers. In addition, all biomarker data obtained from this study may also be included in an ongoing cross -study analysis to investigate the relationship between depression severity, phenotypes, and biomarkers. Pharmacogenomic analyses may include candidate gene analyses or genome -wide association analyses in relation to treatment response, non-response, and MDD. Expression analyses may include testing of known messenger RNA/microRNA (mRNA/miRNA) transcripts or transcriptome -wide analysis in relationship to antidepressant treatment response and MDD. Additional exploratory analyses may be performed. Details of the analysis plan and summary of results from both biomarker and pharmacogenomic analyses will be reported separately.

INTRODUCTION Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most prevalent mental health condition and the psychiatric diagnosis most commonly associated with suicide.41,65Epidemiology studies suggest that nearl y 60% of those who die by suicide suffer from affective disorders, and at least one-half of people who complete suicide are depressed at the time of their deaths.2,13,17,51Although MDD with imminent risk for suicide is a potentially lethal condition that requires immediate intervention , there is no approved treatment. The current standard of care is hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medic ation. H owever, hospitalization is temporary andnot completely effective, and the risk for suicide remain shigh in the weeks after discharge . As standard antidepressants may take up to 4-6 weeks to exert their full effect75,79, there is a significant unmet therapeutic need for effective drugs with rapid onset of effect.24 Ketamine and esketamine (the S-enantiomer of ketamine) are approved and widely used for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia via intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) administration. The anesthetic effects of esketamine are attributed to the blockade of ionotropic N-methy l-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors.78Janssen Research & Development (JRD) is developing intranasal esketamine as an antidepressant therap y. The mech anism of action of esketamine is distinct from conventional monoaminergic antidepressant treatments, and esketamine profoundl y affects fast excitatory glutamate transmission, increases brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, and stimulates synaptogenesis.26In addition, ahigher NMDA receptor binding affinit y of esketamine compared to ketamine allows a lower volume of medication to be admin istered via the non -invasive and rapidl y-absorbed intranasal route. For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding esketamine (JNJ-54135419), refer to the latest version of the Investigator's Brochure for esketamine .37 The term ""sponsor"" used throughout this document refers to the entities listed in the Contact Information page(s), which will be provided as a separate document. 1.1. Background 1.1.1. Nonclinical Studies Safety Pharmacology The effects of ketamine on myocardial contractility and blood pressure variedwith species and experimental conditions.37In these studies , the dog was most predictive of the cardiovascular effects of ketamine in man. I n dogs, ketamine produced increase sinarterial blood pressure , heart rate and cardiac output as well as a decrease in total peripheral resistance .43Results from animal studies suggest that the increase in blood pressure produced by ketamine is due to selective activation of central cardiac stimulating mechanisms leading to an increase in cardiac output.43 NCT03097133"

Intranasal administration of esket amine was well tolerated in these studies. No adverse effects were noted in rats or dogs u p to the highest dose tested.37 Neurotoxicity: The neurotoxic potential of intranasal esketamine has been investigated in rats in two single -dose studies and one 14-day study. No neuropathological lesions were noted in the esketamine -dosed rats at the highest dose tested in each stud y.37 Reproduct ive and Developmental Toxicity :In a rat fertility and earlyembry onic developmental study , no adverse effects of intranasal esketamine on the fertility and reproductive capacities of adult males and females were observed.37Rat and rabbit embry o-fetal developmental toxicity studies with intranasall y administered racemic ketamine did not reveal evidence of reproductive toxicity .37However, when monkey fetuses were exposed in utero to high dose levels of racemic ketamine, neurotoxicity was observed.37Intranasal esketamine did not affect pre-and postnatal development in rats; however, high dose levels of racemic ketamine induced neurotoxicity in early postnatal rat pups.37 Genotoxicity: In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies have been performed with ketamine and esketamine, and the overall weight of evidence demonstrates the absence of significant genotoxic risk.37 Abuse potential: The results of self -administration and withdrawal experiments in several animal models suggest that esketamine would have abuse potential in humans.7,20,21,46,57,83,84 1.1.2. Clinical Studies 1.1.2.1. Completed and Ongoing Clinical Studies with Intranasal Esketamine A total of 9 Phase 1 studies with intranasal esketamine have been completed and reported , including 6studies in healthy younger subjects, 2 studies in healthy elderl y and y ounger subjects, and 1 study in subjects with a history of allergic rhinitis .In total , 263 subjects have been exposed to intranasal esketamine in the completed Phase 1 studies that have been reported .37Three additional Phase 1 studies inhealth y subjects have been completed but not reported , and atotal of 6 Phase 1 studies are ongoing in healthy subjects, subjects with hepatic impairment, and subjects with renal impairment. One Phase 2 study has been completed in subjects with MDD who are at imminent risk of suicide with 35subjects exposed to intranasal esketamine.16One Phase 2 study has been completed in subjects with treatment -resistant depression (TRD )with 107 subjects exposed to intranasal esketamine.37In addition, one Phase 2 study in subjects with TRD is ongoing .

Further information about the completed and ongoing studies with esketamine isprovided in the Investigator’s Brochure.37 1.1.2.2. Human Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism Metabolism and Excretion Ketamine (and esketamine) underg oes extensive metabolism by human hepatic cy tochrome P450 (CYP). In humans, N-demethy lation to the active metabolite norketamine is a major route of metabolism. Norketamine had a half-life in plasma of approximately 5 hours in humans .31The major human hepatic cytochromes that catal yze ketamine N-demethylation in vitro were CYP2B6 and CYP3A4,32,68,82and those that were responsible for the formation of norketamine metabolites include dCYP2A6 and CYP2B6.68Pharmacokinetic (PK) results after IV administration of racemic ketamine and esketamine to human subjects suggested that inversion of esketamine to arketamine (the R -enantiomer of ketamine) doesnot occur.29 Racemic ketamine and its metabolites have been shown to be predominantly excreted in the urine. An average of 91% of a dose of ketamine administered to healthy subjects was recovered in urine.18Less than 3% of an administered dose was excreted in urine as parent drug.80 Pharm acokinetics of Intranasal Esketamine The PKof intranasal esketamine have been characterized in healthy adult subjects (elderl y and younger adults) as well as subjects with a history of allergic rhinitis, with TRD37,and with MDD at imminent risk for suicide. In healthy adult subjects, intranasal ly-administered esketamine (28 to 112 mg) was rapidl y absorbed with measurable concentrations at 7minutes after the first spray ; the plasma esketamine maximum concentration and area under the concentration -time curve increased in a dose-related manner following intranasal administration, and the mean terminal half-life of esketamine ranged from 5.86 to 9.83 h ours (ESKETINTRD1001).37When administered in healthy adult subjects via the intranasal route, esketamine wasrapidl y absorbed and had an absolute bioavailability of approximately 48%(ESKTINTRD1009) .37In a Phase 2 study in subjects with TRD (ESKETINTRD2003), there was a dose-dependent increase in mean plasma esketami ne concentrations from subjects in Panel A who were administered 28, 56, or 84mgdoses of intranasal esketamine .37Furthermore, the mean esketamine concentrations in plasma samples collecte d at corresponding timepoints on Days 1, 11 , and 25 were similar suggesting that the PK was consistent after repeated intranasal administration.37The PK result s from subjects with MDD at imminent risk of suicide (ESKETINSUI2001) who received 84 mg doses of intranasal esketamine were consist ent with the PK results in healthy adults and those with TRD.

Efficacy Several small clinical studies and case reports suggest edthat subanesthetic doses of ketamine could improve symptoms of depression within hours even in subjects who responded poorl y to conventional antidepressant s.50Further results from Panel A (conducted in the United States and Belgium) in a Phase 2, 2-panel, double -blind, doubly -randomized, placebo -controlled clinical study in subjects with TRD (ESKETINTRD2003) demonstrated that treatment with intranasal esketamine (28, 56, and 84 mg) rapidly improved clinical sy mptoms of depression at 2 hours and 24 hours aft er the first dose as assessed by the change in Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS )total score from baseline.37In addition, after 1 week of treatment the analysis showed thatall 3 esketamine dose groups were statistically superior to the placebo group using a one-sided significance level of 0.05 ( least squares mean differences [SE] between each esketamine group and theplacebo group were: -4.2 [2.09] , -6.3 [2.07], and -9.0 [2.13] for esketamine 28, 56, and 84 mg, respectively ; p=0.021, p=0.001, and p<0.001 for esketamine 28, 56, and 84 mg, respectively )and that there was a significant relationship between esketamine dose and change in MADRS total score (p<0.001) .37The major secondary analyses of results from Panel Aprovided preliminary evidence suggesting that improvements in depressive symptoms resulting from esketamine treatment could be sustained with repeated dosing for 74days, the duration of the study in Panel A.37In Panel B(conducted in Japan) , subjects were treated with placebo or 14 or 56 mg of intranasal esketamine for up to 25 days. Greater improvements in MADRS total score were observed in the esketamine 56-mg group compared with the placebo group using a one-sided significance level of 0.10 (mean difference [SE]: -3.7 [2.81]; p=0.096), and a dose response was detected during the first week of treatment (p=0.097 ).37Although there was a statistically significant difference between the esketamine 56-mg and placebo groups during the first week of treatment, the results from Panel B must be interpreted with caution due to a significant treatment by baseline MADRS total score interaction during the first week of treatment (p=0.052) , where results favored the placebo group for subjects with higher baseline MADRS total scores and the esketamine groups for subjects with lower baseline MADRS total scores.37 Several pilot studies in subjects with MDD or bipolar depression also suggested that ketamine may reduce suicidal ideation within hours of administration25,47,71,72,85. In addition , three independent randomized, double -blind trials in subject s with MDD suggest edthat doses of IV ketamine could rapid ly decrease suicidal ideation as evaluated byassessment s such as the MADRS Suicidal Thoughts Item (MADRS -SI).5,38,63Recently , a Phase 2,double -blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, proof -of-concept study (ESKETINSUI2001 ) evaluated the efficacy and safet y of intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of the symptoms of MDD, including suicidal ideation . Subjects with a diagnosis of MDD assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide from the United States were random ly assigned to treatment with placebo (n=31) or esketamine 84 mg (n=35) for up to 25 days.16All subjects received comprehensive standard of care treatment including initial hospitalization and optimized antidepressant medication. Esketamine 84 mg compared with placebo demonstrated a clinicall y meaningful and statisticall y significant reduction of depressive symptoms asassessed by changes from baseline in MADRS total score using a two-sided significance level of 0.20 at 4hours after the first dose (primary endpoint; mean difference [SE] between esketamine 84 mg and placebo: -5.3 [2.10]; p=0.015) NCT03097133"

Safety and Tolerability Ketamine was first introduced as an anesthetic in 1963 and is considered to have an excellent medical safety profile.30,45,73,76The following adverse reactions arelisted as very common, common, or frequent occurrences for ketamine and esketamine when administered as an anesthetic : emergence or recovery reactions, elevated blood pressure and pulse rate, stimulation of respiration, nausea, and vomiting.44,78 Short -term Use of Intranasal Esketamine in Subjects with TRD Subjects with TRD in Panel A in Study ESKETINTRD2003 ,received placebo or 28, 56, or 84mg of intranasal esketamine, and subjects in Panel B received placebo or 14 or 56mgof esketamine . All doses of esketamine generally appeared to be tolerated, and no new safet y concerns were raised during the study . There were no deaths during the double -blind or open - label treatment phases. There was 1 death due to completed suicide in Panel B during the follow - up phase of the study , 20days after the subject received the last dose of study medication.37A total of 4 non -fatal serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 3 subjects during the study ; oesophagitis (during placebo treatment), ectopic pregnancy (during esketamine treatment , leading to treatment withdrawal) , general physical health deterioration (follow -up phase) and confusional state (follow -up phase ).37The investigato r assessed the SAE of confusional state as probably related to study medication and SAEs of esophagitis, ectopic pregnancy , and general physical health deterioration, and completed suicide as not related to study medication .In total, 4subjects experience d treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) which led to withdrawal of study medication while receiving esketamine treatment (ectopic pregnancy [described above] , syncope, headache, and dissociative disorder).37The investigator assessed the events of headache and dissociative disorder as very likely related to study medication. The investigator considered theevent of syncope possibly related to the study medication, and the sponsor considered the event of syncope not related to the study medication based on the short half-life of esketamine and the onset of the event of sy ncope .

41,page_41,"JNJ54135419 (esketamine) Clinical Protocol 54135419SUI3002 Amendment 2 42 Status: Approved , Date: 31 January 2018In Panels A and Bcombined , the common TEAEs (≥10% the total esketamine or placebo groups) that occurred more frequently in the total esketamine group compared with the placebo group during the double -blind phase were : dizziness, headache, dissociation, nausea, feeling abnormal, and hypoaesthesia.19A majority ofsubjects in Panels A and B experienced elevations in blood pressure measurements after receiving esketamine doses; the maximum elevations from predos e in blood pressure measurements on each dosing day were observed in most cases within 1 hour post dose, with the majority returning within the normal range by 2 hours postdose.19The blood pressure changes observed did not appear to attenuate over time with multiple doses. A majority of subjects in the esketamine treatment groups in Panels A and B experienced an increase in dissociative symptoms after dosing as assessed using the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS ).Dissociative symptoms peaked at approximately 40 minutes after dosing and typically resolved by 2 h ours after dosing.19The magnitude of postdose dissociative symptoms decreased over time with repeated consecutive doses for all esketamine doses. Short -term Use of Intranasal Esketamine in Subjects with MDD at Imminent Risk for Suicide In the Phase 2 study in subjects with MDD at imminent risk for suicide (ESKETINSUI2001) , the TEAEs reported byesketamine -treated subjects were consistent with the safety profile of esketamine observed in earlier studies. Esketamine 84 mg was generall y tolerated, and no new safet y signals emerged in this population. There were no deaths during the study . There were 4SAEs in the double -blind phase, all in the esketamine 84 mg group.16Three of these events were related to re-hospitalization of subjects with re-emergence of suicidal ideation (n=2) or depression (n=1) in subjects who had improved and had been discharged from the hospital. In all 3instances, the subjects recovered and completed both the double -blind and follow -up phases. One subject experienced anevent of increased agitation , and the study medication was withdrawn. With the exception of re-emergence of depre ssive symptoms, which was considered possibly related to study medication , none of the other SAEs were considered to be related to study medication by the investigator. During the follow -up phase, 5 subjects in the placebo group experienced SAEs , including suicidal ideation (n=1) and attempted suicide (n=3) and cellulitis (n=1), compared with only 1subject in the esketamine group, who experienced suicidal ideation . One subject in the placebo group and 5 subject s in the esketamine 84 mg group discontinued from the double -blind phase due to TEAEs.16Events leading to discontinuation in the esketamine group were dizziness, dysgeusia, ventricular extras ystole, nausea, and dyspnea , which were considered by the investigator to be probably or very likely related to study drug; and aggression and agitation , which were considered to be doubtfully and not related to study drug, respectivel y. In total, 3 of 35 subjects in the esketamine group had dose reductions from 84 mg to 56 mg for intolerance.16 The most common ( ≥20%) individual TEAEs in the esketamine 84 mg group were nausea, dizziness, dysgeusia, headache, and dissociation and vomiting.16A majority of subjects in the esketamin e group experienced elevations in blood pressure measurements after dosing. The maximum increases in blood pressure occurred in the esketamine treated subjects at approximately 40 minutes postdose.16A greater proportion of subjects in the esketamine group NCT03097133"

The dissociative symptoms observed in the esketamine group had an onset shortly after the start of the dose and generally resolved within 2 hours postdose.16The dissociative symptoms attenuated with repea ted dosing. Adverse Events Associated with Chronic Use of Ketamine Much of the literature on chronic ketamine use comes from data gathered from illegal use, rather than clinical studies. Several studies have examined cognitive function in ketamine users , 23,58,60,64; overall , infrequent use didnot appear to be associated with long-term cognitive impairment.64The most robust findings were that frequent ketamine users (more than 5 times a week) exhibited impairments in both short -and long-term memory .60Although dosages varied, the dosages reported by ketamine users in this study were much higher than the dosages of ketamine or equivalent doses of esketamine intended for use in treating MDD . The memory impairments were not found in ex-users who had been abstinent for at least a year, thus impairments may be reversible .61 Ketamine -induced ulcerative cystitis is also anidentified complication.59The most comm on symptoms are frequency and urgency of urination, dysuria, urge incontinence, and occasionall y painful hematuria. Most cases were in near-daily recreational ketamine users ; the majorit y of cases resolve dafter stopping ketamine use, and one-third remained static. The ketamine dose, dosing frequency , and duration of chronic ketamine use at which cystitis may develop are not known. Compared with the doses and dosing frequency of esketamine proposed in this study , the equivalent ketamine dose in publi shed reports of interstitial cystitis and bladder -related symptoms was typicall y much higher; ketamine wasdosed more frequently , and often there was concomitant use of other substances. Abuse Liability, Dependence and Withdrawal There are reports of ketamine dependence in the literature but no large -scale studies.35,39,56,59,66 One study found that ketamine users and ex-users expressed concerns about ketam ine addictio n, and t he majorit y of frequent users reported using the drug without stopping until supplies ran out, so compulsi ve patterns of behavior are a concern.62A few published reports describe craving and somatic and psychological aspects of anxiety as symptoms of withdrawal from ketamine ; however, a specific ketamine withdrawal s yndrome has not yet been described.22,48,59 1.2. Overall Rationale for the Study The current study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine in addition to comprehensive standard of care in subjects with MDD who are at imminent risk for suicide as a pivotal Phase 3 study in support of regulatory agency requirements for registration of intranasal esketamine.

STUDY DESIGN A ND RA TIONA LE 3.1. Overview of Study Design This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter study . A target of 224 male and female subjects , 18 to 64 years of age, with MDD presenting to an emergency room (ER) or other permitted setting and assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide will be enrolled in this study . The study will consist of a screening evaluation performed within 48hours prior to the Day 1 intranasal dose (if possible, screening should occur within 24 hours prior to the Day 1 intranasal dose), immediatel y followed by a 25-day double -blind treatment phase (Day 1to 25), and a 65-day follow -up phase (Day 26 to Day 90). The total study duration for each subject will be approximately 13 weeks. On Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase, approximately 224 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatments: intranasal esketamine 84 mg (n = 112) or intranasal placebo (n=112), administered two times per week for 4 weeks (Day s 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25).

The first dose of study medication will be administered in the ER or other permitted setting , including the inpatient psychiatric unit. All subjects will be treated in the context of comprehensive standard clinical care, including hospitalization and the initiation or optimization of antidepressant treatment, which will be determined by the treating physician(s). The standard of care antidepressant treatment will be initiated or op timized for all subjects on Day 1. After the first dose (ie, starting with the Day 4 dose or later), a one-time dose reduction to intranasal esketamine 56 mg or intranasal placebo is allowed if a subject is unable to tolerate the intranasal esketamine 84 mg or placebo dose assigned at randomization. No further dose adjustment is allowed during the double -blind treatment phase . Dose titration/adjustments of newl y initiated or optimized standard of care antidepressant treatment should occur during the first 2 weeks of double -blind treatment (ie, by Day 15), with doses remaining stable thereafter through the end of the double -blind phase (Day 25). During the follow -up phase, the antidepressant treatment will be managed based on clinician’ s judgment. Subjects will remain in the inpatient psychiatry unit for a recommended duration of 5 day s, with shorter or longer hospitalizations permitted if clinically warranted per local standard of care. Discharge before 5days must be discussed and approved by the sponsor’s medical monitor. Following discharge from the inpatient psychiatric unit, subsequent visits for the double -blind treatment phase will be conducted twice -weekly at an outpatient psychiatric facility through Day 25. During the follow -up phase, subjects will be monitored twice weekly for the first two weeks (Day s 28, 32, 35, and 39) after study drug treatment. Subjects will then be followed up weekl y for the next two weeks (Day s 46 and 53) and every two weeks for the rest of the follow - up period (Day s 67 and 90). Efficacy , safet y, pharmacokinetic, biomarker , and pharmacogenomic evaluations will be performed as described in the Time and Events Schedule. The primary efficacy evaluation is the MADRS, the key secondary evaluation is CGI-SS-R, and other efficac y evaluations include the SIBAT, BHS, EQ -5D- 5L, QLDS, and TSQM -9. Safety evaluations include monitoring and collection of adverse events and concomitant therapies, physical examination, nasal examination, body weight, height, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, pulse oximetry , respiratory rate, clinical laboratory tests, SIBAT, MOAA/S, and CADSS . Blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of esketamine, noresketamine, and other metabolites if warranted. Blood samples will be collected f or biomarker evaluations.

Study Population This study will enroll adult subjects (18 to 64 years) with MDD presenting with suicidal ideation who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Subjects must meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5th edition (DSM -5)criteria for MDD (without psychosis), based on diagn ostic assessment with the Mini International Psychiatric Interview (MINI), and subjects must have a MADRS total score >28at baseline. By selecting for subjects with a MADRS total score of >28 (representing moderat e to severe depression), the study may reduce placebo response and enhance signal detection.MDD subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide a (n =224) Intranasal Esketamine 84 mg on Day 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25 + Standard of Care antidepressant treatment b (n = 112) Emergency Room (or other permitted setting) Inpatient Psychiatric Unit (Recommended 5 days) dIntranasal Placebo on Day 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25 + Standard of Care antidepressant treatment bStandard of Care antidepressant treatment Screening (within 48 hours c prior to Day 1 dose)Double -blind Treatment (Day 1 to 25) (Day 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25) Follow Up (Day 26 to 90) (Day 28e, 32, 35e, 39, 46, 53, 67, and 90) Outpatient Psychiatric Unit (n = 112) aRandomization will be stratified by study center and by the physician’s assessment of the subject’s need of standard of care antidepressant treatment ( ie, antidepressant monotherapy or an antidepressant plus augmentation therapy); the standard of care will be determined prior to randomization on Day 1. bStandard of care antidepressant treatment will be initiated or optimized on Day 1. cIf possible, screening should be performed within 24 hours prior the Day 1 intranasal dose. dDischarge before 5 days must be discussed and approved by the sponsor’s medical monitor. eRemote contact NCT03097133"
49,page_49,"JNJ54135419 (esketamine) Clinical Protocol 54135419SUI3002 Amendment 2 50 Status: Approved , Date: 31 January 2018Enrolled subjects must also present with suicidal ideation with intent, operationalized by affirmative responses to MINI questions B3 (Think about harming/hurting/ injuring yourself or about suicide?) and B10 (Intend to act on thoughts of killing yourself? ). This generally corresponds with the level of severity of suicidal ideation that appears to predict suicidal behavior over the short term.69Additionally , in the physician’s opinion, acute psychiatric hospitalization of the subject must be clinically warranted due to the subject’s imminent risk of suicide . Byselecting for subjects with this degree of suicide risk, the possibility of a favorable benefit -risk balance for the experimental treatment is enhanced. The age range of 18 to 64 years was selected as this Phase 3 study is designed to confirm the efficacy and safet y of esketamine in subjects with MDD presenting with suicidal ideation using 84mg, the dose anticipated to offer the most rapid and sustained benefit in adults. As higher systemic bioavailability of intranasal esketamine has been previously observed in an elderl y population (≥65years) (Studies ESKETI NTRD1003 andESKETI NTRD101237)and the efficacy and safet y of esketamine in the elder ly population with MDD is being further evaluated in other studies ,elderly adult subjects will not be enrolled in this study . Subjects with a recent history (<6 months) of moderate or severe substance or alcohol use disorders will be excluded to ensure the subject’s depression is not attributed to substance or alcohol use (ie, substance -induced depressive disorder). Subjects with a current diagnosis of bipolar or related disorders will be excluded to allow accurate assessment of efficacy and/or safet y data of the study drug in the context of MDD . 3.2.2. Treatment and Study Duration Patients with MDD with suicidal thoughts and behaviors are at risk for increased suicidalit y both in the first several days after initiating treatment with a standard antidepressant40and post- hospitalization.12,79Therefore, the dosing regimen in this study includes administration of esketamine twice weekly for 4 weeks (Day s 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25). This duration of repeated dosing is consistent with the timeframe inwhich standard antidepressants take to exert their action, and will allow for the evaluation of depression and assessment of suicide risk during this period of increased vulnerability . The same dosing regimen and duration of treatment was used in the Phas e 2 study ESKETINSUI2001. While Study ESKETINSUI2001 demonstrated a rapid onset of effect for esketamine in reducing the symptoms of depression and suicidality , it also suggested that continue d dosing through Day 25 provided an additional therapeutic adva ntage. Indeed, esketamine showed greater improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS total score and on the MADRS -SI at the double -blind endpoint (Day 25).16This result was further supported by response rates (at least 50% improvement in MADRS total score from baseline) and remission rates (MADRS total score ≤12) on Day 25, 4 hours post dose. At thattimepoint, 20 of 24 (83%) esketamine subjects, compared to 15 of 24 (63%) placebo subjects ,were considered responders; similarly , 16 of 24 (67%) esketamine subjects, compared to 12 of 24 (50%) placebo subjects were considered remitters.16The improvements continued throughout the posttreatment follow -up phase; at NCT03097133"
50,page_50,"JNJ54135419 (esketamine) Clinical Protocol 54135419SUI3002 Amendment 2 51 Status: Approved , Date: 31 January 2018Day 81, remission rates were 63% in the esketamine group compared with 50% in the placebo group.16 The duration of follow -up in this study covers the period of greatest risk for recurrent suicidalit y post initial attempt and/or hospitalization.12,15Specificall y, the follow -up after the 25-day treatment period is through Day 90 and will allow for the exploration of the continued effects of esketamine on depression and suicidal symptoms. No intranasal study medication will be administered during the follow -up phase .Subjects will be monitored twice weekl y for the first two weeks (Day s 28, 32, 35, and 39) after study drug treatment. Subjects will then be followed up weekl y for the next two weeks (Day s 46 and 53) and every two weeks for the rest of the follow -up period (Day s 67 and 90).The MADRS and CGI-SS-R will be completed at each of these visits. Additionally, throughout the follow -up period, suicide attempts, hospital re- admissions for suicidality , and ER visits will be assessed . The short -term treatment course of esketamine in subjects with MDD at imminent risk for suicide is expected to provide antidepressant efficacy during the interval needed for the newl y initiated or optimized ora l antidepressant sto become effective. 3.2.3. Control, Randomization and Blinding A placebo control will be used to establish the frequency and magnitude of changes in clinical endpoints that may occur in the absence of active treatment. Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment groups, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg,demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Randomization will be stratified by study center and by the physician’s assessment of the subject’s need of standard of care antidepressant treatment (ie, antidepressant monoth erapy or an antidepressant plus augmentation therap y); the standard of care will be determined prior to randomization on Day 1. This stratification is aimed at balancing treatment groups within the standard of care antidepressant treatment to be initiated or optimized on Day 1, as antidepressant monotherapy and antidepressant plus augmentation therap y may be differentially effective. A similar stratification approach was used successfull y in Study ESKETINSUI2001. Blinded treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints. Administration of esketamine, however, is associated with a number of transient adverse events, including sedation, dissociative symptoms, and elevation of blood pressure. To minimize the risk of unblinding the treatment assignment, different raters will perform efficacy and safet y assessments ;clinicians who perform the MADRS and SIBAT assessments will be different from those who evaluate vital signs, MOAA/S, CADSS , and adverse events .Raters for the MADRS and SIBAT assessments will not be allowed to access or to review subject safety records; therefore, they will not provide clinical care for subjects. Clinical care of subjects will be perform ed by clinicians at the study site who are not MADRS and SIBAT raters. NCT03097133"

Dose The currentl y available nonclinical safety studies support chronic intranasal administration of esketamine in human subjects up to a dose of 84 mg/day .37The treatment groups in the double - blind treatment phase of this study are esketamine 84 mg or placebo. The esketamine dose may be reduced at any time after the first dose to 56 mg for subsequent doses if a subject is unable to tolerate 84 mg. The same dosing regimen was used in the Phase 2 study ESKETINSUI2001. The rationale for this dose selection is based on the fact that MDD with imminent risk for suicide is a psychiatri c emergency requiring rapid and robust efficacy , and for which titration to an effective dose is not warranted. Study treatment will initially be administered in a hospital setting where any adverse effects can be closel y monitored and managed. Finally , a course of treatment of esketamine for MDD with imminent risk for suicide is limited to 4 weeks. Given the benefit- risk assessment of treatment for a life -threatening condition, the 84 mg dose of esketamine (with an option to reduce to the 56 mgdose) was selected to provide the greatest opportunity for rapid onset of efficacy and longer durability of activity , with acceptable tolerability , in the context of a psy chiatric emergency . Efficacy Findings Supporting the 84- mg Dose Results from the Phase 2 place bo-controlled study ESKETINTSUI2001 provided evidence of efficacy of the esketamine 84 mg dose in MDD with imminent risk for suicide . At 4 hours and 24hours after the first dose and at the double -blind endpoint (Day 25), esketamine 84 mg demonstrated a rapid and statistically significant reduction in symptoms of depression (based on MADRS total score ) and suicidal ideation (based on the MADRS -SI score) compared to placebo (refer to Section 1.1.2 .3for details) .Additionally , esketamine demonstrated evidence for a potential therapeutic effect based on the CGJ-SR, which summarized clinician overall judgment of suicide risk as derived from the SIBAT, at b oth 4 hours and 24 hours after the firstdose. Further support for the efficacy of the esketamine 84 mg dose comes from Panel A of the Phase 2 study ESKETINTRD2003 conducted in subjects with TRD ; statistically significant reductions in the MADRS total score were observed in all esketamine groups (28, 56, 84 mg) compared with the placebo group after the first week of treatment, with a significant dose- response relationship detected (refer to Section 1.1.2.3 for details).37In addition, for those subjects in Panel A who received the same esketamine treatment for both periods and completed the double -blind phase, the greatest decrease in MADRS total score was seen with the 84-mg dose, followed b y the 56 -mg dose, whereas the 28 mg dose had the smallest decrease.37 Safety and Tolerability The dosing regimen in this study has a provision for reducing the esketamine dose to 56 mg after Day 1 for subsequent doses if a subject is unable to tolerate the assigned esketamine 84 mg dose. In ESKETINSUI2001, more subjects in the esketamine 84 mg group than in the place bo group received all 8 scheduled doses of the study medication, and mean treatment durations were similar in the esketamine 84 mg group and in the placebo group . Furthermore, only 3 of the NCT03097133"
52,page_52,"JNJ54135419 (esketamine) Clinical Protocol 54135419SUI3002 Amendment 2 53 Status: Approved , Date: 31 January 201835subjects included in the safet y analysis set had esketamine dose reductions from 84 mg to 56mg for intolerance. The most common ( ≥20%) TEAEs in the esketamine 84 mg group during the double -blind phase were nausea, dizziness, dysgeusia, headache, dissociation, and vomiting. The most common TEAE in the placebo group was headache. Dissociative symptoms, as measured on the CADSS, and transient blood pressure increases observed in the esketamine group were consistent with prior studies. There were no deaths during Study ESKETINSUI2001. There were 4 SAEs in the double -blind phase, all in the esketamine 84 mg group. Three of these events were related to re -hospitalization of subjects with re-emergence of suicidal ideation (n=2) or depression (n=1) in subjects who had improved and had been discharged from the hospital. In all 3instances, the subjects recovered and completed both the double -blind and follow -up phases. One subject experienced an event of increased agitation , and the study medication was withdrawn. Six subjects experienced an SAE in the follow -up phase (5 in the placebo group and 1in the esketamine 84 mg group ; seeSection 1.1.2.4 for further details). The SAEs in the placebo group included 3 suicide attemp ts (non-fatal), 1 subject who experienced suicidal ideation , and 1subject with cellulitis. The SAE in the subject from the esketamine group was suicidal ideation . Six subjects (1 in the placebo group and 5 in the esketamine 84 mg group) discontinued from the double -blind phase due to TEAEs. In the esketamine group, events resulting in discontinuation were dizziness, dysgeusia, ventricular extrasy stole, nausea and dyspnea, which were considered by the investigator to be probabl y or very likely related to study drug; and aggression and agitation, which were considered to be doubtfull y and not related to stud y drug, respectively . Overall, the safet y profile of esketamine 84 mg in Study ESKETINSUI2001 was consistent with that observed in previous clinical studies of intranasal esketamine. No new safet y signals were identified. 3.2.5. Efficacy Measures 3.2.5.1. Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MA DRS) The primary outcome measure in this study will be the MADRS (see Section 9.2.1 ).The MADRS is considered the gold standard to measure antidepressant treatment response and is acceptable to the regulatory health authorities for useas a primary endpoint to determ ine symptomatic improvement. Further, the MADRS is sensitive to rapid changes in depression symptoms and suicidal thoughts, and has been included as a key outcome parameter in published studies of ketamine for depression and suicidal ideation5,25,47,63,70,71as well as in the sponsor’s Phase 2 studies of esketamine in MDD with imminent risk for suicide (ESKETINSUI2001) and in TRD (ESKETINTRD2003 and the Phase 3 studies of esketamine in TRD ). This study is primarily aimed at evaluating the rapid reduction of symptoms of MDD, including suicidal ideation , in subject s who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Accordingl y, the primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline (Day 1 predose) in the MADRS total score at 24 hours post first dose. Although therapeutic activity is observed with esketamine as early as 4 hours after administration, it appears that the full benefit is evident after 24 hours , and NCT03097133"
53,page_53,"JNJ54135419 (esketamine) Clinical Protocol 54135419SUI3002 Amendment 2 54 Status: Approved , Date: 31 January 2018evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint at 24 hours after the first dose is expected to reflect the timeframe needed for esketamine to exert its full antidepressant effect. This timepoint is relevant to current clinical practice as patients at imminent risk for suicide are typicall y hospitalized for at least 24 h ours. The MADRS also will be used to evaluate secondary objective sassessing the change from baseline in MADRS total score at 4 hours post first dose and through the end of the double -blind treatment phase and the remission rate at 4 hours and 24 hours post first dose and through the end of the double -blind treatment phase. In addition, the MADRS will be used to evaluate the exploratory objective assessing the change from baseline in MADRS total score and the remission rate through the end of the follow-up phase (Day 90). 3.2.5.2. Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBA T) The development of treatments with the potential for rapid onset of efficacy as measured by diminished severity of suicidal thinking and reduced clinical perception of risk for suicide has driven the need for scales that can reliabl y measure these attributes. However, these requirements correspond with specific deficits in existing suicide assessment scales. To address these unmet needs ,a new instrument, the SIBAT, has been developed bya team of experts in suicide and psychometrics. The SIBAT is a suicide assessment tool that captures suicidal ideati on and behavior(s) as reported by patients and reviewed by clinicians permitting efficient collection and documentation of clinical impress ion of severity of suicidality and imminent and long-term suicide risk and treatment plans (see Section 9.2.2 ). The SIBAT is computerized and organized into 8 modules with branching logic to allow for efficient, comprehensive, and flexible data collection from a broad base of patients who may have a wide variet y of demographic, cultural and demographic backgrounds. The 8 modules of theSIBAT aredivided into patient -reported (Modules 1-5) and clinician -rated (Modules 6-8) sections. This modular structure allows for customization, and the administration of specific modules can be adjusted to meet clinical needs. Responses less susceptible to chang e (eg, demographics, medical history ) are segregated into modules distinct from those responses more likely to fluctuate over shorter time intervals (eg, current suicidal ideation). In general, the patient -reported modules document information regarding the severity of suicidal ideation and risk and protective factors associated with suicide risk and specific suicidal behaviors. Information from the patient -reported modules, plus a brief semi- structured clinician in terview in Module 6, represent a comprehen sive profile for assessment of theClinical Global Impressions in Module 7, which includes the Clinical Global Impression of Severit y of Suicidality –Revised (CGI-SS-R ), the Clinical Global Impression of Imminent Suicide Risk (CGI -SR-I),theClinical Glob al Impression of Long -Term Suicide Risk, and assessment of the frequency of suicidal thinking.

Module 7 (Clinical Global Impressions) of the SIBAT includes a revised version of theCGI-SS(CGI -SS-R), which will be used to evaluate the key secondary objective in this study (further details are provided below) , as well as a Clinical Global I mpression of Imminent Suicide Risk (CGI -SR-I), which will be used to evaluate secondary and exploratory objectives (further details are provided below) .In addition, Question 3 (patient -reported frequency of suicidal thinking) in Module 5 (My Risk) from the SIBAT will be used to evaluate the secondary objective assessing patient- reported suicida lity through the end of the double -blind treatment phase. Formal testing of inter-and intra-rater reliability and assessments of construct validity and internal consistency are being conducted on the SIBAT. Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality – Revised (CGI -SS-R) The CGI-SS was initially created for the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT), a large -scale, long-term prospective study that evaluated the potential of clozapine and olanzapine to reduce suicidal behaviors in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are known to be at high risk for suicide.1,49,53The CGI-SSwas derived from the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI -S), a global rating scale that gives an overall measure of the severit y of a patient’s illness. The CGI-SS provided an index to quantify an expert's impression of severit y of suicidalit y that helped to confirm the validity ISST. Arevised version ofthe CGI-SS (CGI -SS-R) will be used in this study (see Section 9.2.2 ). This revision is aligned with the standard CGI-S with which all clinicians are familiar, and has more severit y levels than the original version, allowing for greater sensitivity. The CGI-SS-R, assessed at 24hours post initial dosing, will be used as the key secondary endpoint in this study . In addition, the CGI-SS-R will be used to evaluate secondary objectives assessing: Change in severity of suicidality at 4 hours postdose on Day 1 and through the end of the double -blind treatment phase Resolution of suicidality as measured by the score of 0 (normal, not at all suicidal) or 1 (questionably suicidal) of the CGI -SS-R at 4 hours postdose on Day 1, 24 hours postdose on Day 2, and through the end of the double -blind treatment phase and exploratory objectives assessing: Change in severit y of suicidality through the end o f the follow -up phase Clinical Global Impression of Imminent Suicide Risk (CGI- SR-I) The CGI-SR-I is a scale summarizing theclinician’s best assessment of the likelihood that the subject will attempt suicide in the next 7 day s(see Section 9.2.2 ).

Specific guidance to be followed on intranasal dosing days is provided in Section 6.1.1 . The MOAA/S will be administered to assess the severit y and duration of any sedation , and the CADSS will be administered to assess treatment -emergent dissociative symptoms . Although the SIBAT will be an efficacy evaluation, it will also be used to inform safety evaluation to detect any worsening of suicidal ideation and behavior throughout the study . On all outpatient intranasal dosing days, all subjects must remain at the clinical site until study procedures have been completed and the subject is ready for discharge per clinician’s assessment . The minimum time required for postdos emonitoring is 1.5hours. Subjects should be accompanied when released from the clinical study site. Subjects must not drive a car or work with machines for 24 hours after receiving study drug. A list of prohibited therapies is provided in Attachment 1for general guidance for the investigator; however, this list is not all- inclusive . 3.2.7. Pharmacokinetic A ssessm ents Blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of esketamine, noresk etamine, and other metabolites if warranted. 3.2.8. Biomarker, Pharmacogenomic (DNA ), and Expression (RNA ) Evaluations Blood samples may be collected for the analy sis of one or more candidate genes and/or the analysis of genetic and epigenetic marker sas well as RNA expression markers . In addition, blood samples will be collected for the exploratory analysis of biomarkers related to immune system activity , HPA axis activation, neurotrophic and metabolic factors. It is recognized that genetic variation can be an important contributory factor to interindividual differences in drug distribution and response and can also serve as a marker for disease susceptibility and prognosis. Pharmacogenomic research may help to explain interindividual variability in clinical outcomes and may help to identify population subgroups that respond differentl y to a drug. The goal of the pharmacogenomic component is to collect DNA to allow the identification of genetic and/or epigenetic factors that may influence the pharmacokinetics (PK) ,pharmacod ynamics (PD) ,efficacy , safet y,or tolerability of esketamine and to identif y genetic factors associated with MDD and suicidality .Specifically , genes and epigenetic changes in genes known to be in pathway s relevant to depression (HPA axis, inflammation, growth factors, monoamine transporters, ion channels, circadian rhythm) will be evaluated. Expression analyses may include testing of known messenger RNA/microRNA (mRNA/miRNA) transcripts or transcriptome -wide analy sis in relationship to antide pressant treatment response and MDD. Increasingl y, it is recognized that psychiatric disorders may be associated with altered immune/metabolic activation patterns.

In addition, biomarker samples may be combined with samples collected from other sources to understand the biomarker correlates of suicidal behavior including but not limited to high ideation state versus low ideation state versus no ideation and to understand the MDD disease mechanism. The DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolic biomarker samples may be used to help address emerging issues and to enable the development of safer, more effective, and ultimat ely individualized therapies. 3.2.9. Medical Resource Utilization Treatment of subjects with MDD at immediate risk of suicide with esketamine versus placebo may result in lower utilization of services (ie, outpatient visits, ERvisits or hospitalization) as assessed using the Heath Resource Use Questionnaire (HRUQ). The HRUQ includes information regarding utilization of healthcare services, including the timing of services, enabling changes in level and quantit y of services to be considered as a variable in econ omic models. 4.

The requestor must use his or her own user identification and personal identification number when contacting the IWRS, and will then give the relevant subject details to uniquely identify the subject. Blinding The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained within the IWRS, which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the blind for an individual subject. Data that may potentially unblind the treatment assignment (eg, study drug plasma concentrations, treatment allocation ) will be handled with special care to ensure that the integrity of theblind is maintained and the potential for bias is minimized. This can include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by the investigators, clinical team, or others as appropriate until the time of database lock and unblinding. To minimize the risk of unblinding the treatment assignment during the study ,different raters will perform efficacy and safety assessments. Clinicians who perform MADRS and SIBAT will be different than those who evaluate vital signs, MOAA/S, CADSS , and adverse events .Raters for the MADRS and SIBAT assessment will not be allowed to access or to review subject safet y records; therefore, they will not provide clinical care for subjects. Clinical care of subjects will be performed by clinicians at the study site who are not MADRS and CGI-SS-R/SIBAT raters. Adherence to this procedure will be monitored and enforced during the study . Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken until all subjects have completed the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the blind should be broken only if specific emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by knowing t he treatment status of the subject. In such cases, the investigator may in an emergency determine the identity of the treatment by contacting the IWRS.It is recommended that the investigator contact the sponsor or its designee if possible to discuss the particular situation, before breaking the blind. Telephone contact with the sponsor or its designee will be available 24hours per day, 7days per week. In the event the blind is broken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, time, and reason for the unblinding must be documented in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF), andin the source document. The documentation received from the IWRS indicating the code break must be retained with the subject's source doc uments in a secure manner . Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unblinded should continue to return for scheduled earl y termination and follo w-up contacts and visits. In general, randomization codes will be disclosed fully only if the study is completed and the clinical database is closed. To maintain the blinding of intranasal study medication, the esketamine and placebo intranasal devices will be indistinguishable.

Instructions for use of the device will be provided as a separate document (see Section 15, Study -specific Materials ).Details regarding study drug administration will be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF. On all intranasal treatment session day s, a site staff member with training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eg, Basic L ife Support course or equivalent course) that is up to date per local regulations must be present with the subject during the intranasal treatment session and the postdose observation period. In addition, equipment for supportive ventilation and resuscitation needs to be present. A physical description of the stud y drugs is provided in Section 14.1. On Day 1, subjects will be randomized to treatment with either intranasal esketamine 84 mg or intranasal placebo , administered two times per week for 4 weeks. Intranasal treatment sessions should not take place on consecutive day s. Food will be restricted for at least 2hours beforeeach administration of study medication . Drinking of any fluids will be restricted at least 30 minutes before the first nasal spray on each dosing day. If the subject has nasal congestion on the dosing day, an intranasal decongestant can be used to reduce congestion ,or with the exception of the Day 1 dose, the dosing day may be delay ed (per the permitted visit window; see the Time and Events Schedule). If an intranasal decongestant is used to reduce congestion , it cannot be used within 1hour prior to intranasal study drug dosing (see Attachment 1for allowed intranasal decongestant ). The first dose of study medication will be administered in the ER or other permitted setting that has appropriate staffing to manage acutel y suicidal subjects . If the first dose is administered in the ER, it is recommended that the subject notbe transferr ed from the ER to the inpatient psychiatric unit after the 4-hour postdose assessments are completed. Subjects who have been admitted directly into the inpatient psy chiatric unit due to imminent risk for suicide or transferred from a medical unit (followin g medical stabilization for recent suicide attempt) will receive their first dose of study medication in the inpatient psychiatric unit. Subjects will remain in the inpatient psychiatry unit for a recommended duration of 5 day s, with shorter or longer hospitalizations permitted if clinically warranted per local standard of care. Following discharge from the inpatient psychiatric unit, subsequent visits for the double -blind treatment phase will be conducted twice -weekly at an outpatient psychiatric facility through Day 25. On all outpatient intranasal dosing days, all subjects must remain at the clinical site until study procedures have been completed and the subject is ready for discharge per clinician’s assessment . The minimum time required for postdose mo nitoring is 1.5 hours. Subjects should be accompanied when released from the clinical study site.

Double -Blind Treatment Phase Following completion of all required screening procedures and confirmation of subject eligibility , subjects will enter the double -blind treatment phase. On Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase, approximately 224 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatme nt groups in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 112 subjects per group) : intranasal esketamine 84 mg or intranasal placebo . Study drug will beadministered two times per week for 4 weeks (Day s 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25). Intranasal treatment sessions should not take place on consecutive day s. Subjects will be admitted toand receive the first dose of study medication inthe ERor other permitted setting ; for example, subjects who have been admitted directly into the inpatient psychiatric unit due to imminent risk for suicide or transferred from a medical unit (following medical stabilization for recent suicide attempt) will receive their first dose of study medication in the inpatient psychiatric unit. If the first dose is administered in the ER, it is recomme nded that subjects not be transferred from the ER to the inpatient psychiatric unit until after the postdose assessme nts are completed (approximately 4 hours after study drug administration) . Prior to the first intranasal dose on Day 1, subjects will pract ice spraying (into the air, not intranasall y) a demonstration intranasal device that is filled with placebo solution. All subjects will self-administer the study medication under the direct supervision of the investigator or designee (Refer to Section 6, Dosage and Administration). All subjects will be treated in the context of comprehensive standard clinical care, including hospitalization and the initiation or optimization of antidepressant treatment (antidepressant monotherap y or antidepressant plus augmentation therap y). On Day 1, all subjects will begin standard of care treatment and will continue, at least, this treatment through the duration of the double -blind treatment phase .

Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale The primary efficacy evaluation will be the MADRS total score. The MADRS will be p erformed using the Structured Interview Guide for the Montgomery A sberg Depression Rating Scale .81 The MADRS is a clinician -rated scale designed to be used in subjects with MDD to measure depression severity and detect changes due to antidepressant treatment.54,55The test consists of 10items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. The test exhibits high inter-rater reliability . The typical recall period for the MADRS is 7 days. In this study , the MADRS will also be administered using a since last assessment recall , a 4-hour recall on Day 1 and Day 25 postdose, and a 24 -hour recall on Day 2. For the MADR S performed at 4 hours postdose on Day s1 and 25, the MADRS scores for the sleep item recorded predose on the same day will be carried forward. Whenever possible, all efforts should be made to use the same raters for the MADRS at each site to assess the sa me subjects throughout the study . If this is not possible, review of the appropriate prior assessments and communication with prior raters should be conducted as needed. 9.2.2. Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool The SIBAT has two major divisions: a patient-rated section and a clinician -rated section. The patient -rated section has modules of demographics and suicide history , risk/protective factors, suicidal thinking, suicide behavior, and suicide risk. The information generated in this section will be summarized and used to support the clinical decision -making of the second section. The clinician -rated section has modules for semi -structured interview, clinical global impressions of current severity of suicidality and imminent suicide risk, clinical global impression of long-term suicide risk, and clinical judgment of optimal suicide management.

Refer to the SIBAT Time and Events Schedule for an ou tline of which modules will be performed at each scheduled time point. One module of the SIBAT includes a revised version of the Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Suicidality . The CGI-SS-R rating is scored on a 7-point scale from 0 (normal, not at all suicidal ) to 6 ( among the most extremely suicidal patients) and will be based on the totality of information available to the clinician, including information from the SIBAT. The CGI-SS-R summarizes the clinician ’soverall impression of severit y of suicidality and will be used to assess the key secondary endpoint in this study (see Section 2.1.2 ). This rating operate slike numerous other CGI-severit y scales that have been used in other psychiatric studies. These instruments have shown clinical validity and sensitivity to change. The CGI-SR-I summarizes theclinician’s best assessment of the likelihood that a patient will attempt suicide in the next 7 day s. Whenever possible, all efforts should be made to use the same raters for the SIBAT at each site to assess the same subjects throughout the study . If this is not possible, review of the appropriate prior ass essments and communication with prior raters should be conducted as needed. 9.2.3. Beck Hopelessness Scale The BHS is a self-reported measure to assess one’s level of negative expectations or pessimism regarding the future . It consists of 20 true -false items that examine the respondent’s attitude over the past week by either endorsing a pessimistic statement or denying an optimistic statement; 9are keyed false and 11 are key ed true. These items fall within 3 domains: (1) feelings about the future; (2) loss of motivation; and (3) future expectations. For every statement, each response is assigned a score of 0 or 1. The total BHS score is a sum of item responses and can range from 0to 20, with a higher score representing a higher level of hopelessness . Total scores that range from 0 to 3 are considered within the normal range, scores 4 to 8 identify mild hopelessness, scores 9 to 14 identify moderate hopelessness, and scores greater than 14 identify severe hopelessness . BHS scores of ≥9 have been found to be predic tive of eventual suicide in depressed suicide ideators who were followed for 5-10 years after discharge from a hospital .8Among a group of 72subje cts with single -episode MDD, the scale was found to have a high degree of internal consistency (0.92); the same value of internal consistency was found among a group of 134subjects with recurrent -episode MDD.9Among a group of hospitalized MDD subject s, the scale showed a relatively high correlation with clinical ratings of hopelessness and other self- administered measures of hopelessness . Test- retest scores of 0.69 and 0.66 have been reported.9 The scale has been found to have concurrent and discriminant validity among subject s with MDD .9 Further, the scale was found to be sensitive to change in the subject ’s state of depression over time.10The measure is designed for use in adults aged 17 to 80 years and takes 5 to 10minutes to complete . A scoring manual and scoring platform is available from the licensee holder. The BHS will be administered using a recall period of the last 7 day s. NCT03097133"

EuroQol 5 -Dimension 5 -Level The EQ-5D- 5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome, primarily designed for self -completion by respondents. It consists of the EQ -5D- 5L descr iptive sy stem and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ- VAS). The EQ-5D- 5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: Mobility , self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression. Each of the 5 dimensions is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems (Level 1 indicating no problem, Level 2 indicating slight problems, Level 3 indicating moderate problems, Level 4 indicating severe problems, and L evel 5 indicating extreme problems).27,28 The subject selects an answer for each of the 5 dimensions considering the response that best matches his or her health “today .” The descriptive system can be represented as a health state. The EQ-VAS self-rating records the respondent’s own assessment of his or her overall health status at the time of completion, on a scale of 0 to 100. The time taken to complete the questionnaire varies with age, health status, and setting but is likely to be approximately 1 minute. 9.2.5. Quality of Life in Depression Scale The QLDS is a disease specific patient -reported outcome designed to assess health related qualit y of life in patients with MDD , ie, it captures the impact of depression and its treatment from the patient’s perspective .34,52,77The instrument has a recall period of ""at the moment"", contains 34- items with ""yes""/""no"" or “true ”/“not true” response options and takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. The score range is from 0 (good quality of life) to 34 (very poor quality of life). It has been shown to have acceptable psy chometric properties and sensitivit y to change. 9.2.6. Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaires for Medication The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM -9)4is a 9-item generic patient reported outcome instrument to assess patients’ satisfaction with medication. It is derived from the longer TSQM Vers ion 1.411and covers domains of effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction. The instrument is scored by domain with scores ranging from 0-100 where a lower score indicates lower satisfaction. The recall period is “the last 2-3 weeks”. It takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. 9.3. Pharmacokinetics Whole blood samples will be used to evaluate the PK of esketamine .Plasma collected for PK may additionally be used to evaluate safet y or efficacy aspects that address concerns arising during or after the study period. Genetic analyses will not be performed on these plasma samples. Subject confidentiality will be maintained. 9.3.1. Evaluations Venous blood samples of approximately 2mL will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of esketamine , noresketamine, and other metabolites if warranted at the time points specified in the Time and Events Schedule .The exact dates and times and pharmac okinetic blood sampling must be recorded.

The objective of the examination at screening is to rule out any subjects with anatomical or medical conditions that may impede drug delivery or absorption. Subsequent examination will consist of a visual inspection of the nostrils, nasal mucosa, and throat for nasal erythema, rhinorrhea, rhinitis, capillary /blood vessel disruption and epistaxis and will be graded as follows: none, mild, moderate, or severe. Dosing Day Assessments Pulse Oximetry Pulse oximetry will be used to measure arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2). On each dosing day, the device will be attached to the finger, toe, or ear ,and SpO 2will be monitored and documented every 15 minutes from predose to 1.5 hours postdose. If oxygen saturation levels are <93% at any time during the 1.5hour postdose interval, pulse oximetry will be recorded every 5 m inutes until levels return to 93% or until the subject is referred for appropriate medical care, if clinically indicated. Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) The MOAA/S will be used to measure treatment -emergent sedation with correlation to levels of sedation defined by the American Societ y of Anesthesiologists (ASA) continuum.67The MOAA/S scores range from 0 (no response to painful stimulus; ASA continuum = general anesthesia) to 5 (readil y responds to name spoken in normal tone [awake] ; ASA continuum = minimal sedation) . On each intranasal dosing day, the MOAA/S will be performed every 15 minutes from predose to 1.5 hours postdose . If the score is ≤3 at any time during the 90 minute postdose interval, the MOAA/S will be performed every 5 m inutes until a score of 4 is reached (at which point a frequency of every 15 minutes can be resumed until t = 90 minutes postdose). If a subject does not have a score of at least 5 at t = 90 minutes postdose, the subject should continue to be monitored. For subjects with a score of 4, the assessment should be repeated every 15 minutes. And for subjects with a score of ≤3, the assessment should be repeated every 5minutes until the score returns to 5 or the subject is referred for appropriate medical care, if clinically indicated. Clinician -Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) The CADSS is an instrument for the measurement of present -state dissociative symptoms14and will be administered to assess treatment -emergent dissociative symptoms.

If any CADSS items are scored zero at 40 minutes, these items will not need to be repeated at 1.5hours postdose. 9.8. Other Evaluations Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) The MINI is a short, structured diagnostic interview developed for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -5) and 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) psychiatric disorders. It has an administration time of approximately 15 to 30 minutes and provides an accurate structured psychiatric interview for multicenter clinical trials. The MINI is used to confirm the diagnosis of MDD with current suicidal ideation and to determine if there are other psy chiatric conditions present. Question s B3 and B10 from the MINI Current suicidal ideation with intent will beevaluated at screening using Question B3 ( Think [even momentarily ] about harming or of hurting or of injuring yourself: with at least some intent or awareness that you might die as a result; or think about suicide [ie,about killing yourself] ?) andQuesti on B10 ( Intend to act on thoughts of killing yourself? ) from the MINI. Subjects will be asked to answer these questions (Yes or No) relative to their current status. T he response to B3 must refer to the present, whereas the response to B10 may reflect the past 24 hours. Ifthe screening phase is longer than 24 hours, Question B3 and B10 from MINI (current status) must be repeated prior to randomization to confirm eligibility . 9.9. Sample Collection and Handling The actual dates and times of sample collection must be recorded in the eCRF or laboratory requisition form.

No further planned assessments will be conducted. In addition, the investigator must ensure the subject is appropriatel y transitioned and/or followed for an y additional care required. If a subject is lost to follow up, every reasonable effort must be made by the study site personnel to contact the subject and determine the reason for discontinuation/withdrawal. This should include at least 3 telephone calls, certified letters, email requests, etc. To ensure access to follow - up subjects, the study sites should attempt to obtain both primary and secondary telephone contact numbers (eg, home, work, and mobile phone numbers) as well as other contact information (eg, email addresses) from subjects before randomization. In addition , the study site should emphasize the importance of follow -up information to the subject before randomization. The measures taken to follow up must be documented. When a subject withdraws before completing the study , the reason for withdrawal is to be docu mented in the eCRF and in the source document. Study drug assigned to the withdrawn subject may not be assigned to another subject. Subjects who withdraw will notbe replaced. Withdrawal of Consent Every effort will be made in the study to ensure withdrawal of consent is not selected as a reason for discontinuation when in fact the subject withdrew for an identifiable reason (eg, due to an adverse event or lack of efficacy ). Subjects who wish to withdraw from the study should be asked if they are agreeabl e to continue to an Early Termination visit and to be contacted remotel y to collect follow -up information at 3days after the last dose of intranasal study medication (if the subject discontinued during the double -blind phase and the date of the Early Term ination visit is less than 3 days after the last dose of intranasal study medication ),on Day 25 (if the subject discontinued during the double - blind phase) and on Day 90.

The investigator will be responsible for making all required notifications to the Institutional Review Board (I RB) or Independent Ethic s Committee (IEC). 10.3. Withdrawal From the Use of Research Sample s A subject who withdraws from the study will have the following options regarding the optional research sample : The collected sample will be retained and used in accordance with the subject's original separate informed consent for optional research samples . The subject may withdraw consent for optional research sample , in which case the sample will be destroy ed and no further testing will take place. To initiate the sample destruction process, the investigator must notify the sponsor study site contact of withdrawal of consent for the optional research samples and to request sample destruction. The sponsor study site contact will, in turn, contact the biomarker representative to execute sample destruction. If requested, the investigator will receive written confirmation from the sponsor that the sample has been destro yed. Withdrawal From the Optional Research Samples While Remaining in the Main Study The subject may withdraw consent for optional research samples while remaining i n the study . In such a case, the optional research sample will be destroy ed. The sample destruction process will proceed as described above. Withdrawal From the Use of Sample s in Future Research The subject may withdraw consent for use of sample sfor resea rch (refer to Section 16.2.5 , Long- Term Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research). In such a case, samples will be destroy ed after they are no longer needed for the clinical study .

STATISTICA L METHODS Statistical analy sis will be done by the sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. A general description of the statistical methods to be used to anal yze the efficacy and safet y data is outlined below. Specific details will be provided in the SAP. 11.1. Subject Information The primary efficacy and safet y analysis sets are defined below. Full analysis set: The full analy sis setwill include all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of double -blind study medication and have both a baseline and a post dose evaluation for the MADRS total score.

Sample Size Determination The maximum sample size for this study was calculated assuming an effect size of 0.45 for the MADRS total score at 24 hours post first dose (Day 2), a one-sided significance level of 0.025, and a drop -out rate at 24 hours of 5%. Approximately 112 subjects will need to be randomized to each treatment group to achieve 90% power . The effect size used in this calculation was based on results of the ESKETINSUI2001 studywhere the effect size for the change from baseline to Day 2 was 0.65 (mean difference between treatment groups of - 7.2 and a pooled SD of 11.02) for MADRS total score. Given that the ESKETINSUI2001 study was a Phase 2 study carried out in only one countr y, the maximum sample size for this Phase 3 study was determined using a smaller effect size of 0.45 to allow for greater variability that can be expected for a study conducted globall y. 11.3. Efficacy Analyses Primary Estimand The primary estimand, the main clinical quantity of interest to be estimated in the study , is defined b y the following 3 components: Population: subjects with MDD who are at imminent risk of suicide Endpoint: change from baseline to 24 hours post first dose (Day 2)in the MADRS total score Measure of Intervention: the effect of the initially randomized treatment that would have been observed had all subjects remained on their treatment until Day 2 of the double -blind phase. The primary analy sis will be based on the full analy sis set and the MADRS total scores collected at Day 2. Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy variable, change from baseline in MADRS total score at 24 hours post first dose (Day 2), will be analy zed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The model will include factors for treatment ,center, standard of care antidepressant treatment (ie, antidepressant monotherapy or an antidepressant plus augmentation therap y), and baseline MADRS total score as a covariate. A point estimate and 95% confidence interva l for the treatment difference will be provided. Since subjects are hospitalized at the time of the primary endpoint, it is anticipated that missing data will be infrequent . However, if a subject has a MADRS total score at a time earlier than 24 hours post first dose but does not have the 24 hour value, the earlier value will be used for the primary efficacy analysis.In addition, descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) of the primary efficacy variable will be provided by study center.

The treatment difference will be estimated using the Hodges -Lehmann estimate, which is the median of all possible paired differences for the change from baseline for CGI -SS-R at 24 hours. The multiplicity with regard to testing multiple endpo ints (the primary and the key secondary ) will be controlled by a fixed sequence testing procedure, ie, the key secondary hypothesis will be tested only after the null hy pothesis for the primary endpoint is rejected. The secondary efficacy endpoint s, propor tion of subjects with remission (MADRS total score ≤12) and the proportion of subjects achieving resolution of suicidality (CGI-SS-R score of 0 or 1)at each visit during the double -blind phase will be analy zed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel chi-square test adjusting for center and standard of care antidepressant treatment (ie, antidepressant monotherapy or antidepressant plus augmentation therap y).Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to the particular visit of the double -blind phase will not be consi dered to have remission or resolution of suicidality . Changes from baseline over time in MADRS total score, BHS, and QLDS total scores will be analyzed based on last observation carried forward (LOCF) data using an ANCOVA model with treatment, center, and standard of care antidepressant treatment (ie, antidepressant monotherap y or an antidepressant plus augmentation therapy )as factors and baseline value as a covariate. Additionally , the change from baseline in MADRS total score at Day 25 will be analy zed u sing a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analy sis with baseline MADRS total score as a covariate, and treatment, center, standard of care antidepressant treatment (ie, antidepressant monotherap y or antidepressant plus augmentation therap y), day, and day -by-treatment interaction as fixed effects, and a random subject effect.

Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications Adverse Event An adverse event is any untow ard medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavor able and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigation al) product. (Definition per International Conference on Harmonisation [I CH]) This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing of the ICF (refer to Section 12.3.1 , All Adverse Even ts, for time of last adverse event recording). Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose: Results in death Is life-threatening (The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product Is Medicall y Important* *Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in decid ing whether expedited reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to preve nt one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should usually be considered serious. If a serious and unexpected adverse event occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study drug and the event (eg,death from anaph ylaxis), the event must NCT03097133"
92,page_92,"JNJ54135419 (esketamine) Clinical Protocol 54135419SUI3002 Amendment 2 93 Status: Approved , Date: 31 January 2018be reported as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of the study endpoint (eg, all -cause mort ality). Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable product reference safet y information. For esketamine , the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the I nvestigator's Brochure. Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Drug An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible, probable, or very likel yby the definitions listed in Section 12.1.2 , Attribution Definitions. 12.1.2. Attribution Definitions Not Related An adverse event that is not related to the use of the drug. Doubtful An adverse event for which analternative explanation is more likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely . Possible An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explan ation, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. Probable An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive (eg,confirmed by dechallenge). An alternative explanation is less likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). Very Likely An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonabl y explained by an alternative explanation, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive (eg, it is confirmed b y dechallenge and rechallenge). 12.1.3. Severity Criteria An assessment of severity grade will be made using the followin g general categorical descriptors: Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity . NCT03097133"
93,page_93,"JNJ54135419 (esketamine) Clinical Protocol 54135419SUI3002 Amendment 2 94 Status: Approved , Date: 31 January 2018Severe : Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. Prevents normal every day activities. The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit y of events not directly experienced b y the subject (eg, laborat ory abnormalities). 12.2. Special Reporting Situations Safety events of interest on a sponsor study drugthat may require expedited reporting or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to: Overdose of a sponsor study drug Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study drug Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study drug Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to the sponsor study drug , eg, name confusion) Exposure to a sponsor study drug from breastfeed ing Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF . Any special reporting situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page of the eCRF . 12.3. Procedures 12.3.1. All Adverse Events All adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICFis obtained until completion of the subject's last study -related procedure ,which may include contact for follow -up o f safety ,with the exception of pregnancy which will be reported up to 6 weeks after the last dose of study medication (females) or 90 days after the last dose of study medication (partners of male subjects ). Serious adverse events, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until completion of the subject's last study -related procedure , must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. The sponsor will evaluate any safet y information that is spontaneously reported by an investigator beyond the time frame specified in the protocol. All events that meet the definition of a serious adverse event will be reported as serious adverse events, regardless of whether they are protocol -specific assessments. Anticipated events will be recorded and reported as described in Attachment 2. All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity , or presumed relationship to study drug, must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the eCRF . Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (eg,cough , runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as ""upper respiratory infection""). Investigators must record in the eCRF their opinion concerning the NCT03097133"

All measures required for adverse event management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor instructions. The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) . The investigator (or sponsor where required) must report SUSARs to the appropriate IEC/IRB that approved the protoco l unless otherwise required and documented by the IEC/I RB.A SUSAR will be reported to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating investigators and IEC/I RB will receive a blinded SUSAR summary , unless otherwise specified. For all studies with an outpatient phase, including open -label studies, the subject must be provided with a ""wallet (study )card"" and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration of the study indicating the following: Study number Statement, in the local language(s), that the subject is participating in a clinical study Investigator's name and 24-hour contact telephone number Local sponsor's name and 24 -hour contact telephone number (for medical staf f onl y) Site number Subject number Any other information that is required to do an emergency breaking of the blind 12.3.2. Serious A dverse Events All serious adverse events occurring during thestudymust be reported to the appropriate sponsor contact person b ystudy -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event. Information regarding serious adverse events will be transmitted to the sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event Form, which must be completed and signed by a physician from the study site, and transmitted to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow-up reports of a serious adverse event should be made b y facsimile (fax) . All serious adverse events that have not resolved by the end of the study , or that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study , must be follow ed until any of the following occurs: The event resolves The event stabilizes The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to study conduct NCT03097133"

Any event requiring hospitalization (or prolongation of hospitalization) that occurs during the course of a subject's participation in a study must be reported as a serious adverse event , except hospitalizations for the following: Inpatient hospitalizations that extend beyond the protocol -recommended 5 days (not due to adverse event , ie, clinical worsening ) Hospitalizations not intended to treat an acute illness or adverse event (eg, social reasons such as pending placement in long -term care facility ) Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the eCRF ). Note: Hospitalizations that were planned before the signing of the ICF, and where theunderl ying condition for which the hospitalization was planned has not worsened ,will not be considered serious adverse events. Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of the originall y planned hospitalization is to be reported as a new serious a dverse event. The cause of death of a subject in a study from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until completion of the subject's last study -related procedure , whether or not the event is expected or associated with the study drug , is considered a serious adverse event. 12.3.3. Pregnancy All initial reports of pregnancy in female subjects or partners of male subjects must be reported to the sponsor by the study -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomal ies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered serious adverse events and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must promptly discontinue further study treatment. Because the effect of the study drug on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male subjects included in the study will be reported as noted above. Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required . 12.4.

ETHICA L ASPECTS 16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations Clinical Study in Subjects with MDD Assessed to be at Imminent Risk of Suicide Major depressive disorder is the most prevalent mental health condition and the psychiatric diagnosis most commonly associated with suicide.41,65Epidemiology studies suggest that nearl y NCT03097133"
99,page_99,"JNJ54135419 (esketamine) Clinical Protocol 54135419SUI3002 Amendment 2 100 Status: Approved , Date: 31 January 201860% of those who die by suicide suffer from affective disorders, and at least one-half of people who complete suicide are depressed at the time of their deaths.2,13,17,51 There is no approved treatment for patients with MDD assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. The current standard of care is hospitalization and initiation or optimization of treatment with antidepressant medication. Pilot studies in subjects with MDD or bipolar depression suggest that ketamine may have a significant effect on reducing suicidal ideation within hours of administration.25,47,71,72,85 Furthermore, a Phase 2 study (ESKETINSUI2001 )recently completed by the sponsor suggested that intranasal esketamine rapidl y reduced symptoms of depression and suicidality in subjects with MDD at imminent risk for suicide and that intranasal esketamine was tolerated in this population . Selection of Subjects The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of the symptoms of major depressive disorder, including suicidal ideation , in subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Thus, the study cannot be completed in health y subjects or depressed patients who are not at imminent risk for suicide. While a patient’s decisional capacity can be impacted by severe depression and suicidal ity, this becomes an ethical concern when the patient refuses medically necessary treatment . However, the subjects in this trial will be providing voluntary consent to participate in the study of a potentially efficacious treatment, given in the context of standard of care treatment (ie, hospitalization and antidepressant treatment) . Subjects may participate in the study only if they have adequate capacity to give consent and after fully understanding the potential risks, benefits, and potential adverse events of thestudy. Determination of a subject’s decisional capacit y will be made by the study investigator. Thus, ethical concerns regarding subjects’ decision to participate are minimal. Justification for Using Placebo Assessment of the potential efficacy of a new comp ound for the treatment of major depression requires adequate and well- controlled clinical studies. Asthere are no approved treatments for the rapid reduction of symptoms of MDD, including suicidal ideation , a placebo controlled study conducted in the context of comprehensive standard of care treatment (ie, acute psychiatric hospitalization, the initiation of optimization standard of care antidepressant treatment, and close outpatient follow up) is ethically appropriate. Subjects will remain hospitalized for a recommended period of 5days, which is consistent with the typical length of stay for MDD patients who are hospitalized due to immi nent risk of suicide, and may stay shorter or longer if clinically warranted. Precautions to Ensure Subject Safety in the Study Subjects may participate in the study only if they have adequate capacity to give consent and after fully understanding the potential risks and giving an informed consent.

Subjects may discontinue the study at any time. The probability of receiving placebo and the concept of random assignment will be explained to the subject. Potential disadvantages and adverse events of participating in the study and alternative treatment options will be discussed. Importantly , the study will be conducted in the context of standard clinical care, including hospitalization the initiation or optimization of antidepressant treatment, and close outpatient follow up. Subjects will remain hospitalized for a recommended period of 5 days, which is consistent with the ty pical length of stay for MDD patients who are hospitalized due to immine nt risk of suicide, and may stay longer if clinically warranted. Subjects will receive standard of care antidepressant treatment beginning on Day 1. For subjects who do not respond during the study and are not willing or able to receive additional study drug treatment, clinical care will be arranged between the study investigator and or their physician. Compensation for any procedure will be fair per local standards and approved by the IECs/ IRBs for participating sites in order to not offer any undue incen tive to participate in the study . The investigator will ensure that subjects who withdraw from the study prior to completion are appropriatel y followed and/or transitioned for an y additional care required. Only qualified and experienced investigators will participate in the stud y. Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study and, during the study , subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue participation. They will be told tha t their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and potential adverse events of the study , and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled. The total blood volume to be collected is considered to be an acceptable amount of blood to be collected over this time period fr om the population in t his study and will be less than a Red Cross blood donation.3 16.2. Regulatory Ethics Compliance 16.2.1. Investigator Responsibilities The investigator is responsi ble for ensuring that the study is performed in accordance with the protocol, current ICH guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory and country -specific requirements.

The subject will be given sufficient time to read theICF and the opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and before entry into the study , consent should be appropriatel y recorded by means of the subject's personall y dated signature. After having obtained the consent, a copy of the ICFmust be given to the subject. Subjects will be asked for consent to provide optional samples for research (where local regulations permit). After informed consent for the study is appropriatel y obtained, the subject will be asked to sign and personall y date a separate ICFindicating agreement to participate in the optional research component . Refusal to participate in the optional research will not result in ineligibility for the stud y.A cop y of this signed ICF will be given to the subject. 16.2.4. Privacy of Personal Data The collection and processing of personal data from subjects enrolled in this study will be limited to those data that are necessary to fulfill the objectives of the study . These data must be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentialit y and compliance with applicable data privacy protection laws and regulations. Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data against unauthorized disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destructio n, or accidental loss or alteration must be put in place. Sponsor personnel whose responsibilities require access to personal data agree to keep the identit y of subjects confidential. The informed consent obtained from the subject includes explicit consent for the processing of personal data and for the investigator /institution to allow direct access to his or her original medical records (source data/documents) for study -related monitoring, audit, IEC/IRB review, and regulatory inspection. This consent also addresses the transfer of the data to other entities and to other countries. The subject has the right to request through the investigator access to his or her personal data and the right to request rectification of any data that are not correct or complete. Reasonable steps will be taken to respond to such a request, taking into consideration the nature of the request, the conditions of the study , and the applicable laws and regulations. Exploratory DNA, biomarker , andPK research is not conducted under standards appropriate for the return of data to subjects. In addition, the sponsor cannot make decisions as to the significance of any findings resulting from exploratory research. Therefore, exploratory research data will not be returned to subjects or investigators, unless required by lawor local regulations . Privacy and confidentiality of data generated in the future on stored samples will be protected by the same standards applicable to all other clinical data. NCT03097133"

If the electronic source system is utilized, references made to the eCRF in the protocol include the electronic source system but information collected through the electronic source system may not be limited to that found in the eCRF .Data in this system may be considered source documentation. 17.5. Case Report Form Completion Case report forms are prepared and provided by the spon sor for each subject in electronic format. All eCRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by the investigator or authorized study -site personnel. The investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRF are accurate and correct. Electronic data capture (eDC) will be used for this study . The study data will be transcribed by study -sitepersonnel from the source documents onto an eCRF , and transmitted in a secure manner to the sponsor within the timeframe agreed upon between the sponsor andthe study site. The electronic file will be considered to be the eCRF. Worksheets may be used for the capture of some data to facilitate completion of the eCRF . Any such worksheets will become part of the subject's source document s. Data must be entered into eCRF in English. The eCRF must be completed as soon as possible after a subject visit and the forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit. All subjective measurements (eg, scale information or oth er questionnaires) should be completed by the same individual who made the initial baseline determinations whenever possible. The investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct. All eCRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by the investigator or other authorized study - site personnel. If necessary , queries will be generated in the eDC tool. If corrections to a eCRF are needed after the initial entry into the eCRF , this can be done in either of the following ways: Investigator and study-site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own initiative or as a response to an auto query (generated by the eDC tool) . Sponsor or sponsor delegate can generate a query for resolution by the investigator and study -site personnel. 17.6. Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and study -site personnel before the study , periodic monitoring visits by the sponsor, and direct transmission of clinical laboratory data from a central laboratory into the sponsor's data base. Written instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples.

After upload of the data into the study database they will be verified for accuracy and consistency with the data sources. 17.7. Record Retention In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all eCRF and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial, and all study documents as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the respons ibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new custodian. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor . If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any documentation relating to this study , the investigator /institution must permit access to such reports. 17.8. Monitoring The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will record dates of the visits in a study site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first post- initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the monitor will compare data entered into the eCRF with the source documents (eg, hospital/clinic/phy sician’s office medical records) ; a sample may be reviewed. The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the eCRF are known to the sponsor and study -site personnel and are accessible for verification by the sponsor study -site contact. If electronic records are maintained at the study site, the method of verification must be discussed with the study -site personnel . NCT03097133"

Findings from this review will be discussed with the study -site personnel . The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be available, the source document swill be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct. In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the study at the site. Central monitoring will take place for data identified by the sponsor as requiring central review. 17.9. Study Completion/Termination 17.9.1. Study Completion /End of Study The study is considered completed with the last study assessment for the last subject participating in the study . The final data from the study site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after completion of the final subject assessment at that study site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement. 17.9.2. Study Termination The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time forany reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed. The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the earlyclosure of astudy site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/I RB or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the investigator Discontinuation of further study drug development 17.10. On-Site A udits Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality assurance department may visit the study site at any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance with regulat ory guidelines and company policy .

The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible for being present and available for consultation during routinely scheduled study -site audit visits conducted by the sponsor or its designees. Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by agents of any regulatory body, either as part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study in support of a regulatory submission. The investigator should immediately notify the sponsor if he or shehas been contacted b y a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection. 17.11. Use of Information and Publication All information, including but not limited to information regarding esketamine or the sponsor's operations (eg,patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, prior clinical data, formulation information) supplied by the sponsor to the investigator and not previously published, and any data, including pharmacogenomic orexploratory biomark er research data, generated as a result of this study , areconsidered confidential and remain the sole propert y of the sponsor. The investigator agrees to maintain this information in confidence and use this information only to accomplish this study, and will not use it for other purposes without the sponsor's pr ior written consent. The investigator understands that the information developed in the study will be used by the sponsor in connection with the continued development of esketamine , and thus may be disclosed as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory agencies. To permit the information derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide the sponsor with all data obtained in the study . The results of the study will be reported in a Clinical Study Report generated by the sponsor and will contain data from all study sites that participated in the study as per protocol . Recruitment performance or specific expertise related to the nature and the key assessment parameters of the study will be used to determine a coordinating investigator . Results of pharmacogenomic or exploratory biomarker analy ses performed after the Clinical Study Report has been issued will be reported in a separate report and will not require a revision of the Clinical Study Report. Study subject identifiers will not be used in publication o f results. Any work created in connection with performance of the study and contained in the data that can benefit from copy right protection (except any publication by the investigator as provided for below) shall be the propert y of the sponsor as author and owner of cop yright in such work.

The investigator has the right to publish study site-specific data after the primary data are published. If an investigator wishes to publish information from the study ,a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review at least 60days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by the sponsor in writing, theinvestigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60days to allow for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity or regulatory compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The sponsor will not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress information. Formulticenter study designs and substudy approaches, secondary results generall y should not be published before the primar y endpoints of a study have been published. Similarly , investigators will recognize the integrity of a multicenter study by not submitting for publication data derived from the individual study site until the combined results from the completed study have been submitted for publication, within 12 months of the availability of the final data (tables, listings, graphs), or the sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study publication. Authorship of publications resulting from this study will be based onthe guidelines on authorship, such as those described in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant contribution to the design of the study or analy sis and int erpretation of the data, provided critical review of the paper, and given final approval of the final version.

For the purposes of this study the following events will be considered anticipated events37for esketamine and major depressive disorder (MDD) (based on DSM -5):  Suicidal thinking, ideation, and behavior  Sleep changes, difficulty sleeping, reduced sleep, abnormal sleep, tiredness, fatigue, and reduced energy  Difficulty in sexual desire, performa nce or satisfaction  Reduced appetite and weight changes (loss or increase)  Activation or hypomania/ mania  Irritability, anger, and impulsive behavior  Agitation, tension, panic attacks, and phobia Reporting of Anticipated Events All adverse events will be recorded in the eCRF regardless of whether considered to be anticipated events and will be reported to thesponsor asdescribed in Section 12.3.1 , All Adverse Events . Any anticipated event that meets serious adverse event criteria will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section 12.3.2 , Serious Adverse Events. These anticipated events are exempt from expedited reporting as individual single cases to Health Authorities. However if based on an aggregate review, it is determined that an anticipated event is possibly related to study drug, the sponsor will report these events in an expedited manner. Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC) An Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC) will be established to perform reviews of pre-specified anticipated events at an aggregate level. The ARC is a saf ety committee within the sponsor’s organization that is independent of the sponsor’s study team. The ARC will meet to aid in the recommendation to the sponsor’s study team as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that an anticipated event is related to the study drug. Statistical Analysis Details of statistical analysis of anticipated events, including the frequency of review and threshold to trigger an aggregate analysis of anticipated events will be provided in a separate Anticipated Events Safety Monitoring Plan (ASMP).
