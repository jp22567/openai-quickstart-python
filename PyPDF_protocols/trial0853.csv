The overall rationale for this amendment is to corr ect inconsistencies in objectives and endpoints lis ted throughout the document and correct administrative errors. Summary of Changes for ANB020-006 Protocol Amendmen t 3 Affected Section(s) Summary of Revisions Made Rationale Global  Minor editorial and grammatical updates  Correction. Synopsis (secondary and exploratory objectives), Section 3  Moved Quality of Life (QoL) objective from secondary objectives to exploratory objectives  QoL endpoints will not be used for decision-making for future studies with etokimab. Synopsis (secondary and exploratory objectives), Section 3  Re-ordered secondary effectiveness endpoints to reflect the hierarchical order of statistical testing.  Identified secondary efficacy endpoints, which will undergo hierarchical statistical testing. All other efficacy endpoints were considered as exploratory endpoints.  Revised the list of endpoints in each section so that each relevant section of the protocol displays the same endpoints.  Hierarchical testing of secondary efficacy endpoints is being implemented as part of the Statistical Analysis Plan, therefore the protocol should also reflect the order of hierarchical testing of these endpoints.  All other secondary efficacy endpoints will not be used for decision making for future studies with etokimab.  The protocol was previously inconsistent in the presentation of endpoints in the different sections of the protocol."

Confidential 10 2 INTRODUCTION 2.1 STUDY RATIONALE Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous dis ease which manifests with mucosal inflammation of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Chronic rhi nosinusitis can be divided into 3 distinct clinical syndromes: CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) accoun ting for 20 to 33 percent of all CRS cases, and CRS without nasal polyposis and allergic fungal rhinosi nusitis accounting for 60 to 65% and 8 to 12% of al l CRS cases, respectively ( Meltzer et al., 2004 ). CRSwNP is characterized by the presence of multi ple polyps in the upper nasal cavity, originating from the ostiomeatal complex. It is the most aggressive form of CRS and causes significant morbidity and le ads to a diminished quality of life in CRS patients . Current treatment options for CRSwNP are limited an d typically include nonsystemic treatment with nasal corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, an tibiotic therapy, and the surgical removal of polyp s. Many patients achieve disease control with these st andard nonsystemic treatments. However, due to disease severity, treatment-related adverse reactio ns, or other factors, some patients do not achieve adequate disease control. Relapses after surgery ar e common in patients with CRSwNP, and thus, there is need for long term therapeutic control in CRS pa tients. CRSwNP is often associated with other atopic diseas es, with up to 50% of CRSwNP presenting with comorbid asthma ( Jarvis et al., 2012 ) though the contributions of these acute condition s to the development of CRSwNP is not well understood. Asthm a has been the most well-defined; approximately 88% of patients with asthma also have radiographic evidence of sino-nasal inflammation and approximately 26 to 48% of patients with asthma als o have been diagnosed with CRSwNP. Increased asthma severity has been linked to enhanced sino-na sal inflammation ( Stevens , et al., 2016 ). The close association of CRSwNP with atopic disorde rs, particularly asthma, has led to a series of cli nical studies with biologics that have shown efficacy in asthma. Two anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies (mepolizumab and reslizumab) and anti-immunoglobuli n E (IgE) (omalizumab) have been tested in clinical studies in CRS patients with overall encou raging results ( Chiarella et al., 2017 ). More recently dupilumab has also shown to provide benefit to CRSw NP patients ( Pauwels et al., 2015 ). These studies have demonstrated the utility of biologics in CRSwN P as a viable option to provide much-needed new therapeutic approaches. The underlying pathophysiology of CRSwNP is not wel l-defined. Several factors are thought to contribute to both the development of the disease a nd complications of treatment. An impaired sino- nasal epithelial barrier could allow for increased exposure to inhaled pathogens and antigens, which, in the setting of a dysregulated host-immune response, could encourage chronic inflammation ( Stevens , et al., 2016 ). Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a tissue-derived cytokine t hat induces and amplifies eosinophilic inflammation , has emerged as a promising new drug target for asth ma and allergic disease (Smith et al., 2017 ). Most recently, IL-33 has been detected in nasal polyps a nd a series of translational studies have highlight ed"
27,page_27,"Etokimab for Treatment of CRSwNP Amendment 3 Protocol ANB020-006 06 February 2020 AnaptysBio, Inc. Confidential 11 the potential central role of IL-33 in the pathogen esis of CRSwNP ( Song et al., 2017 ; Poposki et al., 2017 ; Zhang et al., 2017 ). A recent study by Smith et al. resequenced 100 g enes that were implicated in asthma to identify a novel sequence variant that di rectly correlated to eosinophil counts, as well as established asthma loci (IL-33 and IL1RL1) and demo nstrated that asthma risk is mediated through IL-33 and eosinophil counts are subsequently reduced, whi ch could reduce the recurrence of nasal polyps following surgery. This study provided a sound rati onale for the inhibition of the IL-33 pathway as an effective avenue to contain asthma. Since patients with concurrent CRSwNP and asthma require more sinus surgeries than patients with CRSwNP alone ( Stevens , et al., 2016 ), a significant clinical need to isolate and inhibit the IL-3 pathway is warranted. Etokimab is a powerful and efficient inhibitor of I L-33, and thus, etokimab potentially offers an additional and novel treatment approach to treat se vere CRSwNP patients who fail to respond to the current therapies. This Phase 2 study is intended to explore the activ ity of etokimab in adult subjects with CRSwNP. Etokimab is a highly effective inhibitor of IL-33, a cytokine that is considered to drive the pathogen ic cascade in asthma, atopic dermatitis (AD), and CRSw NP. Interleukin-33 directly affects eosinophil coun ts and function by acting on the early phases of the a topic immune response, which is upstream of current asthma treatments with clinically validated targets such as IL-5, IL-4, and IL-13. The possibility to influence complementary and synergistic pathways in volved in CRSwNP pathogenesis may provide a therapeutic improvement compared to the inhibition of single downstream pathways. This study will explore the effects of repeat doses of etokimab, ad ministered subcutaneously (SC), compared to placebo on validated endpoints, such as the Nasal P olyp Score (NPS) and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22). 2.2 BACKGROUND BACKGROUND OF DISEASE The main clinical symptoms observed in CRSwNP are n asal obstruction and congestion, reduction in or loss of sense of smell, anterior and posterior rhin orrhea, and facial pain. Patients with CRSwNP also report the presence of either anterior or posterior rhinorrhea, along with nasal congestion, hyposmia and/or facial pressure or pain lasting for >12 week s in duration ( Stevens , et al., 2016 ). CRSwNP is the most aggressive form of CRS and causes significant morbidity and leads to a diminished quality of life in CRS patients. It is most often diagnosed between 40 and 60 years of age and is more common in males, though females are often found to have a more aggre ssive disease course than males ( Stevens , et al., 2016 ). The polyps which occur are detected by a series of instrumental approaches mainly by endoscopy also supported by CT scans. CRSwNP is the most difficult type of CRS to be sati sfactorily treated and often relapses even after surgical treatment. CRSwNP is a common condition ob served in up to 5% percent of the US and European population ( Stevens et al., 2016 ). Recently, it has been suggested that the severit y of CRSwNP is associated with high levels of eosinophils and i ndeed the presence of eosinophils in tissue or airw ay"
28,page_28,"Etokimab for Treatment of CRSwNP Amendment 3 Protocol ANB020-006 06 February 2020 AnaptysBio, Inc. Confidential 12 secretions greatly increases the risk of recurrent disease in CRSwNP patients after endoscopic sinus surgery ( Vlaminck et al., 2014 ). Although the pathogenic cascade controlling CRSwNP has not yet been fully elucidated, mounting evidence indicates that CRSwNP shares common pathog enic pathways with asthma, particularly eosinophilic asthma. This is supported by the clini cal evidence of CRSwNP severity correlating with eosinophils levels ( Vlaminck et al., 2014 ). The close association of CRSwNP with atopic diso rders, particularly asthma, has led to a series of clinica l studies with biologics that have shown efficacy i n asthma. Thus, 2 anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies (me polizumab and reslizumab) have been tested in clinical studies in CRS patients ( Chiarella et al., 2017 ). Also, anti-IgE (omalizumab) has been tested in these patients with overall encouraging results ( Chiarella et al., 2017 ). More recently, dupilumab has also shown to provide benefit to CRS patients ( Paulweis et al., 2015 ). All these studies have indicated that the use of biologics in CRSwNP patients is now considered a viable option to provide the much- needed new therapeutic approaches. Although the pathogenesis of nasal polyps is not fu lly understood, it is believed that an atopic (Th2) response drives the cascade. Eosinophils are the pr edominant inflammatory cell found in the sinuses and nasal polyps and are frequently associated with asthma and aspirin sensitivity ( Ponikau et al., 2005 ). Indeed, the large majority of CRSwNP patients have eosinophilic upper airway inflammation. There is evidence indicating that the magnitude of sinomucos al involvement, polyp size, and severity of nasal disease correlate with the extent of eosinophilic i nflammation ( Zacharek, et al, 2003 ). Therefore, eosinophils and eosinophilic products are considere d the key players of the inflammatory response observed in nasal polyps. In this context, a series of cytokines (ie, IL-5) and mediators (cationic pr otein, eotaxin) involved in eosinophil activation are elev ated in the nasal polyp specimens ( Bhattacharyya et al., 2001 ). Most recently IL-33 has been detected in nasal poly ps and a series of translational studies have highlighted the potential central role of IL-33 in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP ( Soyka et al., 2015 ; Lam et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, in human subjects with a polymorphi sm of the IL-33 receptor (ST2), which confers protection from asthma, low levels of eosin ophils have been observed in their periphery ( Smith et al., 2017 ). Interleukin-33 also potentially activates innate lymphoid cell 2 (ILC2) to release cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 which amplify the pat hogenic Th2 response. Etokimab is a powerful and efficient inhibitor of IL-33, and thus, etokimab po tentially offers an additional and novel treatment approach to treat severe CRSwNP patients who fail t o respond to the current therapies. BACKGROUND OF ETOKIMAB Etokimab (previously known as ANB020) is a first-in -class, anti-IL-33 therapeutic antibody to treat Th 2 cell driven inflammatory diseases with underlying I L-33 dysregulation. Etokimab is a humanized immunoglobulin subtype G1/kappa (IgG1/kappa) monocl onal antibody (mAb) that specifically neutralizes the biological effects of human IL-33. Interleukin 33, a member of the IL-1 superfamily (Pastorelli et al., 2010 ) is a multifunctional cytokine that plays an impor tant role in Th2 mediated cellular immunity and in the pathogenesis of atopic diseases (Liew et al., 2012 ; Nabe et al., 2014 ). Etokimab"
29,page_29,"Etokimab for Treatment of CRSwNP Amendment 3 Protocol ANB020-006 06 February 2020 AnaptysBio, Inc. Confidential 13 binds to and inhibits the interaction of IL-33 with its specific cell surface receptor (ST2), thereby, blocking IL-33 driven downstream signaling and subs equent cellular responses. It is being developed fo r the treatment of atopic diseases such as asthma, AD , and food allergies. 2.2.2.1 NONCLINICAL STUDIES WITH ETOKIMAB Etokimab is being developed by AnaptysBio Inc. as a lead drug candidate and exhibits strong inhibitory activity for human as well as cynomolgus monkey IL- 33. Nonclinical data obtained from studies with etokimab in primary human and cynomolgus monkey cel ls, and from in vivo nonhuman primate studies demonstrated that: • Etokimab shows reactivity with human and cynomolg us monkey IL-33 , but not with mouse or rat IL-33. • In primary human and cynomolgus monkey cell popul ations, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human whole blood, etokimab inhibited IL- 33 induced interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production. In human basophils, etokimab also inhib ited IL-33 induced IL 5 production. • Etokimab can reduce eosinophilia in mice treated with human IL-33. • The observed serum apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2) of etokimab in cynomolgus monkeys was 160 hours after a single intravenous (IV) dose admi nistration, and 187 hours after a single subcutaneous (SC) dose administration at 10 mg/kg, consistent with the anticipated PK characteristics for a human IgG1 scaffold mAb in th e monkey. • Multiple dose, good laboratory practice (GLP)- co mpliant toxicology and toxicokinetic studies (4-, 13-, and 26-week duration with recovery phase) have been conducted with etokimab administered by SC and intravenous (IV) injection to cynomolgus monkeys. These studies produced no significant test article-related effects, and established a No Observed Adverse Effect Level of the highest dose tested. These data, together with nonclinical safety data g enerated, support a strong scientific rationale for advancing etokimab into clinical development. For detailed nonclinical experience with etokimab, refer to the etokimab Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 2.2.2.2 CLINICAL STUDIES WITH ETOKIMAB Currently, clinical findings from 2 completed clini cal studies of etokimab (Studies ANB020-001 and ANB020-002) are available and summarized below.

Of thes e 64 subjects, 24 subjects received etokimab by SC injection (6 each at dose levels of 10, 40, 100, an d 300 mg); 24 subjects received etokimab by IV infu sion (6 each at dose levels of 40, 100, 300 and 750 mg); 8 subjects received placebo by SC injection; and 8 subjects received placebo by IV infusion. In the single dose portion of the study, etokimab was well tolerated in male and female healthy volunteers, ag es 19 to 44 years, when administered a single dose of etokimab of up to 300 mg SC and up to 750 mg IV. A total of 81% of subjects in the placebo group an d 79% of subjects in the etokimab group had at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the study. The most commonly reported TEAEs were up per respiratory tract infection (etokimab 48%, placebo 50%), headache (etokimab 27%, placebo 31%), abdominal pain (etokimab 6%, placebo 0%), nausea (etokimab 4%, placebo 0%), vomiting (etokima b 4%, placebo 0%), urticaria (etokimab 4%, placebo 0%), and fatigue (etokimab 4%, placebo 0%). In the SAD cohort, 1 SAE/SUSAR occurred in a subjec t who was randomly assigned to etokimab (750 mg) as a single IV injection. The subject developed sev ere neutropenia (0.2  109/L) on Day 22 postdose. The neutrophils level remained clinically significantly low (0.3  109/L) on Day 24, but the level returned within normal range by Day 29. No direct role of IL -33 inhibition was noted in this reported SAE of neutropenia. The multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase of the stud y, 32 subjects were enrolled into 4 treatment arms of 8 subjects each (6 etokimab + 2 placebo per trea tment arm). Of the 32 subjects enrolled, 18 subject s received etokimab by IV infusion (6 each at dose le vels of 40, 100, and 300 mg weekly); 6 subjects received etokimab by SC injection (at a dose level of 100 mg weekly); 6 subjects received multiple dos es of placebo by IV infusion; and 2 subjects received multiple doses of placebo by SC injection. In the multiple dose portion of the study, etokimab was we ll tolerated in healthy male and female adult volunteers ages 18 to 45 years, when administered o nce-weekly for 4 weeks at 100 mg SC and at up to 300 mg as a multiple dose IV. A total of 24 subject s (75%) had at least 1 TEAE, including, 5 of 6 subj ects (83%) following SC injection of etokimab, 13 of 18 subjects (72%) following IV infusion of etokimab, a nd 6 of 8 subjects (75%) following administration of p lacebo, with a total of 45 TEAEs. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild in severity (25 of 45 AEs, 56% of all AEs); 19 AEs (42%) were classified as moderate; and 1 AE was classified as severe (2%). Treatment-emergent AEs deemed to be related to study drug administration were reported in 17 of 32 subjects (53%). Of the TEAEs deemed to be related to study drug, 2 AEs were reported in 2 subjects (33%) who received etokimab SC, 14 AEs were reported in 11 subjects (61%) who received eto kimab via IV infusion, and 4 AEs were reported in 4 subjects (50%) who received placebo. Of the AEs d eemed related to study drug, 8 AEs were mild in severity, 12 AEs were moderate in severity and 1 wa s considered severe.

The predicted etokimab hal f-life is approximately 14 days. Results from the emergent data will serve as basis for the route of administration of Etokimab in future studies. 2.2.2.2.2 STUDY ANB020-002 Study ANB020-002 was a Phase 2a, proof-of-concept, placebo-controlled, open-label study that evaluated the etokimab activity upon house dust mit e (HDM) skin challenge in 12 subjects with moderate to severe AD at a single center in the Uni ted Kingdom. This study was also conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of Etokimab in s ubjects with moderate to severe AD. All 12 subjects included in the safety analysis set experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study. Duri ng the placebo period (from Day 1 to Day 8 prior to et okimab administration), 8 (66.7%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE and after administratio n of etokimab (on Day 8), 11 (91.7%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE. A total of 10 (83.3%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE considered related to etokimab by the Investigator. No severe TEAE was reported, and no subject died during the study. Only 1 (8.3%) subject experienced an SAE (ex acerbation of pre-existing depression) after etokimab administration of severe intensity and con sidered to be unrelated to study drug. None of the subjects discontinued the study due to a TEAE. The most commonly reported TEAEs were dizziness and headache (3 subjects [25%] each) followed by upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infectio n, peripheral swelling, cough, and urticaria (2 subjec ts [16.7%] each). A total of 10 subjects experience d at least 1 TEAE considered related to etokimab by the Investigator during the study. The most commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs urinary tract infe ction, and urticaria (2 [16.7%] subjects each). Anti-drug antibodies titers were low and with no ap parent effect on etokimab exposure. The mean (SD) total Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score decreased statistically significantly after the administration of etokimab. On Day 15, th e mean (SD) total EASI score was 19.2 (14.01) and the mean treatment difference from baseline in the total EASI score was -10.8. On Day 22 and Day 36, the mean treatment difference from baseline in the total EASI score was -16.3 (p-value<0.0001) and - 17.5 (p-value=0.0008), respectively. The effect of etokimab showed a statistically significant decreas e over time in total EASI scores as compared with bas eline. After administration of etokimab (after Day 8 visit ), no subject was reported by the Investigator to h ave an immunoglobulin A (IgA) score of Grade 5 and ther e was a trend over time for the IgA scores to become less severe. The shift table for the first p ost etokimab administration assessment on Day 15 showed that 3 (25%) subjects who were Grade 5 at ba seline improved to Grade 4; on Day 22, 3 (25%) subjects who were Grade 5 at baseline improved to G rade 4; and on Day 36, 2 (16.7%) subjects who were Grade 5 at baseline improved to Grade 4 and 1 (8.3%) subject who was Grade 5 at baseline improved to Grade 3. At the end of study (EOS) visi t, most of the subjects (8 [66.7%] subjects) were Grade 4. Three (25%) subjects who were Grade 5 at b aseline improved to Grade 4 at the EOS visit. The total Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score decreased statistically significantly after the administration of etokimab. On Day 15, the mean (SD ) total SCORAD score was 43.82 (17.753) and the mean treatment difference from baseline in the tota l SCORAD score was -16.23 (p-value<0.0001). On"

The change from baseline of total SCORAD score was statistically significant at all visits p ost etokimab administration. The Dermatology Life Quality Index and 5D Itch Scal e scores indicated efficacy of etokimab at postdose visits particularly on Days 15, 22, and 36, but wit h declining efficacy at the later visits. 2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS Etokimab has been extensively tested in animals and there were no etokimab-related adverse findings. The administration of etokimab had no effect on hem atology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis test results. Etokimab was found to be s afe and well tolerated in a Phase 1 study (ANB020-001) in healthy subjects. There were no dea ths during the study. In the Phase 1 SAD study, no change in vital signs (blood pressure [BP], hear t rate [HR], electrocardiogram [ECG], or body temperature) were noted. Hematology parameters, suc h as erythrocyte, white blood cell and platelet counts were all within the normal range except in 1 volunteer in the 750 mg dose group, who reported a serious adverse event (SAE) of neutropenia consider ed as possibly related to the study treatment. All others did not show any modification or trend relat ed to etokimab dosing. Serum chemistry results were also all in the normal range. A total of 81% subjects in the placebo grou p and 79% subjects in the etokimab group had at least 1 TEAE during the study. The most commonly reported TEAEs of mild to moderate intensity includ ed upper respiratory tract infection (50% versus 48 % in placebo and etokimab group, respectively) and he adache (32% versus 27% in placebo and etokimab group, respectively). No AEs were deemed by the Inv estigator to be related to etokimab. Of all the AEs reported across all dose groups, 44% were reported as possible related and 36% were reported as unrelated. One SAE of decreased neutrophils was rep orted in the 750 mg dose group which resolved prior to the study completion with no sequelae. No other observations of decreased neutrophils were observed. No dose-dependent AE presentation was evi dent. There were no SAEs in MAD phase of the study. One s evere AE of elevated transaminase was reported in the MAD phase of the study. Of the 32 subjects, 24 reported a total of 45 TEAEs; 5 of 6 subjects (8 3%) following SC administration, 13 of 18 subjects (72% ) following IV administration, and 6 of 8 subjects (75%) following placebo administration. Most of the AEs were mild in severity (25 of 45 [56%] subjects ), 19 (42%) AEs were considered moderate and 1 AE was classified as severe AE (2%). Of the 32 subjects, 17 subjects (53%) reported TEAEs considered related to the study drug. Of these, 2 AEs were reported i n 2 subjects (33%) who received etokimab via IV infus ion and 4 AEs were reported in 4 subjects who received placebo. The most commonly reported AEs we re headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and abdominal pain. Although there is no evidence to date for an allerg ic or immunologic reaction to etokimab, such a reaction to any drug is possible. Symptoms of aller gic reactions can include rash, wheezing or difficu lty"

Based on clinical studies with other mAbs, subjects in this mAb study may experience symptoms of an immune reaction to the drug, also known as ‘cytokin e release syndrome.’ These symptoms of this vary dramatically but can include: • Mild to moderate fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting. • Moderate to severe symptoms such as edema (swelli ng of the skin), hypotension (low BP), and pulmonary infiltrates (eg, blood and mucus in the l ung). Details about specific risks for subjects in this c linical trial can be found in the etokimab IB and I CF. KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS A subject with CRSwNP may or may not receive direct benefit from participating in this study. Details about specific benefits for subjects in this clinic al study are provided in the etokimab IB and ICF. Based upon the inhibition of IL-33 by the study dru g and preclinical study and early Phase 2, results, subjects with CRSwNP who are randomized to active t reatment may benefit from treatment with etokimab. Participation in this study may help deve lop important scientific knowledge that could contribute to the development of a new novel medica tion to be used in the treatment of subjects who suffer from AD, asthma, and food allergies. ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS In clinical development to date, etokimab (administ ered by SC or IV) has been shown to be generally well tolerated at all dose levels without any syste mic or local safety concerns."

The total study duration will be approximat ely 28 weeks. A Sponsor-designated centralized reader will be use d to confirm the diagnosis of CRSwNP as assessed by nasal endoscopy, CT scan of sinuses, and symptom sc oring to reduce the risk of interpretation variatio n. This study has 3 periods: a 4-week screening period (maximum of 31 days), with a minimum MFNS run-in of 20 days prior to the administration of st udy drug on Day 1; a 16-week treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16); and an 8-week safety follow-up perio d. During the screening period, all subjects will unde rgo evaluation for eligibility. Subjects will be ra ndomly assigned on Day 1 to one of the following 3 treatme nt arms in a 1:1:1 ratio:  Etokimab 300 mg load + 150 mg SC every 4 weeks (Wee ks 0, 4, 8, and 12)  Etokimab 300 mg load + 150 mg SC every 8 weeks (Wee ks 0 and 8) and placebo (Weeks 4 and 12)  Placebo (Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12) Eligible subjects will be administered study drug S C during onsite visits on Day 1 (Week 0), Day 29 (Week 4), Day 57 (Week 8), and Day 85 (Week 12). Su bjects will remain onsite for 2 hours for post-dose observation following the initial (Week 0/Day1) stu dy drug injection. Additional visits will occur on Day 5 (Week 1) and Day 113 (Week 16) during the treatment period. During the safety follow-up period, subjects will return to the study center on Day 141 (Week 20) and Day 169 (Week 24) EOS (see Section 1.3). Subjects will also be provided MFNS for use during the trial and are required to undergo a minimum run-in period of 20 days prior to Day 1 with approx imately 80% compliance. Subjects will use MFNS of 2 actuations (50 μg/actuation) in each alternate no stril twice daily (BID), total daily dose of 400 μg ,"

If physician lowers dose regimen due to intolerance, compliance will be based on lower dose. Any changes to the MFNS must be documented and recorded in eCRF. Serum samples for PK and immunogenicity will be col lected before the administration of study drug and at the other time points specified in the SOA (see Section 1.3). Safety assessments including AE/SAE monitoring, vit al signs, physical examinations, ECGs, and laboratory measurements will be performed as specif ied in the SOA (see Section 1.3). 4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN This Phase 2 study will explore the activity of eto kimab in adult subjects with moderate to severe CRSwNP. Etokimab is a highly effective inhibitor of IL-33, a cytokine that is considered to drive the pathogenic cascade in asthma, AD, and CRSwNP. Inter leukin-33 directly affects eosinophil counts and function by acting on the early phases of the atopi c immune response, which is upstream of current asthma treatments with clinically validated targets such as IL-5, IL-4, and IL-13. The possibility to influence complementary and synergistic pathways in volved in CRSwNP pathogenesis may provide a therapeutic improvement compared to the inhibition of single downstream pathways. This study will explore the effects of repeat doses of etokimab, ad ministered SC over a 16-week treatment period, compared to placebo on validated endpoints, such as the NPS and SNOT-22. 4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE Data from the etokimab Phase 1 (ANB020-001) and Pha se 2a (ANB020-002) studies are the basis for the selection of the dose of etokimab for the current s tudy. The dose range of etokimab selected for this study has been used safely in study ANB020-001. Eto kimab pharmacodynamic activity, measured as inhibition of ex-vivo IL-33 stimulated INF-γ produc tion, can be inferred from the correlation with PK data. All of the selected dose levels of etokimab a re predicted to induce full IL-33 inhibition within 2 days for at least 9 to 10 days after dosing. The administration of etokimab loading doses will allow systemic concentrations to reach serum concentratio ns sustaining more than 95% IL-33 inhibition faster , potentially reducing the time to onset of clinical effect. Data from the Phase 2a study show a clinica l response 1 week after etokimab administration (300 mg IV), and the dose was found to be safe and well tolerated. One month after etokimab administration, the average EASI score reduction was 61% and the average pruritus reduction was 32% relative to base line. Sustained clinical response was observed afte r 2 months after etokimab administration. 4.4 END OF STUDY DEFINITION A subject is considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all scheduled study visits, including the last visit or the last schedu led procedure, as shown in the Schedule of Activiti es (SoA), Section 1.3."

The Pharmacy Manual s hould be referred to for additional information and details. ETOKIMAB FORMULATION, APPEARANCE, PACKAGING, AND LA BELING Etokimab is a sterile, colorless to slightly yellow ish solution that is formulated at Each single-use vial contains of solution and of etokimab. Identically matched placebo is supplied as a soluti on in single-use vials that contain active drug pro duct. All IP vials will be packaged and labeled in accord ance with all applicable laws and regulations. ETOKIMAB STORAGE AND STABILITY Etokimab or placebo vials must be refrigerated at 2 °C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) until the day of use. Etok imab or placebo should not be used beyond the retest or expiration date provided by the manufacturer. Vial contents should not be frozen or shaken. Etokimab o r placebo may be stored at room temperature ( 8°C to 25°C [46°F to 77°F]) in the undiluted and/o r diluted state for a maximum of 8 hours. Vials are intended for single-use only; therefore, any remain ing solution should be discarded. Compatibility testing has shown that etokimab is stable and does not adsorb to the polyethylene or polypropylene syringes or standard hypodermic needles. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT PREPARATION Investigational product (study drug or placebo) wil l be prepared by a trained dose preparer. Dose preparation records will be completed and securely maintained by the dose preparer. Both etokimab and placebo have the same appearance in the syringe , thereby ensuring that the study team and subjects will remain blinded to study treatment. Sy ringes of etokimab and placebo will be prepared based on treatment group assignment. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT DOSING INSTRUCTIONS Dosing instructions for study drug (etokimab and pl acebo) will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. Injections of study drug will be administered follo wing clinic procedures and blood collection at scheduled visits during the randomized treatment pe riod (see SoA, Section 1.3). Subjects will be monitored for 2 hours by the Inves tigator or study personnel after the initial (Week 0/Day 1) injection of study drug, for any sig ns or symptoms of a local site injection or"

Subjects with any ongoin g treatment-emergent AEs or SAEs at the time of scheduled discharge from the study center should re main at the study center until the Investigator has determined that these events have been resolved or deemed as not clinically significant. Subjects are not required to remain onsite after follow-up injec tions (Weeks 4, 8, and 12) unless deemed necessary by the Investigator, if there have been injection s ite reactions, or other AEs are noted. MOMETASONE FUROATE NASAL SPRAY FORMULATION, APPEARA NCE, PACKAGING, AND LABELING Mometasone furoate, the active component of MFNS, 5 0 μg, is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid having the chemical name, 9,21-Dichloro-11ß,17-dihy droxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20- dione17-(2 furoate). Mometasone furoate is a white to off-white powder, with a molecular formula of C 27 H30 C12 O6 and a molecular weight of 521.43 g/mol. It is practically insoluble in water; slightly soluble in methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol; soluble in acetone and ch loroform; and freely soluble in tetrahydrofuran. It s partition coefficient between octanol and water is >5000. Mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 μg is a metered-d ose, manual pump spray unit containing an aqueous suspension of 0.05% w/w mometasone furoate in an aqueous medium containing benzalkonium chloride, citric acid, glycerin, micro crystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium, polysorbate 80 and sodium citrate. The pH i s between 4.3 and 4.9. Each bottle contains 120 metered sprays. MOMETASONE FUROATE NASAL SPRAY FORMULATION-DOSING I NSTRUCTIONS Subjects will also be provided MFNS for use during the trial. Subjects will use MFNS of 2 actuations (50 μg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily (BID) , total daily dose of 400 μg, throughout the study, unless they are intolerant to BID INCS in which cas e, subjects can stay on the lower dose regimen of 1 actuation (50 μg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily (BID), total daily dose of 200 μg, additional decreases should be discussed with the Medical Moni tor. If the Investigator lowers the dose regimen due to intolerance, compliance will be based on lower dose . Any changes to the MFNS must be documented and reco rded in eCRF. 6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDI NG RANDOMIZATION This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controll ed, parallel-group study with limited access to the randomization code. All subjects will be centrally assigned to randomized study treatment using an Interactive Web Response System (IXRS). As subjects become eligible, they will be assigned sequential"
45,page_45,"Etokimab for Treatment of CRSwNP Amendment 3 Protocol ANB020-006 06 February 2020 AnaptysBio, Inc. Confidential 29 randomization numbers which will be used to assign the allocated treatment based on a randomization schedule. Before the study is initiated, the teleph one number and call-in directions for the IXRS and/ or the log in information and directions for the IXRS will be provided to each study center. Study treatm ent will be prepared and dispensed at the study visits by a pharmacist or designee as summarized in Section 6.2.4 and the Pharmacy Manual; the visits at which this will occur are summarized in the SoA (Section 1.3). Eligible subjects will be randomized on Day 1 to 1 of 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio (see Section 6.1.2 ), based on a computer-generated randomization schedul e prepared by or under the supervision of the Sponsor. The randomization will be stratified by as thma comorbidity. The IXRS will assign a unique treatment code, which will dictate the treatment as signment and matching study drug kit for the subject. The pharmacist or designee will not be awa re of treatment assignment (etokimab or placebo) and will be provided only kit numbers to assign stu dy drug. All calls resulting in an unblinding event are reco rded and reported by the IXRS. If a subject’s treat ment assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be notifi ed within 24 hours after breaking the blind without informing the Sponsor of the treatment assignment. The date and reason that the blind was broken, but not the treatment assignment, must be recorded in t he source documentation eCRF, as applicable. The assessments of efficacy will be performed by th e Investigator or qualified designee, who is blinde d to the subject’s treatment group assignment. When a ll of the study data have been entered into the study database and verified, the randomization code will be broken for data analysis. BLINDING Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken until all subjects have completed the double-blind phase of study and the database is fin alized. Otherwise, the blind should be broken only if specific emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by knowing the treatment the subject is receiving. In such cases, the Investigator may i n an emergency determine the identity of the treatm ent by IXRS. Telephone contact with the Sponsor or its designee will be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The IXRS will be programmed with blind-breaking ins tructions. In case of an emergency, the Investigato r has the sole responsibility for determining if unbl inding of a subject’s treatment assignment is warranted. Subject’s safety must always be the firs t consideration in making such a determination and unblinding should be performed only if the subject’ s well-being requires knowledge of the subject’s treatment assignment, or if requested by the Data S afety Monitoring Board (DSMB). In the event the blind is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, time, an d reason for the unblinding must be documented by the Investigator in the appropriate section of the eCRF, and in the source document. The documentation received from the Interactive Web Response System indicating the code break must be retained w ith the subject’s source documents in a secure manner (eg, sealed envelope) so as not to unblind t he treatment assignment to the study site,"

Any departures from the intended regimen must be captured in the eCRFs and will be recorded as a protocol deviation. 6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY For this protocol, a prescription medication is def ined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a properly authorized/licensed clinician. Medications to be reported in the eCRF are concomitant prescription medications, over-the-counter medicatio ns and supplements. Any medication, or vaccine (including over-the-coun ter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving a t the time of enrollment and during the study must be recorded on the eCRF. The medical monitor should be contacted if there ar e any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy. A list of prohibited medications is provided in Appendix A . RESCUE MEDICINE Use of rescue medication (eg, systemic corticostero id) is not permitted in this study (except MFNS as supplied per protocol). If a subject receives syste mic rescue treatment the subject will be discontinu ed from the study and should return for a final Early Termination Visit (ETV) within 30 days from last do se. Study procedures should be completed according to t he ETV/EOS per Section 1.3. In the case of ongoing AEs/SAEs, the subject should be followed up until i t has resolved or stable outcome or subject is lost to follow-up. The date and time of rescue medication a dministration, as well as the name and dosage regimen of the rescue medication, must be recorded into the eCRF/study database by study center personnel. 6.6 DOSE MODIFICATION No dose modification is allowed in this study. Stud y treatment can be interrupted temporarily or permanently if deemed necessary as per the Investig ator’s discretion. Any interruption should be discussed with the medical monitor in advance but n o later than 24 hours after it has occurred. 6.7 TREATMENT AFTER THE END OF THE STUDY All subjects will return to the study center for th e EOS (Day 169) or ETV for final safety and EOS assessments.

The medical monitor should be informed. Restarting stud y treatment at the next scheduled administration study visits can be done after discussion with the medical monitor. In the case of discontinuation from study treatment the subject should return for an ETV within 30 day s from last dose and will be encouraged to complete t heir remaining clinic visits as planned. Study procedures should be completed according to the (ET V)/(EOV) per Section 1.3. Ongoing AEs/SAEs, the patient should be followed up until it has resolved or stable outcome or subject is lost to follow-up. If a clinically significant finding is identified ( including, but not limited to changes from baseline ) after enrollment, the Investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant f inding will be reported as an AE. In case of early withdrawal from the study, the sub ject will be required to return as noted above for ETV. Procedures should be completed in accordance with t he SoA (see Section 1.3) Week 24/ETV. If an ETV occurs within 7 days of the previous visi t lab re-draws are not required unless clinically significant labs were noted. 7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STU DY Subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. An Investigator must discontinue or withdraw a subj ect from the study and follow for safety for the following reasons:  Any subject becomes pregnant or indicates they are planning to become pregnant during the study  Any LFT abnormality that meets the following criter ia require discontinuation: o If a subject has at any time post-initial dose an A ST or ALT >5-8x ULN for more than 2 weeks, discontinue dosing; or o AST or ALT >8x ULN, irrespective of duration discon tinue dosing; or o Concurrent AST or ALT >3x ULN and total bilirubin > 2x ULN discontinue dosing.

If a subject withdraws consent because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason f or withdrawal. In the event of early discontinuation, the subject should be asked to return to the study center to complete the assessments specified in the ETV. If at any time during the study, the investigator d etermines that it is not in the best interest of th e subject to continue, the subject will be discontinu ed from participation. The Investigator can discont inue a subject at any time if medically necessary. Appro priate documentation in the subject’s study record and eCRF regarding the reason for discontinuation m ust be completed. Prior to discontinuing a subject from study participation, the Investigator will dis cuss his/her intentions with the medical monitor or designee. All subjects who fail to return to the study center for the required follow-up visits will be contacte d by phone to determine the reason(s) why the subject fa iled to return for the necessary visit or elected t o discontinue from the study. If a subject is unreach able by telephone after a minimum of 2 documented attempts (one attempt on 2 different days), a regis tered letter will be sent requesting that contact b e made with the Investigator. The Sponsor has the right to terminate or to stop t he study at any time. Should this be necessary, bot h the Sponsor and the Investigator will ensure that p roper study discontinuation procedures are completed. Subjects who sign the ICF and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be replaced. Subjects who sign the ICF, and are random ized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or disconti nued from the study, will not be replaced. 7.3 LOST TO FOLLOW-UP Study center personnel will attempt to contact the subject and reschedule any missed visit as soon as possible, if it does not fall within the next visit ’s window, and counsel the subject on the importanc e of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascerta in if the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study. If the re-scheduled visit falls within t he next visit’s window, then the visit should be considered a missed visit and the subject should co me in for the next scheduled visit as planned.

These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s medi cal record or study file.  Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he o r she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to fol low-up. 8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS As part of study preparations, Investigators will r eceive standardized training on the efficacy assessments in this study. The same Investigator wi ll perform all efficacy assessments for a given subject, as practical given the long study follow-u p duration. NASAL ENDOSCOPY AND NASAL POLYP SCORE Nasal endoscopy is one of the co-primary endpoints in the study (ie, change in NPS from baseline to Week 16). It will be performed according to the SoA (see Section 1.3), if the endoscopy is performed onsite during the study visit, it should occur afte r study assessments (eg, QoL assessments, labs, UPS IT, etc.) have been completed and preceded by local adm inistration of anesthetic drugs in combination with a decongestant. The nasal endoscopy must be pe rformed prior to dosing on Day 1, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12. The Day 1 endoscopy can be sch eduled up to 5 days prior to the Day 1 visit; visit windows can be utilized for scheduling follow-up na sal endoscopies. For the analysis of primary endpoint, central reading of Day 1 will be used for comparison with central reading at Week 16. The sites will remove subject-identifying information f rom the imaging data header and label with subject ID prior to sending the imaging data to the central re ader. Standard video sequences of the nasal endoscopy wil l be downloaded or sent to a Sponsor-designated centralized reader at the completion of the visit f or adjudication. Nasal endoscopy will be performed using centralized imaging data assessments and scor ing by an independent reviewer for the imaging data will be performed for all endoscopies. To confi rm eligibility at Study Day 1, only the screening v isit pass/fail results will be made available to the stu dy center.

Confidential 34 SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) The SNOT-22 is one of the co-primary endpoints of t he study (ie, change in SNOT-22 from baseline to Week 16). It is a 22-item outcome measure on a 5-ca tegory scale applicable to sino-nasal conditions an d surgical treatments. The score ranges from 0 to 110 . Higher total scores on the SNOT-22 imply greater impact of CRS on QoL. The questionnaire was found e asy to use (time to completion is approximately 7 minutes) and provided good discriminant validity (Hopkins et al., 2009 ). The SNOT-22 was validated and recommended for routine clinical practice. A Mi nimal Clinically Important Difference MCID is available:  8.90 ( Chowdhury et al., 2017 ; Steele et al., 2016 ; and Rudmik et al., 2015 ). The SNOT-22 will be completed as indicated in the S oA (see Section 1.3) and is located on the clinical tablet. This frequent SNOT-22 might provide a kinet ic profile of etokimab efficacy in subjects with CRSwNP. A sample SNOT-22 is provided in Appendix E . NASAL PEAK INSPIRATORY FLOW Nasal peak flow evaluation represents a physiologic measure of the air flow through both nasal cavitie s during forced inspiration and/or expiration express ed in liter per minute. The NPIF is the best valida ted technique for the evaluation of nasal flow through the nose. Nasal inspiration correlates most with th e subjective feeling of obstruction and is the best v alidated technique for monitoring nasal flow in cli nical trials. Taking the best of 3 outcomes with less than 10% va riation is considered to be the best means of expression of the result ( Juniper et al., 2004 ). All 3 values will be recorded by the subject in the diary, and the highest value will be used for evaluation. The procedure takes about 5 minutes. Baseline AM NPIF will be the mean AM measurement recorded for 7 consecutive days or 1 week during the screening period, prior to the first dose of IP, and baseline PM NPIF will be the mean PM measurement recorded for 7 consecutive days or 1 week during the screeni ng period, and prior to the first dose of IP. Basel ine will be the mean, averaged measurement from the 7-d ay period. At Screening (Visit 1), subjects will be issued an NPIF meter for recording morning (AM) and evening (PM) NPIF. Subjects will record values twice a day for 7 consecutive days during the screening period, and twice a day, every day throughout the treatment and safety follow-up period (Weeks 0-24), according to diary instructions. Subjects will be i nstructed on the use of the meter, and written instructions on the use of the NPIF meter will be p rovided to the subjects. In addition, the Investiga tor will instruct the subjects on how to record the fol lowing variables in the diary on a daily basis.  AM NPIF should be performed approximately 15 minute s after arising prior to taking MFNS  PM NPIF should be performed in the evening prior to taking MNFS Three NPIF efforts will be performed by the subject and recorded."

UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SMELL IDENTIFICATION TES T The UPSIT is a rapid and easy-to-administer method to quantitatively assess human olfactory function. It shows a high test-retest reliability (r: 0.981) and scores on this test are strongly correlated with t he detection threshold for phenyl ethyl alcohol in the same individuals. When the UPSIT is administered i n the standardized manner, clinical subjects show a h igh degree of uniformity in UPSIT performance when tested in different laboratories. The 40-odorant UPSIT is used in over 1500 clinics a nd laboratories throughout the US, Canada, South America, and Europe, and has been administered to n early 200,000 people since its development in the early 1980s. A particular strength of this test is that it provides an olfactory diagnosis based on comparing the subject's test score with normative d ata, providing a percentile score of an individual relative to his or her age-matched normal group. Fu rthermore, a clinician can distinguish subjects wit h a normal sense of smell (""normosmia"") from those with different levels of reduction (""mild, moderate and severe microsmia"") or loss (""anosmia"") ( Juniper et al., 2004 ). DISEASE-SPECIFIC TESTS AND ASSESSMENTS Computed tomography of the sinuses should be perfor med at Day 1 (Week 0) and at Day 113 (Week 16/EOT). Day 1 CT must be collected prior to dosing on Day 1. If necessary, the Day 1 CT can be collec ted prior to Day 1, however all efforts should be made to conduct CT after subject screening labs have bee n reviewed and it is determined subject is likely eli gible for the study. Any CTs collected within 3 mon ths of Visit 2 (Week 0) can be used for in lieu of a ne w CT at Day 1. For both Lund-Mackay scores and 3D volumetric measu rement of the maxillary sinus, the same acquisitions (sequences) will be used for centraliz ed imaging data assessments and scoring by an independent reviewer. Central reading of Visit 2 wi ll be used for comparison with EOT. The final resul ts of central reading will be made available after the study. Details on CTs will be available in a separ ate operational manual provided to the sites. 8.1.5.1 LUND-MACKAY SCORE Lund-Mackay system is based on localization with po ints given for degree of opacification: 0 = normal, 1 = partial opacification, 2 = total op acification. These points are then applied to the maxillary, anterior ethmoid, posterior ethmoid, sph enoid, frontal sinus on each side. The osteomeatal"

Confidential 36 complex is graded as 0 = not occluded, or 2 = occlu ded deriving a maximum score of 12 per side ( Lund and MacKay, 1993 ). This scoring system has been validated in severa l studies ( Metson et al., 1997 ; Oluwole et al., 1996 ). For patients in whom the osteomeatal complex (OC ) is missing (because of a previous surgery) the reader should consider the lo cation of the former OC and provide a scoring (as i f the OC was there). 8.1.5.2 3-DIMENSIONAL VOLUMETRIC MEASUREMENT OF THE MAXILLA RY SINUS This method is used to calculate: ( Deeb et al., 2011 )  the volume of the air (mL)  the volume of mucosa (mL)  % occupied by disease  thickness of lateral wall For the analysis, central reading before V2 will be used for comparison with EOT reading. The sites wi ll remove subject-identifying information from the ima ging data header prior to sending the imaging data to the central reader. The percent change in opacif ication from baseline to EOT will be calculated. POLYP BIOPSIES Study centers with the capability to perform a nasa l polyp biopsy and with consent of the subject, wil l collect samples as noted below. A baseline biopsy will be obtained at Day 1 (Week 0 ) of the study (before injection of the study drug) . After randomization, another biopsy of nasal polyp tissue will be obtained at Week 16. The complete details on tissue collection and proce ssing will be provided separately. Briefly, the biopsied polyp tissue will be weighed (mg) and then cut into cubes of approximately 0.5 cm in each dimension. All but one cube will be individually pl aced into labeled cryotubes and immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen, and then maintained at -70 C or colder until shipped on dry ice to a central s torage site or laboratory. Nasal polyp tissue will be subs equently assessed for various biomarkers of inflammation and disease process or response. Any r emaining tissue will be discarded within 5 years of the completion of the last visit for the last patie nt in the study. Additional information on collecti on, processing, storage, and shipment of samples is loc ated in the laboratory manual. WHOLE BLOOD SAMPLING AND DNA SAMPLING For those subjects who consent to whole blood RNA a nd DNA sampling, blood samples will be collected at timepoints as indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3) and sent to the central laboratory according to laboratory procedures.

The SF-36 is a 36-ite m questionnaire that measures 8 multi-item dimensions of health: physical functioning (10 item s) social functioning (2 items) role limitations du e to physical problems (4 items), role limitations due t o emotional problems (3 items), mental health (5 items), energy/vitality (4 items), pain (2 items ), and general health perception (5 items). For each dimension, item scores are coded, summed, and transformed on to a scale from 0 (worst possible health state measured by the questi onnaire) to 100 (best possible health state). Two standardized summary scores can also be calcula ted from the SF-36; the physical component summary and the mental health component summary. Th e time for completion is 5 to 10 minutes. The SF-36 will be completed as indicated in the SoA (see Section 1.3) and is located on the clinical tablet. A sample SF-36 is provided in Appendix F . 8.1.8.2 EUROPEAN QOL SCALE (EQ-5D) The EQ-5D is a standardized health-related QoL ques tionnaire developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal and inter-disease comparisons. The EQ-5D is designed for self-complet ion by subjects and takes only a few minutes to complete. The EQ-5D was used to study the impact on QoL for f ilgrastim administration in CRS patients, the score s improved though they were not statistically signifi cant ( Van Agthoven et al., 2001 ). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions : mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimens ion has 5 levels: no problem, some problems, severe problems. The EQ VAS records the respondent’ s self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. The EQ VAS ‘thermometer’ has endpoints of 10 0 (Best imaginable health state) at the top and 0 (Worst imaginable health state) at the bottom. The EQ-5D will be completed as indicated in the SoA (see Section 1.3) and is located on the clinical tablet. A sample EQ-5D is provided in Appendix G . 8.1.8.3 7-ITEM ASTHMA CONTROL QUESTIONNAIRE (ACQ-7) The ACQ-7 will be used in this study to assess the asthma symptoms (nocturnal waking, symptom on waking, activity limitation, and shortness of breat h, wheezing, and short acting β agonist [SABA] usag e) and FEV 1 measurement in subjects with active asthma disease . Subject will be asked to recall their"

Confidential 38 experiences during the previous week by responding to 5 symptom related questions and 1 question related to bronchodilator use. Questions will be sc ored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The questionnaire will be administer ed only in subjects with active asthma disease. The subject should complete the ACQ 7 at the time point s indicated in the SoA (see Section 1.3) and is located on the clinical tablet. A sample ACQ-7 is provided in Appendix H . 8.1.8.4 EXCLUDED MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO LUNG FUNCTION ASSESSM ENTS For subjects taking asthma medications, asthma medi cations should be withheld prior to lung function tests on study visit days: • Short acting bronchodilators (eg, albuterol [salbut amol] or ipratropium) should be withheld for at least 6 hours before spirometry. • Twice daily long-acting bronchodilator (LABA or lon g-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA] containing therapies) should be withheld for 12 hou rs and once daily long-acting bronchodilator (LABA or LAMA containing therapies) for > 12 hours before spirometry. • Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) should be r estricted for > 12 hours. • Twice daily theophylline should be withheld for at least 12 hours and once daily theophylline for > 12 hours before spirometry. • If a subject has taken rescue SABA within 4 hours o f the planned spirometry study center visit, they should either: o Remain at the study center until the 4-hour withhol ding time has been reached OR o Return on the following day (or within study window ) for lung function assessments. 8.1.8.5 NASAL POLYP RELATED RESOURCE USE QUESTIONNAIRE The Nasal Polyp Related Resource Use Questionnaire is a questionnaire of health care resource utilization for nasal polyposis (eg, specialist vis its, emergency care visits, sick leaves, days off) will be completed as indicated in the SoA (see Section 1.3) and is located on the clinical tablet. A sample Nasal Polyp Related Resource Use Questionn aire is provided in Appendix I . 8.1.8.6 SPIROMETRY (FEV 1 MEASUREMENT) Spirometry will be performed on all subjects at the time points indicated in the SoA (see Section 1.3) and according to the ATS/ERS guidelines. Sites should p erform spirometry using the spirometer provided by ERT. The spirometer should be calibrated per ATS/ER S guidelines prior to the start of the lung functio n"

The spir ometer should be set to use the Global Lung Functio n Initiative reference equations, results will be ove r read by ERT. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry will be performed aft er appropriate bronchodilator withholding period in the morning. Patients with active asthma should wit hhold their usual asthma therapy prior to lung function tests on the study visit days spirometry i s performed. See Section 8.1.8.4 for prohibited medications prior to lung function assessments. Subjects should have spirometry performed at approx imately the same time on each study center visit day. Forced expiratory maneuvers should be performe d with the patient seated in an upright position. If this is not comfortable for the patient, standin g is permitted; however, the same position should b e used by the patient for each forced expiratory mane uver from Screening through EOS visit. Three acceptable maneuvers should be obtained for each te st. Additional details are provided in the lung function testing manual provided by the vendor. 8.1.8.7 VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE The VAS for rhinosinusitis is used to evaluate the total severity and is validated in adult CRS ( Fokkens et al., 2012 ). The subject is asked to indicate on a VAS the answe r to the question: “How troublesome are your symptoms of rhinosinusitis?“ The VAS ranks from 0 ( Not troublesome) to 10 (Worst thinkable troublesome). The disease can be divided into mild, moderate, and severe based on total severity VAS score (0 to 10 cm): MILD = VAS 0-3 MODERATE = VAS >3-7 SEVERE = VAS >7-10 The VAS will be used as indicated in the SoA (see S ection 1.3). The VAS scale will be collected weekly in the eDiar y. On Day 1, the eDiary must be provided to the subject prior to dosing and the subject must comple te the VAS scale before receiving study drug. A sample VAS is provided in Appendix J . 8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS Unscheduled safety assessments may be performed at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns."

If indicated based on medical history and/or symptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast, and/o r pelvic exams may be performed. At Screening, a complete physical examination will be performed. At baseline and posttreatment visits, the physical examination may be abbreviated, as dee med medically appropriate at the discretion of the Investigator. Significant physical examination findings which mee t the definition of an adverse event will be record ed on the AE page posttreatment; significant findings that are present prior to IP administration are included on the medical history page. VITAL SIGNS Vital signs captured include body temperature, resp iration rate, sitting radial pulse rate, and sittin g systolic and diastolic BPs. Vitals should be collec ted before blood sampling and before injection of s tudy drug at each visit where administered (see Section 1.3). Blood pressure is collected after 15 minutes of rest in a seated position. 12-LEAD ECG A single, standard, supine 12-lead ECG will be obta ined after a subject has rested quietly for at leas t 10 minutes, using equipment provided from the centr al reader. The ECG is to be repeated up to 2 times if the result is abnormal, as clinically appropriat e. ECGs must be collected on the ECG machine provid ed by ERT. ECG data will be submitted and reviewed by the central reader. The ECG will also be reviewed b y the investigator or an authorized representative wh o is experienced in the evaluation of ECGs and assessed for clinical significance. Instructions and guidelines for collection (eg, equ ipment), transmission, and archiving of ECG data wi ll be provided in the ECG Manual. A 12-lead ECG will b e obtained using a validated ECG machine that automatically calculates the HR and measures pulse rate, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. INJECTION SITE EVALUATION Subjects must remain onsite for 2 hours postdose fo r observation at the Day 1 (Week 0) visit.

Confidential 44 8.3 PHARMACOKINETICS Whole blood samples will be collected for measureme nt of serum concentrations of etokimab at time points as specified in the SoA (see Section 1.3). Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by BARC central laboratory and analyzed by Q2 Solutions. The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sample will be re corded in the eCRF. Samples will be used to evaluat e the PK of etokimab. Each serum sample will be divid ed into 2 aliquots (1 for a primary PK sample and 1 for a back-up PK sample). Samples collected for ana lyses of etokimab serum concentration may also be used to correlate exposure to safety or efficacy as pects related to concerns arising during or after t he study. Measurement of concentrations of etokimab will be p erformed using a validated assay method. Only samples which are within the window of sample stabi lity will be analyzed. The time points for PK sampl e collection is given in Appendix D . While PK and immunogenicity samples must be collect ed from subjects assigned to the placebo arm to maintain the blinding of treatment assignment, PK a nd immunogenicity assay results for these subjects are not needed for the safe conduct or proper inter pretation of this trial and the samples will theref ore not be analyzed. Personnel responsible for performi ng PK assays will be unblinded to subjects’ treatment assignments in order to identify appropri ate PK and immunogenicity samples to be analyzed. Samples from subjects assigned to the placebo arm m ay be analyzed upon request (ie, to evaluate a possible error in dosing). Genetic analyses will not be performed on these sam ples unless the separate pharmacogenomics consent has been signed. Subject confidentiality wi ll be maintained. Drug concentration information that may unblind the study will not be reported to study centers or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. Any changes in the timing or additi on of time points for any planned study assessments must be documented and approved by the relevant stu dy team member and then archived in the sponsor and study center study files, but will not constitute a protocol amendment. The IRB will be informed of any safety issues that require alterati on of the safety monitoring scheme or amendment of the ICF. If a subject refuses blood collection for PK analys is, this will not be considered a protocol deviatio n as the PK analysis is a secondary objective. 8.4 BIOMARKERS No specific or exploratory biomarkers will be colle cted or analyzed in this study. 8.5 IMMUNOGENICITY Antibodies to etokimab will be evaluated in serum s amples collected from all etokimab-dosed subjects according to the SoA (See Section 1.3). Additionally, serum samples should also be colle cted at the final visit from subjects who discontinued study treatmen t or were withdrawn from the study. These samples"

Each serum sample will be divided into 2 aliquots (1 each for immunogenicity testing and a back-up). Serum samples will be tested in a multi-tiered appr oach. A validated screening assay for antibodies binding to etokimab will be initially used to asses s serum samples. Samples that are determined putati ve positive in the screening assay will then be subjec ted to a confirmatory assay to demonstrate that antibodies are specific to etokimab. Samples that a re identified as positive in the confirmatory assay will be further characterized in a validated titer assay and the titer of confirmed positive samples will b e reported. Other analyses may be performed to verify the stability of antibodies to study treatment and/or to further characterize the immunogenicity o f study treatment. The detection and characterization of antibodies to etokimab will be performed using a validated assay method by or under the supervision of the sponsor. Only samples which are within the window of sample stability will be analyzed. The time points for ADA sample collection is given in Appendix C . Samples that are confirmed positive for antibodies binding to etokimab with a titer greater than the minimum required dilution of the validated assay ma y be further characterized and/or evaluated for their ability to neutralize the activity of the stu dy treatment using a validated cell based neutraliz ing antibody assay method. 8.6 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS For this protocol, an AE is any untoward medical oc currence (eg, sign, symptom, disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness, CS abnormal laboratory findin g, injury, or accident) that emerges or worsens following administration of the study drug and unti l the EOS participation. The untoward medical occurrence may not necessarily have a causal relati onship to the administration of the IP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including a CS abnormal laboratory result), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigat ional) product. A treatment-emergent AE is one that occurs after any exposure to treatment. A pre-existing condition is one that is present pri or to the start of the study and is to be reported as part of the subject’s medical history. It should be repo rted as an AE only if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study . Any CS change in the study safety evaluations, (eg, vital signs, physical/neurological examinations, e tc.) post injection must be reported as an AE. For each laboratory test result outside the referen ce range, the Investigator must ascertain if the abnormal lab result is a CS result for that individ ual subject. This determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnor mal value is observed; the Investigator may repeat"

Confidential 46 the laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory test. If a laboratory value is determined to be a CS result fo r a subject, this may be considered an AE. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS A SAE includes any event that results in any of the following outcomes: • Death • Life-threatening (ie, the subject was, in the opini on of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.) • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions • Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongs hos pitalization (ie, a prolonged hospitalization beyond the expected length of stay; hospitalization s for elective medical/surgical procedures, scheduled treatments, or routine check-ups are not SAEs by this criterion) • Congenital anomaly/birth defect (ie, an adverse out come in a child or fetus of a subject exposed to the molecule or IP before conception or during preg nancy) • Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but based upon appropriate medical judgment may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or su rgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (ie, is a significant or impo rtant medical event) CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT 8.6.3.1 SEVERITY OF EVENT The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determining the severity of the event. Seve rity will be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe ac cording to the following definitions: • Mild: Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influ ence daily activities; usually does not require intervention. • Moderate: Event may be of sufficient severity to make a subj ect uncomfortable; performance of daily activities may be influenced; intervention ma y be needed. • Severe: Event may cause severe discomfort; usually interfe res with daily activities; subject may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or othe r intervention usually needed. 8.6.3.2 RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION Relationship of an AE to IP will be assessed as fol lows: • Definite: There is a clinically plausible time sequence betw een the onset of the AE and the administration of IP when the event responds to wit hdrawal of IP and recurs with re- administration of IP."
63,page_63,"Etokimab for Treatment of CRSwNP Amendment 3 Protocol ANB020-006 06 February 2020 AnaptysBio, Inc. Confidential 47 • Related: There is a clinically plausible time sequence betw een the onset of the AE and the administration of IP; the AE is unlikely to be caus ed by the concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs or procedures. • Possibly Related: There may or may not be a clinically plausible tim e sequence between the onset of the AE and the administration of IP and a cause cannot be ruled out. • Unrelated: There is not a temporal or causal relationship to IP administration. 8.6.3.3 EXPECTEDNESS The PI/designee will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An unexpected AE is one not identified in nature, seve rity, or frequency in the current protocol or IB. TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP SAEs that are identified on the last scheduled cont act must be recorded on the AE eCRF page and reported to the Sponsor or the authorized represent ative according to the reporting procedures outlined in Section 8.6.6 . This may include unresolved previously reported S AEs, or new SAEs. The Investigator should follow these SAEs until the eve nts are resolved, or the subject is lost to follow- up. The Investigator should continue to report any sign ificant follow-up information to the Sponsor or the authorized representative, and the IRB, up to the p oint the event has been resolved. Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline state of h ealth, or the Investigator does not expect any furt her improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition . Any new SAEs reported by the subject to the Investi gator that occur after the last scheduled contact a nd are determined by the Investigator to be reasonably associated with the administration of IP should be reported to the Sponsor or the authorized represent ative, and the IRB, as required. 8.6.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING The Investigator will assess subjects at each study visit and posttreatment per protocol for the occurrence of AEs. In order to avoid bias in elicit ing AEs, subjects should be asked the following nonleading question: “How have you felt since your last visit?” All AEs (serious and non-serious) reported by the subject must be recorded on the sou rce documents and eCRFs. Adverse Events will be recorded beginning from the time of consent. Adverse Events that occur prior to dosing will also be noted in the medical history. 8.6.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING The Investigator will report any SAE to th Pharmacov igilance within 24 hours of being made aware of it, whether or not considere d study intervention related, including those liste d"

Confidential 48 in the protocol or IB and must include an assessmen t of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event. Study endp oints that are serious adverse events (eg, all-cause mortality) must be reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a caus al relationship between the study intervention and the event (eg, death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the Investigator must report the event to the Spons or in the shortest possible time. All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolu tion or until the study center Investigator deems t he event to be chronic or the participant is stable. O ther supporting documentation of the event may be requested by the local or centralized IRB and study Sponsor and should be provided as soon as possible . The study Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adve rse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case la ter than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor's initial re ceipt of the information and in compliance with the 15 day requirement. In addition, the Sponsor must noti fy FDA and all participating Investigators in an IN D safety report of potential serious risks, from clin ical trials or any other source, as soon as possibl e, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the Spons or determines that the information qualifies for reporting. 8.6.7 REPORTING EVENTS TO PARTICIPANTS The Sponsor will disclose clinical trial data to in dividuals, to Investigators at sites, and publicly as aggregate summaries, in accordance with applicable regulations and requirements. 8.6.8 EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST Not applicable. 8.6.9 REPORTING OF PREGNANCY During the trial, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately (within 24 hours) if they suspect they might be pregnant (e g, missed or late menstrual cycle). The Investigato r must immediately notify Pharmacovigilance of any fe male subject who becomes pregnant any time during study participatio n, record the information on the Pregnancy Notification Form and send the form to the authoriz ed representative. The study center will be asked t o follow-up with the subject periodically during the pregnancy for ongoing health and safety information through term, as applicable. Subjects who become pr egnant during the study will be discontinued. In the case of male subject’s female partner becomi ng pregnant while the male subject is in this study , the Investigator should attempt to collect pregnanc y information on the male subject’s female partner. This applies only to male subjects who receive stud y treatment. The Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate pregnancy form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the part ner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor.

The hypotheses for the co-pr imary efficacy endpoints are delineated below. Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints: Statistical hypotheses associated with the co-prima ry efficacy endpoints are as follows:  Treatment of adults diagnosed with CRSwNP using eto kimab will result in a significantly greater reduction of Week 16 NPS from baseline when compare d to placebo, and  Treatment of adults diagnosed with CRSwNP using eto kimab will result in a significantly greater reduction of Week 16 SNOT-22 score from baseline wh en compared to placebo 9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION Sample size estimates were calculated based on the following assumptions:  Overall alpha=0.05  Co-primary endpoints  Hierarchical testing of the 2 active treatment arms versus placebo  At least 85% power to detect a clinically meaningfu l difference between etokimab and placebo Based on data from similar trials conducted in adul t subjects with CRSwNP, a difference in NPS of 1.3 between the etokimab change from Baseline to Week 1 6 and the placebo group change from Baseline to Week 16 will be clinically meaningful ( Bachert et al. 2016 ). Assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 1.5, and a significance level of 5%, a sample size of n= 27 for each treatment arm will provide approximatel y 87% power to detect the stipulated difference. In o rder to account for the dilution of treatment effec t due to 18% dropouts and missing data, approximately 33 subjects are planned to be randomized equally to each of the 3 treatment arms. The second co-primary endpoint is SNOT-22 total sco re. In a trial of adults with CRSwNP, the differenc e in mean change from Baseline to Week 16 between act ive and placebo was 18.1. Assuming a common standard deviation of 19.2, and 2-sided significanc e level of 5%, the sample size of 27 subjects provi des 92% power to detect the stipulated treatment differ ence. Hence, adjusting for 18% dropouts and missing data, n=33 subjects will provide >85% desir ed power to detect a clinically meaningful differen ce in this endpoint between each active arm and placeb o."

Confidential 65 10.1.7 CLINICAL MONITORING All aspects of the study will be monitored by the S ponsor or authorized representatives of the Sponsor according to GCP and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for compliance with applicable government regulations, (ie, Informed Consent Regulations [US 21CFR, Part 50] and IRB regulations [US 21CFR, Part 56.103]). Access to all records, both during the st udy and after study completion, should be made available to the Sponsor at any time for review and audit to ensure the integrity of the data. The Investigator must notify Sponsor immediately if the responsible IRB has been disqualified or if proceedings leading to disqualification have begun. The Investigator must conduct the protocol in accor dance with applicable GCP regulations and guidelines; applicable informed consent regulations (US 21CFR, Part 50); and in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Every attempt must be made to follow the protocol and to obtain and record al l data requested for each subject at the specified ti mes. If data are not recorded per protocol, the rea sons must be clearly documented on the eCRF/records. Before study initiation, at a study center initiati on visit or at a meeting with the Investigator(s), a representative from the Sponsor will review the pro tocol and study eCRFs with the Investigator(s) and their staff. During the study, the study monitor wi ll visit the study center regularly to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of en tries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, and to ensu re that consent is being sought and obtained in compliance with applicable regulations, and that th e IP is being stored, dispensed and accounted for according to specifications. The Investigator and k ey trial personnel must be available to assist the monitor during these visits. The Investigator must give the monitor access to re levant hospital or clinical records, to confirm the ir consistency with the eCRF entries. No information i n these records about the identity of the subjects will leave the study center. Monitoring standards requir e full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion crite ria, documentation of SAEs, and the recording of primary efficacy and safety variables. Additional c hecks of the consistency of the source data with th e eCRFs will be performed according to the study-spec ific monitoring plan. The Investigator must promptly complete the eCRFs a fter the subject’s visit. The monitor is responsibl e for reviewing them and clarifying and resolving any data queries. A copy of the eCRFs will be retained by the investigator who must ensure that it is stored in a secure place with other study documents, such as the protocol, the IB, and any protocol amendments. The Investigator must provide the Sponsor and the r esponsible IRB with a study summary shortly after study completion, or as designated by the Sponsor."

Confidential 66 10.1.8 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL Each clinical study center will perform internal qu ality management of study conduct, data and biological specimen collection, documentation and c ompletion. An individualized quality management plan will be developed to describe a study center’s quality management. Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that will be run on the database will be gen erated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resol ution. Following written SOPs, the monitors will verify th at the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected, d ocumented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulato ry requirements (eg, GLP, Good Manufacturing Practices [GMP]). The study center will provide direct access to all study-related sites, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor, and inspection by local and regulatory authorities. 10.1.9 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 10.1.9.1 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES All protocol-specified data will be recorded in the source documents, and data will be entered on the eCRFs from the source documents. In addition to sig nature confirmation that a subject meets the study eligibility criteria, upon each subject’s completio n of the study, the Investigator will sign a statem ent indicating that all pages of the subject’s case rep ort have been reviewed. Signature stamps and “per signatures” are not acceptable. It is Sponsor’s policy that the study data be verif iable with the source data that necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and other records for each subject. The Investigator must therefore agree to allow access to subjects’ record s, and source data must be made available for all study data. Subjects (or their legal representative s) must also allow access to their medical records. Subjects will be informed of the importance of incr eased record access and permission granted by signature on the informed consent document prior to Screening. Checks will be performed to ensure the quality, con sistency, and completeness of the data. Instances o f missing or uninterpretable data will be resolved wi th the Investigator or study coordinator. Data queries, documented on data query forms, will be se nt to the research facility. Site personnel will be responsible for providing resolutions to the data q ueries and for correcting the eCRFs, as appropriate . All unused Sponsor source documents and binders must be returned to the Sponsor upon completion of the study."

All these documents must have at l east the subject’s study number, and the date of th e evaluation. The data recorded during the course of the study wi ll be documented in the eCRF and/or the study- specific forms. Before or at study termination, all data must be forwarded to the Sponsor. The data wi ll then be recorded, evaluated, and stored in anonymou s or coded form in accordance with data- protection regulations. Subjects will authorize the use of their protected health information during the informed consent process in accordance with the applicable privacy r equirements. Subjects who deny permission to use and disclose protected health information will not be eligible to participate in the study. The Invest igator will ensure that the study documents forwarded to t he Sponsor, and any other documents, contain no mention of subject names. Any amendments and corrections necessary will be un dertaken in both the source documents and eCRFs (as appropriate) and countersigned by the Inv estigator, or documented designee, stating the date of the amendment/correction. Errors must remain leg ible and may not be deleted with correction aids. The Investigator must state his/her reason for the correction of any data. In the case of missing data/remarks, the entry spaces provided in the eCRF should be cancelled out so as to avoid unnecessary follow-up inquiries. Regulatory authorities, the IRB and/or the Sponsor’ s Quality Assurance group (or designee) may request access to all source documents, eCRFs, and other st udy documentation for onsite audit or inspection. The Investigator must guarantee direct access to th ese documents. eCRFs will be kept by the Sponsor or an authorized designee in a secured area. Clinical data will be recorded in a computer format for subsequent statistical analyses. Data files will be stored on electronic media with a final master dat a file"

Confidential 79 APPENDIX B: CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDANCE AND COLLECTION O F PREGNANCY INFORMATION Definitions: Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) A woman is considered fertile following menarche an d until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see below). Women in the following categories are not considere d WOCBP: 1. Premenarchal 2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: a) Documented hysterectomy. b) Documented bilateral salpingectomy. c) Documented bilateral oophorectomy. Note: Documentation can come from the study center personnel’s: review of the subject’s medical record s, medical examination, or medical history interview. 3. Postmenopausal female: a) A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses f or 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in th e postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal co ntraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenor rhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. b) Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the non-estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confi rmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. Contraception Guidance Male Subjects • Male subjects with female partners of childbearin g potential are eligible to participate if they agr ee to ONE of the following (during the protocol-defined time fra me in Section 5.1): o Are abstinent from penile vaginal intercourse as th eir usual and preferred lifestyle (abstinent on a l ong term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abst inent. o Agree to use a male condom plus partner use of a co ntraceptive method with a failure rate of < 1% per year when having penile vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who is not currently pregnant. o In addition, male subjects must refrain from donati ng sperm for the duration of the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. • Male subjects with a pregnant or breastfeeding pa rtner must agree to remain abstinent from penile va ginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episod e of penile penetration for the duration of the stu dy and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment."

Confidential 80 Female Subjects • Female subjects must refrain from donating ova fo r the duration of the study and for 3 months after t he last dose of study treatment.  Female subjects of childbearing potential are eligi ble to participate if they agree to use highly effe ctive methods of contraception consistently and correctly as described in the table below. Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are Use r Dependent a Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) horm onal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  Oral.  Intravaginal.  Transdermal. Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  Oral.  Injectable. Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent a Implantable progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  Intrauterine device.  Intrauterine hormone-releasing system. Hormone-free intrauterine device interfering with s perm transport and fertilization. Bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation. Vasectomized Partner A vasectomy is a highly effective birth control met hod provided that the vasectomized partner is the s ole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sper m post vasectomy has been confirmed. If not, an add itional highly effective method of contraception should be used. Sexual Abstinence Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosex ual intercourse during the entire period of risk associ ated with the study treatment. The reliability of s exual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. NOTES : a Typical use failure rates may differ from those wh en used consistently and correctly. Use should be c onsistent with local regulations regarding the use of contrac eptive methods for subjects participating in clinic al studies. Pregnancy Testing • Women of child bearing potential should only be i ncluded after a confirmed menstrual negative highly sensitive SPT at Screening and UPT on Day 1 (prior t o study treatment administration). • Additional pregnancy testing should be performed as mentioned in the SOA (see Section 1.3). • Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a me nstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherw ise suspected. Positive UPT result should be confirmed with a serum test."

Confidential 81 Collection of Pregnancy Information Male Subjects with Partners who Become Pregnant • The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnanc y information on any male subject’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject is in this study. This applies only to male subjects who recei ve study treatment. • The Investigator will record pregnancy informatio n on the appropriate pregnancy form and submit it t o the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forw arded to the Sponsor. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated del ivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be repo rted regardless of fetal status (presence or absenc e of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. Female Subjects who Become Pregnant • The Investigator will collect pregnancy informati on on any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be re corded on the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a subject’s pregnancy. The subject will be followed to determine the outc ome of the pregnancy. The Investigator will collect follow -up information on the subject and the neonate and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Gener ally, follow-up will not be required for longer tha n 6 to 8 weeks after the delivery date. Any termination of p regnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal stat us (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication fo r the procedure. • While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an A E or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always consider ed to be an SAE and will be reported as such. • Any post study pregnancy related SAE considered r easonably related to the study treatment by the Investigator will be reported to the Sponsor as des cribed in Section 8.6.6 . While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in form er subjects, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting. • Any female subject who becomes pregnant while par ticipating in the study will be withdrawn from the study."
