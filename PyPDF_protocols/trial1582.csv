PROTOCOL SUMMARY Objective The objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the DiamondTemp Ablation System for the treatment of drug refractory, recurrent, symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . Test Device DiamondTemp Ablation System consists of: • DiamondTemp Ablation Catheter o Unidirectional and Bidirectional models • Diamo ndTemp Catheter -to RFG Cable • DiamondTemp GenConnect Cable • DiamondTemp Generator with Footswitch • DiamondTemp Irrigation Pump • DiamondTemp Irrigation Tubing Set The investigational device will be used with commonly available: • EP recording systems • Cardiac stimulators • EnSite™ Velocity™ or Precision™ Cardiac Mapping System Control Device St. Jude Medical (Abbott) Ablation System o TactiCath™ Quartz Contact Force Ablation Catheter o AMPERE™ RF Ablation Generator and Cables or equivalent o COOL POINT™ Irrigatio n Pump and Tubing or equivalent The control device will be used with commonly available: • EP Recording Systems • Cardiac Stimulator s • EnSite™ Velocity™ or Precision™ Cardiac Mapping System Study Design The DIAMOND -AF study is a prospective , single -blind, 1:1 randomized, controlled trial being performed at multiple centers in the United States , Canada and Europe . Planned Subject Sample Size A maximum of 480 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in this study . Planned Number of Global Investigational Sites Subjects will be enrolled at up to 30 investigational sites in the United States (US) and outside of the US (OUS) . Approximately 50% of the data will be generated from sites within the US. Ablation Procedure The primary focus of the ablation procedure is to create a series of point - by-point radiofrequency (RF) lesions encircling the left and right PVs to"
9,page_9,"DIAMOND -AF Investigational Plan TP00599 Revision F ______________________________________________________________________________ Confidential Page 10 of 82 achieve electrical pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) from the rest of the left atrium (LA). Investigators may use their preferred approach to obtain PVI , such as antral or wide area circumferential ablation (WACA) targeting PVs individually or PV pairs ipsilaterally. PVI must be confirmed by entrance block at least 20 minutes following the last ablation around the respective PV. Targeting non -PV foci and complex fractionated electrograms (CFAE) is not recommended in this investigation. If the investigator identifies additional focal or macro - reentrant atrial sites to be clinically relevant to AF and requiring ablation, the ablation location will be docume nted. Primary Safety Endpoint The primary safety endpoint is defined as freedom from a composite of serious adverse events (SAE) occurring within 30-days and clinically symptomatic pulmonary vein stenosis through 6 -months post -index ablation procedure , as adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) for relatedness to the procedure or device . The primary safety device - or procedure -related SAE composite will be the combined rate o f the following events : • Atrioesophageal fistula • Bleedi ng complication • Cardiac tamponade / perforation • Death • Extended hospitalization • Myocardial infarction • Pericarditis • Phrenic nerve paralysis • Pulmonary edema • Pulmonary vein stenosis • Stroke post-ablation • Thromboembolism • Transient ischemic attack (TIA) po st-ablation • Vagal nerve injury • Vascular access complications"
10,page_10,"DIAMOND -AF Investigational Plan TP00599 Revision F ______________________________________________________________________________ Confidential Page 11 of 82 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint The primary effectiveness endpoint is defined as freedom from documented symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF ), atrial flutter * (AFL) and atrial tachycardia (AT) episodes following the blanking period (3 - month follow -up post -ablation procedure) through the end of the effectiveness evaluation period ( 12-month follow -up post -ablation procedure). An effectiveness failure is defined by any of the following events: • Inability to electrically isolate all accessible targeted pulmonary veins during the ablation procedure • Documented episodes of AF , AFL or AT lasting ≥ 30 seconds in duration as evidenced by electrocardiographic data during the effectiveness evaluation period • DC cardio version for AF, AFL or AT during the effectiveness evaluation period • A repeat ablation procedure to treat AF, AFL or AT during t he effectiveness evaluation period • Use of a new or modification to existing Class I -IV anti - arrhythmic drug (AAD) regimen to treat AF , AFL or AT recurrence during the effectiveness evaluation period • Use of a non -study device for ablation of any AF targets during the index or repeat ablation procedure during the blanking period • More than one (1) repeat ablation procedure during the blanking period * Occurrence and/or ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) -dependent AFL, as confirmed by entrainment maneuver s during EP testing at any time during this study is not a primary effectiveness failure because it is not considered an iatrogenic arrhythmia foll owing a left atrial ablation procedure for AF. Secondary Endpoints Secondary endpoints to characterize th e performance of the DiamondTemp Ablation System, relative to the control device, will include: • Mean duration of individual RF ablations (seconds) . • Mean cumulative RF time per procedure (minutes) . • Freedom from a composite of SAE occurring within 7-days post- index ablation procedure as adjudicated by an indepen dent CEC for relatedness to the procedure or device . • Freedom from documented symptomatic and asymptomatic AF, AT and AFL * episodes following the blanking period through 12-month follow -up post -ablation procedure in the absence of class I and II I anti-arrhythmic drug therapy ."

Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and Clinical Need Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically -significant cardiac arrhythmia. It is a major public health concern in the United States , affecting an e stimated 2.3 million people in North America and 4.5 million people in Europe[1]. It has been projected that the prevalence of AF will increase 2.5 fold during the next 50 years in the United States [2]. AF is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and the prevalence increases over time due to the aging population and an increase in age -specific occurrence of AF [3-5]. Symptoms of AF vary with the ventricula r rate, underlying functional status, duration of AF, presence and degree of structural heart disease, and individual patient perception; however, most patients with AF complain of palpitations, angina, dyspnea, fatigue, or dizziness. AF also significantly impairs quality of life, with up to two -thirds of patients reporting it is disruptive and debilitating to their lives [6-8]. AF is an abnormal heart rhythm that has been classified as recurrent when two or more ep isodes are detected. If these episodes of AF last less than seven days and terminate spontaneously, then it is classified as paroxysmal AF (PAF). PAF accounts for approximately 40 to 45 percent of AF cases. [4, 9] AF is a sustained arrhythmia characterized by rapid and disorganized atrial activation leading to impaired atrial function, which can be diagnosed on an ECG by lack of a P -wave and irregular QRS complexes . The disorganized atrial activation appears as “ fibrillatory ” waves activating the atria at a rate generall y between 350 and 600 beats/min and the syncytial contraction of the atria is replaced by irregular atrial twitches. While AF can occur in isolation, it may also be associated with other arrhythmias such as atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia. The electrophysiological mechanisms responsible for AF may includ e rapid focal tachyarrhythmia in the pulmonary veins (PVs) and/or other atrial regions with fibrillatory conduction, multiple reentrant wavelet conduction initiated by premature atrial complexes (PACs) and/or atrial tachyarrhythmia , and/or formation of sta ble or unstable reentrant circuits of very short cycle lengths that generate fibrillatory conduction [10, 11]. Of all electrophysiological mechanisms responsible for AF, of significant interest are the PVs which ha ve been identified to play a critical role in triggering and maintaining AF. Haissaguerre and colleagues have demonstrated that in most AF pati ents, the focus is in one of the PVs [12]. The choice of therapy for AF is influence d by patient preference, associated structural heart disease, severity of symptoms and whether the AF is classified as recurrent paroxysmal, recurrent persistent or permanent. Although AF can be problematic to manage me dically due to its progressive nature , there are multiple therapies in current use for the treatment of AF, and many of these therapies are sub -optimal for most patients. Treatment options include medical management, pacing, cardioversion, implantable devi ces, surgery and ablation therapy to eliminate the arrhythmia [4, 13]. Of all therapeutic strategies for AF one of interest is radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) as a potential curative treatment. RFCA for t he treatment of AF is a commonly performed procedure for symptomatic patients in whom medications are either ineffective or"
20,page_20,"DIAMOND -AF Investigational Plan TP00599 Revision F ______________________________________________________________________________ Confidential Page 21 of 82 not tolerated [4, 9, 14]. RFCA restores normal sinus rhythm by delivering RF energy throug h a catheter at targeted focal sites to disrupt abnormal electrical activity. The most comm on catheter ablation approach to treat AF is to elect rically isolate the PVs (PVI) . Other approaches used include WACA and CFAE ablation . Additional focal or macro -reentrant atrial sites may be ablated but the approach varies from center to center. Despite significant improvements in catheter ablation strategies to treat AF in recent years, Neuzil and colleagues report that refractory recurrence of arrhythmia remai ns a continuing concern with recurrence rates of AF after RFCA still remain ing relatively high (20-55%) [15] and perhaps attributed to lack of transmural lesions during PVI[16]. Technological innovations in RFCA include multi -electrode ablation catheters, high resolution ablation catheters, force - sensing technologies and navigation technologies . 4.2. Prior Clinical Evide nce for RF Ablation to Treat PAF Ablation has become the standard of care in many centers due to the superiority of catheter ablation to AADs. The first two classes of devices to seek and achieve FDA approval for ablation of PAF were an irrigated RF catheter (ThermoC ool, Biosense Webster ) and a cryoballoon ablation catheter (ArticFront , Medtronic ). The prospective randomized studies for these de vices demonstrat ed the safety and efficacy and the superiority of catheter ablation over dru g thera py in drug refractory patients .[17, 18] Subsequent approval studies of new ablation technologies have been either compared with a previously -approved device with the same indications for use in a randomized , controlled non-inferiority study or, in the case of a second -generation RF ablation catheter, compared with predefined perform ance goals in a single -arm s tudy. Recently, two catheters have been developed to measure real-time contact force during ablati on, a concept where force is one of the primary fac tors determining lesion size . One cathet er uses three optical fibers to measure the micro -deformation of a deformable body in the catheter tip (TactiCath, St Jude Medical, Inc orporated ), which correlates w ith tip force [19- 21]. The second catheter uses a small spring between the ablation tip electrode and the cathe ter shaft, with a tiny magnetic transmitter in the tip and magnetic sensors to measure microdeflection of the spring (ThermoCool SmartTouch, Biosense Webster, Inc.), corresponding to tip force[22-24]. The TactiCath catheter was evaluated in the FDA investigational study, TOCCASTAR clinical trial[25]. In this prospective, randomized clinical trial, 300 patients with PAF were randomized to ablation with the TactiCath catheter or to the non -contact force sensing Thermo Cool ablation catheter. No difference in efficacy was observe d, with success rates of 67.8% and 69.4% in the contact force (CF) and control arms, respectively. When the CF arm was stratified into optimal CF and non -optimal CF groups, effectiveness was 75.9% vs 58.1%, respectively . There was no difference in the rate of complications in the two groups. Cardiac tamponade occurred in one subject in each group. The ThermoCool SmartTouch c atheter was evaluated in a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical tria l performed for FDA a pproval[24]. The outcomes were compared with the Thermo Cool IDE trial[18], in which 170 subject s were enrolle d. The 12 -month freedom from AF/AT/AFL in SMART -AF was 72.5% at 1 -year follow -up, compared with 66%"
21,page_21,"DIAMOND -AF Investigational Plan TP00599 Revision F ______________________________________________________________________________ Confidential Page 22 of 82 efficacy for the ThermoC ool non -contact force catheter . The average CF per procedure was 18 grams. Four subjects experienced cardiac tamponade. A post hoc a nalysis revealed that when the CF was between investigator -selected working ranges >80% of the time, outcomes were 4.25 times more likely to be successful . 5. SUMMARY OF FIRST -IN-HUMAN CLINICAL STUDY (TRAC -AF) ACT conducted a multi -center First -In-Human clinical study, TRAC -AF, across four European centers to establish evidence of clinical safety and effectiveness of the DiamondTemp Ablation System to treat patients with drug refractory, recurrent, symptomatic pa roxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). TRAC -AF (DiamondTemp Tempe RAture-Controlled and Contact Sensing RF Ablation Clinical Trial for Atrial Fibrillation, NCT02821351) study was a prospective, multi -center, single -arm feasibility study initiated in 2016 and conducted at four European investigational sites. Enrollment was performed in two phases. Phase 1 included enrollment of 38 subjects from January through March of 2016 and Phase 2 included enrollment of an additional 34 subjects from June through July 2 017. A total of 72 subjects were enrolled in the study and 70 subjects were treated with the study device and analyzed. Enrollment is now closed and all subjects in both phases have completed 7 -day and 30 -day follow -up visits. Subjects in the first phas e have completed 12 -month follow -up visits and are now exited from the study. All primary study endpoints have been met through 30 days follow up. Assessments of primary safety events resulted in four (4) SAEs ( 5.7%) through the 7 -day safety endpoint an d five (5) SAEs ( 7.1%) through the 30 -day s afety endpoint. The primary effectiveness endpoint of acute procedural success was achieved in 100% of subjects. Once all subjects in the second phase have completed the 12 -month follow -up a final clinical study report will be generated. The focus of t his report is on subject follow up through 30 -days. 5.1. TRAC -AF Study Design Subjects with symptomatic PAF who were refractory or intolerant to at least 1 anti - arrhythmic drug (AAD; class I -IV) were screened for enrollment. Subjects that met the study eligibility criteria and signed the informed consent form (ICF) were enrolled and treated in accordance with the protocol and the HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation [14, 26]. Subjects received ablation using the investigational device which required electrical isolation of all cli nical relevant pulmonary veins . 5.2 Investigational Device The investigational device in this clinical study is the DiamondTemp Ablation System. The investigational devi ce was used with a commonly available EP recording system, cardiac stimulator and mapping device, the EnSite™ Velocity™ or Precision™ Cardiac Mapping System (St. Jude Medical) . There were no control devices in this study."

STUDY PROTOCOL AND METHODS 8.1. Study Objective The objective of this study is to d emonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the DiamondTemp Ablation System for the treatment of drug refractory, recurrent, symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). The study will be considered successful if the investigative device is considered non-inferior to the control device for the primary safety and effectiveness endpoints. 8.2. Study Design The DIAMOND -AF study is a prospective, single -blind, 1:1 randomized, controlled trial being performed at multiple cent ers in the United States , Canad a and Europe to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the DiamondTemp Ablation System for the treatment of drug refractory, recurrent, symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation compared to the TactiCath Quartz Contact For ce Ablation Catheter and compat ible ablation system. This study will enroll up to 480 subjects diagnosed with PAF at up to 30 investigational sites in the US , Canada and Europe . Investigational sites will have a principal investigator (PI) that is responsible for t he conduct of a resea rch study as well as sub -investigators . It is anticipated that approximately 50% of the randomized subjects will be enrolled at centers within the United States."
36,page_36,"DIAMOND -AF Investigational Plan TP00599 Revision F ______________________________________________________________________________ Confidential Page 37 of 82 After providing co nsent, subjects will undergo screening and baseline tests. Subjects that meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to either treatment with the investigational or control device only after completion of all screening and eligibility procedure s. A randomization m odule within the E lectronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be used to randomize subjects 1:1 to one of two treatment groups using a blocked randomization stratified by site followed by stratification by failure of Class I/III or Class II/IV AADs . Since full eligibility for the study may not be confirmable until pre-ablation procedure tests are performed, subjects will only count towards the enrol lment ceiling once final eligibility is confirmed and they are randomized. Once rand omized, a subject will be considered enrolled in the study. The primary focus of t he left atrial ablation procedure is to create a series of point -by-point RF lesions encircling the left and right PVs to achieve electrical PVI from the rest of the left atrium (LA) . Investigators may use their p referred approach to obtain PVI, such as an tral or WACA ablation targeting PVs segmentally or PV pairs ipsilaterally. PVI must be confirmed by entrance block at least 20 minutes followin g the last ablation around the respective PV. Targeting non -PV foci and complex fractionated electrograms is n ot recommended in this investigation. If the investigator identifies additional focal or macro -reentrant atrial sites to be clinically relevant to AF and requiring ablation , the ablation location will be documented. All subjects will be followed per proto col in relation to the date of the index ablation procedure. Follow up will be required prior to hospital discharge and at 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post -ablation. Subjects will be given a cardiac event monitor ( Sentinel Wireless ECG Recorder System or equivalent, HeartcoR Solutions, LLC.) at the hospital pre -discharge visit to be used throughout the duration of the study . If subject exhibits symptoms (e.g. palpitations, dizziness, tiredness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, c hest pain, fatigue, syncope) associated with AF recurrence at any time after the ablation procedure, they will be instructed to record their hea rt rhythm using their cardiac event monitor and to contact the site investigator . This data will be transmitted to and read at an ECG core lab. If a subject has an arrhythmia recurrence within the first 90 days after the ablation procedure (blanking period), one repeat ablation procedure is allowed per protocol. Investigators should make every attempt to schedule a repeat ablation procedure on or before day 90. The repeat ablation procedure must be performed with the assigned investigational or control catheter. Repeat ablation procedures performed with a catheter different than originally assigned will be a pro tocol deviation. Subjects will also be required to perform bi -monthly periodic event recording from the 3 -month follow up visit to the 12 -month follow -up visit to detect possible asymptomatic atrial tachycardias. The event recordings, Holter recordings an d 12-lead ECG data collected between the 3 and 12 month post ablation procedure timepo ints will be reviewed, analyzed and reported on by an ECG core lab to determine the study effectiveness. To evaluate the success of subject blinding to treatment assignm ent, all subjects will be asked whether they think they were in the investigational gr oup, control group or if they don’t know at the 12 -month follow -up visit. The duration of the study is projected to span approximately 36 months . The duration accounts f or:"

Sample Size Justification With a rand omization ratio of 1:1 and an estimated attrition rate of 7%, 2 40 subjects per treatment group (total N=4 80) should yield sufficient power for both the primary safety and primary effectiveness endpoints. For primary safety, assuming a control composite S AE rate of 6.5%, 226 subjects per group yields 80% power to detect a non -inferiority margin of 6.5% betwee n treatment groups at a one-sided significance level of 0.0 25. Similarly, assuming a control effectiveness rate of 65%, 229 subjects per group yields 80% power to detect a non -inferiority margin of -12.5% between treatment groups at a significance level o f 0.025. 8.7. Statistical Analysis Before database lock, the final SAP for clinical data will be prepared to provide full details of all planned anal yses. The analyses presented here represent an outline of the intended methodology. Analysis Populations The following analysis populations are defined in this study: • ITT Population: The Intention -to-Treat (I TT) population will be comprised of all randomiz ed subjects regardless of whether they receive study treatment, with analyses conducted according to the randomized treatment assignment ."
42,page_42,"DIAMOND -AF Investigational Plan TP00599 Revision F ______________________________________________________________________________ Confidential Page 43 of 82 • Per Protocol Analysis Set: The Per Protocol analysis set will be a subset of the ITT Set and comprised of all subjects who did not have any major protocol deviations. • Safety Analysis Population: In the unlikely case where a subject is randomized but the procedure is prematurely halted and no catheter is deployed, said catheter will e included in the ITT S et but excluded f rom the Safety Set since the subject was not expo sed to the study device. The Safety Set will be comprised of all randomized subject in which treatment was at least attempted (assigned treatment catheter inserted into vasculature), with analys es conducted by actual treatment received. General Considerations Descriptive summary statistics for continuous variables will include the n umber of subjects, mean, standard deviation or standard error, median, minimum and maximum. Nominal categorical variables will b e summarized using counts and percentages. Ordinal variables may be analyzed as if they were continuously scaled. The study will be considered successful when the primary safety and effectiveness endpoints are met. If primary effectiveness success is det ermined to be less than 52% for either the treatment arm or the control arm, the primary effectiveness endpoint will be difficul t to interpret, and additional analyses will be necessary to explain the poor device performance. Subject Disposition The numbe r and percentage of subjects who complete and discontinue as well as reasons for early discontinuation will be presented. Demogr aphics and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively. Treatment groups will be compared statistically to confirm that the randomization process generated two homogeneous groups prior to treatment. Catheter Model Analysis The final study data wi ll include evaluations of the DiamondTemp Unidirectional and Bidirectional Catheter s in aggregate as well as stratified by catheter model. There will be a minimum of 30 subjects treated with the DiamondTemp Bidirectional Catheter . 8.8.

After EGM amplitude attenuation is reached, RF delivery is to be stopped three (3) to five (5) seconds after EGM amplitude attenuation is reached. The point of significant EGM attenuation is defined as the time when there are no more changes in the EGM amplitude and/or there is a 7 5 to 80% reduction in EGM amplitude . Investigators are recommended to not ablate for greater th an 45 seconds without moving th e tip of the investigational ablation catheter. In the event of a generator cutoff (impedance, temperature) or if a steam pop is observed , the catheter must be withdrawn and the tip electrode observed for the presence of cha r or coagulum formation. The tip should be cleaned, if necessary, before RF current is reapplied. Purge the catheter prior to insertion into the subject . Pulmonary Vein Electrica l Mapping The electrical a ctivity of the PVs must be mapped prior to ablation. The investigator may determine the order in which the PVs are mapped and if PV angiography is necessary to facilitate vein access. To perform the electrical PV mappin g, each vein should have a diagnostic catheter inserted to document the presence of PV potentials. Documentation of the PV electrical mapping (PV potentials or lack thereof) is required for each vein. If the mapping catheter is successfully positioned in the vein but no PV potentials are present, ablation of the PV is not recommended. Pre -ablation mapping determines which veins are clinically relevant for appropriate declaration of acute procedural success. If the investigator determines it is not clinic ally relevant to perform ablation of a PV, the rationale must be noted prior to sta rting the ablation."
52,page_52,"DIAMOND -AF Investigational Plan TP00599 Revision F ______________________________________________________________________________ Confidential Page 53 of 82 Index Ablation Procedure The primary focus of the ablation procedure will be to create a series of point -by-point RF lesions encircling the left and rig ht PVs to achieve PVI (electrical isolation of PVs from the LA). Investigators may use their preferred approach to obtain PVI su ch as antral or WACA targeting PVs segmentally or PV pairs ipsilaterally. A circumferential approach applying RF application 1 -2 cm outside of the PV ostium to prevent PV stenosis is recommended. Targeting non -PV foci and complex fractionated electrogram s is not recommended in this investigation. If the investigator identifies additional focal or macro -reentrant atrial sites to be clinically relevant to AF and requires ablation, the ablation location will be documented. The order in which PVs are isolate d is up to the investigator’s discretion. While isolating the right superior PV, high -voltage pacing may be used before each R F applicatio n to check for phrenic nerve stimulation. Ablation should be avoided in areas of phrenic nerve capture as to not cau se injury to the phrenic nerve. While ablating on the posterior wall in proximity to the esophagus it is highly recommended that investigators use an esophageal temperature probe during RF ablation procedures to monitor esophageal temperature and help gui de energy delivery. An esophageal temperature increase of 1 -2°C from baseline or a recorded temperature of 39°C –40°C should tr igger interruption of RF energy delivery[26]. Care should be taken to ensure that the esophageal temperature probe is aligned as close as possible with the position of the ablation catheter during ablation to avoid a false impression of safety. Additionall y, each ablation on the posterior LA wall nee ds to consider the duration, power and temperature (investigational catheter only) settings while in proximity to other structures that could potentially be injured, such as the esophagus. Moving a catheter aft er shorter durations of RF application , reduc ing the power (W) and/or temperature set point to 50 or 55 oC (investigational system only) is encouraged but is left to the discretion of the investigator. Procedural recommendations • PVI must be confirmed and documented by entrance block of potentials in to the PV a minimum of 20 minutes following the last RF application in each PV or PV pair to monitor for PV reconnection. • Adenosine and/or isoproterenol may be administered 20 minutes following PVI to detect fo r the presence of dormant PV conduction. o Admi nistration of isoproterenol for the sole purpose to identify non -PV triggers is allowed but not recommended. • Exit block testing is not required, but if performed, exit block must be demonstrated for the PVI to be considered successful. If conduction resum es in any of the PVs, additional RF application can be applied until PVI is achieved. If additional ablation is performed following reconnection of PV, PVI must be reconfirmed at a minimum of 20 minutes followin g last ablation in the respective PV or PV pa ir. • Empiric targeting of complex fractionated electrogram, rotors, ganglionated plexi or performing left atrial mitral isthmus or roof lines are not recommended."
53,page_53,"DIAMOND -AF Investigational Plan TP00599 Revision F ______________________________________________________________________________ Confidential Page 54 of 82 • Spontaneously -occurring atrial arrhythmias that present during the procedure are allowed to b e ablated at the investigator’s discretion. o CTI-dependent (typical) flutter is also allowed if the subject has a known history of typical flutter. • Cardioversions do not signify procedural failures and are not ad verse events. A post-ablation EGM/12 lead ECG documenting the subject’s rhythm at the end of the procedure will be collected. All procedure logistical data, ablation parameters, procedural outcomes, adverse events, fluids administered from both catheter an d non -catheter sources (i.e., steerable sheath, etc.) and medications administered will be recorded and reported throughout the procedure. Prophylactic administration of intravenous diuretics during or after the procedure is allowed and will not be conside red an adverse event. All ablation catheters must be removed from the subject and inspected for char and coagulum formation if there is a generator cutoff (impedance or temperature) as well as each time a steam pop is observed. Ablation data collected d uring the procedure wi ll include but may not be limited to: • Catheter lot/serial number(s) used • Temperature set point • Power set point • Total number of RF applications for PVI • Total number of RF applications during the procedure • Total RF time during the proc edure • ACT levels and t imes taken • Location of additional ablations performed and number of RF applications per location • Total fluid infused from the ablation catheter • Presence of char or coagulum formation and incidence(s) of steam pops • Procedure and fluoro scopy times • EP record ing system gain and filter settings for the ablation distal recording channel and manufacturer If at any time during the ablation procedure the investigator is unable to continue the ablation with the investigational or control cathet er (other than when ab lating an RA flutter line), the investigator may consider the case a procedural failure and complete the case with a device determined best for the subject. The point at which failure was determined as well as the rationale must be d ocumented. After remov al from the subject, the investigation al or control catheter should be inspected, and if any abnormalities such as char or coagulum formation are noted on the catheter, it must be documented. All adverse experiences with the investig ational device during the ablation procedure must be promptly reported to the Sponsor and documented on the CRF."

Investigators may use p rotamine to reverse the intravenous hep arin used during the procedure. Subjects must be anticoagulated for a minimum o f 60 days post index ablation procedure. It is up to the investigator’s discretion which drug is best suited for the subject. If anticoagulation was discontinued prior to and during the ablation procedure, anticoagulation should be resumed within 24 hour s post -procedure to achieve a therapeutic anticoagulation level. It is r ecommended that investigators follow the anticoagulation guidelines set forth in the 2017 HRS Expert Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of AF [26], regardless of the apparent success or fa ilure of the AF ablation procedure . Additionally, the Investigator’s dec ision regarding continuation of systemic anticoagulation more than 60 days post ablation should be based on the subject’ s stroke risk profile (e.g CHA 2DS 2-VASc score ≥2 in men and ≥3 in women, prior stroke or TIA and/or age ≥75 years) and not on the percei ved success or failure of the ablation procedure. If AADs are restarted following the ablation procedure, it is recommended to maintain subject s on a drug regimen for a duration of 2 to 4 weeks to address sympto ms or early recurrences of AF, AFL or AT during the post-ablation healing and stabilization phase. If AADs are restarted for clinical reasons during the blanking period but not later than the 3 - month follow -up visit, it is recommended that subject s are maintained under the same AAD regimen throughou t the effectiveness pe riod (12 -month follow -up). During the effectiveness evaluation period, physicians may discontinue an AAD, but may not add a new class or substitute an AAD . 11.6 Pre-Dischar ge Follow -Up Visit Prior to being discharged from the hospit al, subjects will complete a pre -discharge visit. The evaluation while in the hospital will include but i s not limited to the following: • Complete Physical Exam to assess for procedure related complications per investigational center’s standard of care including but not limited to : o Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, temperature) will be obtained o Cardiovascular and pulmonary examination o Standard neurological assessment o Catheter insertion sites (both groins) will be assessed • Assess th e subject for any adverse events following ablation procedure • Perform a 12 -lead ECG o Report presence or absence of atrial fibrillation or othe r supraventricular tachycardias • NIH St roke Scale Evaluation follow -up"

Investigators may perform one repeat ablation procedure in su bjects with highly symptomatic or multiple early recurrences of atrial arrhythmias that cannot be controlled with antiarrhythmic therapy [26, 28]. Subjects with documented early recurrence during the blanking period are not being considered a primary eff ectiveness failure. The repeat ablation procedure must be performed with the originally assigned investigational or control catheter. Prior to the repeat ablation procedure, subjects must meet the pre - ablation requirements described in Section 11.4 and re peat baseline NIH Stroke Scale and"

Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) Any SAE or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or risk analysis plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associat ed with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. Study staff must complete and AE and device deficiency CRF within 1 business day of becoming aware of the event and report to IRB/EC or FDA/CA per local/regional regulations. Adverse events will be recorded, rep orted and followed for all subjects for the duration of their participation in the study regardless of whether they are in the investigational or control cohort . The Principal Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC, and regulatory authorities of UADE (s) and SAE (s) as required by local /regional regulations . Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by the clinical investigational plan, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered as part of the primary composite safety endpoint . Additionally, underlying diseases/ pre -existing conditions will not be reported as an A E unless there has been a substantial increase in the severity or frequency of the problem which has not been attributed to natural h istory during the investigation. To this extent, hospitalizations due to recurrent AF / AFL or prolonged hospitalization following procedure to adjust anticoagulation regimen or to administer diuretic medication are not consider ed AEs for this study. Devi ce-Related Adverse Event An AE is considered to be device -related (ADE) when, in the o pinion of the Investigator, the clinical event has an association in time and/or proximity with the use of the investigational device such that it is reasonable and lik ely that the investigational device directly caused or contributed to the AE. A device -related adverse event that impacts or potentially impacts a primary and/or secondary safety endpoint will be reviewed and adjudicated by the indepen dent CEC . ADE s includ e any AE resulting from insufficient or inadequate IFU, deployment, operation, or malfun ction of the investigational medical device , as well as, from intentional misuse of the device . Procedure -Related Adverse Event An AE is considere d to be procedure -related when, in the opinion of the Investigator, it is reasonable to belie ve that the eve nt is associated with the ablation procedure and is not specific to the i nvestigational device used and that other products, surgical techniques, or"

Device Deficiency Reporting A device deficiency is defined as any inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunctions, misuse or use erro rs and inadequate labeling. Device deficiencies related to the investiga tional a blation system s may occur in the absence of any associated AE and must be completely documented on a CRF . Device deficiencies related to the DiamondTemp Ablation System and a ssociated accessories should be reported to the Sponsor within two ( 2) business days and returned to the sponsor for analysis as expeditiously as possible . Instructions for returning the clinical device(s) will be provided to investigational sites by the S ponsor . If it is not possible to return the device, the investigator shou ld document why the device was not returned and the final disposition of the device. Device failures and malfunctions should also be documented in the subject’s medical record. If a device deficiency is associated with an AE that specific event would be recorded as an AE. Device deficiencies related to the control system will be handled per the hospital standard complaint handling procedure. Note: Any Device Deficiency that might have led to an SAE if a) suitable action had not been taken or b) interventio n had not been made or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate is considered reportable and should be notified to ACT. 12.9. Protocol Deviations The Investigator is not allow ed to deviate from the protocol without prior approval by Sponsor and prior review and documented approval from the governing IRB/EC . Under emergency circumstances, deviations from the clinical investigation plan to protect the rights, safety and well -being of human subjects may proceed without prior approval of the sponsor and the IRB/EC . Reports of any deviation from the clinical investigational plan as per above emergency circumstances will be reported to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC as soon as possible a fter detection, but no later than twenty -four (24) hours from the time of the deviation. Deviations must be documented on the appropriate protocol deviation CRF . Any report of withdrawal of IRB/EC approval will be submitted to the Sponsor within five (5) w orking days. If a Clinical Monitor becomes aware that an Inve stigator is not complying with the signed Investigator’s Agreement, the Investigational Plan, the requirements of ISO 14155 or other applicable regulations, or any conditions of approval imposed by the reviewing IRB/EC Committee, Sponsor will immediately e ither secure compliance or discontinue shipments of the device to the Investigator and terminate the Investigator’s participation in the"

The Investigator will be required to retur n all investigational components to Sponsor , unless this acti on would jeopardize the rights, safety or welfare of a subject . Protocol deviations will be analyzed by Sponsor for the impact to the overall integrity of the study. Input from the statistician and/or the D ata Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) may be obtaine d to determine if the deviation warrants disqualifying the Investigator. Disqualification is warranted when an investigator has repeatedly or deliberately violated governing regulations or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted false information in any report. Where protocol deviations occur, which do not warrant disqualification from a study, Sponsor w ill implement appropriate corrective and preventive actions, including repeat training as d eemed necessary. 12.10 Investigational Device Accountability No device supplies will be shipped to the Investigator until IRB/EC and regulatory authority (CA and/or FDA) approval has been achieved in writing and each Investigator has supplied Sponsor w ith copies of the IRB/EC approval document and the approved informed consent form to be used. The investigational devices are to be used only in this clinical investigation and according to this protocol and the IFU. The devices for use in this study must be stored in a secure area. The secure area will have restricted access and the study devices will be kept separate from other medical devices. The study devices will only be handled by trained personnel and will not be supplied to any individual not involv ed in the investigation. The study devices will be inventoried at regular intervals during the study and all unused or expired devices will be returned to the Sponsor when study enrollment is closed. The Principal Investigator or his/her authorized repres entative is responsible to keep records documenting t he receipt, use, return and disposal of the investigational devices. A form will be provided to the site that will log the device model, lot number or serial number and date received by the site.

Risk Minimization A comprehensive functional risk analysis was performed to quantify the risks associated with the use of the DiamondTemp Ablation System. This functional risk analysis evaluated the potential interfaces of the DiamondTemp Ablation System with the subject and/or user and listed the potential harms and potential causes. The associated probability of each cause was estimated and risk control m easures were considered and implemented to further reduce the potential for all risks."
67,page_67,"DIAMOND -AF Investigational Plan TP00599 Revision F ______________________________________________________________________________ Confidential Page 68 of 82 The completed risk analyses of th e DiamondTemp Ablation System identified all known potential risks to the subject and user. All risks were categorized in the negligib le or marginal categories. Since all identified risks were low or moderate, the design is determined to be safe for human use. The risk analysis did not result in findings of any risk that would be considered intolerable. The potential risks associated wit h any ablation procedure include standard surgical risks for example: infection, electrical shock, perforation, tamponade , skin burns and complications associated with use of ancillary devices, drugs, and anesthetic. The DiamondTemp Ablation System does n ot create new risks nor does it increase procedural risks as compared with other ablation systems for electrophysiology p rocedures. The risks associated with the use of the DiamondTemp Ablation System have been identified and evaluated, controls have been put in place to adequately mitigate risks, and a system is implemented that monitors the effectiveness of the risk contro ls and provides a process to implement corrective and preventive actions The DiamondTemp Ablation System is similar in design to existi ng commercial ablation systems and intends to provide an equivalent functionality to existing irrigated electrophysiology ablation catheter /system s on the market. Additionally , technology integrated within the catheter allows to measure interface tissue t emperature and the RF generator can be set to automatically adjust the power to achieve a desired interface tissue temper ature. The DiamondTem p Ablation System does no t introduce any new or additional safety risks beyond those associated with similar cardi ovascular and ablation procedures. Further, the system is also capable of assessing the extent of contact between the abl ation electrode and the cardiac tissue ensuring good energy to transfer to the therapy location. This study is intended to evaluate the safety and performance effectiveness of the DiamondTemp Ablation System for the treatment of atrial arrhythmias. Risks associated with the DIAMOND -AF Study can be minimized through appropriate training of Investigators and research staff , compliance to this protocol , adherence to inclusion / exclusion criteria and by promptly supplying Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics with data and information required by this protocol. Additionally, extensive in vitro bench and in vivo animal studies have been successfully performed with the DiamondTemp Ablation System. V erification and lot release testing for all components of the sy stem will be completed. The associated risks proposed in this study are similar to risks posed by other interventional, electrophysiological c ardiac procedures. Based upon the risk analysis conducted to assess the DiamondTemp Ablation System, ACT has determined that the benefits of the device can outweigh the risks if used in the appropriate patient population by a physician trained in the use of electrophysiology procedures . As a primary treatment for cardiac arrhythmias, the DiamondTemp Ablation System is deter mined to be safe for human use. 13.3. Benefits Participants in this research study may or may not receive benefits from participation in this study as compared to standard of care treatment of PAF."
68,page_68,"DIAMOND -AF Investigational Plan TP00599 Revision F ______________________________________________________________________________ Confidential Page 69 of 82 Based on bench and clinical testing with th e DiamondTemp Ablation System it is expected that the subjects enrolled in this study will experience similar benefits as those of the currently a vailable commercial systems. Subjects included in this research s tudy may benefit from closer evaluation of their atrial fibrillation via more frequent office follow -ups, cardiac event monitoring and from having diagnostic non -invasive and invasive evalu ation of their cardiac anatomy in the event of previously undiagnosed cardiac abnormalities . There is potenti al that subjects may have their AF eliminated or AF burden reduced resulting in a better quality of life and reduced need for medication. Additio nally, there may be a benefit to the subjects enrolled in this study through improved therapy delivery. The D iamondTemp system was designed to provide investigators with additional information to a) monitor real -time tissue interface temperatures b) autom atically adjust output power to a temperature set point based on the composite temperature c) utilize a low ir rigation flow rate for all power output up to 50 Watts. 14. MONITORING Monitoring will be performed during the study to assess continued compli ance with the protocol and applicable regulations. Monitoring will occur in line with the Study Monitoring Pla n. 14.1. Study Monitor Study Monitors assigned to the DIAMOND -AF study will be responsible for reviewing the device accountability documentation and subject data as collected on CRFs or via an EDC system. The monitor will ensure that the clinical protocol has been approved by the IRB/EC and will assure ongoing compliance with clinical protocol. The Investigator/institution guarantees direct acces s to original source documents by Sponsor personnel, their designees, and appropriate regulatory authorities. 14.2. Monitoring Procedures Monitoring visits to the clinical sites will be made periodically to ensure that Investigators and their staff unders tand and accept their defined responsibilities, assess compliance with current GCP guidelines, evaluat e clinic al trial progress, assess the continued acceptability of the clinical site facilities, assess compliance with th e investigational plan, and verify the accuracy of data recorded on CRFs or via an EDC system to source documentation . The Sponsor Monitor or its designated representative will be allowed to visit the clinical site and have direct access to all study records throughout the duration of the study. The Monitor will review all source data and compare them to the data documented in the ca se report forms, in addition to performing a review of the Re gulatory Binder and conducting device accountability. Subject safety will be ensured by noting tha t consent was properly documented, the investigational plan was followed and that AEs were report ed and followed - up as appropriate. The Investigator and/or institutio n will provide direct access to source data/documents for trial-related monitoring, a udits , IRB/ EC review and regulatory inspection."
69,page_69,"DIAMOND -AF Investigational Plan TP00599 Revision F ______________________________________________________________________________ Confidential Page 70 of 82 It is important that the Investigator and relevant s tudy per sonnel are available during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. Additionally, telephone and/or e -mail contact wil l be conduc ted on a regular basis with the Investigator and the site staff to ensure that the pro tocol i s being followed and to address any issues that may occur during the trial. If a deficiency is noted during the trial the Clinical Monitor is required t o bring this to the attention of A CT Clinical Affairs Management to discuss the situat ion and (if required) to secure compliance. The study Monitor will evaluate and summarize the results of each clinical site visit in written reports, identifying any rep eated data problems with any Investigator and specifying recommendations for resolution of noted deficiencies. As required by IDE regulations, the conduct and monitoring of the clinical investigation will be conducted in accordance with the Sponsor’s appro ved monitoring plan. 14.3. ECG Core Lab A designated CRO , HeartcoR Solutions, LLC (Algo nquin, IL) will provide centers and/or subjects with instructions and training on the use of an event monitors that serves as a hand - held event recorder for short du ration recordings and can be worn as a 24 hr. Holter . Subjects will be provided with an event monitor prior to discharge from t he hospital and instructed to collect 1-minute ECG recordings with their e vent monitor i f they experience AF symptoms throughout the study . Additionally, subje cts will be required to collect 1 -minute ECG recordings with their event monitor two times per month starting at the end of the 3 - month blanking period to the 12 -month fo llow up visit. The event monitors will be configured to automatically transmit recordings securely and wirelessly to the core lab. All events will be analyzed by the core lab to determine if symptoms are associated with arrhythmia recurrence. The core l ab will be blinded to subject treatment assignment. T he company will identify the subject’s transmitted rhythm and send reports to the investigational center within 72 hours. If there is discordance between the core labs rhythm analysis in the report and the investigator, a third -party cardiologist will be used for final rhythm determination. All event monitors should be returned to the Core Lab after a subject completes the study. At 6 and 12 months post -ablation procedure, the event monitor will be con figured to take a 24-hr continuous reading (like a Holter monitor ) supplied by th e core lab . The ECG core lab will also review, analyze and report on all event and Holter recordings as well as the 12 -lead ECGs taken at the 3, 6 and 12 -month follow -up visi ts. 14.4. Data Safety Monitoring Board The purpose of the DSMB committee is to complete unbiased review of all safety data in comparison to the established criteria in order to determine if the rate of SAEs is acceptable, to evaluate interim data analysis results, to provide related advice on study managemen t and progress, and to make any recommendations regarding the study protocol.
