Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 2/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, CO39722 VERSION 5: RATIONA LE Protocol CO39722 has been amended primarily to add nephritis as a risk associated with atezolizumab. Additional minor changes and clarifications have also been made. Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are summarized below: The Medical Monitor information has been updated ( protocol cover page, Protocol Amendment Acceptance Form, and Section 5.4.1 ). The assessor of the secondary endpoint of disease control rate was not previously defined. This secondary endpoint has been updated to include disease control rate determined by the independent review committee ( IRC) and the investigator (Section 2 [Table 1] and Section 6.4.2). The inclusion criterion that addresses female contraception has been modified to specify when women must refrain from donating eggs (Section 4.1.1.2). Language has been a dded to clarify use of samples after withdrawal of patient consent (Section 4.5.6.2). Immune -related nephritis as an important identified risk for atezolizumab has been added to the protocol, together with its management guidelines for renal events (Section 5.1.2 , Section 5.1.5.3, and Appendix 11). Language has been updated to indicate that therapeutic or elective abortions are not considered adverse events unless performed because of an underlying maternal or embryofetal toxicity. In such cases, th e underlying toxicity should be reported as a serious adverse event. Language has also been added to clarify that all abortions are to be reported on the paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form (Section 5.4.3.3). Language has been added for consiste ncy with Roche's current data retention policy and to accommodate more stringent local requirements (if applicable) (Section 7.6). A link to the list of laboratory results that must be obtained within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug treatment ,per the inclusion criteria ,has now been included in the schedule of assessments in order to increase awareness of this requirement (Appendix 1, footnote “a” of Tables 1 and 2) . The treatment window of 7 days has been changed to 3 days in the schedule o f assessments for consistency with the visit windows for the study ( Appendix 1, footnote s“x”and “z” of Table 1 and footnote “w” of Table 2) . The 3-day window for biomarker samples on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 has been removed from the schedule of assessm ents. It has been clarified that these assessments must be done on the day of study drug administration on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 prior to infusion ( Appendix 2, footnote “a” ). Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency. Substantive new information appears in italics. This amendment represents cumulative changes to the original protocol."

16,page_16,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 16/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5This study will be conducted globally and approximately 450 patients will be randomized in a 1:1ratio to one of two treatment arms: Arm A: Patients will receive 60 mg of cobimetinib by mouth (PO) on a 21 days on, 7 days off (21/7) schedule (dosing on Days 1 –21, followed by no dosing on Day s22–28) plus 840mg of atezolizumab by intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28 -day c ycle (n225). Arm B: Patients will receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab administered by IV infusion ever y 3weeks (Q3 W) (n225). Stratification factors are PD -L1 status (IC0vs. IC 1, 2, 3), baseline serum LDH level (less than or equal to the upper limit of normal [ ULN]vs. greater than the ULN) , and geographic region (North America vs. Europe vs. Australia, New Zealand, and others) . A permuted -block randomization will be applied to ensure a balanced assignment to each treatment arm. Randomization and stratification will be managed through an interactive Web-based response s ystem (IWRS). The Sponsor will monitor enrollment in each region ( North America ,Europe ,Australia, New Zealand, and others ). To ensure balanced global enrollment, the Sponsor may institute temporary limitations on enrollment in certain regions in the event of dispro portionate accrual of patients. Assessments and Monitoring After signing informed consent, all patients will undergo screening procedures that include testing for BRAFV600wild-type melanoma and PD -L1 status; laboratory tests (e.g., hematology, chemistries, liver function tests); left ventricular function evaluation (on echocardiogram [ECHO] or multiple -gated acquisition [MUGA] scan); ECG, contrast -enhanced computed tomogra phy (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and ophthalmologic assessments. All eligible patients will be randomized to treatment in a 1:1 ratio to either Arm A (cobimetinib plus atezolizumab) or Arm B (pemb rolizumab). All patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability during all cycles of therapy, at the treatment discontinuation visit, and during the follow -up period. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Eve nts, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0) will be used to characterize the toxicity profile of study treatments for all patients. Patients will be assessed for adverse events according to the schedule of activities and as necessary throughout the study. Tumor response will be evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Any evaluable and measurable disease must be documented at screening and re -assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation. Investigators will ass ess tumor response at 8 -week intervals, regardless of any dose delays or treatment cycle. Study treatment will continue for all patients until investigator -determined disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 that is confirmed by repeat scans 4 8weeks later, unacceptable toxicity, death, patient or physician decision to withdraw, or pregnancy, whichever occurs first. Patients who experience disease progression must have scans repeated 4 8weeks after initial documentation of progression to confirm dise ase progression. These results will be used as part of the explorator y analyses for assessing efficacy based on immune -modified RECIST . Tumor assessments are to continue according to schedule for patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than confirmed disease progression. Clinically stable patients who have disease progression may continue, as described below. Clinically stable patients who have a favorable benefit risk ratio may continue study treatment following radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1 but approval will need to be provided by the Medical Monitor on a case- by-case basis. Patients who continue treatment beyond radiographic disease progression will be closely monitored. Treatment will be discontinued if clinical deterioration because of disease progression occurs at any time or if persistent disease growth is confirmed on follow -up scans performed 4 8weeks later . Patients who discontinue one study drug in Arm A may be able to continue the other study drug, per guidelines for management of specific adverse events. After treatment discontinuation,"
17,page_17,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 17/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5patients will be followed for disease progression if applicable, and followed for survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow -up, whichever occurs first. If a patient withdraws from the study, study staff may use a public information source (e.g., county records) to obtain information about survival stat us only . This study will not allow crossover to other study drug(s) at the time of progression. All patients who discontinue from study treatment because of radiographic disease progression or any other reasons will be asked to complete the European Qualit y of Life 5 -Dimension, 5 - Level questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ -C30), approximately ever y 28 days for 6 months after the last dose of study treatmen t. Dosing of Study Treatment beyond Disease Progression Dosing of study treatment beyond RECIST v1.1 defined disease progression is allowed for patients in all treatment arms. Dosing of study treatment will continue until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit, as determined by the investigator, after an integrated assessment of radiographic and biochemical data, local biopsy results (if available), and clinical status (e.g., s ymptomatic deterioration such as pain secondary to disease). Because of the possibility of an initial increase in tumor burden caused by IC infiltration in the setting of a T -cell response (termed pseudoprogression) with anti-PD-1 or anti -PD-L1 treatment, radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1 may not be indicative of true disease progression. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet criteria for disease progression per RECIST v1.1 while receiving study treatment will be permitted to continue study treatment if they meet allof the following criteria: Evidence of clinical benefit, as determined by the investigator following a review of all available data Absence of sy mptoms and signs (including laboratory values, such as new or worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease No decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status that can be attributed to disease progression Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease) that cannot be managed by protocol -allowed medica l interventions Approval by the Medical Monitor Safety Data Review The Sponsor’s study team will review data on adverse events, serious adverse events, the frequency of deaths from all causes , and any other safety data (for both treatment arms combined) i n the study on an ongoing basis. It is the responsibility of the study team to review accumulating safety data, to assess and monitor ongoing safety in patients, to evaluate potential changes to the clinical study protocol, and ultimately, to safeguard pat ient safety. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will be employed to conduct periodic evaluations of safety data. All analyses for the iDMC’s review will be prepared by an independent data coordinating center. Specific details, including resp onsibilities and structure of the iDMC, will be specified in an iDMC charter. Number of Patients The planned enrollment specifies a total of approximately 450 patients.

Statistical Methods Unless otherwise noted, all efficacy analyses will include all randomized patients (i.e., the intent- to-treat population), and patients will be grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization. Primary A nalysis Unless otherwise noted, all efficacy analyses will include all randomized patients (i.e., the intent- to-treat population), and patients will be grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization. The primary efficacy analy sis will be the comparison of PFS, as determined by the IRC, between the two treatment arms using the stratified log -rank test at an overall 0.01 significance level (two-sided ). PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by the IRC according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Data for patients who have not experienced di sease progression or death will be censored at the last tumor assessment date. Data for patients with no post -baseline tumor assessment will be censored at randomization. The HR for PFS will be estimated using a stratified Cox model, and two -sided 95% c onfidence intervals (CIs) for the hazard ratio (HR) will be provided. The stratification factors used for analysis will be the same as the randomization stratification factors: PD -L1 status (IC0 vs. IC1, 2, 3), baseline LDH ( less than or equal to the ULN vs. greater than the ULN) , and geographic region (North America vs. Europe vs. Australia, New Zealand, and others). Results from an unstratified analysis will also be provided. Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to estimate the median PFS for each tr eatment arm, and Kaplan -Meier curves will be produced. The 95% CI of the median PFS for each treatment arm will be constructed using the Brookmeyer and Crowley method. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine the impact of missed scheduled tum or assessments on PFS, depending on the number of patients with missed assessments. Determination of Sample Size Approximately 450 patients will be randomized into the study. The overall type I error ( ) for this study is 0.05 (two -sided) .

BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND ON MELANOMA Melanoma is a potentially deadly form of skin cancer originating from melanocytes. Theclinical outcome of patients with melanoma is highly dependent on the stage at presentation. The outcome for promptl y diagnosed superficial tumors is good. In the metastatic setting, high rates of mortality and disease -related morbidity have improved significantly with recent therapeutic advances. The 5 -year overall survival (OS) rates were at 15.7% based on Surveilla nce, Epidemiology, and End Results data from 2012 (Siegel et al. 2016 ). In the KEYNOTE -006 study (pembrolizumab vs. ipilimumab) in advanced melanoma, the 1 -year OS rates ranged from 58% to 74% ( Robert et al. 2015b ). In 2012, there were approximately 232,000 new cases and 55,000 deaths from melanoma worldwide, with more than 100,000 new cases and 22,000 deaths in Europe (Ferlay et al. 2013 ). In the United States in 2016, an estimated 76,380 new diagnoses of melanoma wereprojected and approximately 10,130 patients are expected to die of the disease (American Cancer Society 2016 ). The incidence of melanoma is particularly high among Caucasian populations in Australia (42.4 per 100,000) and Western Europe (10.6 per 100,000) ( American Cancer Society 2016 ). Moreover, the number of melanoma cases worldwide is increasing faster than any other cancer. The annual increase in incidence rate varies between populations, but in gene ral, the rate has been in the order of 3% 7% per year for fair -skinned Caucasian populations ( Diepgen and Mahler 2002 ). Estimates suggest a doubling of the incidence of melanoma every 1020 years ( Garbe and Leiter 2009 ). Until recently, treatment options for metastatic melanoma were limited. Dacarbazine was considered to be the standard first -line treatment ;however ,outcomes were poor , with response rates of 5% –12%, median progression -free survival (PFS) of less than 2months, and median OSof 6.4 to 9.1 months ( Middleton et al. 2000 ;Bedikian et al. 2006 ; Chapman et al. 2011 ; Robert et al. 2011 ). Combination chemotherapy and chemot herapy combined with interferon -(IFN-)or interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), although showing improved response rates, have not resulted in improved OS (Chapman etal.1999 ;Ives et al. 2007 ). The mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade is a key intracellular signaling network that transduces multiple proliferative and differentiating signals from the extracellular environm ent to the nucleus of cells to activate cellular growth and differentiation ( Johnson and Lapadat 2002 ; Roberts and Der 2007 ). This pathway is highly implicated in pathogenesis of melanoma. Approximately 40% 50% of all melanomas harbor an activating mutation in BRAF , a major driver of RAS , RAF, MEK , ERK, and MAPK signaling ( Davies et al. 2002 ; Curtin et al. 2005 ;Jakob et al. 2012 ), and an additional 15% 30% harbor an activating mutation of neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS ) (Lee et al. 2011 ;Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2015). Approximately 14% harbor"
29,page_29,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 29/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5mutations of NF1, an inhibitory protein of the MAPK pathway ( Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2015 ). Thus, the MAPK pathway is an important driver of pathogenesis in BRAFV600wild-type melanoma, as well as in BRAFV600-mutated melanoma. In recent years, targeting of the MAPK pathway has emerged as an effective treatment strategy in BRAFV600-mutated melanoma and several targeted therapies are now approved globally for treat ment of this indication specifically ( Richman et al. 2015 ). Treatment option s for BRAFV600wild-type melanoma have also improved dramatically with approvals of several immunotherapeutic agents. Melanoma cells are highly immunogenic and thus an appropriate target for these agents (Zhu et al. 2016 ).Several immunotherapeutic agents, which interrupt T -cell suppression and render melanoma cells susceptible to immune attack, are currently available or are in development for the treatment of melanoma ( Zhu et al. 2016 ).The two- signal model of activation to overcome T -cell suppression, involves interaction of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with its antigen (signal one), followed by signal two, which is a co -stimulatory interaction between CD28 on the T-cell surface and its ligand B7 -1 on antigen -presenting cells (Chen and Flies 2013 ). Expression of c o-inhibitory receptors, also known as “immune checkpoints” by tumor cells , including cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein -4 (CTLA -4)and programmed death 1 (PD -1)receptor ,can prevent TCR ligand interaction and down regulate the immune system, thus rendering cancer cells immune t o cytotoxic Tcells (Freeman et al. 2000 ). Targeting of these checkpoint inhibitors disables this mechanism and allow sT cells to recognize and attack the cancer cells . Immunotherapeutic agents currently a pproved for advanced BRAF wild-type melanoma include the following : The anti CTLA-4 antibody , ipilimumab Two anti PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab Combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab Both single-agent and combination imm unotherapy with pembrolizumab, ipilimumab , and/or nivolumab have demonstrated an increased overall response rate (ORR) and improved PFS for the treatment of BRAF wild-type unresectable or metastatic melanoma with prolonged duration of responses (DORs) . Across multiple clinical trials responses to anti PD-1 agents are limited to 30 %–40% of patients ,with median PFS of 56months (Robert etal.2015a , 2015b ; Weber et al. 2015 )and OS of approximately 2024 months ( Hodi et al.2016 ;Robert et al. 2016) . Foripilimumab monotherapy, reported response rates are 10 %15% and OS is 1011 months (Hodi et al. 2010 ; Robert et al .2011 ).Of note, these response rates and PFS outcomes both in patients with BRAF -mutant melanoma and BRAF wild-type melanoma are still lower than the rates achieved with combined BRAF and MEK inhibition. Combination immunotherapy , in particular, results in challenging toxicity. InPhase III testing in previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma, the combination of ipilimumab an d nivolumab demonstrated an increased ORR and improved PFS relative to either agent as"
30,page_30,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 30/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5monotherapy but resulted in challenging toxicity, with more than 50% of patients experiencing Grade 3 adverse events. The O S benef it for this combination is not yet known ( Larkin et al. 2015). Despite the therapeutic advance sachieved by development of these agents, high unmet need still exists for patients with advanced BRAFV600wild-type melanoma. 1.2 BACKGROUND ON STUDY TREATMENTS 1.2.1 Cobimetinib Cobimetinib is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of MEK, a central component of the MAPK pathway. Activated MEK triggers downstream signaling through ERK to promote growth. Cancer cells transformed by BRAFV600are exceptionally sensitive to MEK inhibition in vitro. Allosteric MEK inhibitors can result in G 1phase growth arrest in melanoma cells ( Solit etal.2006 ; Haass et al. 2008). Invitro, MEK inhibit ors reduce cell proliferation, soft agar colony formation, and matrigel invasion of BRAFV600 mutation positive melanoma cells, and are also effective against BRAFV600 mutation positive melanoma xenografts, which is suggestive of a potentially important role for MEK inhibitors in melanoma and other tumors that harbor the BRAFV600mutation (Solit etal.2006 ). Cobimetinib (Cotellic®), in combination with vemurafenib, is approved in the United States, European Union ,and multiple other countries across the world for use with vemur afenib for the treatment of advanced BRAF -mutated melanoma. Cobimetinib shows anti -tumor activity in both nonclinical models and patients with cancer and is being investigated as a potential therapy in a wide variety of malignancies and in combination wit h chemotherapy, other targeted therapies, and cancer immunotherapy. Refer to the Cobimetinib Investigator’s Brochure for details on nonclinical and clinical studies. 1.2.2 Atezolizumab Atezolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1)and inhibits the interaction between PD -L1 and its receptors, PD-1 and B7 -1 (also known as CD80), both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells. Therapeutic blockade of PD -L1 binding by atezolizumab has been shown to enhance the magnitude and quality of tumor -specific T -cell responses, resulting in improved anti -tumor activity ( Fehrenbacher et al. 2016 ; Rosenberg et al. 2016 ).

Atezolizumab is being studied as a single agent in the advanced cancer and adjuvant therapy settings, as well as in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and cancer immunotherapy.

The effects of MAPK pathway inhibition on tumor microenvironment may enhance anti -tumor T cell mediated immunity and is supported by preclinical and clinical data as summarized in this section. The nonclinical data elucidating the effect of MAPK inhibition on tumor immune contexture are presented in Section 1.3.2 . The effects of MAPK inhibitors on tumor immune contexture in patients treated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors in clinical trials are summarized in Section 1.3.3 . 1.3.2 Effect on MA PK Inhibition on Tumor Immune Contexture 1.3.2.1 Nonclinical Data The MAPK pathway has been implicated in the regulation of the immune microenvironment of tumors. In in vitro cell lines , blocking the MAPK pathway was shown to increase antigen expression and enhance reactivity to antigen -specific Tlymphocytes ( Boni et al. 2010). MEK inhibition has also been shown to increase tumor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression and PD -L1 expression in triple -negative breast cancer cells invivo and in vitro ( Loi et al. 2016 ). Additional MAPK inhibition effects may further modulate the tumor microenvironment in ways that could enable an improved immune reaction against the tumor. These effects include inc reased recruitment and activation status of CD8 -positive and CD4 -positive Tcells and reduced secretion of granulocyte- colony stimulating factor, which reduces mobilization and activity of CD11 -positive GRL -positive myeloid -derived suppressor cells (Phan et al. 2013; Ebert et al. 2016 ) as well as reduces expression of angiogenesis"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 32/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5factors with altered tumor vascular support ( Ciuffreda et al. 2009 ; Chang et al. 2013 ; Mohan et al. 2015 ). The MEK inhibitor G -38963, which is mechanistically similar to cobimetinib, promotes the effector phenotype and longevity of tumor -infiltrating T cells in a CT26 colon cancer mouse model and combines synergistically with anti PD-L1 in inhibiting growth of CT26 tumors ( Ebert et al. 2016 ). 1.3.2.2 Clinical Data This section describes the tumor biopsy data from patients treated with MAPK inhibitors in clinical t rials. Clinical data from cobimetinib and atezolizumab monotherapy trials are presented in Sections 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 , respectively. C linical efficacy, safety, and biomarker data from patients treated with the combination in Study GP28363 are provided in Section 1.3.5 . Intumor biopsies from patients with melanoma, BRAF and MEK inhibitors, alone or in combination, have been shown to increase m elanoma antigen expression, MHC Class I expression, T -cell infiltration, and PD -L1 expression ( Wilmott et al. 2012; Frederick etal.2013 ;Hu-Lieskovan et al. 2015 ; Kavakand et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2015 ). Furthermore, pretreatment biopsies in which there were increased tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes demonstrated a lar ger increase in tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes and PD -L1 expression after treatment with a BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor (Kakavand et al. 2015 ; Liu et al. 2015 ). Collectively ,and as presented in Section 1.3.4 , the data demonstrate that inhibition of the MAPK pathway leads to an increase in immune effector cells in the tumo r, thus priming the microenvironment to enable the immune system to attack the tumor. 1.3.3 Activity of Cobimetinib and OtherMEK Inhibitors in BRAFV600Wild -Type Melanoma In the Phase Ia study MEK4592g, activity of cobimetinib given as a single agent was limited to BRAF -mutated melanoma. Clinical evidence for modest anti -tumor activity of MEK inhibition in a subset of patients with BRAFV600wild-type melanoma has recently been provided by the NEMO Phase III study, which demonstrated i mproved PFS for si ngle-agent binimetinib, a small molecule MEK inhibitor, in patients with BRAFV600wild-type NRAS -mutated advanced melanoma relative to dacarbazine (hazard ratio [HR] 0.62). Even binimetinib has limited efficacy in the NRAS -mutated population for which a MEK inhibitor would be expected to have optimal efficacy ( Dummer et al. 2016). As described in Section 1.1, the MAPK pathway is also highly implicated in BRAF wild-type melanoma."

Stage 1is designed to establish the combination maximum tolerated dose or maximum administered dose for cobimetinib plus atezolizumab. In Stage 2, the recommended Phase II dose and schedule were investigated in tumor -specific expansion cohorts: metastatic melanoma, KRAS -mutant and wild -type metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), and non small cell lung cancer. In a separate mandatory biopsy cohor t, patients with diverse solid tumors (n 16), including CRC, received 60 mg of cobimetinib once a day (QD) as monotherapy before initiation of atezolizumab treatment and underwent mandatory fresh biopsy collection before initiation of cobimetinib dosing and at the end of the 14 -day period of cobimetinib monotherapy.

The data support the hypothesis that cobimetinib has beneficial immunomodulatory effect s at the tumor site that allow for immune anti -tumor activity. Safety in Patients with Melanoma In the 17 January 2017 data cut for melanoma, the safety data were generally similar for the 22 patients with melanoma andthe overall treated population (N=15 0). The mean duration of safety follow -up was 14 months (range: 2 26 months). For treatment -related adverse events, 100% of patients experienced at least one adverse event; 59.0% of patients experienced a Grade 3 adverse event; and 14.0% of patients ex perienced a serious adverse event, which included pulmonary embolism, bacterial infection, and pain management. There were no Grade 5 (fatal) adverse events in the melanoma cohort. The most common treatment -related adverse events (occurring in 20% of melanoma patients) as of 17 January 2017 were diarrhea (86.0%), rash (68.0%), fatigue (45.0%), nausea (45.0%), pruritus (45.0%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (32.0%), vomiting (32.0%), abdominal pain (23.0%), decreased appetite (23.0%), and dermatit is acneiform (23.0%). In this cohort, the most common Grade 3 events (occurring in 5% of patients) were diarrhea (14.0%), anemia (9.0%), dermatitis acneiform (9.0%), amylase increased (5.0%), asthenia (5.0%), bacterial infection (5.0%), edema peripheral (5%), lipase increased (5.0%), maculopapular rash (5.0%), musculoskeletal pain (5.0%), myalgia (5.0%), rash (5.0%), pain management (5.0%), pulmonary embolism (5.0%), pruritus (5.0%), seizure (5.0%), and vomiting (5.0%). Safety in All Patients As of 12 July 2016, a total of 150 patients were enrolled in the study and evaluable for safety. Fourteen patients had been accrued in the dose- escalation phase (Stage 1, Cohorts 13), and 136 patients had been accrued in the expansion phase (Stage 2). To be considered evaluable for safety, patients must have received at least one dose of cobimetinib or atezolizumab. All patients who received atezolizumab also received cobimetinib. The mean duration of safety follow -up was 6.59 months (range: 0.7–26.4 months). Safety follow -up is defined as the number of days from the date of the first dose to the minimum date of the last dose plus 30 days, discontinuation date, initiation date of another anti-cancer therapy, cutoff date, or the date of death. Overal l, 96.7% of patients experienced at least one adverse event regardless of attribution; 65.3% of patients experienced a Grade 3 adverse event; and 44.0% of patients experienced a serious adverse event. There were five Grade 5 (fatal) adverse events (3.3% ) in the study, of which four were assessed as unrelated to study drug.

The most common Grade 3 events (occurring in 5% of patients) were fatigue (9.3%), anemia (8.7% ), and diarrhea (8.0%). 1.3.5.1.2 Summary The improved ORR and DCR suggest that the combination of cobimetinib and atezolizumab may lead to longer PFS than either agent given as monotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma. Together with the biomarker da ta from the mandatory biopsy cohort, the data suggest that cobimetinib may alter tumor immune contexture, thereby enhancing atezolizumab activity. The safety profile was consistent with other cobimetinib studies, and no new safety concerns were reported. 1.3.6 Benefit Risk Assessment This Phase III protocol is based on a strong scientific rationale for combining cobimetinib and atezolizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced BRAFV600wild-type melanoma (see Section 1.3.1 ) and is supported by compelling clinical data from melanoma patients treated with the combination in Study GP28363 (see Section 1.3.5.1 ). The protocol includes eligibility criteria, baseline measurements, and recommendations for management of adverse events, i ncluding guidelines for dose modifications, delays, and discontinuation of one or more of the study drugs that are designed to enhance the safety of patients in this trial. Oversight of this study will be provided by the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (see Section 3.1.3 ).Additionally, an independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) will be employed to monitor and evaluate patient safet y throughout the study. Treatment options are limited for patients with advanced BRAFV600wild-type melan oma whose disease is unresectable or metastatic .Given the unmet need in this indication, the efficacy and safety data for cobimetinib and atezolizumab given as single agents and in combination (Study GP28363 )in advanced melanoma, the biomarker data from Study GP28363 thatsuggest that the effects of cobimetinib on tumor immune contexture may sensitize tum ors to anti PD-1and anti PD-L1 agents, together with a potentially much improved tolerated safety profile and the extent of safety monitoring proposed, the potential benefits for patients with this indication outweigh the potential risks. Given the unmet need that still exists in advanced BRAFV600wild-type melanoma, these data support development of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab in this indication."

Cobimetinib and atezolizumab in combination were found to be safe and tolerable with cobimetinib on the approved dose and schedule of 60 mg QD 21/7, and atezolizumab 800 mg IV Q2W, which is equivalent to the approved dose and schedule for treatment of bladder cancer of 1200 mg IV Q3 W. Cobimetinib will be administered at the approved dose and schedule of 60 mg QD 21/7 for each 28 -day cycle. The 800- mg Q2 W dose of atezolizumab was evaluated in Study GP28363, which is the pharmacokinetic (PK) equivalent of the dose of 1200 mg Q3W in bladder cancer. To simplify dosing, the dose was rounded up to 840 mg (1 mL of drug), which is further supported by the nonclinical dosing data and is not expected to be different from the 800 -mg dose. 3.3.2 Rationale for Pembrolizumab Dose and Schedule (ArmB,Control) Pembrolizumab will be administered at the approved dose and schedule of 2 00mgIV Q3W. Pembrolizumab is considered standard of care and is approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma . Please refer to pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) local prescribing information for a list of approved indications and a complete summary of safety information. Based on the KEYNOTE -006Phase III trial of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in advanced melanoma, the estimated 6- month PFS rate was 46.4% and 26.5% for pembrolizumab Q3 W and ipilimumab, respectively ( HR0.58). The median estimates of PFS were 5.5 months versus 2.8 months. The estimated 12-month OS rates were 68.4% and 58.2% for pembrolizumab and ipilimumab, respectively (HR 0.69) . The ORR with pembrolizumab was 32.9% relative to 11.9% with ipilimumab (Robert et al .2015 b). InKEYNOTE -001, a Phase Ib trial of pembrolizumab inpatients with ipilimumab -naive and ipilimumab- treated advanced melanoma, the m edian OS for all patients (n655) was 24.4 months.Of note, the m edian OS for patients who had not received any prior systemic treatment (n152) was 32.2 months. Three -year OS rates were 40% and 45% , respectively (Robert et al. 2016 ). Refer to the prescribing information for more details. 3.3.3 Rationale for Patient Population and Cohorts Arm A and Arm B of Study CO39722 will enroll patients with advanced BRAFV600 wild-type melanoma without a history of systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Despite the recent adv ances i ntreatment options provided by"
47,page_47,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 47/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5immunotherapies, this patient population continues to have high unmet need. The known effects of MAPK inhibitors, including cobimetinib, on thetumor microenvironment (see Section 1.3.2 )include effects thatmay enable conversion to an immuno responsive phenotype, sensitize refractory tumors to anti PD-1and anti PD-L1 agents ,and suggest that combination therapy with cobimetinib and atezolizumab may be efficacious in this population. This hypothesis is supported by clinical data from Study GP28363 (see Section 1.3.5 ),indicating that combination therapy with cobimetinib and atezolizumab in advanced melanoma results in improved ORR and PFS relative to antiPD-1,antiPD-L1,or MEK inhibitor monotherapy . In order to ensure BRAFV600wild-type status, the inclusion criteria require tha tBRAF status be confirmed using an approved clinical test before randomization . In order to ensure that the primary endpoint of PFS by independent review , and the secondary endpoints of ORR and DOR can be adequately assessed, patients must have measurable disease (per RECIST v1.1) and locally advanced andunresectable or metastatic melanoma . Additional eligibility criteria have been i ncorporated that are pertinent to the safety profile sofcobimetinib and atezolizumab (and antiPD-L1 targeted therapies as a therapeutic class). These have been informed by the known safety profiles of each drug and supplemented by experience in Study GP 28363, which evaluated the combination of atezolizumab and cobimetinib in patients with diverse solid tumors, including advanced melanoma. 3.3.4 Rationale for Control Arm The control arm will receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab administered by IV infusion Q3W. The intent of this study is to evaluate the magnitude of benefit achievable with the combination of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab, relative to current standard of care, in treatment -naive patients with advanced BRAFV600wild-type melanoma. Several therapies are currently available for this indication (refer to Section 1.1). The current guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European Society of Medical Oncology clinical practice guidelines ( Dummer et al. 2015 ; NCCN 2016 ) are the anti PD-1 monotherapies pembrolizumab and nivolumab and the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab. The c hoice of treatment is based on evaluation of the individual patient by the treating physician. The antiPD-1 monotherapies pembrolizumab and nivolumab have demonstrated comparable efficacy in patients with advanced melanoma across multiple clinical trials. Efficacy has been established for survival endpoints, as well as forthe correlated surrogate endpoints of PFS and ORR (median PFS for these agents in adv anced melanoma is 5– 6 months ,with an ORR of approximately 30% [Hodi et al. 2014; Robert"
48,page_48,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 48/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5et al. 20 15a, 2015b ; Weber et al. 2015] and OS of ap proximately 20 24 months [Hodi etal. 2016 ; Robert et al. 2016]). Both pembrolizumab and nivolumab are used for the treatment of BRAFV600wild-type advanced melanoma in clinical practice. Recently, a Phase III trial (KEYNOTE -006; Schachter et al. 2016 ) demonstrated improved PFS and survival rates for pembrolizumab relative to ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. In this trial, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 10mg/kg either Q2 W or Q3W or four cycles of ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg Q3 W. The final OS analysis at 24 months demonstrated survival rates of 55%, 55%, and 43%, respectively (HR for pembrolizum ab Q2 W0.68; 95% CI:0.53, 0.87; p 0.00085; HR for pembrolizumab Q3 W0.68; 95% CI:0.53, 0.86; p 0.00083) ( Schachter et al. 2016 ). Pembrolizumab is preferred over nivolumab for this open -label study because the dosing frequency is reduced relative to that of nivolumab (Q3 W vs. Q2W [Keytruda®and Opdivo® U.S. Package Inserts and EU Summary of Product Characteristics]), which reduces the visit burden for patients enrolled in the control arm. On the basis of anti PD-1 monotherapy being a currently approved, widely used standard of care, which affords the longest established survival benefit of currently available therapies and is recommended by advisory bodies for t reatment of patients with BRAFV600wild-type melanoma, pembrolizumab is considered an appropriate comparator arm for Study CO39722. Pembrolizumab is the preferred treatment option compared with nivolumab because of the reduced dosing frequency. 3.3.5 Rationale for Confirmation of Progressive Disease perRECIST v1.1 In this study, all patients will ha ve confirmatory scans performed 4 8weeks after initial documentation of progression per RECIST v1.1. Studies with immunotherapeutic agents indicate that conventional response criteria may not adequately assess the activity of immunotherapeutic agents because progressive disease (by initial radiographic evaluation) does not necessarily reflect therapeutic failure. Initial increase in tumor sizecaused by IC infiltra tion in the setting of a T- cell response can occur with immunotherapy and has been termed pseudoprogression ( Hales et al. 2010). However, the implications of atypical anti -tumor responses in the setting of immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy are currently unknown. Clinically stable patients who have a favorable benefit risk ratio will continue on study treatment following radiographic progression according to RECIST v1.1. Patients who continue treatment beyond radiographic disease progression will be closely monitored. Treatment will be discontinued if clinical deterio ration because of disease progression atany time or if persistent disease growth is confirmed by follow -up scans performed 48weeks later."
49,page_49,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 49/Protocol CO39722 , Version 53.3.6 Rational efor P harmacokinetic Sample Collection The proposed PK sampling scheme for assessment of cobimetinib and atezolizumab concentration, together with available data from other clinical studies, will be used to investigate any drug interaction between the two molecules by comparing the PK data from this study with single -agent data from previous studies. PK sampl es will not be obtained from patients in the control arm ( pembrolizumab) since it i s an established product. Atezolizumab is primarily eliminated by catabolism to inactive metabolites and therefore has a low potential for drug interactions. Cobimetinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A, and to a lesser extent by UGT2B7, based on in vitro studies. Strong and moderate inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can alter cobimetinib exposure, and no other clinically relevant drug drug interactions have been observed. There is an approximate 7- fold increase in the area under the concentration time curve with potent CYP3A inhibitors (see Section 4.4.2 ). Because of the differences in metabolism, no drug drug interaction is anticipated between cobimetinib and atezolizumab. PK samples of cobimetinib and atezolizumab will be obtained as indi cated in Appendix 2to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of each molecule when administered in combination. 3.3.7 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessme nts 3.3.7.1 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments in Tumor Tissue To characterize the heterogeneity of tumors among patients and its relationship to clinical response, tumor tissue will be collected at screening (archival tissues of sample collection date 5years or pretreatment biopsies ), on Day 15 of Cycle 1 (optional biopsy) , and at disease progression (fresh biopsy to be obtained either at first evidence of progression or confirmation of progress ion,whichever is closest to the last date of study treatment admi nistration). Tumor tissue will be evaluated for tumor immunity contextures, such as CD8 -positive T-cell infiltrate, PD -L1, and MHC expression, and other components of tumor immunity. In addition, DNA and/or RNA will be extracted from these tumor samples t o enable next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA and RNA to identify tumor -specific somatic mutations, immune and stromal signatures, and the clonalities of TCRs to aid the understanding of disease pathobiology. These molecular characterizations of tumors will be analyzed in relation to clinical response to identify patients who will likely benefit more from the treatment. Because these biomarkers may also have prognostic value, their potential association with disease progression will also be explored. Comparison of biomarkers between tissue acquired before treatment and tissue acquired at the time of progression will further elucidate the potential mechanism of acquired resistance to this combination. Detailed mutation and immune profiles from biopsies obtained from patients at disease progression may also provide data for consideration of subsequent therapeutic options."
50,page_50,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 50/Protocol CO39722 , Version 53.3.7.2 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments in Blood An exploratory objective of this study is to evaluate biomarkers in available blood samp les. Factors in blood samples may hold important clues regarding the disease pathobiology of cancer patients. Potential blood biomarkers may include, but are not limited to, mutations in circulating- tumor DNA (ctDNA) such as, NRAS or NF-1mutations, total mutation load, or protein factors such as S100. Analysis of the characteristics of biomarkers from each patient before treatment, during treatment, and at disease progression, along with clinical data collected in this study, may increase the opportunit y for developing new approaches for monitoring disease dynamics or that would be predictive of clinical benefit forthis treatment combination. 3.3.8 Rationale for Open -Label Design Study CO39722 is intended to evaluate the efficacy of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab in patients with BRAFV600wild-type unresectable ,locally advanced ,or metastatic melanoma compared with pembrolizumab, a widely used standard -of-care treatment in this indication. Study CO39722 is designed as an open -label study for the following reasons: Patients receiving cobimetinib are required to undergo safety mon itoring tests for MEK inhibitor associated adverse events, including extensive ophthalmologic tests (requiring a time commitment of approximately 1 hour) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) monitoring by ECHO or MUGA scan. Both of these investig ations will be performed at baseline, after 1 month, and every 3 months thereafter, with additional testing if an abnormality is detected. These assessments are not indicated for patients receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy and would therefore present an excessive and unnecessary burden to patients in the control arm in a blinded study. Several adverse events observed with cobimetinib, including serous retinopathy, elevated CPK ,and decreased LVEF, are recognized class effects of MEK inhibitors. In the P hase III study GO28141, at the time of the primary analysis, for patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm relative to the vemurafenib plus placebo arm, the incidence of these adverse events was as follows: serous retinopathy, 24% versus 2.1%; Grad e3 elevated CPK, 10.6% versus 0.4% ;and Grade 2 LVEF reductions , 8.5% versus 3.7%. Although the majority of these events have been asymptomatic or mild in nature, they are prospectively monitored in cobimetinib trials and will be monitored in this tr ial. Because patients inthe pembrolizumab control arm will not receive a MEK inhibitor, occurrence of these adverse events would likely alert investigators and patients to the treatment assignment of patients receiving cobimetinib and atezolizumab in the experimental arm, compromising blinding in many cases . Study CO39722 has been designed to prevent compromise of study outcomes by the absence of blinding. The primary endpoint is independent review committee (IRC) -assessed PFS, and IRC members will be b linded to patient treatment assignment. IRC-assessed PFS will be supported by a secondary endpoint of investigator -assessed"
51,page_51,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 51/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5PFS. Furthermore, the secondary endpoints of OS , 2-year landmark OS , and IRC-assessed ORR and DOR will provide additional i nformation for patients and physicians that is unaffected by knowledge of treatment assignment. 3.3.9 Rationale for Selection of Primary Endpoint : Progression -Free Survival ,as Assessed by theIndependent Review Committee PFS is established as a clinically rele vant measure of treatment benefit and a correlate of OSin advanced melanoma ,which in recent years has been an approvable endpoint in the setting of metastatic or unresectable melanoma for both targeted and immunotherapies ( European Medicines Agency 2012 ). In a meta -analysis of 4416 metastatic melanoma patients, PFS was found to be a robust surrogate for OS in dacarbazine -controlled randomized trials of metastatic melanoma. Further more, PFS has also been demonstrated to be predictive of landmark OS for pembrolizumab (Robert et al. 2015a ).In addition , owing to the increased number of active treatment options available and under investigation ,resulting in patients receiving more lines of therapy than have previously been available, OS would likely be confounded by the use of effective subsequent -line therapies or by mortality unrelated to ca ncer ( Flaherty et al. 2012 ). Finally, full powering for OS requires large numbers of patients, and for this study, it would result in a significantly longer timeline, such that analysis of clinical benefit would not be available to patients with remaining unmet need and their physicians in a reasonable timeframe. As progression events provide reliable information on the treatment effect observed and generally are not confounded by subsequent lines of therapy, PFS provides a meaningful efficacy endpoint with earlier time to evaluation (DiLeoetal.2003 ). In addition, 2 -year landmark survival may provide a meaningful measure of benefit to patients and physicians. In summary, multiple drugs, including both targeted therapy and immunotherapies, have been approved in metastatic melanoma in recent years on the basis of PFS, and extensive clinical experience validates PFS as a consistent strong correlate of survival across different treatment modalities. 3.3.10 Rationale for Choice of Stratification Factors In Study CO39722, r andomization will be stratified by three factors: PD -L1 status ( IC0 vs. IC 1/2/3), baseline LDH ( less than or equal to the ULN vs. greater than the ULN) , and geographic region (North America vs. Europe vs. Australia, New Zealand, and others) . PD-L1 expression has recently been recognized as a strong favorable prognostic factor in melanoma and is associated with improved outcome for antiPD-1/PD -L1directed therapy ( Carbognin et al. 2015; Hauschild et al. 2016 ; Wang et al. 2016 )."
52,page_52,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 52/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5Baseline LDH level is recognized as a strong prognostic factor in melanoma for long-term OS. Elevated LDH level is associated with poorer outcomes across multiple therapies and is reflective of other factors associated with aggressive disease, such as tumor stage and burden ( Balch et al. 2009; Chapman et al. 2011 ; Hauschild et al. 2012, 2015 , 2016 ;Ascierto 2013 ;Kelderman et al. 2014 ; Long et al.2014 , 2015 ;McArthur etal.2014 ;Diem et al. 2015 ;Robert etal.2015 b). Different regions employ different treatment paradigms based on regulatory approvals and economic considerations. These factors can influence the population of patients enrolled in clinical trials. It is therefore appropriate to include geographic region as a stratification factor. 3.3.11 Rationale for P atient -Reported Outcome Assessme nts Metastatic melanoma is a deadly cancer that impacts patients’ health -related quality of life (HRQoL) ( Cornish et al. 2009 ). Current treatment goals include improving survival, managing disease or treatment -related symptoms (insomnia, pain,and fatigue) , and preserving HRQoL outcomes as feasible (NCCN 2016 ). Studies have shown that patients with advanced melanoma tend to experience a decrease in global health status (GHS) and physical func tioning while undergoing treatment, which can vary by therapy and presence of disease progression (Schadendorf et al. 2015 ; Long et al. 2016 ). Results from the KEYNOTE -002 study (pembrolizumab vs .chemotherapy) indicate that newer treatments such a spembrolizumab are more tolerable than chemotherapy and that by extending PFS , maintenance of patients’ HRQoL is prolonged as well (Schad endorf et al .2015 ). In this study (CO39722), the EORTC QLQ -C30, a generic cancer questionnaire that assesses commonly reported symptoms, functioning, and GHS/HRQoL, will be used to obtain patient -relevant information and therefore address a measurement needed to understand patients’ experience with treatment of melanoma (see Section 4.5.11.1 ). The EQ -5D-5L (see Section 4.5.11.2 ) will be used to derive utility scores for use in economic models. Assessment of the effects of combination treatment with atezolizumab and cobimetinib in relation to disease and treatment burden is important and will allow oncologists to appropriately educate patients on the benefits and risks of treatment with this doub let combination therapy. The measurement hypothesis is whether the combination of atezolizumab with cobimetinib willresult in maintained HRQoL until progression compared with pembrolizumab. 4.

Avoid ance of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and St. John’s wort) as they increase the metabol ism of cobimetinib. Strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided, or selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 ,should be considered. The above lists of medications are not necessarily comprehensive. Thus, the investigator should consult the prescribing information for any concomitant medication when determining whether a certain medication is metabolized by or strongly inhibits or induces CYP3A. In addition, the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor if questions arise regarding any medications not listed above. 4.4.3 Cautionary Therapy for A tezolizumab -Treated Patients 4.4.3.1 Corticosteroids and Tumor Necrosis Factor- Inhibitors Systemic corticosteroids and TNF- inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab. Therefore, in situations in which systemic corticosteroids or TNF -inhibitors would be routinely administered, alternatives, including antihistamines, should be considered. If the alternatives are not feasible, systemic corticosteroids and TNF -inhibitors may be administered at the discretion of the investigator (see Section 4.4.2 ). Systemic corticosteroids are recommended, at the discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse events when associated with atezolizumab therapy (refer to the Appendix 11for details). 4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS The schedule of activities to be performed during the study is provided in Appendix 1. All activities must be performed and documented for each patient. Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study.

69,page_69,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 69/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5Tumor a ssessments must be performed independently of changes to the study treatment administration schedule (i.e., when treatment is withheld). If a tumor assessment has to be performed early or late, subsequent assessments should be conducted according to the o riginal schedule based on the date of first study treatment administration on Day 1 of Cycle 1. The tumorassessment schedule is identical in both arms to avoid potential bias. Tumor assessments will include contrast -enhanced CT or MRI scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Imaging of the neck should be included if clinically indicated. Inthe event a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanner is used for tumor assessments, the CT portion of the PET/CT must meet criteria for diagnostic quality. A CT or MRI scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis. An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan. Patients with untreated or activel y progressing CNS metastases are not eligible for the study (see Section 4.1.2 ). Stable brain metastases (as defined in Section 4.1.2 ) must be evaluated at each tumor assessment using the same radiographic procedure as the baseline study. Patients without brain metastases do not need brain scans for tumor assessment unless clinically warranted. Clinical disease assessments by physical examination should be performed for patients with palpable or superficial lesions. Tumor measurements for each patient should be made by the same investigator or radiologist, if feasible, using the same assessment technique or procedure throughout the study. Tumor response and progression will be evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix 3) and immune -modified RECIST (see Appendix 4). Objective response ( a complete response or partial response) must be confirmed by repeat assessments 4-8weeks after initial documentation. In the case of stable disease, tumor measurements must m eet criteria for stable disease 6 weeks after initiation of study treatment. 4.5.6 Laboratory , Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples 4.5.6.1 Local Laboratory Assessments Study Inclusion A ssessment A sample for the following laboratory test for study inclusion will be sent to the study site's local laboratory for analysis: BRAFV600status If local analysis is not available, the sample is to be sent for central assessment."

Evaluation of LVEF by ECHO or MUGA must be performed at the following timepoints: Screening Day 1 of Cycle 2 (1 week) Day 1 of every three treatment cycles and starting at Cycle 5 andthereafter (2weeks ) The treatment discontinuation visit evaluation of LVEF does not need to be performed at the treatment discontinuation visit if an evaluation has been performed within the last 12 weeks and there are no clinically significant findings and/or changes from ba seline. All patients restarting treatment with a dose reduction of cobimetinib because of a decrease in LVEF should have LVEF measurements taken after approximately 2weeks, 4 weeks, 10 weeks ,and 16 weeks, and then resume monitoring ofLVEF every three t reatment cycles. Any patient who develops clinical signs or symptoms suspicious of cardiac failure should undergo an LVEF assessment. Evaluation of LVEF must be performed using the same method (ECHO or MUGA) for each patient. It is strongly encouraged t hat the same laboratory and operator perform ECHO or MUGA scans for each individual patient. Investigators must be aware of local institution regulations regarding repeat MUGA scans. The repeat administration of radioisotopes is limited in some nuclear m edicine laboratories, and some patients in this study could require monitoring on four or more occasions."

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 75/Protocol CO39722 , Version 54.5.10 Ophthalmologic Examination All patients will require an ophthalmologic examination at screening ,and only patients receiving cobimetinib (Arm A) will require subsequent ophthalmologic examinations. Ophthalmologic examination must be performed at the following timepoints: Screening Day 1 of Cycle 2 ( 1 week ) Day 1 of Cycles 5, 8, and 11 (every three treatment cycles ;2 weeks ) Day 1 of Cycles 15, 19, and 23 (every four treatment cycles; 2 weeks) Day 1 of Cycles 29, 35, 41, 47, etc. (every six treatment cycles ; 2 weeks) Treatment discontinuation visit : The treatment discontinuation visit evaluation does not need to be performed if an evaluation has been performed within the last 12weeks and there are no clinically significant findings and/or changes from baseline. The objective of baseline ophthalmologic examination is to evaluate for evidence of retinal pathology that may be a risk factor for cen tral serous retinopathy or RVO . Ophthalmologic examination must be performed by a qualified ophthalmologist. Risk factors for RVO include uncontrolled serum cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and glaucoma. See Sections 4.1.2.1 and 4.1.2.3.3 for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Baseline and serial surveillance ophthalmologic examination will include visual acuity testing, intraocular pressure measurements by tonometry, slitlamp ophthalmoscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Spectral -domain optical coherence tomography, if not available, may be substituted with time-domain optical coherence tomography. 4.5.11 Patient -Reported Outcomes To more fully characterize disease burden and clinical benefit of atezolizumab and cobimetinib in patients with advanced melanoma, patient -reported outcome (PRO) data will be obtained through use of the following instruments: EORTC QLQ -C30 and the EQ-5D-5L. The questionnaires will be translated as appropriate in tothe local language. Reminders will be provided in order to maximize compliance. It is critical to rigorously collect the PRO data as they support the secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints. The EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ -5D-5L will be completed on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and every 4weeks thereafter, including prior to tumor assessments visits every 8 weeks. In addition, the questionnaires will be completed at the site for the treatment discontinuation visit and at unscheduled visits. All PRO questionnaires must b e completed prior to any study assessment(s) that could bias a patient’s responses."
76,page_76,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 76/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5Also, the PROs will be collected every 4 weeks for 6 months after the treatment discontinuation visit. PRO data collected post -study treatment will be used as a unique opportunity to quantify patients’ post -treatment experience in terms of humanistic outcomes. Patients will use an electronic device to capture all PRO data. Instructions to use the device and to complete the PRO questionnaires will be provided by site staf f once the patient is randomized and before initiation of study treatment. The data will be transmitted to a centralized database maintained by the vendor and will be made available for access by appropriate study personnel at the site. In the event that the device or the W eb-based system isnotreadily available, paper questionn aires formatted for use as back up data collection forms should be used to minimize missing data. Compliance with data collection will be documented throughout the s tudy. 4.5.11.1 EORTC QLQ -C30 The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a validated, reliable self -report edmeasure ( Aaronson et al. 1993 ; Fitzsimmons et al. 1999) that is commonly used in clinical trials involving patients with metastatic melanoma ( Revicki et al. 2012 ; Schadendorf et al. 2015 ). It consists of 30questions that assess five aspects of patient functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), GHS/ QoL, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week. Scale scores can be obtained for the multi -item scales. The EORTC QLQ -C30 module takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. A 10 -point change is defined as a clinically meaningful difference for the EORTC QLQ -C30 ( Osoba et al. 1998 )and has been used i n other melanoma studies ( Long et al. 2016 ; Shadendorf et al. 2015 ). 4.5.11.2 EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D-5Lis a validated ,self-report edhealth status questionnaire that is used to calculate a health status utility score for use in health economic analyses (EuroQol Group 1990; Brooks 1996 ; Herdman et al. 2011 ; Janssen et al. 2013 ). There are two components to the EQ -5D-5L: a five- item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analog scale that measures health state. Published weighting systems allow for creation of a single composite score of apatient’s health status. The EQ -5D-5L takes approximately 3 minutes to complete. It will be utilized in this study for informing pharmac oeconomic evaluations."

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 79/Protocol CO39722, Version 5 Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the study, including assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events. In addition, guidelines for managing adverse events, including criteria for dosage modification, and treatment interruption or discontinuation, are provided below. There are separate guidelines for the two different arms as the toxicities and management guidelines are distinct. Refer to the specific guidelines for each arm individually. The risks associated with cobimetinib, atezolizumab, and pembrolizumab are detailed in Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.4, respectively. Adverse events will be reported as described in Sections 5.25.6. In addition to the oversight provided by the Medical Monitor and drug safety personnel for this trial, an iDMC will monitor and evaluate patient safety throughout the study. 5.1.1 Risks Associated with Cobimetinib The information related to the risks attributed to cobimetinib is based on safety data from Studies GO28141, NO25395, and MEK4592g. A dditional clinical experience has been obtained through postmarketing experience and clinical studies with cobimetinib in combination with other agents. The safety data is also based on postmarketing experience. For further information regarding clinical safety, refer to the current Cobimetinib Investigator’s Brochure. 5.1.1.1 Important Identified Ri sks Associated with Cobimetinib 5.1.1.1.1 Hemorrhage Hemorrhage, including major hemorrhages, defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur with cobimetinib. In clinical studies with cobimetinib, events of cerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, reproductive tract hemorrhage, and hematuria have been reported. In Study GO28141, Grade 1 4 hemorrhagic events were reported in 13.0% of patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib and in 7.3% of patients treated with placebo plus vemurafenib. The majority of hemorrhagic events were Grade 1 or 2 and non-serious. Grade 3 and 4 hemorrhage events were reported in 1.2% of patients receiving cobimetinib plus vemurafenib and in 0.8% of patients receiving placebo plus vemurafenib. Caution should be used in patients with additional risk factors for bleeding, such as brain metastases, and/or in patients that use concomitant medications that increase the risk of bleeding (including antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy). Instructions for dose modification for hemorrhagic events are included in Appendix 10 ."
80,page_80,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 80/Protocol CO39722, Version 5 5.1.1.1.2 Serous Retinopathy Serous retinopathy (fluid accumulation within the layers of the retina) has been observed in patients treated with MEK-inhibitors, including cobimetinib (Flaherty et al. 2012). Manifestations of serous retinopathy include visual disturbances, findings of retinal detachment, and retinopathy. Serous retinopathy events may also be asymptomatic. Serous retinopathy has been characterized in Study GO28141. The study incorporated prospective serial ophthalmologic examinations for all enrolled patients. Serous retinopathy was reported more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafeni b (25.5% vs. 2.8%, respectively), and approximately half the events were asymptomat ic Grade 1 events. Few patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib experienced Grade  3 ocular events (2.8%); the majority of these events were managed with dose modification of both cobimetinib and vemurafenib. To address serous retinopathy with cobimetinib treatment, all patients are required to undergo a baseline ophthalmologic examination to assess for history or evidence of retinal pathology that is considered to be a risk factor for or indicative of neurosensory retinal detachment, central serous chorioretinopathy, neovascular retinopathy, or retinopathy of prematurity. Patients will also undergo ophthalmologic examinations at specified timepoints throughout the study (see Appendix 1 ). Details regarding baseline and subsequent ophthalmologic examinations are provided in Section 4.5.10. Guidelines for management of patients who develop Grade  2 visual disorders or retinopathy are provided in Appendix 10 . 5.1.1.1.3 Left Ventricular Dysfunction Decreases in LVEF from baseline have been reported in patients receiving cobimetinib. Left ventricular dysfunction may occur with signs and symptoms of cardiac failure, or reduction in LVEF events may be asymptomatic. Left ventricular dysfunction has been char acterized in Study GO28141. The study incorporated prospective serial LVEF evaluations in all patients. With active surveillance, measured Grade 2 or 3 reductions in LVEF were observed more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib (8.5% vs. 3.7%, respectively). Of the patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib, 2 patients (0.8%) had symptomatic reduction in LVEF and the remaining patients were asymptomatic. Most LVEF reduction events in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib (62%) improved or resolved with management according to dose modification guidelines (see Appendix 10 ). 5.1.1.1.4 Rhabdomyolysi s and CPK Elevations Elevations in CPK have been observed in patients who received cobimetinib monotherapy as well as when administered with other agents. The majority of CPK"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 81/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5elevations reported were asymptomatic, non -serious, and resolved with or without study drug interruption. One event of rhabdomyolysis was reported in the Phase III study GO28141 (cobimetinib plus vemurafe nib), and rhabdomyolysis has been reported in the postmarketing experience. In Study GO28141, elevated CPK was reported as an adverse event more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib (32.4% all grades, 11.3% Grade 3 events) tha n placebo plus vemuraf enib (8.1% all grades, 0% Grade 3 events). CPK will be monitored at baseline and monthly during treatment or as clinically indicated. Instructions for Dose Modification for elevated CPK and rhabdomyolysis are included in Appendix 10. 5.1.1.1.5 Pneumonitis Events of pneumonitis have been reported in cobimetinib clinical studies. Most reported events were considered to be non-serious and of low severity grade. In Study GO28141, pneumonitis events were reported more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib (1.6% vs. 0.4% ;all grades). There were no reported Grade 3 events in either study arm. Serious events were reported for2 patients (0.8%) treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib. Refer to Appendix 10for pneumonitis management guidelines. 5.1.1.2 Potential Risks A ssociated with Cobimetinib 5.1.1.2.1 Liver Laboratory Abnormalities and Severe Hepatoxicity (Grade 3) Liver laboratory test abnormalities, incl uding increases in ALT, AST, and ALP have been reported as adverse events and serious adverse events in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib. In the Phase III study GO28141, liver laboratory test abnormalities reported as Grade 3 adverse ev ents occurred more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib (20.5% vs. 15.1%, respectively). Generally, elevations in liver laboratory tests were managed effectively with dose modification guidelines. I n both study arms, the majority of Grade ≥ 3 liver laboratory test abnormalities resolved. Refer to Appendix 10for hepatotoxicity management guidelines. 5.1.1.2.2 Impaired Female Fertility and Developmental Toxicity There is a potential for effects on fertility and embryo fetal toxicity based on results from nonclinical studies. Although no dedicated fertility studies have been conducted with cobimetinib in animals, degenerative changes observed in reproductive tissues included increased apoptosis/necrosis of corpora lutea and seminal vesicle, epididymal and vaginal"

These changes were reversible upon discontinuation of cobimetinib administration. 5.1.1.2.3 Teratogenicity and Developmental Toxicity In a dedicated embryo fetal toxicity study, cobimetinib produced fetal toxicity (resorptions and reductions in fetal weigh t)and teratogenicity (malformations of the great vessels and skull) at similar systemic exposures to those observed in patients administered the 60- mg dose. 5.1.1.3 Other Risks with Cobimetinib 5.1.1.3.1 Rash In Study GO28141, combined rash events of all types and grades were reported more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib (71.7% vs. 66.7%, respectively), although Grade 3 events (approximately 16% of patients) and types of rash reported were similar between stu dy arms. Specific events in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib included rash (39% all grades, 5.9% Grade 3, and 1.6% serious adverse events) and maculopapular rash (14.6% all grades, 6.3% Grade 3,and1.2% serious adverse events). Gene rally, Grade 3 rash events were effectively managed with dose modification guidelines. In Study GO28141, approximately 90% of Grade 3 rash events resolved in both arms. Refer to Appendix 10for rash management guidelines. 5.1.1.3.2 Gastrointestinal Toxicity A range of gastrointestinal adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, have been reported in all cobimetinib studies i n adult patients with cancer. In Study GO28141, diarrhea was the most common adverse event reported. Diarrhea events of all severity grades were reported in 59.9% of patients and Grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 6.5% of patients treated with cobimetin ib plus vemurafenib versus 30.9% (Grade 3) and 0.8% (Grade 4) in the patients treated with placebo plus vemurafenib. No Grade 5 events of diarrhea have been reported. Serious adverse events of diarrhea were reported for1.2% of patients treated with cobi metinib plus vemurafenib. Nausea and vomiting have been reported in association with cobimetinib. Most nausea and vomiting events were considered to be non-serious and of lowseverity grade. In Study GO28141, nausea and vomiting events were reported more frequently in the active cobimetinib arm than the control arm (nausea, 41.3% vs. 25.2%; vomiting ,24.3% vs. 12.6%). However, of patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib, few experienced Grade 3 events (nausea ,0.8% ; vomiting ,1.2%). In the Phase I, single -agent study (MEK4592g), all grades of nausea and vomiting were both reported as 33.9% ,with 0.9% reported for Grade 3nausea and none reported for vomiting."
83,page_83,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 83/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5The combination of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting has the potential to contribut e to clinically significant volume depletion/dehydration from the combination of fluid losses with decreased oral intake. In the majority of cases, diarrhea has been effectively managed with anti -diarrheal agents and supportive care. Routine anti -emetic prophylaxis is not recommended. Refer to Appendix 10for gastrointestinal toxicity management guidelines. 5.1.1.3.3 Hypersensitivity There have been few reports of hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis in clinical trials with patients who have been exposed to cobimetinib monotherapy or cobimetinib when used with other agents. These have appeared to be isolated reports, and in some cases, occurred i n patients with histor yof drug allergies. Thus, the relationship of cobimetinib to these events is unclear. In Study GO28141, Grade 3 hypersensitivity events were reported for3patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm compared with no such event s in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm. All events required hospitalization and treatment with steroids. Investigators should promptly evaluate and treat patients who are suspected of experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction. 5.1.2 Risks A ssociated with A tezoli zumab Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as IRRs and immune- related hepatitis, pneumonitis, myocarditis , colitis, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, hypophysitis, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, Guillain -Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis, meningoencephalitis , and nephritis . In addition, systemic immune activation is a potential risk associated when atezolizumab is given in combination with other immunomodulat oryagents. Refer to Section 6 of the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure and Appendix 11of the protocol for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks for atez olizumab. Systemic immune activation is a rare condition characterized by an excessive immune response. Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, systemic immune activation is considered a potential risk when administered in combination with other immunomodulating agents. Systemic immune activation should be included in the differential diagnosis for patients who, in the absence of an alternative etiology, develop a sepsis -like syndrome after administration of atezolizumab, and the initial evaluation should include the following: CBC with peripheral smear PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and D -dimer Ferritin Triglycerides"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 84/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5AST, ALT, and total bilirubin LDH Complete neurologic and abdominal examination (assess for hepatosplenomegaly) If systemic immune activation is still suspected after the initial evaluation, contact the Medical Monitor for additional recommendations. 5.1.3 Anticipated Overlapping A dverse Ev ents for Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab Special consideration is given to areas of potential overlapping toxicity based on data from previous clinical experience with each compound individually or with other molecules. Potential overlapping toxicities of cobimetinib and atezolizumab include dermatologic reactions, ocular toxicity, hepatic toxicity, liver laboratory abnormalities, pneumonitis, and gastrointestinal toxicity. Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure ,Cobimetinib Investigator’s Brochure ,and Appendix 10for details regarding these adverse events. Patients treated with cobimetinib and atezolizumab should be closely monitored for evidence of overlapping and/or potentiation of these and any ot her acute toxicities. If any evidence of overlapping and/or potentiation of the below toxicities is observed, patients should receive maximal supportive care as clinically indicated. Management guidelines for these potential overlapping toxicities are in cluded in Appendix 10. 5.1.4 Risks A ssociated with Pembrolizumab The overall safety profile for pembrolizumab is based on data from more than 2300patients in clinical trials ,including Phase III data for 1500 patients with metastatic melanoma .Some of the most serious adverse drug reactions in patients who received pembrolizumab are immune -mediated pneumonitis, immune -mediated colitis, immune -mediated hepatitis, immune -mediated endocrinopathies, immune -mediated nephritis ,immune -mediated skin reactions, other immune -mediated adverse reactions, infusion- related reactions ( IRRs ), complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and embryo fetal toxicity. The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions ( 20%) in patients who received pembrolizumab are fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, decreased appetite, dyspnea, pruritus, rash, constipation, diarrhea, and nausea. Of note, this is not an exhaustive list of risks associated with pembrolizumab. Please refer to the pembrolizumab prescribing i nformation for complete information regarding clinical s afety."

Certain types of events require immediate reporti ng to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section 5.4. 5.2.1 Adverse Events According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse e vent is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, fr equency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in Section 5.3.5.10 Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study treat ment Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately Reportable to theSponso r) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria: Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death) This does not include any adverse event that ,had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.11)"
87,page_87,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 87/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study treatment Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) The terms ""severe"" and ""serious"" are notsynonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI C TCAE; see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any furth er findings).

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 89/Protocol CO39722 , Version 55.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact. All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). After initiation of study drug , all adverse events, serious adverse events, and adv erse events of special interest will be reported until 135 days after the last dose of study drug, or until a new systemic anti -cancer therapy is initiated , whichever occurs first. Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse even t reporting period are provided in Section 5.6. 5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient evaluation time points.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 91/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5Table 5Causal A ttribut ion Guidance Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, science -based rationales, and clinical judgment? YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by the patient's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge. NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below . Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, orconcomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the stu dy drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after firstdose of study drug). For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each protocol -mandated therapy. 5.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events Investigators should u se correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.1 Infusion -Related Reactions Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and are judged to be related to study drug infusion should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., IRRs )on the Adverse Event eCRF. If possible, avoid ambiguous term s such as ""systemic reaction."" Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion- Related Reaction eCRF. If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion -Related Re action eCRF. 5.3.5.2 Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms For adverse events other than infusion -related reactions (see Section 5.3.5.1), a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/o r symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event"
92,page_92,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 92/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 5.3.5.3 Adverse Events That A reSeco ndary to Other Events In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vo miting should be reported on the eCRF. If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. All adverse events should be recorded s eparately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated. 5.3.5.4 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints. Su ch events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF. The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reported. If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severit y should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated bychanging the event from ""non -serious"" to ""serious,"" providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation time points and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separ ate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.5 Abnormal Laboratory Values Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms"
93,page_93,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 93/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment Note: For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse events. It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., ALP and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., ""elevated potassium,"" as opposed to ""abnormal potassium""). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinica l term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as ""hyperkalemia."" Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnorm ality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for details on recording persis tent adverse events). 5.3.5.6 Abnormal Vital Sign Values Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Result s in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment It is the inv estigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event."
94,page_94,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 94/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5If a clinically significant vital sign abnor mality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.7 Abnormal Liv er Function Tests The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3baseline value) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by Hy's Law). Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with total bilirubin 2ULN (of which 35% is direct bilirubin) Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with clinical jaundice The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.2) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.3.5.8 Deaths For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint. Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed by the investigator solely to progression of melanoma should be recorded on th e Death during Adverse Event Reporting Period Attributed to Progressive Disease eCRF. All other deaths that occur during the adverse event reporting period, regardless of relationship to study treatment, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ). Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the ti me of reporting, ""unexplained death"" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death"" should be replaced by the established cause of death. The term ""sudden death"" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., ""sudden cardiac death"")."
95,page_95,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 95/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6. 5.3.5.9 Preexisting Medical Conditions A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. W hen recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., ""more frequent headaches ""). 5.3.5.10 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Melanoma Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only. In most cases, the expected pattern of progressi on will be based on RECIST v1.1 . In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration. However, every effort should be made to document progression through use of objective criteria. If there is any uncerta inty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event. 5.3.5.11 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization Any adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined below. An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event: Hospitalization for respite care Planned hospitalization required by the protocol (e.g., for study treatment administration or performance of an efficacy measurement for the study) Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria are met: The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected normal progression of the disease The patient has not experienced an adverse event Hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 96/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not considered to be a serious adverse event but should be reported as an adverse event instead: Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours 5.3.5.12 Patient -Reported Outcome Data Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data (i.e., EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ-5D-5L) by the Sponsor, and safety analyses will not be performed using PRO data. Although sites ar e not expected to review the PRO data, it is possible that an investigator could become aware of PRO data that may be indicative of an adverse event. Under these circumstances, the investigator will determine whether the criteria for an adverse event have been met and, if so, will report the event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.4 IMMEDIA TE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM INVESTIGA TOR TO SPON SOR Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial. The investigator must report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event. The following is a list of events that the invest igator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: Serious adverse events (defined in Section 5.2.2 ; see Section 5.4.2 for details on reporting requirements) Adverse events of special interest (defined in Section 5.2.3 ; see Section 5.4.2 for details on reporting requirements) Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for details on reporting requirements) Overdoses, medication errors, drug abuse, or drug misuse (see Section 5.4.4 for details on reporting requirements) The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becom ing aware of the information). New significant information includes the following: New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis Significant new diagnostic test results Change in causality based on new information Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event"

The ""Accidental overdose"" and ""Medication error"" boxes would need to be checked on both eCRF pag es. 5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PA TIENT S AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 5.5.1 Investigator Follow -Up The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow-up, or the patient withdraws consent. Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. During the study period, resolution of ad verse events (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification. All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome."

STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLA N This is a Phase III, r andomized , open- label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cob imetinib plus atezolizumab compared with pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated BRAFV600wild-type melanoma .Please refer to the Statistical Analysis Plan for additional details. 6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE Approximately 450 patients will be randomized into the study. The overall type I error ( ) for this study is 0.05 (two-sided). The type I error ( ) for the analysis of the primary endpoint of IRC-assessed PFS is 0. 01 (two-sided ). The analysis of the primary endpoint of IRC-assessed PFS will take place when approximately 240PFS events have occurred. Statistical considerations are based on the following assumptions: Stratified log -rank test at 0. 01 significance level ( two-sided ) Median PFS of 5.5 months for the pembrolizumab arm Median PFS of 10.0 months for the cobimetinib plus atezolizumab arm Enrollment period of approximately 12 months Annual dropout rate of 5% No interim analysis for PFS A total of 240 PFS events provides approximately 98% power to detect an improvement in median PFS from 5.5 months in the pembrolizumab arm to 10.0 months in the cobimetinib plus atezolizumab arm. This corresponds to a HRof 0.55, with a minimal detectable difference of 0. 72. The PFS analysis will be conducted approximately 17months after FPI. The final analysis of the secondary endpoint of OS will be performed after the occurrenc e of approximately 295deaths. A total of 2 95deaths provides approximately 60% power to detect an improvement in median OS f rom 28months in the pembrolizumab arm to 37.5 months in the cobimetinib plus atezolizumab arm, corresponding to an HR of 0.75, or 80% power to detect a nHR of 0.70. Two interim analyses of OS will be conducted. The final OS analysis will be conducted approximately 68months after FPI."

Study treatment administration will be summarized by treatment arm for all treated patients. 6.3 SUMMA RIES OF TREA TME NT GROUP COMPA RABILITY Demographic variables, stratification factors, and other baseline and disease characteristics will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. 6.4 EFFICA CY ANAL YSES Unless otherwise noted, all efficacy analyses will include all randomized patients (i.e., the intent -to-treat population), and patients will be grouped according to the treatment assigned at ran domization. 6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy analysis will be the comparison of PFS, as determined by theIRC, between the two treatment arms using the stratified log -rank test at an overa ll 0.01 significance level ( two-sided ). PFS is defin ed as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by theIRCaccording to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Data for patients who have not experienced disease progression or death w ill be censored at the last tumor assessment date. Data for patients with no post -baseline tumor assessment will be censored at randomization. The HR for PFS will be estimated using a stratified Cox model, and two -sided 95% CIs for the HR will be provid ed. The stratification factors used for analysis will be the same as the randomization stratification factors: PD -L1 status (IC0 vs. IC1, 2, 3), baseline LDH ( less than or equal to the ULN vs. greater than the ULN) , and geographic region (North America v s. Europe vs. Australia, New Zealand, and others). Results from an unstratified analysis will also be provided. Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to estimate the median PFS for each treatment arm, and Kaplan -Meier curves will be produced. The 95% CI of the median PFS for each treatment arm will be constructed using the Brookmeyer and Crowley method ( Brookmeyer and Crowley 1982 ). Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine the impact of missed scheduled tumor assessments on PFS ,depending on the number of patients with missed assessments. 6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary efficacy endpoints are listed in Section 2(see Table 1 ). OS is defined as the time from randomization to death fro m any cause. For patients who are alive at the time of analysis data cutoff, OS time will be censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive. Survival time for patients with no post -baseline"

The HR for OS will be estimated using a stratified Cox model, and a two- sided 95% CI for the HR will be provided. The stratification factors used for analysis will be the same as the randomization stratification factors. Results from an unstratifie d analysis will also be provided. The Kaplan- Meier approach will be used to estimate median OS and 2- year landmark survival rate. The 95% CI of the median OS will be estimated using the Brookmeyer and Crowley method (Brookmeyer and Crowley 1982). The 95% CI of landmark survival rate will be calculated using the standard error derived from Greenwood’s formula ( Greenwood 1926 ). Objective response will be presented as ORR, defined as the total numbe r of patients whose objective response is a complete response or a partial response, divided by the number of patients in the intent -to-treat population with measurable disease at baseline . Objective response is defined as a complete response or partial response on two consecutive occasions 4weeks apart, as determined by the IRC and investigator using RECIST v1.1. A 95% Clopper -Pearson CI will be calculated for the ORR. The difference in ORR between treatment arms will be tested using the stratified Cochrane - Mantel -Haenszel test. PFS, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, will be analyzed using the same methods as described for PFS in Section 6.4.1 . DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response, a partial response, or stable disease at 16 weeks after the baseline tu mor assessment , as determined by the IRC and investigator using RECIST v1.1. A 95% Clopper -Pearson CI will be calculated for the DCR. For patients who achieve an objective response, DOR is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression, as determined by the IRC and investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. The censoring method for DOR will be the same as that for PFS. The Kaplan -Meier approach will be used to estimate median DOR. The 95% CI of the median DOR will be estimated using the Brookmeyer and Crowley method (Brookmeyer and Crowley 1982 ). Comparisons of DOR between treatment arms will be for descriptive purposes only. The GHS/HRQoL will be scored according to the EORTC scoring manual as listed in Section 6.4.3 . The change from baseline in GHS/HRQoL scores at each timepoint by treatment arm during treatment , as measured by the EORTC QLQ -C30 GHS/HRQoL scale, will be analyzed for all randomized patients who had a baseline and one or more post-baseline assessments."

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 106/Protocol CO39722 , Version 56.4.3 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints The exp loratory efficacy endpoints are listed in Section 2 (see Table 1 ). Objective response, DOR, and PFS according to immune -modified RECIST, will be analyzed using the methods as described above. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and range) and the mean change from baseline of linear -transformed scores will be calculated for all subscales of the E ORTC QLQ -C30 according to the EORTC scoring manual guideline at each assessment timepoint for each arm, including progression, treatment discontinuation, and post -study treatment. The mean (and 95% CI) and median of the absolute scores and the change from baseline will be reported for interval and continuous variables. Completion and compliance rates will be summarized at each timepoint by treatment arm. Compliance with PRO assessments will be calculated as the number of forms received divided by the number expected at every assessment. Only patients with a non- missing baseline assessment and at least one non -missing post-baseline assessment will be included in the analyses. All of the scales and single- item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a fun ctional scale represents a high, healthy level of functioning, a high score for the GHS/QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high level of symptomatology and problems. A longitudinal analysis will be conducted to estimate the effect difference on PRO repeated responses over the time on study treatment and between the treatment arms, and mixed models on a set of covariates (baseline domain score, patient demographic s, and clinical variables) wil l be conducted. The change from baseline at subsequent cycles will be presented by treatment arm and will include LS mean, the difference in LS mean between two treatment arms, and 95% CIs for the differences. The standard error will also be calculated f or each LS mean. Patients’ post -baseline PRO score swill be classified as being “improved,” “stabl e,” or “worsened ”according to a 10-point change inthe GHS/QoL ,functional ,and symptom scores of the EORTC QLQ -C30. The number and propo rtion of patients who improve, remain stable, or worsen from baseline will be summarized by treatment group and study visit, at each timepoint , including progression, treatment discontinuation ,and post-study treatment .

Verbatim description of adverse events will be summarized by mapped terms and appropriate thesaurus levels and graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0. All adverse events that occur during or after the first study drug dose will be summarized by treatment arm and NCI CTCAE grade. In addition, serious adverse events , severe adverse events (Grade 3), adverse events of special interest, and adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation or interruption will be summarized accordingly. Multiple occurrences of the same event will be counted once at the maximum severity. The proportion of patients who experience at least one adverse event will be reported by toxicity term and treatment arm. Study drug exposure, including treatment duration, number of doses, and dose intensity, will be summarized for each treatment arm using descriptive statistic s. All deaths and causes of death will be summarized by treatment arm. Laboratory data with values outside the normal ranges will be identified.

W hen determining the post -baseline incidence, patients are considered to be ADA positive if they are ADA negative or have missing data at baseline but develop an ADA response following study drug exposure (treatment -induced ADA respons e), or if they are ADA positive at baseline and the titer of one or more post -baseline samples is at least 0.60 -titer unit greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment -enhanced ADA response). Patients are considered to be ADA negative if they are ADA negative or have missing data at baseline and all post -baseline samples are negative, or if they are ADA positive at baseline but do not have any post -baseline samples with a titer that is at least 0.60 titer unit greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment unaffected). The relationship between ADA status and safety, efficacy, PK, and biomarker endpoints may be analyzed and reported using descriptive statistics. 6.8 BIOMA RKER ANAL YSES Efficacy will be explored in biomarker subgroups defined by PD -L1 expression, CD8 T-cell density, and other significant biomarkers at the conclusion of this study.

The first OS interim analysis will be performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis when a projected number of 8 0deaths are expected to have occurred. The second OS interim analysis will be performed after the occurrence of approximately 153deaths and is projected to occur at approximately 28months after the first patient is randomized. The final OS analysis will be perform ed after the occurrence of approximately 295 deaths and is projected to occur approximately 68months after the first patient is randomized. The actual number of observed OS events at each interim analysis may differ from the estimates presented. The stopping boundaries are computed using Generalized Haybittle -Peto boundaries with unequal p- values of 0.001, 0.040, and 0.018 at the three OS analyses to control the overall type I error of the OS comparison at a two -sided 0.05 significance level.

The Sponsor will review all protocol deviations and assess whether any represent a serious breach of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and require report ing to health authorities. As per the Sponsor's standard operating procedures, prospective requests to deviate from the protocol, including requests to waive protocol eligibility criteria, are not allowed. 9.3 SITE INSPECTIONS Site visits will be conducted by the Sponsor or an authorized representative for inspection of study data, patients ’ medical records, and eCRFs. The investigator will permit national and local health authorities; Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators; and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study. 9.4 ADMINISTRA TIVE STRUC TURE This study is sponsored by F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd. Approximately 160study centers will participate in t his study globally and enroll a total of approximately 450patients. TheSponsor will provide clinical operations oversight, data management support, and medical monitoring. An IWRS will be used to manage site drug supply and to randomize patients to study drug. For patients not previously tested for tumor mutational sta tus, testing will be performed at screening. Plasma and serum will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis and sample storage. Routine sample analysis will be performed by an accredited external vendor or the center’s local laboratory ; central and local laboratory ranges will be collected. An iDMC will be employed to monitor and evaluate patient safety throughout the study. Tumor response will be evaluated by an IRC as the primary efficacy endpoint in this study . 9.5 PUBLICA TION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADESECRETS Regardless of the outcome of a trial, the Sponsor is dedicated to openly providing information on the trial to healthcare professionals and to the public, both at scientific congresses and in peer -reviewed journals. The Sponsor will comply with all requirements for publication of study results.

116,page_116,"Cobimetinib and Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 116/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5Theresults of this study may be published or presented at scientific congresses. For all clinical trials in patients involving an IMP for which a marketing authorization application has been filed or approved in any country, the Sponsor aims to submit a jou rnal manuscript reporting primary clinical trial results within 6 months after the availability of the respective Clinical Study Report . In addition, for all clinical trials in patients involving an IMP for which a marketing authorization application has been filed or approved in any country, the Sponsor aims to publish results from analyses of additional endpoints and exploratory data that are clinically meaningful and statistically sound. The investigator must agree to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor prior to submission for publication or presentation . This allows the Sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available to the investigator. In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data. In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutu al agreement. Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ’authorship requirements. Any formal publication of the study in which contribution of Sponsor personnel exceeded that of conventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and the appropriate Sponsor personnel. Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from the use of data fr om this study will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property of the Sponsor , except where agreed otherwise. 9.6 PROTOCOL A MENDMENTS Any protocol amendments will be prepared by the Sponsor. Protocol amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC and to regulatory authorities in accordance with local regulatory requirements. Approval must be obtained from the IRB/EC and regulatory authorities (as locally required) before implementation of any changes, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immedi ate hazard to patients or changes that involve logistical or administrative aspects only (e.g., change in Medical Monitor or contact information)."

Assessments sha ded in gray should be performed as scheduled, but the associated data do not need to be recorded on the eCRF (except in the case of an adverse event). aPerform screening tests within 35 day s prior to treatment initiation (Day 1) unless the patient meets criteria specified in Section 4.5.1 . Standard -of-care screening assessments may be performed concurrently with BRAFV600mutation and PD -L1 testing. BRAFV600status must be known prior to performing study -specific screening assessments. The 35 -day window begins at the time of the first standard -of-care screening assessment or the first study -specific screening assessment after the BRAFV600mutation test result is available, whichever is earlier. Results of standard -of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within 35 day s prior to treatment initiation (Da y1) may be used; such tests d o not need to be repeated for screening. For a list of laboratory tests for which results must be obtained within 14days prior to the first dose of study drug, see Section 4.1.1.2 . Test results should be reviewed prior to administration of study drug. PD-L1 will be assessed by central laboratory and the result will be used for stratification and randomization only. bPatients who discontinue study drug will return to the clinic for a treatment discontinuation visit within 30 ( +7) days. The visit at which response assessment shows progressive disease may be used as the study discontinuation visit. cRequired follow -up information will be collected via telephone calls and/or clinic visits every 3 months until death, loss to follow -up, or study termination by the Sponsor. dDay 1 of Cycle 1 can occur up to 3 days after randomization. eVisit not specified by the protocol.

All measurable and non -measurable lesions should be assessed at screening and at subsequent protocol -specified tumor assessment timepoints. Additional assessments may be performe d as clinically indicated for suspicion of progression. DEFINITION OF MEA SUR ABLE LESIONS Tumor Lesions Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows: 10 mm by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval 5 mm) 10-mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be reco rded as non- measurable) 20 mm by chest X -ray Malignant Ly mph Nodes To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be 5 mm). At baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. Additional information on lymph node measurement is provided below (see ""Identification of Target and Non -Target Lesions"" and ""Calculation of Sum of Diameters""). 1For clarity and for consistency within this document, the section numbers and cross -references to other sections within the article have been deleted and minor changes have been made."

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 137/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5DEFINITION OF NON -MEASURA BLE LESIONS Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with short axis 10 mm but 15 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measurable include leptom eningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal mass/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by rep roducible imaging techniques. SPECIA L CONSIDERA TIONS REG ARDING LESION MEA SURA BILITY Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular comment, as outlined below. Bone Lesions: Technetium -99m bone scans, sodium fluoride positron emission tomography scans, and plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques for measuring bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as CTor MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable. Cystic Lesions: Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by defin ition, simple cysts. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferr ed for selection as target lesions. Lesions with Prior Local Treatment: Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to other loco -regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion."
138,page_138,"Appendix 3 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1(cont.) Cobimetinib and A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 138/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5METHODS FOR A SSESSIN G LESIONS All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never mor e than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study. Imaging -based evaluation should always be the p referred option. CLINICA L LESIONS Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 10mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is suggested. CHEST X -RAY Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. CT AND MRI SCA NS CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. In t his guideline, the definition of measurability of lesions on CT scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm. When CT scans have slice thickness of 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable. If prior to enrollment it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT scans with intravenous (IV) contrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a non- contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) wi ll be used to ev aluate the patient at baseline and during the study should be guided by the tumor type under investigation and the anatomic location of the disease. For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non- contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed should also be based on the tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease, and should be optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possi ble. Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward. Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions and interpretation of"
139,page_139,"Appendix 3 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1(cont.) Cobimetinib and A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 139/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5non-target disease or new lesions on a different modality, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size using a new modality. ENDOSCOPY, LA PAROSCO PY, ULTRA SOUND, TUMO R MA RKERS, CYTOLOGY, HISTOLOGY Endoscopy, laparos copy, ultrasound, tumor markers, cytology, and histology cannot be utilized for objective tumor evaluation . ASSESSMENT OF TUMOR BURDEN To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. IDENTIFICA TION OF TA RGET AND NON- TARGET LESIONS When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. This means that, for instances in which patients have only one or two organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two sites), respectively, will be recorded. Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those o rgans will be considered non- target lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should lend themselves to reproducible repeated me asurements . It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be selected. Lymph nodes merit special mention si nce they are normal anatomical structures that may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. As noted above, pathological nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor. Lymph node size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT, this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded"
140,page_140,"Appendix 3 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1(cont.) Cobimetinib and A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 140/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10mm but 15mm) should be considered non -target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis of 10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed. All lesions (or sites of disease) not selected as target lesions (measurable or non-measurable), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required. It is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the Case R eport Form (CRF) (e.g., ""multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes"" or ""multiple liver metastases""). CALCULA TION OF SUM O F DIA METERS A sum of the diameters (longest diameter for non lymph node lesions, short axis for lymph node lesions) will be calculated for all target lesions at baseline and at each subsequent tumor assessment as a measure of tumor burden. Measuring Ly mph Nodes Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomic al plane as the baseline examination), even if the node regresses to 10 mm during the study. Thus, when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of diameters may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph nod e is defined as having a short axis of 10 mm. Measuring Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure During the study, all target lesions (lymph node and non lymph node) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measurement and may report them as being too small to measure. W hen this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF, as follows: If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned and ""too small to measure"" should be ticked. (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be"
141,page_141,"Appendix 3 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1(cont.) Cobimetinib and A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 141/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5assigned in this circumstance as well and ""too small to measure"" should also be ticked). To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is 5 mm, and in that case ""too small to measure"" should not be ticked. Measuring Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment When non lymph node lesions fragment, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the sum of diameters. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximum lo ngest diameter for the coalesced lesion. EVALUATION OF NON -TARGET LESIONS Measurements are not required for non -target lesions, except that malignant lymph node non-target lesions should be monitored for reduction to 10 mm in short axis. Non-target lesi ons should be noted at baseline and should be identified as ""present"" or ""absent"" and (in rare cases) may be noted as ""indicative of progression"" at subsequent evaluations. In addition, if a lymph node lesion shrinks to a non -malignant size (short axis10 mm), this should be captured on the eCRF as part of the assessment of non-target lesions. RESPONSE CRITERIA CRITERIA FOR TA RGET LESIONS Definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response for target lesions are provided below: Complet e response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to 10 mm. Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (including baseline) In addition to the relative increase of 2 0%, the sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of 5 mm. Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR or PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD"

A modest increase in the size of one or more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progr ession status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non -target lesions in the face of SD or PR in target lesions will therefore be extremely rare. NEW LESIONS The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progr ession; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for theidentification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differe nces in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ""new"" bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting lesions). This is particularly important when the patie nt’s baseline lesions show PR or CR. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ""new"" cystic lesion, which it is not."

All measurable and non -measurable lesions should be assessed at screening and at subsequent protocol -specified tumor assessment timepoints. Additional assessments may be performed as clinically indicated for suspicion of pr ogression. DEFINITION OF MEA SUR ABLE LESIONS Tumor Lesions Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows: 10 mm by computed tomography ( CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval 5 mm) 10-mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable) 20 mm by chest X -ray Malignant Ly mph Nodes To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be 5 mm). At baseline and follow -up, only the short axis wi ll be measured and followed. Additional information on lymph node measurement is provided below (see ""Identification of Target and Non -Target Lesions,"" ""New Lesions,"" and ""Calculation of Sum of Diameters""). DEFINITION OF NON -MEASURA BLE LESIONS Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with short axis 10 mm but 15 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measurable include leptomeningeal disease , ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal mass/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by reproducible imagin g techniques.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 147/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5Bone Lesions: Technetium -99m bone scans, sodium fluoride posi tron emission tomography scans, and plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques for measuring bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as CTor MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable. Cystic Lesions: Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cyst s. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection a s target lesions. Lesions with Prior Local Treatment: Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to other loco -regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. METHODS FOR A SSESSIN G LESIONS All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study. Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option. CLINICA L LESIONS Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 10mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to e stimate the size of the lesion, is suggested."

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 148/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5CHEST X -RAY Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions on c hest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. CT AND MRI SCA NS CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. In this guideline, the definition of measurability of lesions on CTscan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm. When CT scans have slice thickness of 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable. If prior to enrollment it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT scans with intravenous (IV) contrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a non- contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the patient at baseline and during the study should be guided by the tumor type under investigation and the anatomic location of the disease. For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non- contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed should also be based on the tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease, and should be optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possible. Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, th e patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward. Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions and interpretation of non-target disease or new lesions on a different modality, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size using a new modality. ENDOSCOPY, LA PAROSCO PY, ULTRA SOUND, TUMO R MA RKERS, CYTOLOGY, HISTOLOGY Endoscopy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, tumor markers, cytology, and histology cannot be utilized for objective tumor evaluation. ASSESSMENT OF TUMOR BURDEN To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements."
149,page_149,"Appendix 4 Immune- Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (Immune- Modified RECIST) (cont.) Cobimetinib and A tezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 149/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5IDENTIFICA TION OF TA RGET AND NON- TARGET LESIONS When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. This means that, for instances in which patients have only one or two organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two sites), respectively, will be recorded. Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those organs will be considered non- target l esions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements . It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be selected. Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical struct ures that may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. As noted above, pathological nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axi s of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor. Lymph node size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT, this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm30mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10 mm but 15mm) should be considered non- target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis of 10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed. All lesions (or sites of disease) not selected as target lesions (measurable or non-measurable), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required. It is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g., ""multiple enl arged pelvic lymph nodes"" or ""multiple liver metastases"")."

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 150/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5NEW LESIONS New lesions identified after baseline will be evaluated for measurability with use of the same criteria applied to prospective target lesions at baseline per RECIST (e.g., non lymph node lesions must be 10 mm on the longest diameter; new lymph nodes must be 15 mm on the short axis [see note below]). All new lesions (measurable or non-measurable) must be assessed and recorded at the time of identification and at all subsequent tu mor assessment timepoints. Up to a maximum of five measurable new lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) can be included in the calculation of tumor burden that is performed as part of the tumor response evaluation. New lesion types that would not qualify as target lesions per RECIST cannot be included in the calculation of tumor burden and thus will not affect overall tumor response evaluation. New lesions that are not measurable at first appearance but meet measurability criteria at a s ubsequent timepoint can be included in the tumor response evaluation from that point on, if the maximum number of measurable new lesions has not been reached. Note regarding new lymph node lesions : If at first appearance the short axis of a lymph node les ion is 15 mm, it will be considered a measurable new lesion. If at first appearance the short axis of a lymph node lesion is 10 mm and 15 mm, the lymph node will not be considered measurable but will still be considered a new lesion and should be identified as a non- measurable new lesion. If at first appearance the short axis of a lymph node is 10 mm, the lymph node should not be considered pathological and should not be considered a new lesion. A lymph node can subsequently become measurable, wh en the short axis is 15 mm. CALCULA TION OF SUM O F DIA METERS A sum of the diameters (longest diameter for non lymph node lesions, short axis for lymph node lesions) will be calculated for all target lesions at baseline as a measure of tumor burden. At ea ch subsequent tumor assessment, a sum of the diameters (longest diameter for non -lymph node lesions, short axis for lymph node lesions) will be calculated for all target lesions plus measurable new lesions (up to five new lesions, with a maximum of two new lesions per organ) that have emerged after baseline. Hence, each net percentage change in tumor burden per assessment accounts for the size and growth kinetics of both old lesions and new lesions as they appear. Measuring Ly mph Nodes If at first appearan ce the short axis of a new lymph node lesion is 15 mm, it will be considered a measurable new lesion and may be included in the sum of the diameters.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 151/Protocol CO39722 , Version 5measured and i ncluded in the sum of diameters at subsequent timepoints, even if the short axis decreases to 15mm (or even 10mm). However, if it subsequently decreases to 10 mm and all other lesions are no longer detectable or have also decreased to a short axis of 10mm (if lymph nodes), a response assessment of complete response may be assigned. Lymph nodes should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the node regresses to 10 mm during the study. Thus, when lymph nodes are included in the sum of diameters, the sum may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of 10mm. Measuring Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure During the study, all target lesions and up to five measurable new lesions (lymph node and non lymph node) should have their actual mea surements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measurement and may report them as being too small to measure. W hen this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF, as follows: If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is beli eved to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned and ""too small to measure"" should be ticked. (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well and ""too small to measure"" should also be ticked). To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is 5 mm, and in that case ""too small to measure"" should not be ticked. Measuring Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment When non lymph node lesions fragment, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the sum of diameters. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them m ay be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly"

Non-target lesions should be noted at baseline, and non -measurable new lesions should be noted at the time of identification. At subsequent evaluations, non -target lesions and non-measurable new lesions will be categorized as ""present"" or ""absent."" After baseline, changes in non -target lesions or non -measurable new lesio ns (or measurable new lesions in excess of five total or two per organ) will contribute only in the assessment of complete response (i.e., a complete response is attained only with the complete disappearance of all tumor lesions, including non -target lesions and non - measurable new lesions) and will not be used to assess progressive disease.

New lesions alone do not qualify as progressive disease.

Additional tests, such as autoimmune serology or b iopsies, should be used to evaluate for a possible immunogenic etiology. Although most immune -related adverse events observed with immunomodulatory agents have been mild and self -limiting, such events should be recognized early and treated promptly to avoi d potential major complications. Discontinuation of atezolizumab may not have an immediate therapeutic effect, and in severe cases, immune -related toxicities may require acute management with topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, or other imm unosuppressive agents. The investigator should consider the benefit risk balance a given patient may be experiencing prior to further administration of atezolizumab. In patients who have met the criteria for permanent discontinuation, resumption of atezo lizumab may be considered if the patient is deriving benefit and has fully recovered from the immune -related event.

Immune -related meningoencephalitis should be suspected in any patient presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or encephalitis, including, but not limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, motor or sensory dysfunction, and altered or depressed level of consciousness. Encephalopathy from metabolic or electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from potential meningoencephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or progression of malignancy, or secondary to a paraneoplastic process. All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with a CT scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation, or edema. If deemed safe by the treating physician, a lumbar puncture should be performed and a neurologist should be consulted. Patients with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 11.
