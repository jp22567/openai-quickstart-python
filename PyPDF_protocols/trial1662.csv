Procedures: See Schedule of Events for full details of protocol required procedures and applicable visits (and timings). Subjects who have provided signed and dated informed consent will be scre ened for entry into this study. Baseline proteinuria level is determined by a mean of 2 f irst morning void urine samples taken during the screening period . If a subject has not had a kidney biopsy within the required timeframe for study eligibility , one may be performed to assess eligibility into the study , provided consent is in place and provided the results are received before randomization. Subjects meeting the required eligibility criteria will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either Orelvo (23.7 mg BID) or matching placebo starting on Day 1. All subjects will receive initial treatment with 0.5 to 1.0 g IV methylprednisolone . In consultation with the Medical Monitor, and if it is in the subject’s best interest, IV methylprednisolone may be started during the screening period . Subjects receiving IV methylprednisolone in the 3 months prior to screening must be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to initiating further IV methylprednisolone . For subjects who are not already taking prescribed MMF prior to randomization, the dosing of MMF will start at 500 mg BID for a total daily dose of 1 g/day for the first week, increasing to 1 g BID for a total daily dose of 2 g/day for the second and subsequent weeks (i.e., beginning on Day 8). All subjects will complete dosing through 52 weeks of study treatment. Subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment before the Week 52 visit will return for all remaining study visits and assessments unless they have withdrawn consent . All subjects who complete participation and study treatment through 52 weeks and provide consent will have the opportunity to enroll into a continuation study for which the details are not yet finalized. Sample Size: A 2 group continuity corrected Chi square test with a 0.05 two -sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference between a placebo response rate of 20.0% and a n Orelvo response rate of 34.4% (odds ratio=2.1) when the sample size in each group is 162 (total N=324) . While the effect of withdrawals will be investigated, subjects withdrawing for a ny reason will be counted as non -responders in the primary analysis and therefore no adjustment of sample size for withdrawals is necessary."

Populations : The efficacy analysis will be based on t he intent -to-treat (ITT) principl es and will consist of all randomized subjects. The per -protocol set will be a subset of subjects in the ITT population who do not have any major protocol violations (to be defined prior to unblinding). The safety analysis set will consist of all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment . Methods : The primary analysis of the primary endpoint, renal response at W eek 52, will be conducted on the ITT population . The relative renal response for Orelvo compared to placebo will be determined using logistic regression. The logistic regression model will include terms for treatment , baseline UPCR , biopsy class , and MMF use at baselin e. Results of this logistic regression will be displayed as odds ratios and a 2-sided confidence interval (CI) (Orelvo compared to placebo). The proportion of subject s exhibiting renal response at W eeks 24 and 52 will be summarized by treatment group . The analyses of the secondary endpoints are described below: Other binary endpoints will b e analyzed in a similar manner to the primary endpoint. Endpoints measured as a time -to-event will be displayed using Kaplan -Meier methodology. Orelvo will be compared to placebo using a C ox proportional hazard model . The model will include terms for treatment and appropriate baseline assessments . Median time -to-event along with 2- sided CIs will be displayed. Other endpoints will be summarized by visit and differences between baseline an d on-treatment values at weeks up to and including W eek 52 will be ana lyzed using Mixed Effect Model Repeated Measures (MMRM). The MMRM model will include terms for treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction and baseline. Results will be expressed as differences between treatment arms (along with associated 95% CI). Safety Endpoints : Adverse events will be aggregated by S ystem Organ Class and preferred term and presented as summary tables. Laboratory values (based on results from t he central laboratory), vital signs and other safety parameters will be summarized by visit as absolute values and change from baseline. Laboratory values outside of defined normal ranges will be summarized. The impact of withdrawals on primary endpoint wi ll be investigated with a tipping point analysis ."

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 1.1 Background of the Disease and Treatment Options – Lupus Nephritis Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common serious manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Lupus nephritis is divided into different classes according to the level of treatment required, using a classification system for renal biopsy pathology originally developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) . The classification of LN has evolved and the “International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society 2003 Classification of Lupus Nephritis” is now widely used and has a higher level of inter -observer reproducibility than the original classification (see Appendix 3) . For subjects with Class III, IV (proliferative), or V (membranous), or combinations of these forms of LN, the standard of care is treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy. Lupus nephritis manifests as diverse patterns of immune complex -mediated renal disease affecting glomerular, tubulointerstitial, and vascular compartments. It can lead to permanent and irreversible tissue damage within the kidney, resulting in end- stage renal disease (ESRD), and thus making LN a serious and potentially life -threatening condition. In subjects with LN, renal damage results in protein uria and/or hematuria and a decrease in renal function as evidenced by reduced creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and increased serum creatinine levels. In LN as in other serious renal diseases, the main clinical outcome s are progression to ESRD (i.e., the need for long -term dialysis or transplantation) and death. The current standard of care for LN, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, has improved the prognosis of the disease considerably. Incidence rates of ESRD in L N, however, appear to have been stable over recent years, possibly reflecting the limits of effectiveness of current treatments or lack of adherence to treatments by subjects . The most recent studies have reported 10- year survival rates of over 90% and, although the overall risk of developing ESRD in subjects with LN is approximately 15%, the 5- year risk of developing ESRD has been found to be as low as 5% [ 1]. Recently, 10-year follow -up data of LN subjects treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) for active disease followed by maintenance treatment with azathioprine (AZA) found rates of ESRD to be approximately 7% [ 2]. 1.1.1 Limitations of Current Treatment The current treatment paradigm for LN includes 2 goals, based on the severity of disease. The first goal of treatment in subjects with active LN is intended to bring the disease under control as quickly as possible to limit the potential for extensive renal scarring or loss of life. This phase of treatment is particularly critical for those subjects at highest risk for ESRD (i.e., subjects w ith clinical or laboratory indicators of active nephritis, such as biopsy evidence of"
25,page_25,"AURORA 1 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -01), Version 2.0 (Amendment 1) Confidential 04 May 2017 Page 26 of 114 proliferative nephritis, active urinary sediment, elevated serum creatinine, and/or proteinuria). In subjects with severe LN, the achievement of complete or partial remis sion, as demonstrated by stabilization or improvement in renal function, improvement in proteinuria, and normalization of active urinary sediment, has been shown to be associated with better patient and renal survival. Treatment of active LN (i.e., inducti on treatment) typically consists of high doses of both corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. The second goal of treatment, after the patient successfully responds to treatment, is to maintain remission by preventing renal flares and any resulting deterio ration in renal function. In this second phase of treatment, lower doses of both corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are used. Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of treatment in SLE, and have been the standard since the 1950s to treat both renal and non- renal manifestations. Intravenous (IV) steroid pulse therapy is widely used to rapidly treat relapsing LN, but does not provide long- term management. Oral corticosteroids taken for prolonged periods and at high doses are often needed, but have potentiall y severe, and at times irreversible adverse effects including risk of infection, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, diabetes, and accelerated atherosclerosis. Induction treatment recommendations advocate the use of immunosuppressants in conjunction with high -dose oral corticosteroids, to enable a rapid taper to a lower maintenance dose of steroids. Steroid- sparing therapies are needed in order to treat disease activity and also minimize cumulative and high -dose steroid exposure. Intravenous cyclophosphamide , while classically considered the standard of care for induction therapy, is still associated with significant potentially life -threatening toxicities, such as the increased risk of severe infections including sepsis, malignancy, and major morbidity, such as permanent gonadal failure. Recent studies have shown that induction treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has similar efficacy to that of IVC. The authors of a recent meta -analysis concluded that MMF is as efficacious as IVC and is not as sociated with the risk of infertility, which is a significant toxicity of IVC in this patient population [ 3]. In the Aspreva Lupus Management Study (ALMS), a comparison of MMF and IVC in the treatment of active LN, 50.4% subjects with active LN entering the study had nephrotic -range proteinuria (>3 g/day) [ 4]. Intravenous cyclophosphamide and MMF reduced proteinuria to a similar extent. However, even after 24 weeks of therapy with either MMF or IVC in the setting of a clinical study , subjects had substantial residual proteinuria. At the end of 24 weeks of therapy, normal (<500 mg/24 hours) protein excretion levels were observed in only 27% of subjects who received IVC and 23.8% of subjects who received MMF [5]. The findings from ALMS indicate that there exists a substantial unmet medical need for more effective treatments for active LN with heavy proteinuria."
26,page_26,"AURORA 1 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -01), Version 2.0 (Amendment 1) Confidential 04 May 2017 Page 27 of 114 The importance of proteinuria and reduction of proteinuria as prognostic factors f or renal flares, ESRD and death in subjects with LN is well documented. Proteinuria in itself is related to progression of renal disease through effects on the glomerulus and tubulointerstitium [6]. In observational studies, proteinuria has been shown to be a predictor of adverse renal outcomes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in subjects with non- diabetic proteinuric nephropathies [ 7]. 1.2 Rationale for the Use of Calcineurin Inhibitors in Lupus Nephritis 1.2.1 Mechanism of Action Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are a class of immunosuppress ants which reversibly inhibit immunocompetent lymphocytes, particularly T -lymphocytes in the G 0 and G 1 phase of the cell-cycle, and also reversibly inhibit the production and release of lymphokines. Voclosporin, a CNI, mediates its suppressive effects by bindi ng to an ubiquitous intracellular protein cyclophilin. This complex, in turn, inhibits the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase activity of the enzyme calcineurin. Calcineurin inhibition then prevents the activation of various transcription factors necessary for the induction of cytokine genes during T -cell activation, such as interleukin -2, interleukin- 4, tumor necrosis factor -α, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, and interferon- γ. 1.2.2 Use of Immunosuppression in Lupus Nephritis Calcineurin inhibitors are standard treatment to prevent acute rejection in subjects who have received transplants. Since the development of cyclosporine in the early 1980s, standard immunosuppression regimens to prevent rejection post -transplant ation have included steroids and a CNI; more recently other immunosuppressants, such as MMF, have been added to standard therapy. The rationale for use of CNIs in autoimmune diseases include potent effects on T-cell activation and immunomodulatory effects. AT- cell mediated immune response is an important feature of the pathogenesis of many of these diseases, including LN. Calcineurin inhibitors also have specific anti -proteinuric effects. The podocyte is a key cell in the glomerular capillary wall that maintains the integrity of the filtration barrier and prevents the development of proteinuria in healthy individuals, while being the primary target of injury in proteinuric kidney disease. Podocyte injury is an important factor in the progression of LN. It typically occurs due to immune complex deposition but may also occur in the absence of this histologic feature [ 8]. Podocyte function depends on a complex and unique structure that, in turn, depends on a tightly regulated actin cytoskeleton. Synaptopodin acts as a key stabilizer of the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes. When synaptopodin is phosphorylated, it binds to another protein, 14-3- 3, and is thus protected from degradation. Calcineurin dephosphorylates synaptopodin allowing its degradation, thus promoting proteinuria by destabilization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Expression of activated calcineurin in podocytes leads to proteinuria. By inhibiting activated calcineurin, tacrolimus thus exerts a specific"
27,page_27,"AURORA 1 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -01), Version 2.0 (Amendment 1) Confidential 04 May 2017 Page 28 of 114 anti-proteinuric effect by preventing the degradation of the podocyte -stabilizing protein synaptopodin. Taken together, these data suggest that the anti -proteinuric effects of CNIs may be explained by their direct effect on the podocyte actin cytoskeleton as well as immunomodulatory effects on T-lymphocytes [ 9]. 1.2.3 Clinical Studies of Calcineurin Inhibitors in Lupus Nephritis Bao et al, 2008 [ 10] performed an open- label study in 40 subjects with Class V+IV LN. Subjects were randomized to either IVC and prednisolone or “multi -target therapy” with MMF plus tacrolimus (4 mg/day) and prednisolone. In the multi -target group, 50% achieved complete remission compared with 5% in the standard IVC group at 6 months. Estimated glomerular filtratio n rate normalized in both groups, but there was a significantly larger reduction in proteinuria in the multi-target therapy group. Miyasaka et al, 2009 [ 11] evaluated the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in 63 subjects receiving glucocorticoid therapy for LN in a double- blind, placebo -controlled, randomized trial. Subjects with persistent nephritis requiring 10 mg/day prednisone were randomized to receive 28 weeks of treatment with tacrolimus (3 mg/day) or placebo. There was a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, the Lupus Nephritis Disease Activity Index, in the tacrolimus group compared to the placebo group. Daily urinary protein excretion (the percentage of subjects with urine protein <0.3 g/day at the final evaluation) also showed a significant decrease in the tacrolimus group. However, measures of glucose intolerance were more frequent in tacrolimus -treated subjects. The authors conclude d that tacrolimus should be considered one of the options to treat LN. On the basis of the results of this study , tacrolimus was approved for the treatment of LN in Japan. In an observational study conducted by Cortes -Hernandez et al, 2010 [ 12], 70 subjects who had received MMF as continuous therapy were followed over a 5- year period. Tacrolimus was added as rescue therapy in 17 subjects who were treatment failures or had renal flares on treatment with MMF. The authors reported a significant reduction in proteinuria at 3 months, and after 2 years of follow -up, it was concluded that tacrolimus was a safe and effective treatment for MMF non-responsive c ases. Several smaller pilot studies and case series in subjects with LN, including subjects with membranous nephropathy, have suggested a treatment benefit of tacrolimus with or without MMF [ 13-19]. The available data suggest a plausible mechanism of action by which CNIs may provide treatment benefits in LN. The clinical evidence is suggestive of improvement in measures of response in active LN and improvement in extrarenal manifestations of SLE and immunologic parameters."

Voclosporin is structurally similar to cyclosporine A ( CsA) except for a novel modification of a functional group on the amino acid 1 residue of the molecule. This alteration has changed the binding of voclosporin to calcineurin leading to a 3 - to 5- fold increase in potency when compared to CsA. This modification has also shifted metabolism away from amino acid 1, the major site of metabolism for CsA, thus altering the metabolic profile. This in turn has led to faster elimination of metabolites resulting in lower measured metabolite exposure as compared to CsA. The combination of increased potency and decreased measured metabolite exposure, for voclosporin as compared to CsA, has led to better pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic predictability. During the development of this investigational product the legacy names of voclosporin, VCS, are referenced in discussions related to historical usage. However, f or the LN Phase 3 clinical development program, the name of the investigational product will be referred to as Orelvo, the proposed trade name. These legacy names should all be considered interchangeable unless specifically identified as different. Prior t o the LN clinical development program, approximately 2,200 subjects received investigational products containing voclosporin in 14 Phase 1 and 10 Phase 2/3 clinical studie s in the indications of transplant rejection, psoriasis and non- infectious uveitis . Detailed data for these clinical studie s are presented in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . 1.2.4.1 Pharmacokinetic Considerations Voclosporin approximates linear multiexponential PKs. Exposure to voclosporin was dose- related with maximum concentrations occurring ≤2 hours with a terminal elimination half-life ( t1/2) of ≥30 hours. Drug accumulation was minor with accumulation factors of approximately 2 hours after twice daily (BID) dosing. Administration of voclosporin oral solution with either low - or high- fat meals decreased both the rate and extent of absorption which appeared to be related to the fat content of the meal. It is therefore recommended that Orelvo (voclosporin) be administered on an empty stomach to ensur e adequate absorption. Voclosporin has been shown to be a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). Concomitant administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, led to a 6 -fold increase in maximum concentration ( Cmax) and an 18- fold increa se in area under the curve between 0 and 12 hours ( AUC 0-12) for voclosporin. Concomitant administration of rifampin, an inducer of CYP3A4/5, resulted in a decrease in exposure to voclosporin. Maximum concentration decreased approximately 70%, the area under the concentration curve decreased approximately 90%, and t 1/2 decreased 85%. Consequently, both ketoconazole and rifampin are contraindicated with Orelvo (voclosporin). Concomitant administration of voclosporin and"
29,page_29,"AURORA 1 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -01), Version 2.0 (Amendment 1) Confidential 04 May 2017 Page 30 of 114 midazolam, a model substrate of CYP3A4/5 and potential inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, did not result in statistically significant changes in the rate or extent of exposure to midazolam or α-hydroxy- midazolam. Voclosporin is both a substrate for and an inhibitor of P -glycoprotein ( P-gp). Concomitant administration of verapamil, a known inhibitor of P- gp, demonstrated an approximate 3-fold increase in C max and AUC 0-12 of voclosporin. Concomitant administration of digoxin, a P- gp substrate, resulted in statistically significant increases in digoxin C max and area under the curve between 0 and 24 hours ( AUC 0-24) and a decrease in clearance. Therefore concomitant administration of P- gp substrates with voclosporin would be expected to result in increased exposure to the substrate. Clinicians are advised to consider the benefit/risk of concomitant P-gp substrate drugs carefully. 1.2.4.2 Lupus Nephritis Clinical Development The AURA- LV study (Protocol AUR -VCS -2012-01) is a randomized, controlled, double- blind Phase 2 study comparing the efficacy and safety of voclosporin (23.7 mg BID or 39.5 mg BID) with placebo in achieving remission in patients with active LN. The duration of the study is 48 weeks and is ongoing. All patients received background therapy with MMF and corticosteroid taper. The primary endpoint of complete remission was defined as: urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) of ≤0.5 mg/mg at 24 weeks (using first morning void) and eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or no confirmed decrease from baseline in eGFR of ≥20%. In addition, patients could not receive rescue medicat ions for LN (defined as >10 mg prednisone/day for >3 consecutive days or >7 days total from Weeks 16-24) to be considered for complete remission. A tot al of 265 subjects were randomized into the AURA -LV study. The 24- week primary endpoint assessment for t he AURA- LV clinical study demonstrated that the groups were generally well balanced for age, gender and race, with a trend to higher proteinuria and lower eGFR data in the low-dose voclosporin arm. The low dose achieved a statistically significant benefit over placebo for the primary efficacy assessment of complete remission at 24 weeks (odds r atio (OR) [95% CI] = 2.03, [1.01, 4.05], p=0.045), without a statistically significant improvement seen in the high dose. The results were confirmed by 24 hour urine collections (p=0.047). Both the low- and high -dose voclosporin were statistically superior to placebo in partial remission, time to complete remission , and time to partial remission. A mean reduction in serum creatinine was seen in both arms (0.2 mg/dL low , 0.1 high ; p<0.001). In the voclosporin groups, eGFR fell by a median of 8 -9 mL /min by W eek 4 and then stabilized over the course of the study. Blood pressure did not vary by group. The correlation of 24 -hour urine protein and using the first morning void was assessed from the results of the AURA -LV study demonstrating a high degree of correlation (Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.92)."

More serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in the voclosporin groups (25.8% low -dose , 25.0% high-dose , 15.8% placebo ), and were consistent with those observed in LN patients. There were 13 deaths (4.9%) during the study. There were more deaths in the voclosporin low- dose arm (10) than in either the voclosporin high-dose (2) or placebo (1) arms, with the majority (11/13) occurring in Asia. All deaths were assessed by the Investigators as unrelated to study treatment. In sum mary, no unexpected safety signals were observed with the use of voclosporin in LN subjects; voclosporin was generally well tolerated. The overall safety profile is consistent with the expectations for the class of drug, the patient population, and concomitant therapies. The AURION study ( protocol AUR -VCS -2014- 01) is an exploratory open- label Phase 2 study assessing the short -term predictors of remission of voclosporin 23.7 mg BID in c ombination with standard of care in patients with active LN. The duration of the study is 48 weeks with 10 subjects randomized. All subjects received background therapy with MMF and corticosteroids. At 24 weeks, 4/7 (57.1%) subjects continued to be in complete remission as measured by a UPCR of ≤0.5 mg/mg, eGFR within 20% of baseline , and concomitant steroid dose of less than 5 mg/day. Within these 7 AURION patients, there was a 54% mean reduction in proteinuria at 24 weeks compared to pre -treatment levels along with consistent improvements in complement 3 (C3), C4 and anti -double- stranded DNA. Renal function as measured by eGFR remained stable. Voclosporin was well tolerated with no unexpected safety signals observed. 1.2.5 Potential Toxicities Voclosporin has been studied in numerous disease states. When examining LN, there were a small proportion of voclosporin treated subjects that experienced an early drop of ≥30% in eGFR, however that proportion then remains stable over time. None of these t reatment - emergent adverse event s (TEAEs ) were classed as serious. The majo rity of TEAEs of decreased GFR were classed as mild or moderate, and resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug in 1 (1.1%) placebo subject, 6 (6.7%) voclosporin low -dose subjects and 5 (5.6%) voclosporin high -dose subjects. There were more TEAEs of hypertension seen in the voclosporin- treated patients compared to placebo however, overall mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( BP) decreased in all groups, without statistically significant differences seen between groups. Overall, only 1 (1.1%) subject, in the voclosporin high -dose group, had a TEAE of hypertension that resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug. There was evidence of an increased incidence of TEAEs over placebo and with increased dose of voclosporin in the System Orga n Classes of Infections and Infestations, Gastrointestinal Disorders , and Vascular Disorders."

RATIONALE The rationale for the development of Orelvo and the choice of doses is to introduce a novel CNI to the LN patient population, with meaningful efficacy while minimizing toxicities common to other CNIs. In clinical studies, a favorable efficacy/safety profile for Orelvo has been demonstrated in the prevention of renal transplant rejection. As evaluated in nonclinical and clinical studies (healthy volunteers, moderate to severe psoriasis, renal transplantation, and uveitis) Orelvo is well tolerated and exhibits AEs that are typical of other CNIs yet seen to a lesser extent than that seen historically with other CNIs. The aim of the current study is to investigate whether Orelvo , added to the standard of care treatment in active LN, is able to reduce disease activity over a treatment period of 52 weeks. The background therapy will be MMF at a dose of at least 1 g/day and initial treatment with IV methylprednisolone, followed by a reducing course of oral corticosteroids. Subjects with active, flaring LN will be eligible to enter the study. They are require d to have a diagnosis of LN according to established diagnostic criteria (American College of Rheumatology) and clinical and biopsy features suggestive of active nephritis. Efficacy will be assessed by the ability of the drug combination to reduce the level of proteinuria (as measured by urine protein/creatinine ratio ( UPCR) ) while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile. Normally, most subjects will respond to treatment by 6 months , but the optimal short -term predictor of long- term renal function is the response to treatment by 12 months (as observed in the AURA- LV study) . Therefore, the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 study will be complete renal response at 52 weeks. 2.1 Dose Rationale This Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate the treatment ben efit of Orelvo 23.7 mg BID versus placebo. Orelvo and/or placebo are herein referred to as study treatment. The selection of Orelvo dose in this study (see Section 7, Study Treatments ) was based on the previous experience with this drug in the Phase 2 study (AURA -LV). In AURA- LV, subjects were administered voclosporin 23.7 mg BID, 39.5 mg BID, or matching placebo. Low -dose voclosporin was significantly superior to placebo in the proportion of subjects achieving complete renal response at Week 24 (p=0.045). There was no increase in efficacy with the higher dose and no significant differences between the 2 voclosporin groups in achievement of renal response. Orelvo 23.7 mg BID will be administered as a fixed dose without the use of therapeutic drug monitoring. Population PK analyses of voclosporin concentrations from the clinical development program (including healthy subject s, subjects with renal impairment, subjects with hepatic impairment, renal transplant, and plaque psoriasis) demonstrated that weight did not have a significant effect on the PKs of voclosporin. The protocol contains provisions for"

The safety data from the use of voclosporin demonstrates that these risks are dose- related, reversible, and can be managed by dose reduction and temporary interruption."

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 4.1 Overall Study Design This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, prospective, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled, 2- arm comparison study of Orelvo versus matching placebo . Subjects who have provided a signed and dated informed consent will be screened into the study up to 30 days before randomization. During the screening period, el igibility criteria will be assessed. A kidney biopsy may be performed, provided the subject has given consent and provided the results can be obtained and reviewed before baseline. Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion c riteria will be eligible for randomization into the study. Baseline assessments will be performed before the first dose of study treatment is administered on Day 1. The baseline assessments of the serum creatinine and urine protein laboratory parameters wi ll be established by using the mean of the 2 pre-randomization values. Using an interactive web response system ( IWRS ), eligible subjects will be randomized to r eceive either oral Orelvo 23.7 mg BID or matching placebo for 52 weeks. All subjects should receive 0.5 g/day IV methylprednisolone on Days 1 and 2 before changing to a reducing course of oral corticosteroid therapy on Day 3. ( For additional details and exceptions, see Section 7.2.2.2, Corticosteroids ). Starting at the Baseline Visit, all s ubjects will also receive background therapy with MMF (see Section 7.2.2.3, Mycophenolate Mofetil (Background Therapy) . All subjects will return for assessment of efficacy and safety at Day 2 and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 52. See Schedule of Events , for detailed information regarding visits. In addition, subjects not on MMF during screening, will start receiving MMF at the Baseline Visit and will return for local complete blood count assessments at Weeks 1 and 3 after randomization. All subjects, completed or withdrawn, will complete the End of Treatment /Early Termination assessments (Visit 15) at Week 52 or at the t ime of early termination . Subjects who do not enroll in the continuation s tudy will attend the Safety Follow -up Visit (Visit 16) at Week 56 to collect any new AEs and concomitant medications . At the follow -up visit, UPCR and eGFR will be assessed as well. For subject withdrawal procedures and criteria, see Section 5.5, Withdrawal of Subjects . 4.2 Duration of Subject Participation and Study The expected duration of subject participation is approximately 60 weeks. The screening period is up to 30 days and the treatment duration is 52 weeks, with a further follow -up visit 4 weeks after last dose (completion or early termination) if not particip ating in the continuation study."

Subjects with cervical dysplasia that is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 , but have been treated with conization or loop electrosurgical excision procedure, and have h ad a normal repeat Papanicolaou test are allowed. • Lymphoproliferative disease or previous total lymphoid irradiation. • Severe viral infection ( e.g., cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus) within 3 months of screening; or known HIV infection . Severe viral infection is defined as active disease requiring antiviral therapy. • Active TB, or known history of TB/evidence of old TB if not taking prophylaxis with isoniazid (see Section 9.2.1, Screening Visit Procedures ). 8. Other known clinically significant active medical conditions, such as: • Severe cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure, history of cardiac dysrhythmia or congenital long QT syndrome. QT interval duration corrected for heart rate using method of Fridericia (QTcF) exceeding 480 msec in the presence of a normal QRS interval (<110 msec) at time of screening will result in exclusion . • Liver dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or bilirubin ≥2.5 times the upper limit of normal) at screening and, if abnormal at screening, then confirmed that the levels have returned to <2.5 times upper limit of normal before randomization. • Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma requiring oral steroids. • Bone marrow insufficiency unrelated to active SLE (according to Investigator judgment) with white blood cell count <2,500/mm 3; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1.3 × 103/μL; thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50,000/mm3). • Active bleeding disorders. • Current infection requiring IV antibiotics. 9. Any overlapping autoimmune condition for which the condition or the treatment of the condition may affect the study assessments or outcomes (e.g., scleroderma with significant pulmonary hypertension; any condition for which additional immunosuppression is indicated).

No vaccines using live organisms, virus or bacterial, are allowed during screening and while taking the study treatment. 11. Other major physical or psychiatric illness or major traumatic injury within 6 months prior to screening that may affect study conduct or interfere with study assessments or outcome . 12. Any other medical condition which, in the Investigator’s judgment, may be associated with increased risk to the subject or may int erfere with study assessments or outcomes. 13. Subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding or, if of childbearing potential, not using adequate contraceptive precautions. 14. Participation in another clinical study within 4 weeks prior to s creening and/or receipt of investigational drugs within 4 weeks or 5 half -lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to screening. 15. Subjects randomized and treated in a previous voclosporin clinical study. 5.4 Adequate/Effective Contraception Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline. Two effective forms of contraception must be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Effective contraception must be used before beginning st udy treatment , during study dosing, and for 6 weeks following discontinuation of study treatment or MMF dosing, even when there has been a history of infertility, unless due to surgical sterilization. Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women without menses for at least 12 consecutive months or surgically sterilized. Sexually active men, both reproductively competent and vasectomized, are required to use condoms during treatment and for at least 90 days after cessation of study treatment or M MF. In addition, female partners of male subjects are recommended to use an effective contraception during their partner’s treatment and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study treatment or MMF. Male subjects are to refrain from making sperm donations during treatment and for at least 90 days after cessation of study treatment or MMF. An effective and medically acceptable method of birth control means the chance of pregnancy, when using that type of birth control, is less than 1% per year if used correctly. These birth control methods (i.e., reliable forms of contraception) include birth control pills (combined oral contraceptives), hormone implants, hormone shots , and some intrauterine contraceptive devices. The use of MMF in this study can also r educe the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive pill."

Although abstinence, when adhered to, is an effective method of birth control, other additional effective contraception methods should be used where there is any doubt. The method of contraception needs to be discussed with the Investigator throughout the study period in order to confirm the method used is considered effective. 5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time for any reason. Alternatively, subjects may be withdrawn at the Investigator’s discretion if it is in the subject’s best interest. Every effort should be made for subjects who withdraw from the study, either voluntarily or at the Investigator’s discretion, to undergo end of study assessments (Visit 15), if possible. If possible, the subject should also be advised to come for the Safety Follow -up V isit 4 weeks after last dose. If a subject refuses end of study procedures, the reason for refusal should be fully documented in the subject’s source document and recorded in the study specific electronic case report form ( eCRF ). It is the subject’s right to withdraw from the st udy without providing a reason. In this case, the source documents and the eCRF should document the reason for discontinuation as “withdrawal of consent.” Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 5.6 Discontinuation of Study Treatment If any subject is discontinued from study treatment , the reason for discontinuation will be documented in the eCRF . If the reason for discontinuing study treatment is an AE or an abnormal laboratory test result, the specific event or test will be recorded in the eCRF. Except for cases involving pregnancy , subjects who are discontinued from study treatment should undergo all study assessments up to and including ( Week 52 or Early Termination Visit – Visit 15), if possible. T he subject should also be advise d to come for the Safety Follow -up Visit 4 weeks after last dose. G uidance on when study treatment must be discontinued is in Section 7.6, Orelvo/Placebo Dose Modification. 5.6.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment Due to Early Non-response to Therapy Subjects will be discontinued from study t reatment if their early disease response is suboptimal. The I nvestigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss further continuation in the study if the subject meets 1 of the 2 following criteria: • After 12 weeks of treatment , the subject shows a >30% decrease from baseline value in CKD- EPI eGFR in 2 successive measurements separated by at least 4 weeks"

If the subjects require treatment with IV methylprednisolone or any rescue medication other than that permitted in the protocol (see Section 7.2.2.2, Corticosteroids ), they should be permanently discontinued from the study treatment and will be considered a treatment failure. Subjects who are permanently discontinued from study treatment will be treated as deemed appropriate by the Investigator. 5.6.2 Discontinuation of Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event Subjects may be permanently discontinued from study treatment because of the appearance of an unacceptable AE. It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject withdrawn because of an AE. In any case, every effort must be made to evaluate protocol -specified safety follow -up procedures (see Section 10.3, Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs, and Pregnancy ). If a subject is withdrawn due to an AE, the event should be followed by the Investigator through contact with the subject until resolu tion or stabilization has occurred. All AEs should be followed until resolution, stabilization or the subject is lost to follow -up and cannot be contacted."

RANDOMIZATION , BLINDING AND UNBLINDING PROCEDURES 6.1 Randomization All subjects enrolled must be identifiable throughout the study. The Investigator will maintain a list of subject numbers and subject names to enable records to be found at a later date. Subjects will be allocated a subject number at the s creening visit and registered with an interactive cen tral randomization system. Subjects meeting the required eligibility criteria will be randomized to treatment at Visit 2 (baseline). The randomization will be stratified by biopsy class (Class V only versus Others) and by prior MMF use at time of screening. The subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either Orelvo 23.7 mg BID or match ing placebo. To help ensure balance , a centralized randomization will be utilized where region will be employed as a blocked factor . Details on randomization procedures will be provided in a separate manual. 6.2 Blinding In order to preserve the double -blind design, subjects randomized to the placebo group will be matched to the active dosage groups. Dosing schedule in the placebo group w ill be the same as that of the active treatment group . To this end, the double -blind nature of this study preserves the blind with respect to active study treatment and placebo. All study personnel and subjects will be blinded to the study treatment admini stered during the study. Orelvo and placebo will be identical in taste, smell, and appearance. The randomization code key will not be available to the Study Monitors, project statisticians or the project team at Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Aurinia) or its representatives . The site staff, monitors , and study subjects will remain blinded until the end of the study. In case of emergency, the unblinding process below should be followed. 6.3 Unblinding In the rare event that an AE or pregnancy occurs for which kno wledge of the identity of the study treatment administered is necessary to manage the subject’s condition, the IWRS code for that subject may be broken and the test substance identified. Procedures for unblinding will be provided in a separate manual. Should emergency unblinding be required, the Investigator should call the Medical Monitor before unblinding wherever possible ; however, t he Investigator is responsible for the medical care of the individual study subject, and does not require the agreement of the Medical Monitor before unblinding. T he reason for unblinding must be documented. The information on study treatment should only be used for decision"

Placebo – 3 capsules BID Placebo; 3 capsules administered BID in combination with MMF and oral corticosteroids from randomization onwards. 7.2.2 Dosing Guidelines 7.2.2.1 Orelvo/ Placebo – Study Treatment Study treatment will be taken BID with water on an empty stomach as close to a 12 hour schedule as possible, and with a minimum of 8 hours between doses. If the subject misses a dose of study treatment by less than 4 hours from the anticipated dosing time, the missed dose will be taken immediately. The next dose will be taken at the originally scheduled time. If a missed dose of study treatment is greater than 4 hours from the expected dosing time , the subject will skip the dose and take the next dose at the originally scheduled time. The variation in dosing will be recorded in the eCRFs. The dose/doses of study treatment may be held at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects must avoid consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit - containing juice (e.g., pomelo) for the duration of their participation in the study. Possible dose adjustments: If GI or other disturbances occur with study treatment , then study treatment dosing may be reduced or interrupted, and/or appropriate treatment may be initiated (e.g., addition of a proton pump inhibitor (see Appendix 5) and Section 7.6, Orelvo/Placebo Dose Modification). All unused study treatment s (and any empty containers) dispensed to the subject will be returned at each study visit for capsule counts to check compliance. The Investigator will count the returned study treatment and this information will be used to assess subject compliance. This study treatment count must be documented in the eCRF and source documentation. 7.2.2.2 Corticosteroids All subjects who weigh ≥45 kg should receive 0.5 g IV methylprednisolone on both Day 1 and Day 2 (a total of 1 g), before oral corticosteroid therapy is started on Day 3. All s ubjects who weigh <45 kg should receive 0.25 g IV methylprednisolone on both Day 1 and Day 2 (a total of 0.5 g). When subjects are receiving IV methylprednisolone, they should not receive oral corticosteroids on the same day. If it is considered to be in the subject’s best interest, IV methylprednisolone treatment may be started during the screening period, but no more than 1 g in total may be administered for the"

Subjects receiving IV methylprednisolone in the 3 months prior to screening must be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to initiating further IV methylprednisolone. Also, IV corticosteroid therapy to be administered during screening must be discussed with the Medical Monitor in advance. If IV corticosteroid therapy is administered by the site during screening, the dose administered on Day 1 and/or Day 2 will be 1 g minus the dose administered during screening. The maximum daily dose of methylprednisolone administered on Day 1 and/or Day 2 is 0.5 g. See below for examples : • Example 1: If a 0.6 g dose of IV methylprednisolone is administered during screening, then ( 1 – 0.6) = 0.4 g IV methylprednisolone will be administered on Day 1, followed by the oral steroid dosing schedule in Table 1, beginning on Day 2 or 3. • Example 2: If the dose administered during screening is 0.3 g, then the total residual dose required is (1 – 0.3) = 0.7 g. Because 0.7 g is greater than the maximum daily dose allowed, 0.35 g will be administered on Day 1 and 0.35 g on Day 2, followed by the oral steroid dosing schedule in Table 1, beginning on Day 3. If IV methylprednisolone therapy is administered in the 2 weeks prior to the start of screening then the subject is excluded from the study (see Section 7.8.1, Prohibited Medications ), unless approved by the Medical Monitor. • Example 3: In a 40 kg subject , if a 0.3 g dose of IV methylprednisolone is administered during screening then ( 0.5 – 0.3) = 0.2 g IV methylprednisolone will be administered on Day 1, followed by the oral steroid dosing schedule in Table 1, beginning on Day 2 or 3. If at s creening the Investigator determines a subject requires IV corticosteroid therapy, every effort should be made to collect both morning urine specimens (for UPCR determination) before initiation of the IV steroids. If this cannot be done, the Medical Monitor should be contacted in advance of the therapy (see Section 9.2.1, Screening Visit Procedures ). In the case of the full 1 g IV methy lprednisolone being administered prior to randomization (or 0.5 g in a subject <45 kg), it is acceptable for oral prednisone as per dosing schedule to be administered on Day 1.

In this case , the Investigator may be permitted to omit the administration of further IV methylprednisolone but only after discussion with the Medical Monitor. 4 Week 6 is not a scheduled study visit, a phone call can be performed to decide further tapering for subjects. Note s: Oral prednisone taper should be done within ± 3 days of specified timeframe. When clinically indicated, subjects are allowed to be completely titrated off of oral corticosteroids. Abbreviation: IV = Intravenous. Note that at each visit or during interim phone calls , the corticosteroid dose to be achieved is shown. The timing of the titration to that dose is at the discretion of the Investigator. For example, the Week 6 administration of steroids in a 43 kg subject should be 1 0 mg daily. The Investigator may reduce it at Week 7 to 7.5 mg until 5 mg is prescribed at Week 8. When clinically indicated, subjects are allowed to be completely titrated off of oral corticosteroids. Subjects with a lack of response are allowed one 4- week interval without dose reduction or 1 dos e escalation to the previous dose for 2 weeks at any time during the study. Lack of response is defined as no or minimal change in UPCR per Investigator judgment over 3 visits or deterioration in UPCR not meeting the criteria for withdrawal.

All s ubjects will take MMF BID (morning and evening), before meals (i.e., on an empty stomach), with a glass of water. If a dose is missed, the subject should take the next correct dose rather than “doubling up” at the next dosing time point. A stable dose of MMF will be maintained throughout the study. Dose changes or interruptions are permitted for clearly documented safety reasons only. • Approval by the Medical Monitor is required for subjects taking a dose other than 2 g/day MMF from randomization onwards (e.g. , total daily dose of 1 or 3 g/day). • If GI disturbance or other side -effects occur with MMF, the 1 g BID dosing may be changed to 500 mg four times daily. • If a subject has an ANC <1,500/mm3 at any study visit, the dose of MMF should be decreased or interrupted. If a subject has an ANC <1,000/mm3 at any visit, the dose should be discontinued and only recommenced when the ANC reaches 1,500/mm3. If the subject has a dose interruption of MMF of >14 days , then permanent discontinuation of MMF , therefore the study, should be considered after discussion with the Medical Monitor. • If deemed necessary by the Investigator on account of leukopenia or other adverse effect, or if the subject weighs 50 kg or less, the dose of MMF may be decreased to a minimum of 500 mg BID. 7.3 Package and Labeling All study treatments provided by Aurinia will be packaged and labeled for Aurinia by appropriately qualified vendors according to all applicable local and country regulatory"

All packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to GMP and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Study- treatment wallets provided to site s and to subjects will be labeled in the appropriate local language, according to local regulatory requirements. Wallet label information will be appropria tely documented in the Drug Accountability Form after the container has been dispensed to the subject. 7.4 Study Treatment Allocation For purposes of randomization, each eligible subject will be assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio using IWRS . The randomization will be central -based and stratified by biopsy class (Class V only versus Others) and by prior MMF use at time of the S creening Visit. Randomization will additionally be blocked by region. 7.5 Site Supply, Storage, Accountability 7.5.1 Site Supply Once a site has been approved for study initiation, the site will be supplied with an initial stock of study treatment . The need for study treatment resupply will be assessed on a regular basis taking into account the number of subjects enrolled at the s ite. 7.5.2 Storage Orelvo softgel caps ules and matching placebo capsules will be supplied in cartons containing 168 capsules in 4 wallets of 42 capsules each. The Investigator must ensure the availability of proper storage conditions. All study treatment supplie s provided for this study will be stored in a secure area with restricted access at the study site. The capsules must be stored at a controlled room temperature between 15 and 30°C (59-86°F). The Investigator must document and inform the Site Monitor about temperature deviations outside the acceptable range. Subjects will be instructed to store the study treatment at room temperature between 15 and 30°C (59- 86°F). Each site should have a thermometer that records minimum and maximum temperatures daily. Maint enance of a temperature log is mandatory. The log should be updated by site personnel during normal working hours. This log must be available for review by the Site Monitor during on-site monitoring visits. 7.5.3 Accountability The Investigator at each site is r esponsible for study treatment supplies. The Investigator will ensure that adequate records of the receipt, dispensing , and return of the study treatment are"

All data regarding the study treatment must be recorded on the relevant forms provided. Each study site will maintain a drug inventory/dispensing record for all drugs dispensed and returned. At the end of the study, 1 copy of the drug inventory/dispensing record should be sent to Aurinia for the central study file. The original will be kept in the site files. After completion of the study, or if it is prematurely terminated, all unused materials will be returned to Aurinia. The decision to destroy study treatment at a site must be made by Aurinia. If the study treatment is destroyed at a site, the Investigator must receive Aurinia approval of the process and forward the certificate of destruction to Aurinia. Records of IV methylprednisolo ne, oral corticosteroids , and MMF must be maintained (prescribed dose, dose adjustments and reasons) in the source notes and mus t be transcribed into the eCRF. 7.6 Orelvo/Placebo Dose Modification Dose modifications for background therapy (MMF and corticosteroids) are detailed in Section 7.2, Drug Dosage and Administration. 7.6.1 Deterioration in Renal Function Serum creatinine and eGFR utilizing the CKD -EPI formula will be used for the assessment of renal function at every visit (Visits 1 -15 and unscheduled visit(s)). S ubjects will have a minimum of 2 eGFR measurements conducted pri or to dosing at Visit 2. The lowest of the pre-dose eGFR assessments will be used as the marker of baseline renal function. It is recognized that eGFR may be unreliable at higher values (>100 mL/min/1.73 m2). Lupus nephritis subjects with nephrotic range proteinuria frequently have wide fluctuations in serum creatinine (and therefore eGFR) which are not representative of true renal dysfunction. Chronic kidney disease is defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for ≥3 months [ 20], with or without kidney damage. 7.6.1.1 Decrease in eGFR > 30% and eGFR <60 mL/min /1.73 m2 During the treatment period, any subject experiencing a > 30% decrease in eGFR from baseline to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, will have study treatment interrupted until a repeat test can be performed (unscheduled visit to be completed). If the decrease is confirmed and not due to potential contributing factors (e.g., high baseline eGFR, the addition or modification of non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) , a concurrent state of dehydration, overdosing with study treatment, lupus renal flare, etc.) , the case sh ould be discussed with the"

If the eGFR decrease is not confirmed, the study treatment can be restarted at 2 capsules BID and increased as tolerated with discussion with the Medical Monitor. 7.6.1.2 Decrease in eGFR ≤ 30% and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 During the treatment period, any subject having a ≤30% reduction in eGFR to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, should have the influence of potential contributing factors (as described in Section 7.6.1.1, Decrease in eGFR >30% and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) ruled out and appropriate corrective action taken. Any subject having a > 20-≤30% reduction compared to baseline in eGFR to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 will have a confirmation measurement done within approximately 2 weeks (at a planned study visit , if any, or an unscheduled visit is to be completed). The subjects will be managed in the most medically appropriate manner in consultation with the Medical Monitor. The management of the decrease in eGFR may include reduction of dose or temporary interruption. 7.6.1.3 Recovery of eGFR Subject s experiencing a decrease in eGFR with resultant decrease in dose should be reassessed for recovery of renal function. If the repeated eGFR is >80% of baseline, the dose should be increased by 1 capsule BID and eGFR assessed w ithin 2 weeks. 7.7 Procedures for Overdose Based on clinical experience with Orelvo , symptomatic treatment of AEs or overdoses is indicated. Treatment for renal dysfunction, hypertension, and infection may include dose reduction or dose discontinuation. Magnesium supplementation may be required for hypomagnesemia. Treatment for GI complaints and biochemical/hematological abnormalities, and all other expected AEs, should be based on symptoms, with care taken to rule out other causes. 7.8 Prohibited Therapy and Conco mitant Treatment Any concomitant treatment given for any reason during the course of the study must be recorded in the eCRF and in the subject’s source documents, including dosage, start and stop dates , and reason for use.

Subject weight will also be recorded at each physical exami nation; however, height will only be recorded at the screening ( Visit 1 ). 9.1.3 Vital Signs The following vital signs will be measured in accordance with the Schedule of Events : • Resting BP (systolic and diastolic) • Resting HR • Body temperature (°C or °F) To avoid variability, the same method of obtaining body temperature should be used throughout the study. 9.1.3.1 Blood P ressure Management Blood pressure and HR will be measured with the subject in a sitting position after 5 minutes of rest. The procedure for standardized measurement of BP is detailed in Appendix 2. If the BP measure is confirmed to be >130/80 mmHg (i.e., by the mean of the second and third repeats of 3 readings), the subject’s BP will be managed per local practice. If the BP remains uncontrolled with the maximal doses of first and second -line antihypertensive therapies referenced in Appendix 1, then the Investigator should contact the Medical Monit or to consider dose adjustment of the study treatment.

The subject will be asked to return for an unscheduled visit within 24 hours and the ECG will be repeated (confirmed), in triplicate (i.e., three 10 -second ECGs in rapid succession within 1 minute). If the repeat measurements confirm that the QTcF is >500 msec or >60 msec from baseline, the subject will be withdrawn from treatment with the study treatment and followed until the QTcF value either returns to baseline (or as appropriate) or until, in the judgment of the Investigator, further evaluation is not clinically indicated. If study treatment is discontinued, the subject should continue in the study for all remaining scheduled study visits. 9.1.5 Lupus Disease Activity Assessments The SELENA -SLEDAI assesses disease activity within the last 10 days. Twenty -four items are scored for 9 organ systems, and summed to a maximum of 105 points. A score of 6 is considered clinically significant. See Appendix 6. Assessments for SELENA -SLEDAI will be conducted at baseline, Week 24, and Week 52. 9.1.6 Orelvo Pharmacokinetics Blood samples will be taken at Weeks 24 and 52. PK samples will be drawn prior to study treatment dosing (trough sample), and at 2 hours post -dose. These samples will be analyzed for Orelvo . Should a subject experience an SAE, require a dose modification or be withdrawn from treatment, a blood PK sample will be taken (with a trough sample preferred) for later determination of drug level. If a subject has discontinued from study drug treat ment, further PK samples are not required. 9.2 Schedule of Assessments A detailed schedule of assessments (including all protocol -required assessments, visits , and visit windows) is located on the Schedule of Events . No study related assessments will be performed (including changes to current medications to meet study eligibility) until the subject has provided signed and dated informed consent. Every effort will be made to keep the subject within the requested visit schedule. If a subject is seen outside of the visit window listed on the Schedule of Events , the reason must be clearly documented in the source notes. The Investigator (or designee) should contact Aurinia for assistance with getting the subject’s schedule back on track in order to avoid large variances in treatment exposure or to avoid delaying overall study timelin es."

Screening will include provision of informed consent, physical examination including weight , and height, medical history (including SLE and LN history) , vital signs measurements, 12 -lead ECG, and review of prior and concomitant medications and entry criteria. Any AEs which occur after informed consent will be recorded. Urine samples will be collected for urinalysis and urine microscopy; first morning void urine samples (for determination of UPCR) will be collected on 2 days during the screening period and must be returned and the results evaluated prior to Visit 2. An average of the 2 screening UPCRs will be used as a marker of baseline urine protein excretion. Baseline proteinuria level is determined by a mean of 2 first morning void urine samples taken during the screening period. The lowest of pre -dose eGFR assessments will be used as the marker of baseline renal function . It is recommended that in the event that IV corticosteroids are administered during screening, the 2 first morning urine voids are to be collected prior to administration of the corticosteroids (see Section 7.2.2.2, Corticosteroids ). In the case where this is not possible , then the marker of baseline urine protein excretion will be based upon the Visit 1 UPCR collection only. This must be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrollment. Please note that the results of the 24- hour urine collection will have to be avai lable prior to the Baseline Visit. Blood samples will be drawn according to Table 2 . If the subject is from an area where TB is endemic or whose history suggests an increased personal risk, e.g., from contact with people with TB or travel to areas with endemic TB, the subject will be carefully evaluated for latent or active TB. Women of childbearing potential should have a negative serum pregnancy test result before randomization. Study treatment cannot be initiated by the physician until a report of a serum negative pregnancy test has been obtained. If a subject has not met the requirements in Inclusion Criter ia #4 due to not having kidney biopsy result within the required time frame , a kidney biopsy can be performed as per local procedures, after signing the study consent, provided the results can be obtained and reviewed prior to randomization. 9.2.2 Treatment Procedures Only subjects who satisfy all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for randomization and study treatment.

EVALUATION , RECORDING AND REPORTING OF AES AND SAE S 10.1 Definitions 10.1.1 Adverse Event Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment is an AE. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 10.1.2 Adverse Drug Reaction In the pre -approval clinic al experience with a new medical product or its new usages, particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phrase “ responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 10.1.3 Serious Adverse Event An SAE (experience) or reaction is an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 1 or more of the following criteria : • Results in death (Note: death is an outcome, not an event) • Is life -threatening (Note: the te rm “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe) • Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant di sability/incapacity • Results in a con genital anomaly/birth defect • Is a medically important event or reaction The definitions and reporting requirements of International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions, and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to."
67,page_67,"AURORA 1 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -01), Version 2.0 (Amendment 1) Confidential 04 May 2017 Page 68 of 114 Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediat ely life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These will also usually be considered serious. Hospitalizations for e lective or previously scheduled surgery for pre -existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, will not be classed as SAEs. Previously scheduled hospitalizations must be documented in the subject’s source documents before the subject signed the informed consent form ( ICF). A kidney biopsy performed as part of the study to verify eligibility will not be considered a n SAE. Any complication experienced during a kidney biopsy procedure resulting in hospitalization or a prolongation of the hospitalization requires SAE reporting. 10.1.4 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction Any ADR that is both serious and unexpected (per the IB) that, based on the opinion of the Investigator or Aurinia, is felt to have a reasonable suspected causal relationship to a medicinal product is a s uspected unexpected serious adverse reaction . 10.2 Adverse Event Descriptors 10.2.1 Intensity/Severity Categorization The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, modera te, or severe myocardial infarction); however the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. In general, the intensity of a particular AE to be recorded is the worst intensity experienced by the subject during the course of the event. The medical assessment of intensity will be determined by using the following definitions: Mild: The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with usual activity. Moderate: The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still able to function. Severe: The AE is incapacitating and the subject is unable to work or complete usual activity."
68,page_68,"AURORA 1 ( AUR -VCS -2016 -01), Version 2.0 (Amendment 1) Confidential 04 May 2017 Page 69 of 114 10.2.2 Causal Relationship Categorization An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the study treatment for each AE and SAE. The Investigator must decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study treatment. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE/SAE must be classified as not related. Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a cause -and-effect relationship between the study treatment and the occurrence of the AE/SAE, then the AE/SAE will be considered related. For SAEs, the Investigator must provide a brief comment explaining the rationale of his/her assessment of causal relationship on the SAE reporting form. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition Related Yes The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study drug administration indicates a causal relationship , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. Not related No The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study drug administration does not indicate a causal relationship , or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. If the causal relationship between an AE/SAE and the study treatment is determined to be “related”, the event will be considered to be related to study treatment for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. In circumstances where the Investigator has not yet provided his/her assessment about the relationship, the event will be considered as “related” and qualify for expedited regulatory reporting. 10.2.3 Outcome Categorization Outcome may be classified as recovered without sequelae; recovered with sequelae; improved; worsened; ongoing; ongoing at end of study; fatal; or unknown. If the outcome is reported as recovered with sequelae for a n SAE , the Investigator should specify the kind of sequelae on the SAE reporting form. SAEs that are ongoing at the time of death will have an outcome of “unknown” recorded. SAEs resulting in a fatal outcome will have an outcome of “ fatal” recorded."

An explanation of these circumstances must be written in the source documents. Worsening of the symptoms however, will be recorded as an AE, and clearly marked as worsening or by the subject’s worst observed intensity. 10.2.5 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations A change in the value of a safety laboratory investigation can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant in the opinion of the Investigator or if, during treatment with the stu dy treatment , a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to a pathological value, or a further worsening of an already pathological value. If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are pathological laboratory values which were not present at baseline, further clinical or laboratory investigations will be performed until the values return to within reference range or until a plausible explanation (e.g., concomitant disease) is found for the pathological laboratory values. If the Investigator c onsiders such an AE as serious it must be reported as an SAE. 10.2.6 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose and Medication Error All AEs of special interest such as study treatment abuse, misuse, overdose , and medication error have to be documented in the subject’s eCRF and source documentation. If any occurrence of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors leads to any event that fulfils any seriousness criteria, the event has to be reported as an SAE. 10.3 Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs , and Pregnancy 10.3.1 Adverse Events All AEs either observed by the Investigator or one of his/her medical collaborators, or reported by the subject spontaneously, or in response to a direct question, will be noted in the AE section of the subject's eCRF and source documentation. This applies to all AEs regardless of presumed relationship to the study treatment. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment must be collected. If any AE is reported, the date of onset, relationship to study treatment, any action taken, date of resolution (or the fact that it is still continuing or has become chronic), outcome, and whether the AE is serious or not , will be recorded. Use of colloquialisms and abbreviations should be avoided. Only 1 AE term should be recorded in the event field on the AE eCRF . Where possible, the Investigator should report a diagnosis rather than signs and symptoms or"

However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the AE eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all prev iously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one AE report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis . The AE reporting period begins at the time the ICF is signed by the subject. The AE reporting period ends at Visit 15 (if the subject participates in the continuation study) or the study follow- up visit (Visit 16) , if the subject does not participate in the continuation study. Adverse events persisting at the time of study completion will be followed by the Investigator through contact with the subject until resolution or stabilization has occurred (or the subject is lost to follow- up and cannot be contacted) and recorded in the source documents . If the subject reports an AE, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to acquire sufficient information in order to assess causality. This may require additional laboratory testing, physical examinations, telephone contacts, etc. In ci rcumstances where the Investigator is unable to make contact with the subject, the Investigator must provide a written statement to Aurinia confirming that the subject is lost to follow -up. In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked a non- leading question, such as “How are you feeling?” It is also important to question the subject in a non- leading way about changes in their health or concomitant medication usage since their last visit. This information should be collected prior to com pletion of assessments at all study visits. In addition, any symptoms/conditions reported during assessments and deemed to be clinically significant by the Investigator will be considered AEs. 10.3.2 Serious Adverse Events All SAEs occurring after the signing of the ICF will be reported to within 24 hours of the Investigator, designee, or site staff’s knowledge of the event regardless of relationship to study treatment. All SAEs are to be reported on the eCRFs. In the event that the site expe riences a temporary disruption of the EDC system a back -up paper SAE Report ing Form will be available for site staff to complete. • Site staff will complete the paper SAE report form and e -mail it within 24 hours to the following address: • Only in cases where the email system is unavailable, site staff will send the SAE by fax to: (US) and (Outside US)."

All SAEs , regardless of causality, will be reported from the time the ICF is signed until 30 days follo wing the last study visit or 30 days after last study treatment administration in subjects who withdraw or discontinue prior to study completion. No formal study visit is required but Investigators must report any SAEs that occur during this 30 day period on the eCRF . If the Investigator has not seen the subject at a clinic visit at the end of the reporting period, the Investigator must make reasonable efforts to contact the subject to inquire about SAEs. All recorded SAEs, regardless of relationship to study treatment, will be followed up until resolution, stabilization, or the subject i s lost to follow -up and cannot be contacted. In circumstances where the Investigator is unable to make contact with the subject, the Investigator must provide a written statement to Aurinia confirming that the subject is lost to follow-up. Any SAE consider ed to have a causal relationship (i.e., “related”) to the study treatment and discovered by the Investigator at any time after the study will be reported. A rationale for the assessment of a causal relationship must be provided by the Investigator. Any saf ety information that is obtained after the Follow-up V isit (Visit 16) will be documented in the safety database only. A death occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the Investigator within 30 days after the last study visit (including the F ollow -up V isit) or until 30 days after the last study treatment administration, whichever is longer, whether considered treatment -related or not, must be reported to Aurinia. If the subject died, the SAE report should include the cause of death as the event term and whether or not the death was related to study treatment, as well as the autopsy findings, if available. Preliminary reports will be followed by detailed descriptions which will include copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports/certificates and other documents when requested and applicable. Additional follow-up information must be reported in the e CRF within 24 hours of awareness following Investigator (or site) awareness of the information. The Investigator should not delay reporting a n SAE in order to obtain additional information. A dditional information, when available, should be reported to by the reporting procedures described above.

The Investigator should counsel the subject, and in the case of a male subject, the subject’s partner, discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. A female subject must immediately inform the Investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study. Monitoring of the pregnancy in a female subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. In case of a pregnancy in the partner of a male subject, the Investigator should obtain informed consent of the pregnant partner prior to monitoring of the pregnancy. Women who have a positive pregnancy test during the study will be withdrawn from the study treatment and the procedures for withdrawal will be completed. The Medical Monitor must be contacted immediately to break the blind (if applicable). All pregnancies , subject or partner of a subject, that occur during the study or come to the attention of the Investigator within 30 days af ter the last study visit (including the Follow -up Visit) or until 30 days after last study treatment administration, which ever is longer, must be reported to by the reporting procedures described above. The outcome of all such pregnancies (including normal births) should be followed up and documented, even if the subject was withdrawn from the study. Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome until 90 days (or otherwise as appropriate) post -partum . It will be the responsibility of Aurinia, together with the appropriate support of the Investigator, to obtain this information. Complications of pregnancy such as abortion (spontaneous or induced), premature birth, or congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and should be reported following the reporting procedures as outlined in Section 10.3.2, Serious Adverse Events .

A general description of the planned methods is provided below. Any deviation from the SAP will be noted and explained in the clinical study report. 13.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations The total sample size will be 324 subjects ( 162 subjects per treatment arm). This is based on the following assumptions: • A two group continuity corrected Chi square test with a 0.05 two- sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference between a placebo response rate of 20.0% and a Orelvo response rate of 34.4% (odds ratio=2.1) when the sample size in each group is 162 (total N=324). • The effect of w ithdrawals will be investigated. S ubjects withdrawing for any reason will be counted as non-responders in the primary analysis and therefore no adjustment of sample size for withdrawals is necessary. • The impact of withdrawals on primary endpoint will be investigated with a tipping point analysis. Table 3 shows the Orelvo response rates required to maintain a minimum 80% power at the planned sample size for given placebo response rates. These response rates all lead to odds ratios of around 2, which is a clinically relevant effect.

The study null hypothesis H 0 and alternative hypothesis H 1 are as follows: H0: There is no difference in renal response between Orelvo and placebo . H1: There is a difference in renal response between Orelvo and placebo. The null hypothesis H 0 will be rejected in favor of H 1 if there is evidence at the 5% significance level using a 2 -sided test. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on the ITT set using logistic regression with terms for treatment, baseline UPCR , biopsy class , and MMF use at baseline . The results being expressed as an odds ratio (and associated two -sided 95% CI) for Orelvo compared to placebo . Odds ratios greater than unity show the odds of response are greater for Orelvo than for placebo and therefore indicate a benefit of the Orelvo treatment arm. 13.8.2 Sensitivity Analyses The following sensitivity analyses will be performed: • Renal response at Week 52 will be analyzed using a logistic regression including only a term for treatment.

It will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier methodology and will be presented as a plot showing a line for each treatment group. Median time -to-event along with two-sided confidence intervals will be displayed. Cox’s proportional hazards model will be performed to assess the significance of the differences between treatment arms. The model will include ter ms for treatment, baseline UPCR , biopsy class , and MMF use at baseline. E stimates of the treatment effects will be expressed as hazard ratios (and associated 95% CI) for Orelvo relative to placebo. Hazard ratios greater than unity show the hazard to be greater for Orelvo than for placebo and therefore indicate that the events in question generally occur earlier on active Orelvo . The log- rank test and Cox’s proportional hazards model assume that the hazard ratio is constant over time. This assumption will be checked graphically by plotting log -log survivor functions for the treatment groups. It should be noted that modest deviations from the proportionality assumption generally will not invalidate inf erence. 13.8.3.3 Change from Baseline Endpoints The following secondary endpoints will be analy zed using a Mixed E ffect Model Repeated Measures analysis with treatment arm, visit, treatment by visit interaction , biopsy class , and MMF use at baseline included as a covariate in the model.
