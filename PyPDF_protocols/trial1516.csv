This study incorporates multiple interim analyses for futility, efficacy, and unblinded sample -size re-estimation . In the phase 3 part of the study, blinatumomab will be compared to IC chemotherapy. The phase 2 compone nt of t he study will consist of up to a 28-day screening period, approximately 70 to 112 days of study treatment, a 30-day (± 3days ) safety follow up, and long- term follow up that will conclude with the final analysis of the phase 3 component, estimated at 30 months after initiation of the phase 3 component. In the event that phase 3 is not initiated , LTFU for phase 2 subjects will proceed as detailed in Section 7.2.7. For the phase 3 component, the study w ill con sist of up to a 28- day screening period, a treat ment period of up to approximately 168 days, a 30- day safety follow -up visit, and long -term follow up. Long -term follow up will conclude with the final analysis. In the phase 2 component, enrolled subjects will receive blinatumomab monotherapy. In the phase 3 component, enrolled subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to blinatumomab or IC chemotherapy. Randomization will be stratified according to the following criteria: • Response to S1 chemotherapy (PMR vs no metabolic response [ NMR ]/progressive metabolic disease [ PMD ]) • Cytarabine administered in S1 (eg, R-DHAP and R -ESHAP vs R -ICE and R -GDP) • Primary Mediastinal B -Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) and B- cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma vs all other histologies of aggressive B -cell lymphoma All subjects enrolled in phase 2 and s ubjects in phase 3 randomized to the blinatumomab arm will receive a single 70- day cycle, with a total of 56 days of blinatumomab continuous infusion (7 days at 9 µg/day, 7 days at 28 µg/day, and 42 days at 112 µg/day ), followed by a treatment -free period of 14 days. Response will be assessed by central review of a PET/ CT after this single cycle (ie, on approximately day 70). In phase 3 , subjects randomized to the IC arm will receive no more than 3 cycles (maximum cycle length 28 days) of S2 chemotherapy prior to response assessment (see specific S2 requirements in Section 6.3). Any change in the chemotherapy regimen prior to respon s e assessment or without objective evidence of disease progression will be scored as treatment failure. Following the response assessment, subjects may undergo hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSC) mobilizatio n and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant or allogeneic HSCT. Subjects who demonstrate a response (PMR or CMR) to protocol -assigned therapy based on local assessment and who are not proceeding directly to autologous hematopoietic cell transplant or allogeneic HSCT may receive additional cycles of protocol -assigned therapy (maximum 1 x 4- week cycle of blinatumomab given 7 days at 9 µg/day, 7 days at 28 µg/day, and 14 days at 112 µg/day or a maximum of 3 cycles of IC S2 chemotherapy) starting at least 2 weeks , but not Approved"

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1 Disease The annual incidence of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) in Europe and the United States is estimated to be 15 to 20 cases/100.000 (Fisher and Fisher, 2004). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of NHL , accounting for 30% to 40% of cases and 13% of all hematologic disorders. The incidence i s approximately 8 cases per 100 000 and rises with age; the median age at diagnosis is 70 years (Haematological Malignancy Research Network ). Morphologically similar entities have historically been treated in a similar manner as DLBCL, and thus are collectively known as aggressive B -cell lymphomas. DLBCL as a uniform diagnostic entity, makes up approximately 85 % of aggressive B-cell lymphomas (Ziepert et al, 2010). However, distinct patterns of gene expression are observed within DLBCL, with different prognostic and potentially predictive implications (Swerdlow et al, 2016). Left untreated, DLBCL is uniformly fatal. Anthracycline-based frontline chemotherapy, introduced in the 1970s, resulted in the long term cure of 30% of patients (DeVita et al, 1975).Twenty -five years later, introduction of the human-mouse chimer ic monoclonal anti -CD20 immunoglobin G ( IgG) rituximab increased the cure rate significantly and is now a standard agent in frontline therapy, resulting in cure for 60 % of patients (Sehn and Gascoyne 2015).

HSCT is preceded by a course of salvage chemotherapy. “Chemoresponsivess”, indicating a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to salvage chemotherapy, has been as used as 1 criterion to define HSCT eligibility, since early trials demonstrated the extremely poor outcomes of patients without an objective response to salvage chemotherapy (Philip et al , 1987). It is not known if responsiveness to newer classes of therapies, such as those that are immune-based, may also be sufficient to permit the successful use of HDT/HSCT . 2.1.2 First Salvage Chemotherapy The most commonly used regimens in the S1 treatment of transplant-eligibl e patients contain rituximab and a platinum -based agent such as cisplatin (eg, R-DHAP, R-GDP, R-ESHAP) or carboplatin (eg R -ICE) (Crump et al , 2014; Martin et al , 2008; Witzig et al , 2008; Kewalramani et al , 2004). Each regimen is administered over 4-5 days every 2-4 weeks . Two to three cycles of therapy are given before response assessment . Those with PR or CR typically undergo H SC mobilization and an additional 1-2 cycles may be given before HDT /HSCT . Non-re sponders, if offered additional chemotherapy, typically receive an alternative regimen. The efficacy of salvage regimens have been compared in 2 large, multicenter randomized trials, CORAL (R -DHAP vs R-ICE) and NCIC Ly.12 (R-DHAP vs R-GDP) (Crump et al , 2014; Gisselbrecht et al , 2010). A third trial, ORCHARRD, tested an alternative anti -CD20 agent, ofatumomab, versus rituximab in combination with DHAP (van Imhoff et al , 2014). An overview of the results is shown in Table 1 . The different response and survival rates observed in these large trials may be attributed to heterogeneity in patient selection criteria as well as in the nature and timing of post-treatment assessments. Nonetheless, these results 1) fail to demonstrate superiority of any specific regimen and 2) underscore the need for new agents in the salvage treatment of this disease. Approved"

Pre-transplant 18FDG -PET outperformed other well establi shed prognostic factors, such as secondary age-adjusted international prognostic index for outcomes after autologous HSCT (Hamlin et al , 2003; Sauter et al , 2015 ). Therefore, some centers will not mobilize patients with P MR or less after 2 cycles of chemotherapy . A third cycle of the same salvage regimen may be used, though the efficacy is not documented and many non-responders discontinue after 2 cycles (Martin et al , 2008 ). 2.1.4 Later Salvage Patients who do not respond to S1 may be offered alternative therapies (hereafter referred to as S2) and HSCT provided that there is a response to S2 and that performance status and organ function are relatively preserved.

The ESMO and NCCN guidelines ar e relatively silent on appropriate S2 regimens (Zelenetz et al , 2016; Tilly et al , 2015). ICE, administered after DHAP, has been reported to provide a response rate of 52%, including 14% CR, but these responses have been observed almost exclusively in patients with stable disease (SD) rather than progressive disease ( PD) to DHAP (Simpson et al , 2007). Results of other small, single- center retrospective analyses support the conclusion that standard cytotoxic therapy is of limited value in patients not responsive to S1 chemotherapy and that novel therapies should be explored in this setting (Elstrom et al , 2010; Ardeshna et al , 2005 ;). A recent report from the CORAL trial has provided outcome data on the 203 subjects who did not undergo autologous HSCT (prim arily due to treatment failure) after S1 chemotherapy ( Van Den Neste et al , 2016). Eighty -two percent received additional chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating investigator. Of those subjects, 13%, 15%, and 67% had CR/unconfirmed complete response ( CRu), PR, or SD/PD after S1, with the remainder having unknown response. Approximately 20 % of those treated received R-DHAP -like regimens, 20% received ICE -like regimen, and 14% receiving a gemcitabine-based regimen. A variety of other regimens made up the total, but each in fewer than 10% of subjects. Among subjects achieving less than CR/CRu to second line therapy (n= 177), the CR/Cru rate to third line therapy was 22%. The median OS of the entire cohort (ie, including those that achieved CR/Cru to second line therapy) was 4.4 months. For subjects achieving CR (n= 55), PR (n=24), or SD/PD (n =87), OS at 1 year 77, 44, and 13% , respectively . Autologous HSCT was performed in 54, 58, and 22% of subjects with CR, PR, and SD/PD to S2 chemotherapy . Thirty subjects achieved CR and underwent HSCT; their 1 year survival was 82% . These results confirm that the majority of patients who do not respond to S1 chemotherapy are unlikely to respond to additional conventional chemotherapy. However, the survival experienced by responding subjects , particularly those in CMR, support the objective to introduce new agents in this setting. 2.2 Amgen Investigational Product Background: Blinatumomab Blinatumomab (BLINCYTO, AMG 103, formerly also known as MT103 or bscCD19xCD3 ) is a member of a novel class of bispecific antibody constructs called BiTE, or “bispecific T-cell engagers” (Schlereth et al, 2006; Dreier et al, 2002). Blinatumomab is a BiTE antibody construct with dual binding specificities. T-cells are Approved"

This unique feature of blinatumomab allows it to transiently connect malignant cells with T-cells, thereby inducing T- cell mediated killing of the bound malignant cell. In preclinical models, blinatumomab-mediated T-cell activation involves the transient release of inflammatory cytokines and proliferation of T-cells . The subsequent serial lysis of multiple malignant cells by a single blinatumomab-activated T-cell clos ely resembles a natural cytotoxic T-cell reaction. CD19 is highly expressed throughout B -cell development and is present on > 90% of B-cell lineage cancers including DLBCL. The efficacy of blinatumomab has been evaluated in subjects with B -cell precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and NHL , including DLBCL. Study MT103-104 evaluated the efficacy of blinatumomab in subjects with relapsed/refractory B -NHL . In this phase 1 study, subjects with relapsed/refractory NHL where treated with a target blinatumomab dose of 60µ g/m 2. In the subset of subjects with DLBCL (n = 11), 2 achieved a PR and 4 achieved CR/unconfirmed complete response (CRu) (ORR was 55% ). Neurologic events were the dose limiting toxicity, but were reversible in all cases upon interruption of the infusion ( Goebeler et al, 2016). As of the most recent analysis, 2 of the DLBCL subjects with CR/CRu had ongoing responses beyond 600 days. Of the other 2 subjects , 1 subject underwent allogeneic HSCT and was censored, and the other relapsed around 7 months after therapy. A subsequent open-label phase 2 blinatumomab study (MT-103-208) in relapsed/refractory DLBCL included 25 subjects (23 subjects received stepwise dosing and 2 a flat dose of 112 µg/day). At baseline, the median number of prior regimens was 3 (range 1 to 7 ) and all subjects had received prior rituximab. Seven (28% ) had relapsed after prior autologous HSCT. This study demonstrated stepwise dosing with weekly dose escalation of blinatumomab (9/28/112 µ g/day) was tolerable and associated with anti-tumor activity with an ORR after 1 cycle of blinatumomab of 43% for evaluable subjects, including CR in 19%. The most common adverse events were tremor, pyrexia, and fatigue. Grade 3 neurologic adverse events were reported in 22% of subjects (no grade 4 or 5) but were generally reversible with treatment interruption (Viardot et al, 2016) . Approved"

Blinatumomab (BLINCYTO) is approved in multiple regions for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative R/R B-cell precursor ALL . Additionally, confirmation of clinical benefit is a condition of approval in multiple countries . Refer to the specific section of the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information related to the physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties and formulation(s). 2.3 Rationale This study in s ubjects with R/R aggressive B -NHL will provide an opportunity to further define blinatumomab’s safety and efficacy profile in this population. The single-agent activity of blinatumomab observed in heavily pre-treated subjects as described above, coupled with the need for new agents earlier in the course of salvage treatment, provides a strong rationale for testing blinatumomab in this setting. 2.4 Clinical Hypotheses (Phase 3) Administration of blinatumomab to subjects with aggressive B -NHL following suboptimal response to standar d platinum -containing S1 chemotherapy will increase the CMR rate and OS. 3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN 3.1 Study Design This is a phase 2 /3 open label, multicenter trial testing blinatumomab monotherapy for the treatment of subjects with R/R aggressive B-NHL not achieving CMR after standard platinum -based chemotherapy regimens administered as S1. In the phase 3 part of the study, blinatumomab will be compared to IC chemotherapy. This study incorporates multiple i nterim analyses for futility, efficacy, and unblinded sampl e-size re-estimation, described further in Section 10.4.1. The primary endpoint for both the phase 2 and 3 components of this trial is CMR rate, determined during the first 12 weeks after initiation of blinatumomab or after initiationof IC chemotherapy for phase 3 . Subjects with R/R aggressive B-NHL and considered by the investigator to be transplant eligible, but dependent upon the response to S2, will be enrolled after a minimum of 2 cycles of platinum -based S1 chemotherapy or if with PMD after 1 cycle of platinum -based S1 chemotherapy .

However, enrollm ent may not occur until the PET/CT results are centrally reviewed and interpreted. Subjects who experience clinical evidence of progression following at least 1 cycle of platinum -based S1 chemotherapy may be eligible but will require pre-S1 imaging and post-S1 PET/CT scan to confirm progression and to establish a new baseline for subsequent response assessment. In the phase 2 component, enrolled subjects will receive blinatumomab monotherapy. In the phase 3 component, enrolled subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to blinatumomab or IC chemotherapy. Randomization will be stratified according to the following criteria: Response to S1 chemotherapy (P MR vs no metabolic response [NMR ]/ progressive metabolic disease [PMD]) Cytarabine administered in S1 (eg, R -DHAP and R -ESHAP vs R -ICE and R -GDP) Primary Mediastinal B- Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) and B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma vs all other histologies of aggressive B -cell lymphoma Subjects in the phase 2 and subjects randomized to blinatumomab in phase 3 will receive a single 70-day cycle, with a total of 56 days of blinatumomab continuous infusion of 7 days at 9 µ g/day, 7 days at 28 µg/day, and 42 days at 112 µg/days, followed by a treatment-free period of 14 days . Response will be assessed by central review of a PET/CT within 12 weeks of initiation of blinatumomab. In phase 3 , subjects randomized to the IC arm will receive no more than 3 cycles (maximum cycle length 28 days) of S2 chemotherapy prior to response assessment. For phase 3 , investigator choice of S2 chemotherapy regimens will be designated as the control arm of the study. S2 chemotherapy requirements are provided in Section 6.3.1. Any change in the chemotherapy regimen prior to or without objective evidence of disease progression will be scored as treatment failure.

Blinatumomab will be supplied as single-use glass injection vials as a sterile, preservative -free, white to off-white, lyophilized powder for reconstitution and admi nistration by intravenous ( IV) infusion. Each vial contains blinatumomab with additional excipients and buffers including citric acid monohydrate, trehalose dihydrate, lysine hydrochloride and polysorbate 80, pH 7. To prepare blinatumomab for IV infusion, the lyophilized powder is reconstituted with sterile water for injection. The reconstituted solution is added to an infusion bag containing 0.9% NaCl and a product- specific stabilizer (IV Solution Stabilizer). The IV solution stabilizer functions to prevent adsorption of blinatumomab to surfaces of the infusion components . The IV Solution Stabilizer is supplied in a single -use glass injection vials as a sterile, preservative-free, clear, colorless -to-slightly -yellow liquid concentrate. Sterile water for injection and supplies required for reconstitution and injection of blinatumomab will not be provided to clinical sites. For information surrounding the use of a continuous infusion pump, refer to Section 6.7. 6.2.1 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule Blinatumomab will be administered by continuous IV infusion . A cycle of blinatumomab is 70 days and includes treatment 56 days of treatment, followed by a 14-day treatment-free interval. The initial blinatumomab dose is 9 µ g/day, and is escalated stepwise to 28 µg/day on day 8 and then 112 µg /day on day 15 until the completion of therapy, barring any dose modifications . Optional Cycle 2 blinatumomab consists of a 28 day cycle of blinatumomab continuous infusion admini stered 7 days at 9 µg/day, 7 days at 28 µ g/day, and 14 days at 112 µg/day. The dosing schedule is described in the study schema in Figure 1 for phase 2 and Figure 2 for phase 3. The dose, start and stop date/time, and lot number of the protocol -specified therapy are to be recorded on each subject’s eCRF. Response should be assessed 14 (+ 3) days after completion of blinatumomab infusion. Chemotherapy should not be administered within the 14-day treatment-free interval Approved"

Nurses/physicians trained in emergency medicine should be available for immediate intervention in case of complications . See Section 6.2.2.1 regarding monitoring following dose interruptions . 6.2.1.2 Outpatient Dosing After a subject meets the minimum criteria for in patient administration and monitoring as described in Section 6.2.1.1, and if a subject is deemed stable by the investigator, continuation of blinatumomab infusion may continue as an outpatient. See Section 6.2.2.1 regarding monitoring following dose interruptions . In the outpatient setting, either the subject will return to the study center for changes of infusion bags or the subject will be visited by a well -trained ambulant/home care service provider at specific intervals to change the infusion bag. The subject and the ambulant/home care provider will be trained and will receive written instructions for storage of the IV bags. For the ambulant/home care provider , study -specific requirements and recording of source documentation must be completed before any study -related tasks are started. A comprehensive list of all home care services, including but not limited to the storage, handling, and administration of blinatumomab as well as mandatory procedural and data collection requirements will be separately provided in a home health care manual. Following each visit, this information will be documented on the ambulant/home care services visit worksheet and forwarded to the investigator. In case of any adverse event in the outpatient setting, the ambulant/home care provider should directly contact the investigator at the study center for further management. Any unexpected or unusual events as well as any deviations will be communicated promptly to the investigator. The ambulant/home c are professionals provide 24 hour emergency on-call service.

The daily blinatumomab dose may be up to 10% lower or higher in order to account for possible pump inaccuracies. A dose of up to 10% higher than the intended dose may not require specific intervention. In case of overdose or medication error, the infusion should be immediately stopped. Consultation with the Amgen medical monitor is strongly recommended for prompt reporting of clinically apparent or laboratory adverse events possibly related to overdosage. Consultation with the Amgen medical monitor is also strongly recommended even if there are no adverse events, in order to discuss the minimal duration of dose interruption. If the overdose results in clinically apparent or symptomatic adverse events or additional adverse events, the subject should be followed carefully until all signs of toxicity are resolved and the adverse event/s should be recorded/reported per Section 9.

Note that radiotherapy to previously bulky sites of disease that upon response assessment, remains metabolically inactive (Deauville ≤ 4) will not be counted as an event. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be administered if the investigator deems the subject to be at high risk of CNS relapse. Evidence of CNS disease will be reported as relapse or progression. • Immunotherapy other than blinatumomab • Chronic systemic ( > 7 days) high-dose corticos teroid therapy (dexamethasone > 24 mg/day or equivalent) • Any other immunosuppressive therapies (except for transient use of corticosteroids for ≤ 7 days ) • Any other investigational agent Following last response assessment and prior to trial enrollment, subjects are prohibited from receiving additional chemotherapy. The Exclusion Criteria in Section 4.1.2 describe other medications that are prohibited in this study. 6.10 Contraceptive Requirements 6.10.1 Female Subjects Femal e subjects of childbearing potential must agree to practice true sexual abstinence (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for an additional 48 hours after the last dose of protocol -required therapies. Acceptable methods of effective contraception include: Hormonal ( combined estrogen and progestogen or progesterone-only hormonal contraception given via oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, or implantable route); Intrauterine device; Approved"

A female condom is not an option because there is a risk of tearing when both partners use a condom . The reliability of true sexual abstinence must be evaluated by the investigator and be the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. If a female subject is suspected of being pregnant, the protocol -required therapies must be stopped immediately and may not be resumed until absence of pregnancy has been medically confirmed. Females not of childbearing potential are defined as: Any female who is has had a hysterectomy, OR bilateral salpingectomy, OR bilateral oophorectomy, OR are post-menopausal . A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternativ e medical cause. (A high follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy [HRT]. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient). Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study . Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to practice sexual abstinence or use an acceptable method of effective contraception during the treatment and for an additional 48 hours after the last dose of blinatumomab. Acceptable methods of contraception include: • Combined (estrogen and progestogen) or Progestogen-only hormonal methods given via oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, or implantable route) • Intrauterine device • Intrauterine hormonal -releasing system Approved"

The reliability of sexual abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.) • Double barrier method: the male uses a condom and the female may choose either a cervical cap, diaphragm, or contraceptive sponge with spermicide (A female condom is not an option due to the risk of tearing when both partners use a condom.) Additional medications given during treatment with blinatumomab may alter the contraceptive requirements. These additional medications may require female subjects use highly effective methods of contraception and for an increased length of time. In addition, male subjects may also be required to use contraception. The investigator is to discuss these contraceptive changes with the subject. 6.10.2 Male Subjects Male subjects are not required to use birth control during treatment with blinatumomab. However, the subject should let his female partner know he is in the study. 6.10.3 Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control for Female Subjects Birth control methods that are considered unacceptable in clinical trials include: periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method. 7.

It is very important to attempt to perform study procedures and obtain samples at the precise timepoints stipulated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5 to Table 9 ). When it is not possible to perform the study visit at the exact timepoint, the visit may be performed within the acceptable visit windows if applicable. Any missed visits, tests not done, or examinations that are not conducted must be reported as such on the e CRFs . Subsequent study visits should resume on the original schedule. Missed assessments at prior visits should not be duplicated at subsequent visits. Details regarding each type of procedure are provided in subsequent sub -sections. Refer to the applicable supplemental central laboratory, IVRS, IPIM, and study manuals for detailed collection and handling procedures. Refer to the eCRF completion guidelines for data collection requirements and documentation of study assessments/procedures. Confirmation that the most current IRB/IEC -approved ICF has been signed should occur before any study -specific procedures are performed. All subjects who are enrolled and receive blinatumomab or undergo study -specific procedures should be reconsented with any updated versions of IRB /IEC-approved ICFs during study participation as applicable and per institutional guidelines. 7.2.1 Screening, Enrollment and/or Randomization The screening period is up to 28-days . Screening procedures are to be completed during the screening period at time points designated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5 ). Informed consent must be obtained before completing any study -specific procedures . Procedures that are part of standard of care are not considered study -specific procedures and may be performed before the informed consent and used to determine eligibility (as described in Section 4.1 ), but must be done within the timeframe as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5 ). Randomization is described in Section 5.1. After written informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened to assess eligibility for study participation. If a subject has not met all eligibility criteria at the end of the 28-day window, the subject will be registered as a screen failure. Subjects who screen fail may be eligible to rescreen 1 additional time. Approved"
59,page_59,"Product: Blinatumomab Protocol Number: 20150292 Date: 07 May 2019 Page 60 of 115 CONFIDENTIAL All screening procedures must be performed within 28 days of day 1 (ie, 28 days of the start of treatment with study drug), unless otherwise noted. Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible to be enrolled in the study. See Section 6.9 regarding treatments prohibited during screening. 7.2.2 Rescreening Subjects who are unable to complete or meet eligibility at the initial screening will be permitted to rescreen 1 time, provided study recruitment has not closed. Re-screen subjects must first be registered as screen failed in IVRS and subsequently registered as re-screened . Subjects will retain the same subject identification number assigned at the original screening. Upon signing a new ICF, a new 28-day screening window will begin. Procedures completed during prior screening may be included in the rescreening eligibility criteria provided that they occur within the timeframe as specified in the schedule of assessments. 7.2.3 Treatment Subjects satisfying eligibility requirements will be enrolled into the treatment period and should receive the first dose of blinatumomab or IC chemotherapy on day 1 of the study . Visits and procedures will occur per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 6 , Table 7 , and Table 8 ) during the treatment period. 7.2.4 Safety Follow -up Visit (s) For phase 2 and phase 3 , all subjects , including subjects who withdraw from treatment early, will complete a safety follow -up visit a pprox imately 30 (± 3) days after their last dose of blinatumomab or 30 (± 3) days or after the last day of the last cycle of IC chemotherapy . In the event that a planned cycle of therapy is delayed beyond 30 days, then the safety follow -up may be delayed without a protocol deviation. However, in the event that therapy is not resumed, the subject should be seen for safety follow -up as soon as possible. For subjects proceeding to HSCT, the safety follow -up visit must be conducted before the initiation of the transplant conditioning regimen. If a subject starts a new anti -lymphoma treatment within 30 (± 3) days of their last dose of protocol -assigned therapy, a safety follow -up visit should be conducted immediately prior to starting any new treatment, including HSCT conditioning regimens . The procedures performed at the safety follow -up visit are listed in Table 9 will be performed. Approved"

For those subjects who have received blinatumomab and who have not undergone prior HSC mobilization, HSC mobilization may commence after PET/CT restaging. Mobilization should be with colony stimulating factors (ie G-CSF or GM -CSF alone) and should not be preceded by chemotherapy (chemomobilization) or done in planned conjunction with another mobilizing agent, such as plerixafor. As an example, G -CSF may be administered at 10 µg/kg/day for at least 5 days until the completion of apheresis. The target cell dose is dictated by institutional standards, but should be no less than 2 x 10 6 CD34+ cells/kg . Failure to achieve that dose will be designated as not successful on the appropriate eCRF. For subjects randomized to IC S2 in phase 3 , the timing of mobilization is determined according to the S2 protocol chosen by the investigator. Additional chemotherapy or planned plerixafor should not be used in the initial mobilization attempt. Leukapheresis may commence according to local standards . If peripheral blood leukocyte and/or CD34+ cell counts are insufficient to initiate leukapheresis, subjects may receive plerixafor in the initial mobilization or undergo other rescue mobil ization, including chemomobilization or bone marrow harvest. Mobilization that requires plerixafor or additional chemotherapy will be designated as not successful on the appropriate eCRF. 7.2.6 HSCT Subjects may be referred for HSCT after primary endpoint assessment at the discretion of the treating inves tigator, regardless of response. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant Conditioning Status eCRF must be completed for all subjects to indicate whether an HSCT conditioning regimen was initiated within 30 days of first response assessment. Transplant types (autologous vs allogeneic), conditioning regimens, etc. are at the discretion of the investigator or site. Approximately 100 days after HSCT, the center will complete an HSCT summary document and/or the appropriate eCRF. For subjects receiving autologous HSCT, about the following information will be collected: • Conditioning regimens • Number of cells infused (CD34+ /kg) on day 0 • Date of neutrophil engraftment (first day that ANC > 0.5 x 10 9/L for 3 consecutive days) Approved"

Study completion will occur once 236 death events for phase 3 subjects have occurred or 12 months since last subject in phase 3 is randomized if 236th death in phase 3 subjects is not observed. If the study will not continue for the phase 3 portion, study completion will occur when the last phase 2 subject has had the opportunity to complete their 2 year follow -up visit after treatment. Should a subject fail to return to the clinic for a scheduled protocol visit or neglect to participate in a scheduled follow up telephone call, sites will need to make 3 attempts to contact subjects by a combination of telephone and mail. Sites must document all 3 attempts to contact the subject. If a subject does not respond within 1 month after the third contact, the subject will be considered lost to follow -up.The procedures and tests listed in Table 9 will be performed during the long-term follow up. Subjects will allow Amgen continued access to medical records so that information related to subjects’ health condition, including disease status and overall survival, may be obtained. Approved"

In oncology, there is particular interest in the molecular changes underlying the oncogenic processes that may identify cancer subtypes, stage of disease, assess the amount of tumor growth, or predict disease progression, metastasis, and responses to IP or protocol -required therapies . Amgen may attempt to develop test(s) designed to identify subjects most likely to respond positively or negatively to blinatumomab using the blood and bone marrow samples collected as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments. Biomarker development may be pursued by the use of advanced biochemical analyses such as proteomic methods, ribonucleic acid transcript profiling and DNA sequencing. Refer to the laboratory manual for detailed collection and handling procedures for all biomarker development samples. 7.6 Optional Pharmacogenetic Studies If the subject consents to the optional pharmacogenetic portion of this study, DNA analyses may be performed. A peripheral blood cell pellet will be collected at the time of plasma separation for genomic DNA isolation. Frozen plasma and cell pellets will be shipped to a central laboratory for high throughput sequencing. These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or responsiveness to the therapies used in this study . Genomic DNA will be isolated from non-malignant as well as tumor tissue in order to determine if genetic polymorphisms in the tumor sample are tumor -associated or germline mutations. At present, there is no plan to perform targeted analysis of non-tumor associated genes in order to identify predictors of efficacy, toxicity, or to understand drug metabolism . No additional samples will be collected for pharmacogenetic studies . 7.7 Sample Storage and Destruction Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assess ments (Table 5 through Table 9 ) can be analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study subjects. This includes testing to ensure analytical methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study.

Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to the samples for the study. Results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality . If informed consent is provided by the subject, Amgen can do additional testing on remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the disease under study, DLBCL, the dose response and/or prediction of response to blinatumomab, characterize antibody response, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites). Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study. Samples can be retained for up to 20 years. Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the treatment course, the results of biomarker development, or other exploratory studies are not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties, except as specified in the informed consent. The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by contacting the investigator. Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining samples (eg, blood, tumor) and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed. Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed. However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by Amgen.

The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record. The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition or underlying disease (eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome than expected. A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study , is not considered an adverse event. If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Event eCRF. Approved"

D eath due to disease progression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor type ( eg, R/R indolent NHL). Note: The term “disease progression” should not be used to describe the disease related event or adverse event. An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device. Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device. The investigator’s clinica l judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed from treatment due to an adverse event. In the event a subject, or subject’s legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapies or the study due to an adverse event, refer to Section 8.1 for additional instructions on the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or the study . 9.1.3 Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a Disease Related Event as defined in Section 9.1.1): • fatal • life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) • requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • congenital anomaly/birth defect • other medically important serious event A disease related event blood and lymphatic system disorders or investigations are to be reported as a serious adverse event if: • the subject’s pre-existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would consider typical for a patient with the same underlying condition, or • if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the investigational medicinal product(s)/protocol -required therapies and the event, • and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria.

If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”. Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix A for drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention. If the criteria for grade 4 in the CTCAE grading scale for laboratory event differs from the regulatory criteria for serious adverse events , it is left to the investigator ’s judgement whether to report these grade 4 abnormalities as serious adverse events. 9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures 9.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Disease Related Events The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all Disease Related Events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after the first dose of investigational medicinal product(s)/study treatment/protocol -required therapies through the safety follow -up visit are recorded on the Event CRF as a Disease Related Event. Disease Related Events assessed by the investigator to be more severe than expected and/or related to the investigational medicinal product(s)/study treatment/protocol -required therapies, and determined to be serious, must be recorded on the Event CRF as Serious Adverse Events . Additionally, the investigator is required to report a fatal Disease Related Event on the Event CRF. 9.2.2 Adverse Events 9.2.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That Do Not Meet Serious Criteria The i nvestigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur from the first dose of IP through the safety follow -up visit are reported using the Even t CRF.

This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity (eg, protocol -required therapies), and/or procedure”? The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a change from the subject’s baseline values. All grade 3 and grade 4 laboratory values should be recorded as adverse events . In addition, if signs or symptoms are associated with a laboratory abnormality, the signs/symptoms and the laboratory abnormality should all be recorded as adverse events.

Subjects who are alive and did not have progression will be censored at the last date of tumor assessment. • DOR : calculated only for subjects who achieve an OR. The duration will be calculated from the date a response, CMR or PMR, is first achieved per central review during the first 12 weeks after starting blinatumomab until the earl iest date of a disease assessment indicating a relapse event or death, whichever occurs first. Subjects who do not have a relapse event will be censored on their last disease assessment date. If the last disease assessment date is after the date that tri ggers the analysis, the subject will be censored at the analysis trigger date. A sensitivity analysis will censor subjects who receive a HSCT at the time of HSCT unless there is no assessment after the HSCT, in which case the last assessment prior to the HSCT will be used as the censoring time.

Subjects not experiencing events that of interest for time-to-event endpoints (eg, deaths for OS) will be censored according to rules to be detailed in the statistical analysis plan. 10.2 Sample Size Considerations 10.2.1 Phase 2 The sample size for the phase 2 part of the study is determined by a 1-sample test of the rate of CMR during the first 12 weeks after initiation of blinatumomab. With the 1-sided type I error rate ( α) set at 0.025, a null hypothesis response probability (π0) of 15%, and an alternative response probability (π1) of 40% , a sample size of 36 subjects will provide 90% power to reject the null hypothesis that the response probability is no more than 15% . Being able to make this determination will represent evidence of clinical activity and warrant advancement into the phase 3 part of the study. 10.2.2 Phase 3 The primary endpoint is CMR. A CMR r ate of 22% in the IC arm vs. 40 % in the blinatumomab arm is hypothesized. The odds ratio of CMR rate will be tested at the 1-sided significance level of 0.025.

The sample size is adjusted for 3 interim futility analyses when 25%, 50% , and 75% of the subjects have had the opportunity to complete the tumor assessment and 1 interim efficacy analysis when 75% of the subjects have had the opportunity to complete the tumor assessment. The interim futility boundaries will use a Lan-DeMets beta-spending approach to an O’Brien-Fleming boundary and the interim efficacy boundaries will use a Lan-DeMets alpha-spending approach to an O’Brien-Fleming boundary. The details of these interim analyses are specified in the Section 10.4.1. Overall survival is a key secondary endpoint and the study is also powered for overall survival . If the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint is rejected, then OS will also be tested at a 1 -sided significance level of 0.025. Assuming the true hazard ratio is 0.65 a final OS analysis after 236 death events will provide 90% power. With a median survival time of 4.4 months in the IC arm vs. 6.7 months in blinatumomab arm , accrual rates of 14.5 subjects per month, a 5% drop-out rate per year, and a targeted sample size of 296 randomized subjects , it is estimated that the 236th event will occur within 26 months of the start of randomization. Sample size re-estimation will be allowed at an interim analysis (see Section 10.4.1). 10.3 Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Amgen or Designees Blinded individuals will not have access to unblinded information until the study is formally unblinded. Unblinding and potentially unblinding information should not be distributed to the study team, investigators or subjects prior to the study being formally unblinded (eg, the formal unblinding may occur at the final analysis rather than during the primary analysis) except as specified (eg, Sect ion 10.4.1 and Section 9.2.2.2). 10.4 Planned Analyses 10.4.1 Interim Analyses Table 12. specifies the timing of planned phase 3 analyses for C MR and OS.
