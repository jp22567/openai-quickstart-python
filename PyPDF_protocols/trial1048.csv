Data from clinical trials with macitentan 10 mg were reviewed, identifying cases where macitentan 10 mg was administered concomitantly with dual CYP3A4 / CYP2C9 inhibitors, such as fluconazole and amiodarone. The review indicated that co - administration of fluconazole or amiodarone with macitentan was not common (between 1-3% of patients). No safety concerns were identified with concurrent administration of fluconazole or amiodarone and macitentan 10 mg. A Pro tocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table for current amendment is provided below."

As we are adding on a new group of forbidden therapy during the study , it will not necessarily apply to subjects who are already well managed on such an ongoing combination. 5.2.5 Forbidden concomitant therapy; 13 References A new reference was added to Section 5.2.5 and updated in the reference list.

Secondary objectives To ev aluate the effect of macitentan 10 mg as compared to placebo on: • Quality of life • Daily physical activity • Worsening of heart failure Other objectives Other objectives are described in Section 2.3. DESIGN A prospective, multi -center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel-group design Phase 2b study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either macitentan or placebo. Treatment allocation will be stratified by NT-proBNP l evel (< 1000 pg/mL and ≥ 1000 pg/mL) at macitentan run -in entry. PERIODS Screening period: Lasts up to 30 days; st arts with the signature of the Informed Consent F orm at Visit 1 and ends prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment at Visit 2. Run-in period: 9-week run- in period consisting of a single- blind placebo run- in of 4 weeks, followed by a single- blind macitentan run-in of 5 weeks."

The macitentan run -in starts with the administration of the first dose of macitentan at Visit 4 and ends with the subject ’s randomization at Visit 6. Double -blind t reatment period: The double -blind treatment period consists of 2 phases: Core phase: The double -blind core phase will last for 24 weeks. It starts with the administration of the first dose of double- blind study treatment and end s on the day before Visit 11 (Week 24). Subjects who are still in the core phase at the time of global protocol V ersion 6 approval will end treatment at 24 weeks and will not proceed to the extension phase [see Section 3.1.1.8]. Extension phase: The double -blind extension phase will last for 28 weeks. It starts on the day of V isit 11 (Week 24) and ends on the day of last study treatment intake. Subjects who are in the extension phase at the global protocol Version 6 approval will return for an EOT visit within 60 days, but no later than Week 52. Post-treatment observation period: Subjects who prematurely discontinue double -blind st udy treatment (core or extension phase) will be asked to enter a post -treatment observation period (PTOP), which ends 52 weeks after randomization. The PTOP starts with visit PTOP1, which corresponds to the safety follow -up visit. Thereafter, visits are scheduled at Week 24 (PTOP2), Week 36 (PTOP3) and Week 52 (PTOP4), depending on time point of premature discontinuation. Subjects who have not completed Week 24 at the time of global protocol V ersion 6 approval, will end PTOP at 24 weeks (PTOP2) [see Section 3.1.1.8] . Safety follow -up period: The safety follow- up period starts on the day after the last dose of study treatment and ends 30 days thereafter with the End -of-Study (EOS) visit, or PTOP1 visit for those subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment."

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all s ubjects randomized to double-blind study treatment. The Per -protocol Analysis Set comprises all randomized subjects who received double-blind study treatment and who complied with the protocol sufficiently to allow a reliable assessment of the treatment effect on the primary efficacy endpoint. The Safety Set includes all subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind study treatment. Primary efficacy variable The primary efficacy variable is the percent of baseline in NT-proBNP at Week 24. For subjects without available NT -proBNP value at Week 24, the last available value observed before Week 24 will be carried forward and considered for the main analysis. Percent of baseline is calculated as the ratio of the Week 24 NT-proBNP value over baseline value, expressed in percentage. Null and alternative hypotheses Due to the underlying log- normal distribution of the primary efficacy variable, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be applied on log-transformed data. The null hypothesis is tha t macitentan and placebo effects on NT-proBNP are the same. The alternative hypothesis is that the effect of macitentan on NT -proBNP differs from placebo effect. The null hypothesis will be tested by a 2- sided Wald test with a 2-sided significance level of 0.10. Primary statistical analysis The main analysis will be performed on subjects of the FAS, according to the intent -to-treat principle.

The treatment effect expressed as geometric means ratio and its associated 90% 2 -sided confidence interval (CI) will be estimated based on the same model by inversely transforming , using the exponential function, the Least Squares Mean and 90% CI obtained in log scale. Key secondary efficacy variables The three key secondary efficacy variables will be tested using a hierarchical testing approach to address multiplicity concern. The change from baseline to Week 24 in KCCQ clinical summary score and accelerometer -assessed physical activity will be analyzed by means of an ANCOVA adjusting for the variable baseline value and for the log of the ratio: baseline NT-proBNP over NT -proBNP value as per IRT . Least Squares Estima tes within each treatment group and between treatment groups will be displayed along with 90% 2 -sided CIs and p - values.

Sample size A number of 300 randomized subjects is adequate to detect a geometric means ratio of 0.75 (macitentan over placebo, −0.288 in log scale) corresponding to a 25% improvement with a power of 80% and a type I error of 0.10 2-sided, when considering a standard deviation of 1 in log scale and using the Wald test. The critical value expressed as geometric means ratio is 0.83. Following closure of Screening on 27 December 2019, it is expected that approximately 140 subjects will be randomized. With the same assumptions as above for the reduced sample size of 140, the critical value expressed as geometric means ratio is 0.76.

The two ET -1 receptors, ET A and ET B, have unique binding locations and affinities for the endothelin peptide [ Benigni 1995, Massaki 1998]. The ET A receptors are expressed on pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas ET B receptors are present on endothelial, epithelial, endocrine and nerve cells. When activated, the ET A receptors located in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells mediate a potent vasoconstrict ive response, and ET B receptors on endothelial cells mediate vasodilatation via increased production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin [ Hirata 1993, de Nucci 1988]. ET-1 is also known to be a potent mitogen, with the ability to induce cell proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells. It has been shown that both the ET A and E TB receptors mediate the mitogenic action of ET -1 [Clarke 1989 , Chua 1992, Davie 2002, Sugawara 1996]. The endothelin system has been shown to be activated in chronic heart failure (CHF) , among other neurohumoral systems, such as the sympathetic and R AAS [ Jessup 2003]. Plasma big ET -1 and ET -1 levels were found to be elevated and inversely correlated with clinical and hemodynamic measures of prognosis in patients with CHF, including patients with sta ble CHF [ Kiowski 1995, Pacher 1996, Wei 1994, Parker 2004, Hulsmann 1998]. Big ET -1 and C -terminal pro -ET-1 have been shown to independently predict mortality and morbidity in CHF [ Masson 2006, Jankowska 2011]. In nonclinical studies in animal models of experimental heart failure (HF) treatment with dual or ET A selective antagonists significantly improved left ventricular dysfunction, prevented ventricular remodeling and prolonged survival [ Cowburn 2001, Wada 1997 ]. Several endothelin receptor antagonist (ERAs ) have been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics, exercise capacity, functional status, and clinical outcome in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH ) and are approved for PAH treatment [Galiè 2015] ; however, ERAs tested in acute and chronic HF have not consistently shown clinical benefit and new studies are warranted [ Kaoukis 2013]. 1.1 Indication HF is a common, disabling and potentially fatal condition, which is the leading cause of hospitalization in persons over 65 years of age. HF is a major public health issue, with an estimated prevalence of over 5.8 million in the USA, and over 23 million worl dwide [Bui 2011, McMurray 1998]. Approximately 1 % to 2% of the adult population in the developed countries has HF, and rising to ≥ 10% among persons of 70 years of age or older [McMurray 2012, Mosterd 2007]."
33,page_33,"Macitentan / ACT-064992 HFpEF and pulmonary vascular disease Protocol AC -055G202 / SERENADE Version 7 16 July 2020, page 34/144 EudraCT 2016 -003653 -15 Doc No D- 20.252 CONFIDENTIAL – FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S . 34 In the USA, projections show tha t the prevalence of HF will increase 46% from 2012 to 2030, resulting in > 8 million people ≥ 18 years of age with HF. It is estimated that 870,000 new cases of HF are diagnosed every year in the USA. The incidence of HF is nearly 10 per 1000 population over 65 years of age. Nearly 300,000 deaths occur annually that are directly attributable to HF [ Mozaffarian 2015 ]. The estimated prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) among all HF patients ranges from 40% to 71% in different studies [Bishu 2013, Oktay 2013, Bui 2011, Brouwers 2013, Tiller 2013 ]. With increasing prevalence in recent years, HFpEF may become the predominant form of HF in the coming decades [ Oktay 2013]. HFpEF has been variably classified as ejection fraction > 40%, > 45%, > 50%, and ≥ 55%. The criteria proposed to define the syndrome of HFpEF include a) clinical signs or symptoms of HF; b) evidence of preserved or normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); and c) evidence of abnormal left ventricular (LV ) diastolic dysfunction (the filling of the left heart) that ca n be determined by Doppler echocardiography or cardiac catheterization [Vasan 2000]. HFpEF seems to have a different epidemiological and etiological profile from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [ McMurray 2012]. Patients with HFpEF are predominantly elderly, more likely to be female than m ale, and have a high prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease ( CAD) , diabetes mellitus, obesity, anemia, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ Bishu 2013, Oktay 2013, Bui 2011, Borlaug 2014]. Dysfunction of the right ventricular -pulmonary vascular unit is a common entity in HFpEF and i s recognized to confer poor outcomes in these patients, including increased HF hospitalization and higher overall cardiovascular mortality. Right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) develops in response to elevated afterload and pulmonary vascular dysfunction, and is evolving to be a significant modifier of both natural history and prognosis in patients with HFpEF. The prognostic significance of RVD in HFpEF has been shown to be independent of, and additive to, the severity of pulmonary hypertension ( PH) [Zakeri 2015b] and was the strongest predictor, more predictive than severity of PH, of death in 96 HFpEF patients [ Melenovsky 2014]. 1.2 Study treatment(s) Macitentan (ACT -064992, Opsumit®) is an orally active, non -peptide, potent d ual endothelin ET A and ET B ERA which has been approved for the treatment of PAH. ERAs are being developed for a variety of diseases associated with the deleterious effects of ET, particularly in the pulmonary and cardiovascular fields. For detailed information on macitentan, pleas e see the most recent version of the macitentan Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) [Macitentan IB]."

In contrast to HFrEF, there is no approved therapy for HFpEF patients despite several attempts to mitigate the diastolic dysfunction through blockade of the RAAS, beta blockade and phosphodiesterase- 5 (PDE -5) inhibitors [ Yancy 2013, Shah 2013, Pfeffer 2015]. Today, HFpEF patients, particularly those with associated PH, are empirically treated for their underlying condition (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) and with diuretics for fluid retention. The HFpEF population presents a high prevalence of comorbidities that are associated with increased ET -1 production, e.g., sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity and age. Nonclinical studies demonstrated that ERAs were effective in preventing or attenuating the cardiovascular compl ications (hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, renal failure, cardiac remodeling) of these risk factors [Mulder 1976, Maczewski 2000, Belaidi 2009, Iglarz 2008]. Cardiac remodeling can be attributed in part to ET -1, based on its known profi brotic and hypertrophic properties [ Schwarz 2002]. Recent preliminary data demonstrated efficacy of ET receptor blockade with macitentan on LV remodeling without significantly affecting systemic blood pressure (BP) [Richard V , et al. Actelion data on file; Sam 2015] . Taken together, these data suggest that dual ET receptor blockade can directly improve LV remodeling, and especially decrease fibrosis, leading to an improvement of the filling capacity of the left ventricle. Most studies with ERAs did not demonstrate clinical benefit in chronic HF ; treatment with ERAs has been associated with fluid retention, which may worsen HF symptoms [B-166849, B-02.005, D-05.036, Lüscher 2002, Anand 2004, Abraham 2001]. Treatment with ERAs has been also associated with increased incidence of edema in PAH patients [Aversa 2015] . However, in patients with HFpEF, treatment with sitaxentan for 6 months significantly increa sed exercise tolerance as measured by treadmill time. There was no significant difference in the overall occurrence of adverse events (AEs) between sitaxentan and placebo, while peripheral edema was reported for 19.7% and 15.6% in the sitaxentan and placeb o groups, respectively, over 6 months of treatment [ Zile 2014]. In a Phase 2 exploratory study in 63 subjects with combined post - and pre -capillary pulmonary hypertension (CpcPH) , AC-055G201/MELODY-1 [ Vachiéry 2018] , the main composite safety endpoint , i.e., the proportion of subjects experiencing either significant fluid retention (defined as an increase in body weight due to fluid overload by≥ 5kg or ≥ 5%, or intravenous (i.v.) administration of diuretics) or a worsening in New York Heart"
35,page_35,"Macitentan / ACT-064992 HFpEF and pulmonary vascular disease Protocol AC -055G202 / SERENADE Version 7 16 July 2020, page 36/144 EudraCT 2016 -003653 -15 Doc No D- 20.252 CONFIDENTIAL – FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S . 36 Association ( NYHA) functional class (FC) up to End-of-T reatment (EOT) , was more frequently met in the macitentan group: 7 subjects on macitentan (23%) compared to 4 subjects on placebo (13%). Occurrence of edema was observed early in the course of this trial in patients treated with macitentan and was generally well managed by diuretic enhancement. The occurrence of a fluid retention ev ent was more frequent in the macitentan group (6.4%) compared to the placebo group (1.6%) during the first 4 weeks from the start of study treatment, while it was similar in both treatment groups beyond 4 weeks of study treatment (5.1% on macitentan versus 4.8% on placebo). This observation suggests that the susceptibility to fluid retention manifested early and stabilized over time. A higher number of subjects on macitentan experienced at least one serious adverse event (SAE ) (11 subjects [35%] on macitentan; 6 subjects [18.8%] on placebo), discontinued study treatment prematurely (7 subjects [22.6%] on macitentan; 4 subjects [12.5%] on placebo), or were hospitalized for worsening of HF (5 subjects [16.1%] on macitentan; 2 subjects [6.3%] on placebo). This difference was driven by the subjects who met the main safety point. Although the MELODY -1 study was not powered to assess the efficacy of macitentan, the improvements observed in c ardiac output (CO) (Hodges -Lehmann’ s median treatment difference of 0.6 L/min, 95% confidence limit [CL ] 0.20, 1.10 at Week 12) and n- terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro- BNP ) (23% reduction compared to placebo at Week 12) may indicate a potential benefit with macitentan in the explored indication. The results of the study also showed that the hemodynamic characteristics of subjects with CpcPH included in the MELODY -1 study are similar to those with HFpEF and pulmonary vascular disease, therefore macitentan may present a potential benefit for subjects with HF , specifically HFpEF and pulmonary vascular disease with or without overt RVD where by the increased right ventricular afte rload could be mitigated by ERA treatment. The purpose of this present study is to confirm the MELODY -1 findings on NT -proBNP and evaluate whether favorable findings from this earlier study translate into a clinically meaningful benefit in a subset of HFpEF patients with pulmonary vascular disease and who tolerate macitentan lending support for the further development in this indication. 1.4 Summary of known and potential risks and benefits The results of the MELODY -1 study have shown that treatment with mac itentan reduces NT-proBNP, a marker reflecting cardiac load and LV wall stress, and improves CO. These findings suggest that macitentan may have a bene ficial effect in subjects with HFpEF and pulmonary vascular disease. However, the MELODY-1 results also showed an increased incidence of fluid retention events which led to worsening of HF in the macitentan group [Section 1.3]. The timing of these event s suggests that fluid retention under macitentan therapy manifests early and stabilize s over time. To mitigate adverse effects caused by fluid retention, the study contains a placebo run -in phase to ensure that subjects are stable"

It was planned that a pproximately 300 subjects would be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either macitentan or placebo. Treatment allocation will be stratified by NT -proBNP level at macitentan run -in entry. The study is being conducted in 77 sites in 17 countries. Following closure of Screening on 27 December 2019, it is expected that approximately 140 subjects will be randomized [see Section 3.1.1.8]. 3.1.1 Study periods The study comprises the following consecutive periods. 3.1.1.1 Screening period Lasts up to 30 days; starts with the signature of the Informed Consent F orm (ICF) at Visit 1 and ends prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment at Visit 2. 3.1.1.2 Run-in period The run-in period consists of 2 parts: a placebo run- in and a macitentan run -in. The run- in period starts with a single -blind placebo run- in of 4 weeks which starts with administration of the first dose of placebo at Visit 2 and ends on the day before Visit 4 (macitentan run -in start). The placebo run- in is followed by a single -blind macitentan run -in of 5 weeks, which starts with administration of the first dose of macitentan at Visit 4 and ends with the subject ’s randomization at Visit 6. 3.1.1.3 Treatment period The double-blind treatment period consists of 2 phases: Core phase: The double -blind core phase will last for 24 weeks. It starts with the administration of the first dose of double -blind study treatment and ends on the day before Visit 1 1 (Week 24). The main aim of the core phase is to determine the 24 -week effect of macitentan on the primary efficacy endpoint, NT- proBNP . Subjects who are in core phase at the time of global protocol version 6 approval, will end treatment at 24 weeks and will not proceed to the extension phase of the study [see Section 3.1.1.8]."

It starts on the day of V isit 1 1 (Week 24) and ends on the day of last study treatment intake. The main aim of the e xtension phase is to collect further morbidity and mortality data. Subjects who are in the extension phase at the global protocol Version 6 approval will return for an EOT visit within 2 months, but no later than Week 52. 3.1.1.4 Post-treatment observation perio d Subjects who prematurely discontinue double -blind study treatment (core or extension phase) will be asked to enter a post -treatment observation period (PTOP), which ends 52 weeks after randomization. The PTOP starts with visit PTOP1, which corresponds to the safety follow -up visit. Thereafter, visits are scheduled at Week 24 (PTOP2), Week 36 (PTOP3) and Week 52 (PTOP4), depending on time point of premature discontinuation. If the safety follow -up visit (PTOP1) falls within the time -window of any of the other PTOP visits, then the corresponding PTOP visit and the safety follow -up visit can be combined. The assessments that are performed at each visit are described in the visit and assessment schedule [ Table 4] for subjects entering the PTOP. Subjects who have not completed Week 24 at the time of global protocol Version 6 approval, will end the PTOP at Week 24 (PTOP2) . Subjects who are past Week 24 at the time of consenting to global protocol Version 6 will return for an EOT visit within 2 months but no later than Week 52 and will then proceed to enroll in the OL study, if eligible, or complete EOS, if not eligible to enter SERENADE OL [see Section 3.1.1.8]. 3.1.1.5 Safety follow -up period The safety follow -up period starts on the day after the last dose of study treatment and ends 30 days thereafter with the End-of- Study (EOS) visit, or PTOP1 visit for those subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment. The visit schedule and protocol -mandated procedures will be performed according to the table of assessments [ Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4] and are described in Section 7. 3.1.1.6 End-of-Study EOS is reached when the safety follow -up period or, if applicable, PTOP have been completed. For an individual subject, the study is completed with the EOS visit, which is either Visit 14 (safety follow -up visit) for subjects who completed the treatment period as per protocol, or PTOP4 for subjects who prematurely discontinued study treatment. 3.1.1.7 SERENADE OL extension ( study AC-055G203) Subjects who remained in SERENADE (main study) for 52 weeks afte r randomization may be eligible for transition to the SERENADE OL study. Subjects who consented to global protocol Version 6, are eligible to transition to SERENADE OL if they remained in the main study for at least 24 weeks [see Section 3.1.1.8] ."

The reason for treatment discontinuation to be recorded in the eCRF for these subjects will be ‘sponsor decision’ , unless an additional reason led to discontinuation of study treatment (e.g., AE). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment will remain in PTOP up to Week 24 (PTOP 2) and may transition to SERENADE OL if the eligibility criteria are met. Subjects who are past PTOP2 at the time of consenting to global protocol V ersion 6 will return for an EOS visit within 60 days but no later than Week 52 and may transition to SERENADE OL at this timepoint, if the eligibility criteria are met.

Current practice guidelines are aimed at treating fluid retention, aggressively controlling hypertension, and treating comorbid conditions that contribute to decompensation. In this study, subjects are allowed to stay on their usual HF treatment ; therefore , the addition of a placebo arm to the standard -of-care is considered acceptable.

Inclusion of a placebo group is the only way to reliably interpret the potential effect of macitentan on f luid retention. A placebo -controlled trial conducted in a randomized and double- blind fashion also provides the most rigorous method for evaluating the efficacy and safety of a medical treatment. 3.2.2 Placebo - and macitentan treatment run -in period Studies with ERAs in HF have consistently shown issues with fluid retention. These events were more frequently observed early in the course of these studies, i.e., mainly within 4 weeks of treatment initiation [D-16.139, B-02.005, Mann 2010, Bakris 2010]. The early timing of fluid related AE s and HF exacerbation observed with ERAs in HF studies is not unique to this class of compounds. The b eta-blocker carvedilol , for example, has been known to worsen HF in up to 44% of patients during the initiation of therapy [ Krum 1995]. To mitigate these risks, some HF trials have employed a pre -randomization run- in period to exclude subjects who do not tolerate or do not respond to the study drug or are noncompliant [ ANZ 1995 , SOLVD 1991, Packer 1996, McMurray 2013]. Accordingly, the aim of introducing a placebo - and a macitentan run -in period in this study is thus to maximize the number of randomized subjects able to tolerate macitentan. The run -ins will also serve to exclude noncompliant subject s as medication noncompliance is a notorious precipitant of fluid decompensation in HF patients. Placebo run- in period: Subjects who are not on optimal diuretic therapy may be more prone to developing fluid retention. During the placebo run- in period, which lasts for 4 weeks, the clinical stability of the subject will be established. If necessary, HF or other cardiovascular medications may be adapted to optimize treatment. The subjects must be on stable HF- and/or cardiovascular therapy for at least 1 week immediately prior to entering the macitentan run-in. Macitentan run -in period: The purpose of the macitentan run- in is to identify and exclude subjects who are unable to tolerate macitentan as per criteri a defined in Section 4.5, based on investigator judgment. Dose adjustment of oral diuretics and other cardiovascular medications is allowed, provided that the subje ct remains on stable therapy for at least 1 week immediately prior to randomization. The macitentan run- in will last for 5 weeks. 3.2.3 Rationale for the post- treatment observation period In order to comply with the intent- to-treat principle, subjects who premat urely discontinue study treatment will be followed until Week 52 to collect information pertaining to hospitalization and mortality [see Section 3.1.1.8 ]."

Results from MELODY -1 are in line with other studies with other HF treatments which have shown that the effect on NT-proBNP occurs early, i.e., within 12 weeks after start of treatment [Solomon 2012, Rosenberg 2008]. As wall stress is the mechanical stimulus influencing BNP release, the improvement in NT -proBNP is expected to be attained by 24 weeks, reflecting improvements in cardiac structural remodeling which are likely to start manifesting by this time. Therefore, a study duration of 24 weeks is considered to be sufficient to observe an effect on NT -pro- BNP. A treatment duration of 24 weeks is also considered to be sufficient to assess a change in key secondary endpoints such as daily physical activity and quality of life. Originally , the double-blind treatment duration was 52 weeks in order to allow for an estimation of the potential effect size on morbidity and mortality for a potential Phase 3 study in this indication. However, due to early termination of recruitment and consequently reduced sample size, the number of WHF events is expected to be too low f or a meaningful analysis of time to WHF. Furthermore, the primary endpoint (change in NT -proBNP) and the key secondary endpoints of KCCQ clinical summary score and change in physical activity assessed by accelerometry are all assessed at Week 24. Therefore, the double-blind treatment duration was reduced to 24 weeks [see Section 3.1.1.8]. 3.3 Study committees An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) has overall responsibility for safeguarding the interests of subjects by monitoring the benefit -risk ratio and making appropriate recommendations based on all the reported data and thus ensuring that the study is being conducted with the highest scientific and ethical standards. The IDMC will be fully operational prior to enrollment of the first subject into the study. The composition and operation of the IDMC is described in the IDMC charter. An Independent Statistical Analysis Center (not otherwise involved with study conduct or statistical analysis) will have exclusive access to the randomization list and will generate the monitoring reports exclusively for review by the IDMC. Both a S cientific Advisory Board and a Steering Committee are involved in the study design and will be consulted prior to and during the study for relevant medical issues and study publications."

The subjects must have signs and symptoms of HF requiring treatment with at least 1 diuretic of any type, and they must be in NYHA FC II or III. In ord er to assess the effect of macitentan on the physical activity of subjects, subjects must be ambulatory (i.e., subjects in NYHA FC IV are excluded). To minimize the number of screening failures, it is recommended to only screen subjects who have had the diagnosis of HFpEF confirmed by a previous echocardiography. Eligible subjects must be able and willing to give informed consent for participation in the clinical study. 4.2 Rationale for the selection of the study population The improvements in CO and NT-proBNP observed in MELODY -1 [see Section 1.3] indicate a potential benefit of macitentan in subjects with CpcPH due to left ventricular dysfuntion ( LVD) . ERAs have been previously tested in HFrEF and have not consistently shown clinical benefit [Kaoukis 2013 ]. As subjects with HFpEF comprised the majority of the MELODY -1 population, macitentan may present a potential benefit for this indication with a high unmet need due to lack of approved therapies. Similarly to HFrEF, RVD may accompany HFpEF and this phenotype portends a poorer prognosis, including higher HF hospitalization rate, cardiovascular mortality, and all -cause mortality, irrespective of severity of PH or comorbid conditions [ Zakeri 2015a ]. In the subset of HFpE F patients with secondary RVD, increased right ventricular afterload could be mitigated by ERA treatment. A decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR) with macitentan is expected to alleviate right ventricular (RV) burden and consequently improve RV-pulmonary artery coupling. ERAs, including macitentan, demonstrated efficacy and are generally well tolerated in subjects with PAH with a varied degree of RVD. In a Phase 3 study in subjects with PAH (AC-055- 302 / SERAPHIN), macitentan reduced the risk of a morbidity or mortality event, improved exercise capacity, WHO FC and pulmonary hemodynamics , and reduced NT-proBNP, compared to placebo. In SERAPHIN, the presence of clinical signs of RVD did not negatively impact the treatment effect of macitentan. On the contrary, the treatment"
45,page_45,"Macitentan / ACT-064992 HFpEF and pulmonary vascular disease Protocol AC -055G202 / SERENADE Version 7 16 July 2020, page 46/144 EudraCT 2016 -003653 -15 Doc No D- 20.252 CONFIDENTIAL – FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S . 46 effect of macitentan on the morbidity/mortality endpoint was greater in subjects with signs and symptoms of right HF (or mean right atrial pressure [mRAP ] ≥ 12 mmHg) at baseline . Subjects with a more pronounced degree of RVD had an overall higher morbidity/mortality event rate. It is currently unclear whether macitentan would be beneficial in patients with pulmonary vascular disease associated with advanced left heart disease, as i ncreased PVR could be a protective mechanism against blood overflow in the lungs. This mechanism is thought to be the cause of early aggravation of patients with left HF who received epoprostenol [Califf 1997 ]. However, p ost hoc analyses conducted for a subset of SERAPHIN PAH patients with clinical traits compatible with a possibility of concomitant LVD reported a similar treatment effect compared to the overa ll SERAPHIN PAH population on the primary morbidity/mortality efficacy endpoint, as well as the combined endpoint of death and hospitalization due to PAH, and a similar effect on 6- minute walk test, without specific safety concerns in this patient subset. Similarly, patients with PAH and LV dysfunction in the AMBITION study with ambrisentan did not differ from the selected PAH population on the primary efficacy endpoint [ Galiè 2015]. Subject selection in AC -055G202 is aimed to identify subjects with HFpEF and associated pulmonary vascular disease with and without overt RVD and tolerating macitentan, which will optimize evaluation of potential efficacy of macitentan as assessed by NT -proBNP, symptom burden and patient related outcomes in a Phase 2 study over 52 weeks of treatment. 4.3 Inclusion criteria For inclusion in the study, all of the following inclusion criteria must be fulfilled at Screening.

One tablet must be taken orally once a day. Macitentan doses of 3 mg and 10 mg were investigated in the AC -055-302 / SERAPHIN study in subjects with PAH [ Pulido 2013] . Based on the results of this trial, macitentan, at both the 3 mg and 10 mg doses, decreased the risk of a morbidity/mortality event over the treatment period versus placebo. A dose -response was identified, with the greatest efficacy demonstrated in the 10 mg dose group. Macitentan was well tolerated in this subject population.

No differences were observed between macitentan and placebo on fluid retention (edema). For more detailed informa tion, see the macitentan IB [Macitentan IB]. Based on these results, a dose of 10 mg was selected for the AC -055G201 / MELODY -1 study in subjects with CpcPH due to LVD. In M ELODY -1, an improvement in CO and NT-pro- BNP was observed. The safety observations were consistent with the known safety profile of macitentan in other populations, and no new safety signal was detected. Therefore, a dose of macitentan 10 mg was selected as the dose for study AC-055G202. 5.1.2 Study treatment administration The first intake of study treatment will take place at site, during Visit 2 (start of the placebo - run-in). Thereafter, one tablet must be taken orally every morning irrespective of food intake. The subjects must be instructed not to take study treatment in the morning of study visit days. After all study assessments have been performed, a tablet from the newly dispensed bottle is taken (except at Visit 3, where the study treatment is taken from the bottle dispensed at V isit 2). If a dose has been missed, the subject must be instructed to take it as soon as possible on the same day, and to take the next dose at the regular time. The subject must be instructed not to take 2 doses to make up for a m issed dose. 5.1.3 Treatment assignment After informed consent has been signed, the investigator/delegate contacts the Interactive Response Technology system (IRT) at Visit 1 (Screening) to obtain a subject number. In case of re -screening, the subject number attributed at the time of first screening will also be used for the re- screened subject. At Visit 2 (start of the placebo run -in), after having confirmed the eligibility of the subject, the investigator/delegate contacts the IRT to receive the bottle number for the placebo run - in period. At the end of the placebo run- in period (Visit 4), after having confirmed the eligibility of the subject, the investigator/delegate contacts the IRT to obtain the bottle numbers for the macitentan run -in. At the end of the macitentan run -in (Visit 6, Randomiz ation), after having confirmed the eligibility of the subject, the IRT is contacted again by the investigator/delegate to randomize the subject. The IRT assigns a randomization number to the subject and assigns bottle number(s), which match the treatment arm assigned by the randomization list to the randomization number."

At EOT, the IRT is contacted to r egister the visit. The randomization list is generated by an independent Contract Research Organization (CRO), Almac Clinical Technologies, using SAS® version 9.3. Treatment allocation will be stratified by NT -proBNP level ( ≤/> 1000 pg/mL) prior to administration of the first dose of macitentan; i.e., the NT -proBNP value measured at macitentan run -in entry will be used. If the NT -proBNP value at macitentan run- in entry is not available, the NT -proBNP value measured at V1 (Scre ening) will be used instead . NT-proBNP is chosen as a stratification variable as it is associated with many other factors that determine outcome such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease . 5.1.4 Blinding 5.1.4.1 Single-blind run-in period The placebo - and macitentan run -in periods will be performed in a single -blind fashion, i.e., only the subject is blinded to the identity of the treatment. The investigator and site staff must exercise caution when discussing the study proc edures and study treatment with the subject to keep the subject blinded to the identity of the study treatment. 5.1.4.2 Double-blind treatment period After randomization of the subject, the study will be performed in a double -blind fashion. The investigator and st udy personnel, the subjects, the Clinical Research Associates (CRAs), Actelion personnel, and CRO personnel involved in the conduct of the study will remain blinded to the study treatment until study closure. Actelion personnel responsible for clinical stu dy supply distribution will need to be unblinded to ensure adequate supply of study treatment. These persons will be clearly identified, their unblinding will be documented in the trial master file and they will not take part in any Clinical Trial Team (CTT) meetings after study set -up has been completed. Until the time of unblinding for final data analysis, the randomization list is kept strictly confidential, and accessible only to authorized persons (i.e., Global Quality Management [GQM] , independent sta tistical analysis center and Clinical Trials Supplies Group) who are not involved in the conduct of the study. The investigational treatment and its matching placebo are indistinguishable, and will be packaged in the same way."

Unblinded SUSAR information will be provided to respective health authorities and independent ethics committees (IECs) or institutional review board (IRBs) only. SUSARs will be reported to investigator s in a blinded fashion. 5.1.5.4 Emergency procedure for unblinding The investigator, study personnel and Actelion personnel must remain blinded to the subject’ s treatment assignment. The identity of the study treatment may be revealed only if the subject experiences a medical event, the management of which would require knowledge of the blinded treatment assignment. In this case, the investigator can receive the unblinded treatment assignment through the IRT. In these situations, the decision to unblind resides sol ely with the investigator. Whenever it is possible, and if it does not interfere with (or does not delay) any decision in the best interest of the subject, the investigator is invited to discuss the intended unblinding with Actelion personnel. The occurrence of any unblinding during the study must be clearly justified and explained by the investigator. In all cases, Actelion personnel must be informed as soon as possible before or after the unblinding. The circumstances leading to unblinding must be documented in the Investigator Site File (ISF) and CRF. 5.1.6 Study treatment supply Manufacture, labeling, packaging, and supply of study treatment will be conducted according to Good Manufacturing Practice, Good Clinical Practice (GCP ), and any local or national regulatory requirements .

It is to be recorded by site personnel on the study -treatment dispensing and accountability log and in the CRF, and checked by the CRA during site visits and at the end of the study. The study treatment accountability log in the CRF will include at least the following information for each study treatment bottle dispensed to the subject: • Dispensed bottle number (s) • Date dispensed / number of bottles dispensed • Date returned / number of tablets returned All study treatment supplies, including partially used or empty bottles must be retained at the site for review by the CRA. If the subject forgets to bring the remaining study treatment to a study visit, he/she mus t be instructed to not take any tablets from the remaining study treatment bottle and to return it at the next visit. 5.1.7.2 Study treatment compliance Study tr eatment compliance is based on study treatment accountability.

During the stu dy, compliance is expected to be between 80% and 120%. Compliance values outside of this range will be considered as a protocol deviation, which will be reported in the CRF by the CRA. The investigator or delegate must discuss the non-compliance with the subject to clarify the reasons and to take appropriate actions to avoid reoccurrence. This discussion and its outcome must be documented in the source documents. 5.1.8 Study treatment dose adjustments and interruptions Study treatment dose adjustments are not permitted. Study treatment may be temporarily interrupted in response to an AE, a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, a laboratory abnormality, or for administrative reasons. Study- specific criteria for interruption of study treatment are described in S ection 5.1.10. If study treatment is interrupted by the subject for any reason, she/he must immediately inform the investigator. Interruptions of s tudy treatment must be kept as short as possible. If treatment is stopped for more than 4 consecutive weeks, re -introduction is not permitted, and treatment must be permanently discontinued [see Section 5.1.9]. Study treatment interruptions must be recorded in the CRF. 5.1.9 Premature discontinuation of study treatment The decision to prematurely discontinue study treatment may be made by the subject, the investigator, or Actelion personnel. The main reason and whether discontinuation of study treatment is the decision of the subject (e.g., tolerability - or efficacy -related), the investigator (e.g., due to pre -specified study treatment discontinuation crite ria, an AE or lack of efficacy), or Actelion (e.g., study terminated) must be documented in the CRF. Refer to Section 3.1.1.8 for guidance on reporting the reason for study treatment discontinuation of subjects who consented to global protocol Version 6. A subject has the right to prematurely discontinue study treatment at any time, without any justification, by withdrawal from study treatment only or by withdrawal from any further participation in the study (i.e., premature withdrawal from the study [see Section 8.2]). Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason for prematurely withdrawing from the treatment or the study, it is recommended that the investigator makes a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject’ s rights."

Study- specific criteria for discontinuation of study treatment are de scribed in Section 5.1.10. A subject who prematurely discontinues study treatment is NOT considered as withdrawn from the study and will be asked to enter a PTOP which lasts until Week 52, provided that the subject ’s consent for this limited participation in the study has not been withdrawn. (The duration of PTOP for subjects who consented to global protocol Version 6 is described in Section 3.1.1.8.) The subject will be asked to return for an EOT visit within 7 days after taking the decision to stop study treatment and for a safety follow -up visit 30 (+5) days after the last intake of study treatment (PTOP1). At the premature EOT visit, the assessments described for the regular EOT visit (V isit 13) are to be performed [ Table 1]. If the premature EOT - or safety follow -up visit falls within the time -window of any of the PTOP visits, the visits can be combined. A subject who prematurely discontinues study treatment and withdraws consent to participate in any further study assessments is considered as withdrawn from the study. Subjects who die or are lost to follow -up are also considered as withdrawn from the study. Withdrawal from the study and follow -up medical care of subjects withdrawn from the study is described in Sections 8.2 and 8.4, respectively. Subjects who choose not to enter or complete the PTOP but who did not withdraw consent [see definition in S ection 8.2] will be contacted by telephone at Week 52 (+/−14 days) by the site, and their vital status will be recorded in the CRF. This does not apply to subjects who consented to global protocol V ersion 6. 5.1.10 Study -specific criteria for interruption / premature discontinuation of study treatment 5.1.10.1 Liver aminotransferase abnormalities Interruption of study treatment Study treatment must be interrupted in the following cases: • Aminotransferases (i.e., ALT and /or AST) ≥ 3 and < 8 × ULN Perform a re -test of aminotransferases (ALT and AST), total and direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase within one week.

The advice of a hepatologist is recommended. Interruptions must be for less than 4 consecutive weeks; longer interruptions must lead to permanent discontinuation of study treatment. Liver aminotransferase levels must then be checked within 3 days after re-introduction, then again after a further 2 weeks and thereafter according to the recommendations in Section 7.2.4 (i.e., at monthly intervals). Permanent discontinuation of study treatment Study treatment must be stopped and its re -introduction is not to be considered in the following cases: • Aminotransferases ≥ 8 × ULN • Aminotransferases ≥ 3 × ULN and associated clinical symptoms of liver injury, e.g., nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, unusual lethargy or fatigue, flu-like syndrome (arthralgia, myalgia, fever) • Aminotransferases ≥ 3 × ULN and associated increase in total bilirubin to ≥ 2 × ULN Perform a re -test of aminotransferases (ALT and AST), total and direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Aminotransferases, total and direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels must be monitored weekly after study treatment discontinuation until values return to pre- treatment levels or within normal ranges. Other diagnoses (e.g., viral hepatitis, mononucleosis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, alcoholic hepatitis, non- alcoholic st eatohepatitis, autoimmune disease) and/or etiologies (e.g., hepatic toxicity of concomitant medication[s] or other substances) should be considered and ruled out by performing the appropriate tests. All liver aminotransferase abnormalities leading to study treatment interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as AEs [see Section 9 ]. 5.1.10.2 Hemoglobin abnormalities Hemoglobin abnormalities leading to ru n-in failure are described in S ection 4.5. If there is a decrease in hemoglobin from baseline 10 of > 20 g/L during the run- in or double- blind treatment period, a re -test must be performed within 10 days, with additional laboratory evaluations that may include, but are not limited to, any of the following: 10 Baseline hemoglobin refers to the last hemoglobin value obtained prior to the start of the placebo run-in."

If hemoglobin remains > 20 g/L bel ow baseline value at subsequent visits, further re -tests are to be performed as per investigator ’s judgment. This work- up should not result in study treatment interruption or discontinuation, unless clinically mandated based on the investigator’ s judgment, or in the following situation : A decrease in hemoglobin to < 80.0 g/L, a decrease in hemoglobin from baseline of > 50 g/L, or the need for transfusion must result in temporary interruption of study medication, except during the run -in period where the subject must be permanently discontinued. Re -introduction of study medication can be considered if hemoglobin recovery, defined as a return of hemoglobin to within 20 g/L of the baseline value, is achieved. Study treatment interruptions exceeding 4 consecutive weeks must lead to permanent discontinuation of study treatment. 5.1.10.3 Initiation of prohibited medications Study treatment must be permanently discontinued if any other investigational treatments are started during the treatment period. Treatment with strong CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors and PAH specific drugs as detailed in Section 5.2.5 must lead to interruption of study treatment for the duration of thei r administration. Re -initiation of study treatment can be considered if the interruption does not exceed 4 consecutive weeks. 5.2 Previous and concomitant therapy 5.2.1 Definitions A previous therapy is any treatment for which the end date is prior to signing of in formed consent. A therapy that is study -concomitant is any treatment that is ongoing or initiated after signing of informed consent, or initiated up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation. A therapy that is study treatment- concomitant is any trea tment that is either ongoing at the start of study treatment or is initiated during the treatment period."

The generic name, start/end dates of administration (as well as whether it was ongoing at start of treatment and/or EOS), route, dose, and indication will be recorded in the CRF. 5.2.3 Auxiliary medicinal products All subjects must be on oral diuretic therap y (any type). On the day of the study visit , subjects will be requested to withhold their morning dose of diuretic(s) until after the blood sampling. 5.2.4 Allowed concomitant therapy Subjects are allowed to continue with their usual HF therapy. However, HF or other cardiovascular medications must be administered at a stable dose for at least 1 consecutive week prior to entering the macitentan run -in (Visit 4) and prior to Randomization (Visit 6). For subjects with a SBP > 150 mmHg, treatment with antihypertensives according to local guidelines [e.g., ESC Guidelines 2013, James 2014] to achieve their target BP is recommended. After the start of the double -blind treatme nt period, the investigator is encouraged to keep the subject ’s cardiovascular medications stable, unless a change is required for medical reasons. Any change has to be recorded in the CRF as described in Section 5.2.2. 5.2.5 Forbidden concomitant therapy The following concomitant medications are forbidden within 1 month prior to S creening and up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation : • PAH- specific drug s (ERAs, prostanoids, PDE -5 inhibitors, guanylate cyclase stimulators ). • Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin/rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentin, St. John ’s wort ). • Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, and saquinavir) or moderate dual CYP3A4/CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole, amiodarone) or co- administration of a"

Initiation of ENTRESTO® (sacubitril/valsartan) is forbidden during the core phase of the double- blind treatment period . 6 STUDY ENDPOINTS 6.1 Efficacy endpoints 6.1.1 Primary efficacy endpoint • Percent of baseline NT -proBNP assessed at Week 24 . Rationale: NT-proBNP is one of the best established cardiovascular response markers among all available surrogates in HF. Changes in this marker may reflect reduction in cardiac load and LV wall stress and reductions in NT -proBNP have been associated with improved outcomes in HF [Januzzi 2013, Grewal 2008]. NT -proBNP is a suitable endpoint for a Phase 2b, non- registration study in this indication, provided it is accompanied by an improvement in symptom burden and/or patient related outcomes (key secondary endpoints) and well characterized cardiovascular safety. NT -proBNP is simple to assess, it allows shorter study duration. Percent change in NT -proBNP was the most objective endpoint in MELODY -1 (decrease in NT -proBNP of 13% compared to placebo af ter 8 weeks of treatment with 10 mg macitentan once daily, and a further decrease to 23% compared to placebo after 12 weeks) despite a relatively small sample size in MELODY -1 and without minimum natriuretic peptide level requirement at study entry. This e ffect was commensurate with increased CO without increases in PAWP or HR . In addition, NT-proBNP has been used as the primary endpoint in a study in HFpEF (PARAMOUNT study [ Solomon 2012]) of similar size and duration as s tudy AC -055G202. As wall stress is the mechanical stimulus influencing BNP release, the maximum improvement in NT -proBNP is expected to be attained by 24 weeks, reflecting improvements in cardiac structural remodeling which are likely to manifest by this time."
63,page_63,"Macitentan / ACT-064992 HFpEF and pulmonary vascular disease Protocol AC -055G202 / SERENADE Version 7 16 July 2020, page 64/144 EudraCT 2016 -003653 -15 Doc No D- 20.252 CONFIDENTIAL – FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S . 64 Therefore, a study duration of 24 weeks is considered to be sufficient to observe an effect on NT-pro- BNP. The statistical method used to analyze the primary efficacy variable takes into account the expected underlying log normal distribution of NT -proBNP [ Solomon 2012]. As a consequence, the treatment effect will be tested on a log -scale using a classical general linear model for normally distributed variables and expressed, on the original scale , as the ratio between treatment groups of the geometric means of individual percent of baseline at Week 24 (macitentan over placebo). As a consequence, the primary endpoint is defined for each subject as percent of baseline at Week 24 . 6.1.2 Key secondary efficacy endpoints • Change from baseline to Week 24 i n the clinical summary score (as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]). • Change from baseline to Week 24 in accelerometer -assessed proportion of time spent in light to vigorous physical activity based on a threshold of > 100 activity counts per minute. • Time to WHF event over 52 weeks. Rationale for the choice of key secondary endpoints : The effect on NT -proBNP needs to be accompanied by improvements in clinically relevant measures, such as quality of life, functional capacity, and delay in first occurrence WHF. The KCCQ is a valid, reliable and responsive health status measure for patients with CHF and may serve as a clinically meaningful outcome in cardiovascular (CV) clinical research, patient management and quality assessment [ Green 2000]. The HF symptoms and physical limitation domains scores show the best the correlation for improvements following a CHF exacerbation [ Green 2000]. Thus, the key secondary endpoint is t he clinical summary score (mean of physical limitation and total symptoms scores) of the KCCQ at 24 weeks. All other domains will be analyzed as other endpoints, as the instrument will be administered in its entirety. Patients with chronic HF are character ized by a poor exercise tolerance prohibiting them to manage activities of daily living without limitation [Belardinelli 1999 ]. The amount of daily physical activity, as well as the intensity with which this habitual activity is performed seems important in determining functional capacity and disease severity. Accelerometer-assessed activity is a novel end point, that provides high -density quantitative data from continuous assessment of physical activity in the real -life setting, enabling a more detailed analysis of activity. With accelerometry, “ every step counts ” as ubiquitous walking associated with daily living seems to play a contributing role in terms of clinical prognosis. Physical activity assessed by accelerometer is significantly associated with exercise"

Accelerometry circumvents limitations of “ targeted walking” assessed by measures such as the six -minute walk test which provides an intermittent evaluation of submaximal exercise capacity and which therefore can underestimate the true burden of HF . Accelerometry has already been used in HF studies. The NEAT -HFpEF study represents the first study within a dedicated HFpEF population to use accelerometer -assessed physical activity as a primary end point [Redfield 2015]. Recent studies in patients with HFrEF have demonstrated correlations between accelerometer data and N YHA FC, six-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ), peak oxygen consumption, and estimated (Seattle Heart Failure Model) or observed mortality risks. Studies have also shown increases in accelerometer -assessed activity after cardiac resynchronization therapy, confirming its ability to reflect therapeutic response [ Zakeri 2015a ]. Validity, analytic issues, and compliance with externally worn accelerometer devices have been addressed in clinical trials for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among whom age and activity level are likely comparable with elderly patients with HFpEF [Lores 2006 , Hecht 2009, Jehn 2011b]. In addition, physical daily activity assessed by accelerometry has been shown to correlate with 6MWD in adult PAH patients and is significantly lower in patients with WHO FC III/IV as compared to WHO FC I/II [Pugh 2012, Ulrich 2013 ]. WHF event is defined as an event that includes HF death, W HF hospitalization or an urgent WHF visit during which a subject exhibits new or worsening symptoms of HF, has objective evidence of WHF, and receives initiation or intensification of HF treatment [ACC/AHA 2015 ]. Accurate recognition of WHF events is important as they are associated with the poor outcomes and societal burden. The 2015 ACC/AHA definition s of a HF eve nt and a HF death will ensure accurate and consistent reporting of W HF events during the study, independent of whether the exacerbation of HF results in hospitalization, recognizing that exacerbation of HF can often be managed on an outpatient basis such a s with an urgent or unscheduled outpatient office/practice or emergency room visit [ACC/AHA 2015 ]. Using a standardized definition of a WHF event is particularly important in a global clinical trial, as standard -of-care may significantly differ across participating countries and sites. For the purposes of this study, HF death is included in the defin ition of W HF, in order to ensure that relevant fatal events without preceding hospitalization or an urgent/unscheduled/emergency visit are also captured . 6.1.3 Other efficacy endpoints • Number of days alive and out of the hospital (DAOH) assessed over 52 weeks"

Subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment or withdraw consent from further participation in the study will not be replaced. 7.1.1 Screening/re- screening Screening starts with the first screening assessment. The date of the first screening assessment corresponds to the date of the Screening visit. It is the responsibility of the investigator/delegate to obtain written informed consent from each subject participating in this study after adequate face -to-face explanation of the objectives, methods, and potential hazards of the study. The subjects who agree to participate in the study and the investigator/delegate must sign the ICF prior to any study- related assessment or procedure. Subjects who are in Screening when the enrollment target has been met may still be randomized. It is permitted to re- screen subjects twice , if the reason for non- eligibility is transient (e.g., abnormal laboratory test, insufficient wash -out period of a forbidden medication). All screening assessments except pulmonary function tests ( PFTs ) must be repeated at the time of re -screening. If the screening echocardiography was done within 2 months of the re-screening visit, it does not need to be repeated. 7.1.2 Unscheduled visits Unscheduled visits may be performed at any time during the study. Vital signs (BP and HR) and body weight will be measured at each unscheduled visit and recorded in the CRF. In addition, concomitant medications and AE s will be recorded, as applicable. Depe nding on the reason for the unscheduled visit (e.g., AE), appropriate assessments (including laboratory assessments as necessary) will be performed based on the judgment of the investigator and the results will be recorded in the CRF. After an unscheduled visit, the regular scheduled study visits must continue according to the planned visit and assessment schedule. 7.1.3 EOT and EOS in case of transition to the SERENADE OL study The SERENADE OL enrollment visit is combined with Visit 11 (Week 24) or the EOT visit, and the EOS (safety follow -up) visit of the main study will not be performed. In case the EOT - and SERENADE OL enrollment visit cannot be combined, subjects will enter the safety follow -up period in the main study. In this scenario, the EOT visit of the main study and the SERENADE OL enrollment visit will be 2 separate visits. The transition to SERENADE OL occur s within 30 days of the intake of the last dose of double- blind study treatment, and the EOS visit w ill not be performed. If transition within"

The assessments that are mandatory during a visit are marked with an ‘X’ . All study assessments are performed by qualified study personnel (medical, nursing, or specialist technical personnel) and are recorded in the CRF, unless otherwise specified. Study assessments performed during unscheduled visits will also be recorded in the CRF. The foll owing order of assessments (if applicable) is recommended: • KCCQ • Patient ’s global assessment (PGA) • Physical examination (including assessment of AEs/SAEs) , vital signs, NYHA FC • PFTs • ECG • Echocardiography • Blood sampling. If the Principal Investigator (PI) delegates any study procedure/assessment for a subject, e.g., ECG, echocardiography, blood sampling to an external facility, he/she should inform Actelion to whom these tasks are delegated. The set -up and oversight will be agreed upon with Actelion. The supervision of any external facilities remains the responsibility of the PI. Calibration certificates / evidence of equipment maintenance for the below -listed equipment used to perform study assessments must be available pr ior to the screening of the first subject. Calibration certificates of other equipment must be available as per local requirements. • Temperature measurement devices for study treatment storage area and freezer • Evidence of maintenance of echocardiography equipment • Body- weight scale. 7.2.1 Demographics / baseline characteristics Demographic and baseline characteristic data to be collected on all subjects include: age, sex, race and ethnicity. Previous hospitalization for HF (including date of last hospitalization) and number of HF hospitalizations in previous year will be recorded in the CRF . Relevant medical history/current medical conditions (e.g., chronic and ongoing acute conditions, serious past conditions) present before signing informed consent will be recorded on the medical history page. Where possible, diagnoses and not symptoms will be recorded."

NT -proBNP blood samples will be drawn using the central labora tory kit at the visits listed in Table 3 and Table 4. The presence of atrial fibrillation must be assessed with standard 12- lead ECGs on the day of NT-proBNP sampling, and recorded in the CRF. The subjects will be instructed to avoid high- sodium meals and to not modify their usual diet, if possible, within 3 days prior to the ir visit. Further details regarding collection, storage and shipment of the NT -proBNP blood samples are provided in the central laboratory manual. 7.2.2.2 Accelerometry The physical activity (counts/min) of the subject is assessed via accelerometer. The accelerometer is given to the subject at Visi t 2 (start of placebo run -in) and the subject will wear the device daily during waking hours until Visit 3. The period between Visits 2 and 3 is considered to be a training period, and the data collected will only be used for analysis if data collected at Visit 3 are incomplete or missing. Subsequently, the subject is instructed to wear the accelerometer for 9 consecutive days during waking hours following Visit 3, Visit 5 (macitentan run -in safety visit), Visit 8 (Week 4), and Visit 10 (Week 16), as well as for 9 consecutive days during waking hours prior to Visit 11 (W eek 24; see Section 3.1.1.8). This will allow for the inclusion of data during week days and weekend days and will provide a reliable estimate of the usual physical activity of the subject. Only data collected during these periods will be used for the analysis of physical activity. Subjects will receive a reminder from the site staff (e.g., telephone call, text message) to ensure that they are wearing the accelerometer during these periods . The subject will receive a reminder prior to W eek 24 to ensure the device is charged and ready to be wor n 9 days prior to W eek 24. The site will send the reminder to subjects to keep the device charged . The accelerometers are pre- programmed to minimize patient handling and do not display the collected data, i.e., the subjects do not have access to their activity measurements since thi s could influence their behavior . The investigator (or delegate) instructs subjects on how and when to wear the accelerometer (refer to the AC -055G202 Accelerometry Manual). The subjects return the device to the study site and the investigator (or delegate ) transfers the data to the accelerometry central lab as described in the AC-055G202 Accelerometry Manual. The central lab oratory will read daily counts/min and will analyze duration of daytime activity and time ( minutes ) spent in sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous physical activity. These data are transferred to Actelion."

A WHF event includes HF death, hospitalization or an urgent visit for W HF and is defined as follows: HF death: Death associated with clinically worsening symptoms and/or signs of HF, regardless of HF etiology ( note: deaths due to HF can have various etiologies, including single or recurrent myocardial infarctions [ MIs] , ischemic or non -ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, or valvular disease) . WHF hospitalization: • Subject is admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of HF • Length of stay is at least 24 h (or extends over a calendar date) • Subject has A, B, and C [ Table 2 and Table 4]. Urgent WHF visit: • Subject has an urgent, unscheduled office/practice or emergency department visit for a primary diagnosis of HF but is not admitted to the hospital • Subject has A, B, and C* [ Table 2 and Table 4]. *changes to oral diuretic therapy only in case of addition of high potency thiazide diuretic (metolazone, indapamide), or ≥ 100% increase in loop diuretic to a total oral dose ≥ 120 mg of furosemide equivalents/day ."

The patient global assessment and the NYHA class are assessed as described below. The reporting of HF hospitalization is described in Appendix 6. 7.2.2.4.1 Patient global assessment The PGA is a seven -point patient self- evaluation scale, which will be conducted at visits described in Table 2 and Table 4. At Visit 6 (randomization), the investigator/delegate will ask the subject how he/she feels about his/her condition at that time, and explains that he/she will be asked periodically to rate how he/she feels compared to this point in the study. Subsequently, subjects will be asked to rate how well they feel compared to Visit 6 (randomization/baseline); i.e., by indicating whether their clinical status has markedly, moderately or slightly improved, remained unchanged, or had slightly, moderately or markedly worsened since the start of the double-blind treatment period at Visit 6 . 7.2.2.4.2 NYHA FC The NYHA FC is one of the most reliable instruments for rating HF subjects ’ functionality. NYHA FC is evaluated at all scheduled visits. NYHA class Symptoms I No symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity, e.g., shortness of breath when walking, climbing stairs , etc. II Mild symptoms (mild shortness of breath and/or angina) and slight limitation during ordinary activity. III Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than ordinary activity, e.g., walking short distances (20–100 m). Comfortable only at rest. IV Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest . Mostly bedbound patients. 7.2.2.5 Echocardiography Standard 2D/Doppler echocardiography is performed at the visits listed in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 4. All echocardiographies will be submitted to a central echocardiography laboratory for evaluation of echocardiographic parameters outlined in the echocardiography imaging manual."

The LVEF, LA enlargement parameters, LV septal/posterior wall thickness, parameters of RV dysfunction (see inclusion criterion 9) measured centrally at Screening will determine the subject ’s eligibility to enter the study. If the results from the central reader cannot be awaited for logistical reasons and the locally read echocardiographic parameters meet the eligibility requirements, the subject may start the placebo run -in. However, if the locally - read results are not confirmed by the central rea ding results when they become available, the subject must be discontinued from the study as soon as possible as long as he/she is still in run -in. All efforts must be made to confirm eligibility before the subject enters the macitentan run -in. If the quali ty of the echocardiography does not allow assessment of critical measurements (i.e., measurements listed in inclusion criteria 4, 7 and 9, septal E/e ’ ratio, lateral e ’ velocity, septal e ’ velocity), it may be repeated during Screening or placebo-run- in (if the subject entered run- in at risk). All echocardiography assessment s performed for the study must be reviewed by the investigator or delegate , and appropriate action must be taken in the event of safety -related findings (e.g., reporting the finding in the medical history or as an AE). Incidental findings unrelated to HF identified by central reading will be communicat ed to the investigator who is responsible for taking appropriate action. Subjects with clinically relevant echocardiographic fi ndings unrelated to HF will be followed up until the final diagnosis is established and managed as per local medical practice. Detailed instructions on how to perform echocardiograph y and how to transfer data to the central echocardiography laboratory are provided in a separate manual. 7.2.2.6 Right heart catheterization In order to establish the diagnosis of pulmonary vascular disease, a RHC may be performed during the Screening period, if deemed necessary by the investigator. Local guidelines will be followed. 7.2.3 Safety assessments The definitions, reporting and follow -up of AEs, SAEs and pregnancies are described in Section 9. 7.2.3.1 Safety phone calls during the run-in period A safety phone call will be performed 2 weeks after the start of each run -in period (i.e., Run-in W eeks 2 and 6). During this phone call, the investigator or delegate will ask the subject if he/she experienced any signs and symptoms (e.g., increase in body weight, presence of extra fluid in the body, swelling of legs, feet and ankles, increase in dyspnea"

At interim visits, a more focused/shorter physical exam will include the examination of general appearance, heart, lungs, abdomen and extremities. If indicated, based on medical history and/or symptoms, additional exams may be performed as per investigato r’s discretion . It is recommended that evidence of pulmonary congestion is sought if clinically indicated (e.g., chest X-ray, pulmonary ultrasound). Information for all physical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the study site. The observations should be reported according to body system in the CRF as either normal or abnormal. If an abnormality is found it should be specified on the corresponding CRF page (except for abnormalities already reported on the specific signs/sym ptoms form), describing the signs related to the abnormality (e.g., fever) and not the diagnosis (e.g., pneumonia). Clinically relevant findings (other than those related to left HF and RVD) that are present prior to signing of informed consent must be rec orded on the Medical History CRF form. Significant physical examination findings made after signing of informed consent, which meet the definition of an AE [Section 9.1.1], must be recorded on the AE form of the CRF. 7.2.3.3 Vital signs Vital signs are measured at all visits. Triplicate SBP and DBP and radial pulse measurements will be measured in a supine or sitting position. It is recommended to allow the s ubject to rest for at least 5 minutes prior to the first reading, to perform the triplicate measurements at least 2 minutes apart, and to use the same device, same position (supine or sitting), same arm, same operator and appropriate cuff size throughout the study for an individual subject. 7.2.3.4 Weight and height Height will be measured at Screening for BMI calculations. Body weight will be measured at the site at all visits. It is recommended to always weigh individual subject under similar conditions, i.e., indoor clothing without shoes, same scale, similar interval between weighing and last meal."

It is recommended that the subjects always weigh themselves under similar conditions, e.g., every morning before breakfast. The subjects will receive a weight card on which body weight measurements can be recorded manually and must be instructed to bring the card along at each visit. 7.2.3.6 Pulmonary function tests Post-bronchodilator P FTs (FEV 1 and FVC) will b e performed at Screening for subjects with a known or suspected history of significant lung disease . Historical PFT data obtained within 12 months prior to Screening are accepted, provided there is evidence in the source documentation that the subject ’s pulmonary status has been stable/unchanged during this time and the results are considered to be reliable by the investigator. Predicted normal values for FEV 1 and FVC will be used to determine eligibility. Measured FEV 1 and FVC values (including historical) will be collected in the CRF. Calculated FEV 1/FVC and FEV 1 % of predicted value used by the site to assess subjects’ eligibility will also be collected in the CRF. 7.2.3.7 ECG assessment A standard 12- lead ECG is performed as indicated in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 4. The ECG will be interpreted locally, and the presence of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (i.e., atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter or sinus rhythm) will be recorded in the CRF. 7.2.4 Laboratory assessments 7.2.4.1 Type of laboratory Hematology and chemi stry tests will be performed at the visits indicated in Table 3 and Table 4. Monthly AST/ALT monitoring is recommended. A central laboratory (see central laboratory manual for contact details) will be used for all protocol- mandated laboratory tests, including re -tests due to laboratory abnormalities and laboratory tests performe d at unscheduled visits. If monthly AST/ALT monitoring in between visits is performed, a local laboratory can be used. If the local laboratory results show an increase in AST/ALT ≥ 3 × ULN, the subject must return to the site and the AST/ALT re -test must be performed centrally."

The local laboratory results (with the corresponding normal ranges) must be recorded in the CRF. At randomization, hemoglobin (run-in failure criterion , see Section 4.5) will be assessed locally to confirm eligibility of the subject. Other exceptional circumstances that will require recording of local laboratory results of the parameters listed in Section 7.2.4.2 (with correspon ding normal ranges) include hospitalization of the subject due to a medical emergency and missing central laboratory results from a scheduled or unscheduled visit. If two or more consecutive central laboratory samples are lost or cannot be analyzed for whatever reason, the investigator will collect an additional sample as soon as possible for repeat analysis, unless a local laboratory sample was collected within the same time-window and these test results are available. Central laboratory reports will be sent to the investigator. In case of specific (pre -defined) laboratory abnormalities, the central laboratory will alert Actelion personnel and the concerned site personnel. Alert flags that will trigger such notifications are displayed in Appendix 2. All laboratory reports must be reviewed, signed and dated by the investigator or delegate within 10 working days of receipt and filed with the source documentation. T he investigator/delegate must indicate on the laboratory report whether abnormal values are considered clinically relevant or not. Clinically relevant laboratory findings that are known at the time of signing of informed consent must be recorded on the Med ical History page of the CRF. Any clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities detected after signing of informed consent must be reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate [see Section 9], and must be followed until the value returns to within the normal range or is stable, or until the change is no longer clinically relevant. Details about the collection, sampling, storage, shipment procedures, and reporting of results and abnormal findings can be found in the laboratory manual. 7.2.4.2 Laboratory tests At Screening, the laboratory tests will be performed in fasted state in order to characterize the subjects in terms of their glucose levels and lipid profiles. At subsequent visits, the subjects do not need to be fasted prior to the laboratory tests. The amount of blood collected during the study from an individual subject is approximately 150 mL (10 mL for hematology/clinical chemistry, including pregnancy test , if applicable;"

During the double- blind treatment period , women of childbearing potential must perform urine pregnancy tests at home in between visits at Weeks 12, 20, 28, 32, 40, 44, and 48 in addition to the serum pregnancy test during site visits. The subjects will be provided with validated urine pregnancy tests kits by the site. The investigator/delegate will follow -up on the results of the urine pregnancy test with a tele phone call and records the result of the test in the CRF. If pregnancy is su spected during the study, a serum pregnancy test must be performed immediately. 7.2.5 Quality of life assessments The KCCQ will be completed at the visits indicated in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 4. It is recommended that the KCCQ be completed prior to any other clinical assessment or interaction with site staff to avoid potential bias in the subject ’s responses. The KCCQ is a 23 -item, self -administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self -efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. On average, it requires 4–6 minutes to complete. The KCCQ is available in a number of validated translations. The questionnaire will not be administered if it is not available in a language that can easily be understood by the subject. The paper questionnaire completed by the subject is considered to be the source document. The data from the paper questionnaire will be manually entered in the CRF by site staff. Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd has been granted a license agreement f or the use of the KCCQ. 7.2.6 Biomarkers A blood sample for analysis of additional exploratory protein biomarkers related to modulation of heart function and target engagement and markers which are important for the regulation of the fluid status will be collect ed from subjects who gave their consent for this blood sample. The biomarker ana lysis will be performed after study closure and will not be included in the study report . The aim of this analysis is to investigate t he effect of macitentan on proteins involved in the pathophysiology of HFpEF and pulmonary vascular disease, and to gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which ERAs contribute to fluid retention. Such markers may include, but are not limited to, galectin -3, co-peptin and biomarkers related to the renin -angiotensin system (additional biomarkers may be included in the analysis , if scientific rationale has become available through new research)."

This includes fluid retention15- or WHF events16 detected at regular or unscheduled study visits at the site. Blood sampling procedures, storage and shipment of the biomarker samples are described in the central laboratory manual. The biomarker samples will be transferred to an Actelion designated biobank when the study is closed and may be stored there for a maximum of 15 years. Subjects may request that these samples be destroyed at any time during or after the study. 8 STUDY COMPLETION AND POST -STUDY TREATMEN T / MEDICAL CARE 8.1 Study completion as per prot ocol A subject who completes 52 weeks of follow -up (± time-window indicated in Table 2 or Table 4) including the safety follow -up period is considered to have completed the study as per protocol , regardless of whether he/she has completed the double-blind treatment period as per protocol. Subjects who die are considered to have completed the study. 8.2 Premature withdrawal from study Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study without justification for any reason at any time. Subjects are considered withdrawn if they state an intention t o withdraw further participation in all components of the study (i.e., withdrawal of consent), die, or are lost to follow -up. If a subject withdraws consent, no further data will be collected in the CRF from the date of withdrawal onward. The investigator may withdraw a subject from the study (without regard to the subject ’s consent) if, on balance, he/she believes that continued participation in the study would be contrary to the best interests of the subject. Withdrawal from the study may also result from a decision by Actelion for any reason, including premature termination or suspension of the study. Subjects are considered as lost to follow -up if all reasonable attempts by the investigator to communicate with the individual failed. The site must take preventive measures to avoid a subject being lost to follow -up (e.g., document different ways of contact such as telephone number, home address, email address, person to be contacted in case the subject cannot be reached). If the subject cannot be reached, the site must make a reasonable effort to contact the subject, document all attempts, and enter the loss of follow -up information into the CRF. The following methods must be used: at least three telephone calls must be placed to the last availabl e telephone number and one registered letter must be sent by post 15 A fluid retention event refers to an AE related to edema or fluid overload. 16 See definition in Section 7.2.2.3 ."

Additional methods may be acceptable if they are compliant with local rules/regulations (e.g., a visit by site personnel to the subject ’s home), respectin g the subject ’s right to privacy. If the subject is still unreachable after all contact attempts listed above, he/she will be considered to be lost to follow-up. If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason, the reason (if known) for premature withdrawal from the study, along with who made the decision (subject, investigator, or Actelion personnel) must be recorded in the CRF, if known. If for whatever reason (except death or loss -to-follow- up) a subject is withdrawn from the study, the investigator should make efforts to schedule a last appointment / telephone call to assess the safety and well -being of the subject, collect unused study treatment and discuss follow -up medical care. Data obtained during this last appointment / telephone call will be recorde d in the subjects ’ medical records but it will not be collected in the CRF. The investigator must provide follow -up medical care for all subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from the study, or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care, as described in Section 8.4 . 8.3 Premature termination or suspension of the study Actelion reserves the right to terminate the study at any time globally or locally. Investigators can terminate the participation of their site in the study at any time. If the study is prematurely suspended or terminated, Actelion will promptly inform the investigators, the IECs/IRBs, and health authorities, as appropriate, and provide t he reasons for the suspension or termination. If the study is suspended or prematurely terminated for any reason, the investigator – in agreement with Actelion – must promptly inform all enrolled subjects and ensure their appropriate treatment and follow-up, as described in Section 8.4. Actelion may inform the investigator of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ interests. In addition, if the investigator suspends or terminates the study without prior agreement from Actelion, the investigator must promptly inform Actelion personnel and the IEC/IRB, and provide both with a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension. If the IEC/IRB suspends or terminates its approval / favorable opinion of the study, the investigator must promptly notify Actelion personnel and provide a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension. Any suspension or premature termination of the study must be discussed with the IDMC."

A treatment -emergent AE is any AE temporally associated with the use of study treatment (from study treatment initiation until 30 days after study treatment discontinuation) whether or not considered by the investigator as related to study treatment. AEs include: • Exacerbation of a pre- existing disease. • Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing episodic disease or medical condition. • Disease or medical condition detected or diagnosed during the course of the study even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study. • Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at study start that worsen following the signing of informed consent. • Abnormal assessments, e.g., change on physical examination, ECG findings, if they represent a clinically significant finding that was not present at study start or worsened during the course of the study. • Laboratory test abnormalities if they represent a clinically significant finding, symptomatic or not, which was not present at study start or worsened during the course of the study or led to dose reduction, interruption or permanent discontinuation of study treatment. Overdose, misuse, abuse of the study treatment and study treatment errors will be reported as an AE. 9.1.2 Intensity of adverse events The intensity of clinical AEs is graded on a three -point scale – mild, moderate, severe – and is reported on specific AE pages of the CRF."
91,page_91,"Macitentan / ACT-064992 HFpEF and pulmonary vascular disease Protocol AC -055G202 / SERENADE Version 7 16 July 2020, page 92/144 EudraCT 2016 -003653 -15 Doc No D- 20.252 CONFIDENTIAL – FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S . 92 If the intensity of an AE worsens within a study period, the worst intensity should be reported on the AE page. If the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required to be reported. If there is a worsening in intensity occurring during a subsequent study period (i.e., placebo run- in, macitentan run -in or d ouble- blind treatment period), this must be reported in the CRF. The three categories of intensity are defined as follows:  Mild The event may be noticeable to the subject. It does not usually influence daily activities, and normally does not require intervention.  Moderate The event may make the subject uncomfortable. Performance of daily activities may be influenced, and intervention may be needed.  Severe The event may cause noticeable discomfort and usually interferes with daily activities. The subje ct may not be able to continue in the study, and treatment or intervention is usually needed. A mild, moderate, or severe AE may or may not be serious [see Section 9.2.1] . These terms are used to describe the intensity of a specific event. Medical judgment should be used on a case -by-case basis. Seriousness, rather than intensity assessment, determines the regulatory reporting obligations. 9.1.3 Relationship to study trea tment Each AE must be assessed by the investigator as to whether or not there is a reasonable possibility of causal relationship to the study treatment, and reported as either related or unrelated. The determination of the likelihood that the study treatment caused the AE will be provided by the investigator. 9.1.4 Reporting of adverse events All AEs with an onset date after signing of informed consent and up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation must be recorded on specific AE pages of the CRF. 9.1.5 Follow-up of adverse events AEs still ongoing more than 30 days after study treatment discontinuation must be followed up until they are no longer considered clinically relevant or until stabilization.

It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death had it been more severe. • Requiring in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. • Resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. • Congenital anomaly or birth defect. • Medically significant: Refers to important medical events that may not immediately result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered to be SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject, and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions above. The following reasons for hospitalization are not considered as SAEs: • Hospitalization for cosmetic elective surgery, or social and/or convenience reasons. • Hospitalization for pre -planned (i.e., planned prior to signing informed consent) surgery or standard monitoring of a pre -existing disease or medical condition that did not worsen, e.g., hospitalization for coronary angiography in a subject with stable angina pectoris. However, complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs or SAEs (e.g., if a complication prolongs hospitalization). 9.2.2 Reporting of serious adverse events All SAEs occurring after sig ning of informed consent up to 30 days after study treatment discontinuation must be reported on AE pages in the CRF and on an SAE form, regardless of the investigator -attributed causal relations hip with study treatment or study- mandated procedures. An SAE is defined as related to protocol -mandated procedures if it appears to have a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship to either the study design or to"

The follow -up information obtained after the subject’ s EOS visit must be reported to Actelion Global Drug Safety, but it is not recorded in the CRF. 9.2.4 After the 30-day follow- up period New SAEs occurring after the 30- day follow -up period must be reported to Actelion Global Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator ’s knowledge of the event, only if considered by the investigator to be causally related to previous exposure to the study treatment. 9.2.5 Reporting and f ollow- up of SAEs during the PTOP All SAEs, regardless of investigator -attributed causal relationship, that occur during the PTOP period mu st be reported on AE pages in the CRF and on an SAE form. These SAEs must be followed up until resolution or stabilization, or until the event outcome is provided. The follow -up information obtained after the end of the PTOP must be reported to Actelion Global Drug Safety, but it is not recorded in the CRF. New SAEs occurring after the end of the PTOP must be reported to Actelion Global Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator ’s knowledge of the event, only if considered by the investigator to be cau sally related to previous exposure to the study treatment. 9.2.6 Reporting procedures All SAEs must be reported by the investigator to Actelion Global Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s first knowledge of the event. All SAEs must be recorded on an SAE form, irrespective of the study treatment received by the subject, and whether or not this event is considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment. The SAE forms must be sent to Actelion Global Drug Safety (contact details are provide d on the SAE form). The investigator must complete the SAE form in English, and must assess the event ’s causal relationship to the study treatment. Any relevant information from source documents regarding the SAE, e.g., hospital notes or discharge summaries, etc., must be summarized on the SAE form."

Actelion Global Drug Safety personnel may contact the investigator to obtain further information. If the subject is hospitalized in a hospital other than the study site, it is the investigator ’s responsibility to contact this hospital to obtain all SAE -relevant information and documentation. The expectedness of an adverse reaction is determined by Actelion in the reference safety information (RSI) section provided in the most recent version of the IB. Any SAE that is assessed as related and unexpected against the RSI is known as a SUSAR and must be reported by Actelion to concerned health authorities (including the EudraVigilance database if the study is conducted in Europe), IECs/IRBs and investigators. 9.3 Pregnancy If a woman becomes pregnant while on study treatment, study treatment must be discontinued. The investigator must counsel the subject and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 9.3.1 Reporting of pregnancy Irrespective of the treatment received by the subject, any pregnancy occurring after study start (i.e., sign ing of informed consent) up to 30 days following study treatment discontinuation must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator ’s knowledge of the event. Pregnancies must be reported on the Actelion Pregnancy form, which is faxed to Actelion Global Drug Safety (see contact details provided on the Pregnancy form), and on an AE page in the CRF. 9.3.2 Follow- up of pregnancy Any pregnancies must be followed up to their conclusion and the outcome must be reported to Actelion Global Drug Safety. Any AE associated with the pregnancy occurring during the follow- up period after study treatment discontinuation must be reported on separate AE pages in the CRF. Any SAE occurring during the pregnancy must be reported on an SAE form as described in Section 9.2.2. 9.4 Study safety monitoring Study safety information (AEs, SAEs, laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and study- specific examinations as required) is monitored and reviewed on a continuous bas is by the Actelion Clinical Team (in charge of ensuring subjects ’ safety as well as data"

Percent of baseline is calculated as the ratio of the Week 24 NT -proBNP value over baseline value, expressed in percentage. 10.2.2 Key seco ndary efficacy variables Key secondary efficacy variables described here below are related to the key secondary efficacy endpoints described in S ection 6.1.2. 10.2.2.1 Quality of life at Week 24 The first key secondary efficacy variable is the clinical summary score derived from the KCCQ, expressed as change from baseline to Week 24. For subjects deceased before Week 24, the scores will be set to 0. 10.2.2.2 Accelerometer- assessed ph ysical activity at Week 24 The second key secondary efficacy variable is the proportion of time spent in light to vigorous physical activity based on a threshold of > 100 activity counts per minute , expressed as change from Baseline to Week 24 . To be considered evaluable, physical activity should have been measured for at least 4 complete days at a specific time point of assessment. A complete day is defined as a record of at least 7 hours of data (after excluding the periods when the device was appare ntly not worn). These limitations allow for obtaining reliable results [Robertson 2011]. 10.2.2.3 Time to first occurrence of worsening of heart failure event over 52 weeks The third key secondary efficacy variable is the time to first occurrence of WHF event. All worsening of heart failure events occurring until EOS / open- label enrollment (OLE) are considered, irrespective of subjects compliance to assigned therapies. Subjects with out any worsening of heart failure event up to EOS / OLE are righ t-censored at their time of EOS or OLE . Time to first occurrence of WHF event is expressed in days and calculated as the onset date of the first WHF event minus date of randomization plus 1 or, for censored subjects, as OLE / EOS date minus date of randomization plus 1.

The days in hospital are obtained by adding the durations of each individual hospital stay. The days dead are calculated for subjects who die during the study as the number of days from their death to the end of the expected follow -up (randomization date plus 52 weeks [or 24 weeks ; see Section 3.1.1.8]). Days in hospital and days dead are then subtracted from total expected follow -up time to derive DAOH for each subject. The percentage of DAOH (%DAOH) is also calculated for each subject by dividing DAOH by total potential follow -up time. 10.2.3.2 Time to first occ urrence of HF death or HF hospitalization over 52 weeks The variable of interest is the time to first occurrence of HF death or HF hospitalization based on investigator assessment. All HF hospitalizations and HF deaths occurring until OLE / EOS are considered, irrespective of subjects compliance to assigned therapies. Subjects still alive at OLE / EOS and without any HF hospitalizations up to OLE / EOS are right- censored at their time of OLE / EOS. Time to first occurrence of H F death or HF hospitalization is expressed in days and calculated as the onset date of the first HF death or HF hospitalization minus date of randomization plus 1 or, for censored subjects, as OLE / EOS date minus date of randomization plus 1."

All hospitalizations occurring until OLE / EOS are considered, irrespective of subjects compliance to assigned therapies. Subjects who do not experience any HF hospitalization before OLE / EOS will be considered as having 0 HF hospitalization. 10.2.3.5 NYHA FC (improved/worsened/stable) at each post -baseline assessment It is the NYHA FC value categorized as improved, worsen ed or stable at every post- baseline assessment. An improvement corresponds to a decrease in NYHA class by at least one level whereas a worsening corresponds to an increase in NYHA class by at least one level . Subjects remaining in the same NYHA class as th e one reported at baseline are categorized as stable. The proportion of subjects in each category is calculated at each post -baseline assessment based on the number of subjects with non-missing data (i.e., those having a reported value of I through IV). 10.2.3.6 Clinical composite outcome ( ‘worsened ’, ‘unchanged ’, ‘improved ’) The clinical composite outcome measure provides an overall evaluation of whether a subject’ s condition is considered to have improved, worsened, or unchanged after a pre-specified period of time defined as follows [ Packer 2001 ]:"

The resulting p-value will be compared to an overall 2-sided type I error of 10%. The primary and three key secondary efficacy variables will be t ested at two-sided α = 0.10, using a hierarchical testing approach to address multiplicity concern in the FAS. The secondary efficacy variables will be tested in a sequential conditional manner following the order of Section 6.1.2. Baseline is defined as the last non -missing value observed among all measu res collected during placebo and macitentan run- ins, up to the day of randomization (Visit 6). As a consequence, for the majority of subjects, it is expected to be the value observed the day of randomization (V isit 6). 10.3.2 Analysis of the primary efficacy variable The statistical method used to analyze the primary efficacy variable takes into account the expected underlying log normal distribution of NT -proBNP [ Solomon 2012]. As a consequence, the treatment effect will be tested on a log -scale using an ANCOVA and expressed , on the original scale , as the ratio between treatment groups of the g eometric means of individual percent of baseline at Week 24 (macitentan over placebo)."

Such unbalance may not be fully captured by the baseline NT -proBNP value , which is expected to be the value observed on the day of randomization for the majority of subjects , and thus already influenced by macitentan . Despite the randomization stratification based on the NT-proBNP value collected at subject ’s entry into macitentan run -in, a continuous covariate quantifying individual NT -proBNP evolution during the macitentan run -in is deemed more sensitive and therefore more appropriate than a binary covariate based uniquely on the stratification factor. 10.3.2.1 Hypotheses and statistical model Due to the underlying log- normal distribution of the primary efficacy variable, an analysis of covariance will be applied on log- transformed data. yij denotes the log- transformed percent of baseline in NT -proBNP at Week 24 for subject j in treatment group i x ij denotes the log- transformed ratio: baseline NT -proBNP over NT -proBNP value as per IRT stratificat ion, for subject j in treatment group i TRTi denotes for each subject the treatment group i he/she belongs to.

This approach is chosen as it is commonly used for this specific parameter [ Solomon 2012] and in order to facilitate the clinical interpretation across study publications in the same indication. A sensitivity analysis will be performed by imputing missing NT -proBNP value s at Week 24 according to the reason for drop -out. In particular , subjects who died or were hospitalized for HF before Week 24 will be assigned a value significantly higher than the one assigned to subjects who have a missing value at Week 24 due to technical/administrative reason . 10.3.2.3 Main analysis The main analysis will be performed on subjects of the FAS, according to the intent- to- treat principle. The main analysis of the primary efficacy variable will be carried out after log-transformation using a n ANCOVA adjusting for the log of the ratio: baseline NT-proBNP over NT -proBNP value as per IRT with an overall type I error of 10% 2- sided .

The test of interaction is performed with ‘n-1’ degrees of freedom , where ‘n’ is the number of subgroup categories . The treatment effect, measured as a geometric means ratio, will be estimated within each level of the subgroup variable based on the ANOVA including the interaction term. Significance of the interaction terms will be tested at a 0.01 level . Treatment effect geometric means ratio and corresponding 90% CIs for the different levels of each subgroup are presented in a forest -plot. The forest -plot is prepared as described in [Cuzick 2005] with a vertical reference line displayed at the level of th e overall treatment effect for macitentan versus placebo and a vertical reference line at geometric means ratio = 1. The p- value for the interaction test is displayed on the plot for each subgroup along with the number of patients in macitentan and the number of patients in placebo within each subgroup level. Some of the pre -specified subgroup analyses will not be conducted or categories will be combined when it is determined that there is an insufficient number of subjects in a subgroup category to produce a valid result. Further subgroups will be added for analysis if deemed appropriate. No multiplicity adjustment is introduced; the subgroup analysis is descriptive in nature. 10.3.3 Analysis of key secondary efficacy variable(s) 10.3.3.1 Quality of life at Week 24 The change from baseline to Week 24 in the clinical summary score will be analyzed by means of an ANCOVA adjusting for the score baseline value and for the log of the ratio:"

A number of 300 randomized subjects is adequate to detect a geometric means ratio of 0.75 (macitentan over placebo, −0.288 in log scale) corresponding to a 25% improvement with a power of 80% and a type I error of 0.10 2- sided, when considering a standard deviation (SD) of 1 in log scale and using the Wald test. The critical value expressed as geometric means ratio is 0.83. Following closure of Screening on 27 December 2019, it is expected that approximately 140 subjects will be randomized. With a reduced sample size of 140 and the same assumptions as above, the critical value expressed as geometric means ratio is 0.76. The origina lly planned sample size calculation s and assumptions are presented below, with SD ranging from 0.8 to 1 and a geometric means ratio of 0.8 or 0.75.

The 2-sided type I error has been fixed to 0.10 due to the P hase 2b nature of this study . The SD of 1 has been conservatively fixed based on: • PARAMOUNT study in which the observed SD vary between 0.91 and 0.99 (baseline and Week 12) • MELODY-1 study for which the SD is equal to 0.82 in subjects with a NT -proBNP baseline ≥ 300 pg/mL."

All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of the data. Data reported in the CRF derived from source documents must be consistent with the source documents. CRF data will be captured via electronic data capture (using the Rave system provided by Medidata Solutions, Inc., a web -based tool). The investigator and site personnel will be trained to enter and edit the d ata via a secure network, with secure access features (username, password, and identification – an electronic password system). A complete electronic audit trail will be maintained. The investigator/delegate will approve the data (i.e., confirm the accuracy of the data recorded) using an electronic signature (ref. to US 21 CFR Part 11). Entries recorded by the subject in the KCCQ as well as the physician -reported global assessment are considered source data. Site personnel will review and ensure completeness and readability of the subjects’ entries. Subject screening and enrollment data will be completed for all subjects (i.e., eligible and non-eligible) through the IRT system and CRF. For each subject enrolled, regardless of study treatment initiation, a CRF must be completed and signed by the investigator/delegate. This also applies to those subjects who fail to complete the study. If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the CRF. 11.2 Maintenance of data confidentiality The investigator/delegate must ensure that data confidentiality is maintained. On CRFs or other documents (e.g., documents attached to SAE forms / Pregnancy forms) submitted to Actelion and any CROs, subjects must be identified only by number and never by their name or initials, date of birth , hospital numbers, or any other identifier. The investigator/delegate must keep a subject identification code list at the site, showing the subject /randomization number, the subject ’s name, date of birth, and address or any other locally accepted identifiers. Documents identifying the subjects (e.g., signed ICFs) must not be sent to Actelion, and must be kept in strict confidence by the investigator/delegate."

The investigators will have access to the site CRF data until the database is closed. Thereafter, they will have read -only access. The CRF must be kept current to reflect subject status at any time point during the course of the study. Whil e entering the data, the investigator/delegate will be instantly alerted to data queries by validated programmed checks. Additional data review will be performed by Actelion personnel on an ongoing basis to look for unexpected patterns in data and for study monitoring. If discrepant data are detected, a query specifying the problem and requesting clarification will be issued and visible to the investigator/delegate via the CRF. All electronic queries visible in the system either require a data correction (w hen applicable) and a response from the investigator/delegate to clarify the queried data directly in the CRF, or simply a data correction in the CRF. The investigator/delegate must, on request, supply Actelion with any required background data from the st udy documentation or clinical records. This is particularly important when errors in data transcription are suspected. In the case of health authority queries, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that subject confide ntiality is protected. This process will continue until database closure. Laboratory samples will be processed through a central laboratory and the results will be electronically sent to Actelion. If local laboratory data are obtained, they must be entered in the CRF by the site, as defined in Section 7.2.4.1. NT-proBNP samples will be processed through the central laboratory and the results will be sent electronical ly to Actelion . As NT -proBNP is a p otential ly unblinding variable, appropriate data processes will be implemented to ensure the blind is preserved and integrity of the study maintained. Individual subject NT -proBNP data assessed during the double -blind phase will not be shared with the site staff and the Sponsor ’s study team . There are no restrictions on NT-proBNP data up to and including Visit 6. MR-proANP data also have the potential to unblind treatment allocation and will therefore not be shared with the site staff and the Sponsor’ s study team until after data base closure. Echocardiographies are read centrally and the results are transferred electronically to Actelion. AEs are coded according to the latest Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) used by Actelion."

Any changes to the database after that time may only be made as described in the appropriate Actelion QS docs. After database closure, the investigator will receive the CRFs of the subjects of his/her site (including all data changes made) on electronic media or as a paper copy. 12 PROCEDURES AND GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE 12.1 Ethics and Good Clinical Practice Actelion personnel and the investigators will ensure that the study is conducted in full compliance with ICH -GCP Guidelines, the principles of the “ Declaration of Helsinki” , and with the laws and regulations of the country in which the study is conducted. 12.2 Independent Ethics Committee / Institutional Review Board The investigator will submit this protocol and any related document(s) provided to the subject (such as the ICF) to an IEC/IRB. Approval from the committee/board must be obtained before starting the study, and must be documented in a dated letter to the investigator, clearly identifying the study, the documents reviewed, and the date of approval. Modifications made to the protocol or the ICF after receipt of the approval must also be submitted as amendments by the investigator to the IEC/IRB in accordance with local procedures and regulations [see Section 12.6]. A list of members participating in the IEC/IRB meetings must be provided, including the names, qualifications, and functions of these members. If that is not possible, the attempts made to obtain this information along with an explanation as to why it cannot be obtained or disclosed must be documented in the study documentation. If a member of the study personnel was present during an IEC/IRB meeting, it must be clear that this person did not vote. 12.3 Informed consent It is the responsibility of the investigator/delegate to obtain informed consent according to ICH- GCP and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and local regulations from each individual participating in this study and/or legally designated representative. The investigator/delegate must explain to subjects that they are completely free to refuse to enter the study, or to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without having to provide any justification. Special attention shall be paid to the information needs of specific subject populations and of individual subjects, as well as to the methods used to give the information. Adequate time shall be given for the subject and/or legally designated representativ e to consider his or her decision to participate in the study and it"

The ICF will be provided in the country local language( s). Site personnel authorized (according to local regulation) to participate in the consent process and/or to obtain consent from the subject and/or legally designated representative will be listed on the Delegation of Authority form supplied by Actelion. A study physician must always be involved in the consent process. The subject and/or legally designated representative and authorized site personnel listed on the Delegation of Authority form supplied by Actelion must sign, personally date, and time (if th e first study -mandated procedure is to be performed on the same day informed consent is obtained) the ICF before any study -related procedures (i.e., any procedures required by the protocol) begin. A copy of the signed and dated ICF is given to the subject and/or legally designated representative; the original is filed in the site documentation. The informed consent process must be fully documented in the subject ’s medical records. This must include at a minimum the study reference, the subject number, the date and, if applicable, time when the subject was first introduced to the study, the date and, if applicable, time of consent, who participated in the consent discussion, who consented the subject, and any additional person present during the consent proc ess (e.g., subject ’s family member[s]), and the information that a copy of the signed ICF was given to the subject / legally designated representative. If the site intends to recruit subjects who are considered as vulnerable (e.g., subject cannot read or write, does not speak or understand the ICF language), additional measures must be implemented in order to ensure subject ’s rights are respected and the consent obtained is legally valid. Actelion, the regulatory authorities (if applicable), and the IEC/IRB must be informed prior to the recruitment. The consent process (e.g., involvement of an impartial witness) must be fully described, submitted to, and approved by the IEC/IRB, according to procedures and before subjects are recruited. 12.4 Compensation to subje cts and investigators Actelion provides insurance in order to indemnify (with both legal and financial coverage) the investigator/site against claims arising from the study, except for claims that arise from malpractice and/or negligence. The compensation of the subject in the event of study -related injuries will comply with applicable regulations."

If a protocol deviation occurs, the investigator/delegate will inform Actelion or its representative in a timely manner. The investigator/delegate must document and explain any deviation from the approved protocol. Deviations considered to be a violation of ICH- GCP must be reported to the IEC/IRB and regulatory authorities according to Actelion or (overrulin g) local requirements. All protocol deviations will be reported in the Clinical Study Report ( CSR) . IECs/IRBs will be provided with listings of protocol deviations as per local requirements. 12.6 Protocol amendments Any change to the protocol can only be made through a written protocol amendment. An amended protocol must be submitted to the IEC/IRB and regulatory authorities, according to their requirements. 12.7 Essential documents and retention of documents The investigator/delegate must maintain adequate records necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. A number of attributes are considered of universal importance to source data and the records that hold those data. These include that the data and records are accurate, legible, contemporaneous, original (or certified copy), attributable, complete, consistent, enduring, and available when needed. These records are to be classified into two different categories of documents: ISF and subjects’ source documents. These records must be kept by the investigator for as long as is necessary to comply with Actelion ’s requirements (i.e., as specified in the clinical study agreement), and national and/or international regulations, whichever would be the longest period. If the investigator cannot guarantee thi s archiving requirement at the site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements, respecting the data confidentiality, must be made between the investigator and Actelion to store these documents outside the site, so that they can be retrieved in c ase of a regulatory inspection. No study document should be destroyed without prior written approval from Actelion. Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party, or move them to another location, Actelion must be notified in advance."

If the site is using an electronic/computerized system to store subject medical records but it could not be confirmed that the system is validated or if the CRA could not be provided access to the system, the site is requested to print the complete set of source data needed for verification by the CRA. The print -outs must be numbered, stapled together with a coversheet, s igned and dated by the investigator/delegate to confirm that these certified copies are exact copies having the same information as the original source data. The printouts will be considered as the official clinical study records and must be filed either with the subject ’s medical records or with the subject ’s CRF. In order to verify that the process the site uses to prepare certified copies is reliable, the CRA must be able to observe this process and confirm that the comparison of the source documents and the certified copy did not reveal inconsistencies. The CRA does not need to verify this process for all data of all subjects but at least for some of them (e.g., first subject; regular check during the study of critical data like inclusion/exclusion crite ria, endpoints for some subjects) as per Actelion ’s instructions. If it were not possible for the CRA to observe this process, it would not be possible to rely on the site ’s certified copies and therefore the site cannot be selected for the clinical study. 12.8 Monitoring Prior to study start, a site initiation visit (SIV) will be performed after the required essential study documents are approved by Actelion. The study treatment will be shipped to the site upon approval of the required essential documents. The PI must ensure that all site personnel involved in the study are present during the SIV and will dedicate enough time to it. Site Information Technology support should also be available during the SIV. The SIV must be completed before the si te can start the screening of study subjects. Following the SIV, a copy of the completed initiation visit report and follow -up letter will be provided to the PI and filed in the ISF. During the study, the CRA will contact and visit the site regularly and must be permitted, on request, to have access to study facilities and all source documents needed to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being entered in the CRFs and other protocol -related documents. Actelion monitoring standards require full verification that informed consent has been provided, verification of adherence"

Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs will be performed according to the study- specific monitoring guidelines. The frequency of the monitoring visits will be based on subject recruitment rate and critical data -collection times. The PI must ensure that the CRF is completed after a subject ’s visit (site visit or telephone call), and that all requested subject files (e.g., ICFs, medical notes/charts, other documentation verifying the activities conducted for the study) are a vailable for review by the CRA. The required site personnel must be available during monitoring visits and allow adequate time to meet with the CRA to discuss study -related issues. The investigator agrees to cooperate with the CRA(s) to ensure that any issues detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. If the subject is hospitalized or dies in a hospital other than the study site, the investigator is responsible for contacting that hospital in order to document the SAE, in accordance wit h local regulations. A close- out visit will be performed for any initiated site when there are no more active subjects and all follow -up issues have been resolved. In case a site does not enroll any subjects, the close -out visit may be performed prior to s tudy database closure at the discretion of Actelion. 12.9 Investigator Site File Each site will be provided with an ISF prior to the SIV. It will contain all the essential documents that are required to be up- to-date and filed at site as per ICH -GCP section 8. The ISF will include a table of content listing the essential documents. All study -related documentation must be maintained in the ISF. In some cases, exceptions can be discussed with the CRA regarding the filing of the study documents outside the ISF. It should be clearly documented where each document is filed. This note to file should be present in the specific tab of the document in the ISF. The ISF must be stored in a secure and access- restricted area during and after the study. It must be kept by the site for as long as needed to comply with any applicable rules and regulations, ICH -GCP, as well as instructions from Actelion. If the site needs to transfer the ISF to another location and/or if site facility can no longer store the ISF, the PI must immediately inform Actelion. If the PI will change, or if the site will relocate, the CRA must be notified as soon as possible."

CV death is defined as death with the following primary cause [ ACC/AHA 2015 ]: Acute MI Death by any cardiovascular mechanism (arrhythmia, sudden death, HF, stroke, pulmonary embolus, PAD) within 30 d after an acute MI, related to the immediate consequences of the MI, such as progressive HF or recalcitrant arrh ythmia. There may be assessable (attributable) mechanisms of cardiovascular death during this time period, but for simplicity, if the cardiovascular death occurs within 30 d of an acute MI, it will be considered a death due to MI. Note: Acute MI should be verified to the extent possible by the diagnostic criteria outlined for acute MI or by autopsy findings showing recent MI or recent coronary thrombosis. Death resulting from a procedure to treat an MI (PCI or CABG), or to treat a complication resulting fro m MI, should also be considered death due to acute MI. Death resulting from an elective coronary procedure to treat myocardial ischemia (i.e., chronic stable angina) or death due to an MI that occurs as a direct consequence of a cardiovascular investigation/procedure/operation should be considered as a death due to a cardiovascular procedure. Sudden cardiac death Death that occurs unexpectedly and not within 30 d of an acute MI. Note: Sudden cardiac death includes the following s cenarios: • Death witnessed and occurring without new or worsening symptoms • Death witnessed within 60 min of the onset of new or worsening cardiac symptoms unless the symptoms suggest acute MI • Death witnessed and attributed to an identified arrhythmia (e.g., captured on an electrocardiographic recording, witnessed on a monitor, or unwitnessed but found on ICD review)"

For patients who were not observed alive within 24 h of death, undetermined cause of death should be recorded (e.g., a subject found dead in bed but who had not been seen by family members for > 24 h). HF Death associated with clinically worsening symptoms and/or signs of HF, regardless of HF etiology. Note: Deaths due to HF can have various etiologies, including single or recurrent MIs, ischemic or non- ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, or valvular disease. Stroke Death after a stroke that is either a direct consequence of the stroke or a complication of the stroke. Note: Acute stroke should be verified to the extent possible by the diagnostic criteria outlined for stroke. CV procedure Death caused by the immediat e complication(s) of a Cardiovascular procedure . CV hemorrhage Death related to hemorrhage such as a nonstroke intracranial hemorrhage (e.g., subdural hematoma) nonprocedural or nontraumatic vascular rupture (e.g., aortic aneurysm), or hemorrhage causing cardiac tamponade . CV: other Cardiovascular death not included in the above categories but with specific, known cause (e.g., PE, PAD) . CABG indicates coronary artery bypass graft; CV, cardiovascular; HF, heart failure; ICD, implantable cardioverter- defibrillator; MI, myocardial infarction; PAD, peripheral artery disease; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention and PE, pulmonary embolism ."

Appendix 7 Protocol a mendment history The Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amendment is directly before the Table of Contents. Summary of previous amendment is provided below. Amendment Date Main reason(s) 1 08 February 2017 Implementation of additional safety monitoring measures post - macitentan first dose, as requested by the FDA. 2 12 April 2017 Addition of medications mainly transported by BCRP to the list of forbidden medications, as requested by the FDA. 3 10 April 2018 Description of the transition to the SERENADE OL extension study, revision of the eligibility and run- in failure criteria and introduction of a Clinical Event Committee. 4 08 March 2019 Addition of the 6 -minute walk distance sub study to assess the change in exercise capacity from baseline and the removal of the 8 - hour post- macitentan first dose safety monitoring period at the start of macitentan run -in. Addition of 2 phone calls to ensure adequate safety follow -up is established during the run- in phase. In addition, the testing hierarchy of the key secondary efficacy endpoints was changed. 5 06 February 2020 • The early termination of recruitment into the study since the study failed to meet subject recruitment targets and completion of the study within reasonable timeline is not realistic.

The rationale for this change is that Week 24 is the pre - defined timepoint for assessing the primary endpoint, as well as the key secondary endpoints. The secondary endpoint of time to worsening heart failure (WHF) event however was planned to be assessed up to Week 52 to gather meaningful information for the preparation of a pivotal clinical trial development program. Due to the reduced sample size, the number of WHF events is expected to be too low for a meaningful analysis of time to WHF. The dou ble-blind treatment period will thus be stopped at Week 24, and eligible subjects will be able to transition to SERENADE OL at this timepoint. Subjects who have already completed the Week 24 visit, will be scheduled to come back for an EOT visit within 60 days and will proceed to enroll in the OL study, if eligible. • To remove the CEC which was appointed to review and adjudicate in a blinded fashion WHF events, the reasons for hospitalization and causes of death. The rationale is based on the reduction of the double -blind treatment period from 52 weeks to 24 weeks, coupled by the low occurrence of WHF events which will not allow for meaningful conclusions to be drawn. However, the investigator assessment of WHF events will continue. Removal of the CEC does not affect safety monitoring and therefore the decision was also endorsed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). • To re -schedule accelerometry to be performed 9 consecutive days prior to Week 24 (Visit 11/PTOP2) for subjects completing week 2 4 (Visit 11) under Amendment 5 to ensure assessment performed on double -blind treatment. • To stop sub -study assessments (6 -minute walk test and Borg Dyspnea Index), as number of subjects participating in the sub - study is too low to allow for meaningful int erpretation of results. The planned analysis of sub -study data is amended to reflect the above amendment to the protocol."

In alignment with recent health authority guidance, the sponsor is providing options for study-related participant management in the event of disruption to the conduct of the study. This guidance does not supersede any local or government guidelines or requirements or the clinical judgement of the investigator to protect the healt h and well -being of participants and site staff. If , at any time , a participant ’s safety is considered to be at risk, study intervention will be discontinued, and study follow -up will be conducted. Scheduled visits that cannot be conducted in person at the study site will be performed to the extent possible remotely/virtually or delayed until such time that on -site visits can be resumed. At each contact, participants will be interviewed to collect safety data. Key efficacy endpoint assessments should be per formed if required and as feasible. Participants will also be questioned regarding general health status to fulfill any physical examination requirement. Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol -specified assessments for participants on study intervention, including follow -up. Modifications to protocol -required assessments may be permitted via COVID -19 Appendix after consultation with the participant, investigator, and the sponsor. The sponsor will continue to monitor the conduct and progress of the clinical study, and any changes will be communicated to the sites and to the health authorities according to local guidance. If a participant has tested positive for COVID -19, the investigator should contact the sponsor ’s responsible medical officer to discuss plans for study intervention and follow -up. Modifications made to the study conduct as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic should be summarized in the clinical study report."

Therefore, temporary measures may be implemented if considered appropriate by the sponsor and i nvestigator to maintain continuity of participant care and study integrity. Certain m easures, such as those listed below, may be necessary and should be instituted in accordance with applicable (including local) laws, regulations, guidelines, and procedures: o remote (eg , by phone / telemedicine) or in-person, off -site (eg , in-home) interact ions between site staff (or designees) and participants for study procedures , eg, those related to safety monitoring / efficacy evaluation / study intervention storage and administration (including training where pertinent) . The following assessment s shoul d be made and documented in the eCRF and source documents: • Weekly body weight measurements • Follow -up on ongoing AEs, recording of new AEs • Changes in concomitant medications • Results from urine pregnancy test, as applicable Wherever possible, the following efficacy assessments should be performed and recorded in the eCRF if they would have been assessed at the missed visit: • Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire: the site should administer the KCCQ by interview over the phone. When administering the KCCQ, the following points should be considered: o The participant should be interviewed without others in attendance. This will not only make the participant more comfortable, but also ensure that the answers are those of the participant. o The instructio ns and each part (the question and available responses) of the questionnaire should be read exactly as written. o If the participant does not understand the question, it should not be interpreted for them. Participants should merely be reassured that there are no right or wrong answers and that they should answer the questions as best they can. The question can be reread to the particip ant. • Patient Global Assessment (PGA): The PGA can be administered by interview over the phone . • Accelerometry: if the participant still has an accelerometer at home, he/she will be instructed to keep the device charged and to start wearing it as per ‘visit and assessment schedule ’ of the SERENADE protocol. If the participant doesn’t have an accelerometer at home, the site will send an accelerometer to the participant."

Since this is pre -planned in the protocol under exceptional circumstances (section 5.1. 6.3), direct -to-subject shipments are not considered to be a protocol deviation. • Laboratory assessments using a suitably accredited local laboratory : for selected measures (eg, urine pregnancy tests), home testing may be employed. Safety laboratory testing should include AST/ALT and hemoglobin at minimum. NT-proBNP should be measured if a visit which includes NT -proBNP sampling is missed. • Other procedures, eg, imaging, may be conducted at an appropriate facility. Once the restrictions are lifted, the subject should return to the site within 4 weeks to start to perform all safety and efficacy assessments that have been missed. o Missed assessments/visits will be captured in Rave, electronic data capture system for protocol deviations. Discontinuations of study interventions and withdrawal from the study should be documented with the prefix “COVID-19-related ” in the eCRF. O ther relevant study data elements impacted by the pandemic should also be documented / labeled as “COVID-19-related ” in CRFs, per addendum to the eCRF completion guidelines . These may include missed / delayed / modified study visits / assessments / dosing, and instances where temporary measures such as those above are implemented. • The sponsor will evaluate the totality of impact of COVID -19 on collection of key study data and additional data analyses will be outlined in study SAP(s). Guidance for re -consenting and monitoring • Re-consenting to protocol v. 6 (core ICF v. 6) can be done over the phone and/or mail; provided local regulations allow this mode of consenting. • Remote monitoring will be performed if this can be implemented at the site, per local requirements."
