T he passive Baha Attract System uses a magnetic connection through intact skin. Magnetic conduction have the advantage over skin - penetrating systems of eliminating the daily cleaning , reduction in r eported adverse skin reactions of the implant site and are perceived as more cosmetically appealing by many subjects. The skin - penetrating abutment of the traditional Baha System is seen as a barrie r for many candidates. The passive Baha Attract System was developed in consideration of all these feature s and incorporates implantable and external parts as illustrated in Figure 1 . Figure 1: The passive Baha Attract System The sound processor (1) is connected (via a snap coupling) to the sound processor mag net (2), which, together with the implant magnet (3), constitute the transcutaneous coupling. The implant magnet is fixated to the titanium implant (4). Both Baha Systems make use of the same exter nal sound processors and are built on the same implantable platform, the osseointegrated BI300 Implant . Both systems have been proven t o be safe and effective through years of clinical use and data from clinical investigations1, 2, 3. While the Baha Connec t System enables direct bone conduction through the percut aneous implant, the passive transcutaneous Baha Attract System offers less efficient bone conduction (especially at high frequencies) due to attenuation of sound vibrations through the intact skin t hat separates the external transducer from the osseointegr ated implant. 1.1.2 The ATB System The ATB System ( Osseointeg rated Steady State Implant System ) is developed to provide the benefit s of a non -skin-penetrating system combined with the benefits of a skin -penetrating system . Compared to the passive transcutaneous Baha Attract System, the ATB System will provide a more efficient transmission of sound, especially in the high frequency range, as the implantable transducer eliminates the attenuation of sound vi brations through the soft tissue that is inherent to the p assive system. With the ATB System it will also be possible to position the transducer closer to the ear canal, which may further improve audiological outcomes."
13,page_13,"CBAS5539 CIP Version 5 Template 1015045 Version 5.0 14 of 60 The ATB System is a bone -conducti on hearing device that allows direct bone -conduction throu gh an implanted actuator on the osseointegrated BI300 Implant (Figure 2). Figure 2: The ATB System The ATB System function as follows: • The external sound processor - SP (1) captures and digi tally processes sound • The SP transmits power and digital i nformation to the internal implant (2) • The implant converts the digital information into a an electric analogue implant (3) • This electric signal is transmitted to the actuator (4) • The actuator conv erts the electric signal to vibrations that are transmi tted to the mastoid bone trough the osseointegrated BI300 Implant (5) With t he ATB System the following transition paths have been established : • From a traditional percutaneous solution – the Baha Conn ect System • Via a magnetic connection solution (Baha Attrac t System ) with better aesthetics but limited performance due to skin attenuation, especially in the high frequency area • To the ATB System which combines aesthetics with higher performance to meet th e needs of subjec ts with mixed hearing loss . The target fi tting range is 55dB Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). In addition, since the actuator creating the vibration is connected directly to the BI300 Implant , the attenuation of higher frequencies that o ccurs when using the Baha Attract System , could be avoided . 1.2 Aim The aim of the investigation is to demonstrate that the ATB System provides an improvement in hearing outcomes and quality of life compared to unaided hearing in patients with a conductive or mixed hearing loss or single -sided sensorineural deafness (SSD). The aim is also to measure and present preoperative audiological test results with a Baha BP110 Power Sound P rocessor on a Baha Softband in relation to the Investigational device. S afety parameters will be collected. ."

Patients should have sufficient bone quality and quantity to support successful implant placement . This system should only be used by trained, qualified professionals. The ATB System has a fitting ra nge of up to 55 dB SNHL bone conduction threshold in mixed hearing loss. The regulatory classification of the system is expected to be Class III active implantable medical device (AIMD) in the EU and Class II or III in the US1. The instruments of the ATB System that have previously been CE marked and FDA cleared for the current Baha or Cochle ar Implant (CI) systems maintain their current classification . The BI300 Implant will also maintain its classi fication in the EU (Class IIb) and in the US (Class II). Figure 3: The ATB System parts :1 Sound Processor, 2 Receiver , 3 Stimulator , 4 Actuator, 5 BI300 Implant, 6 Lead The ATB S ystem (F igure 3) consists of the following components: Button sound processor (1): The ATB Sound Processor (SP) consists of an all -in-one off -the-ear button p rocessor: processing unit with active coil, magnet (with s even possible strengths), and two battery cells. The ATB SP has identical hardware as the CP950 Sound Processor for Cochlear I mplants, but with ATB specific firmware. The ATB SP will commercially be referred to Osia™ Sound Processor . The sound is picked up by the microphone and processed by the processing unit. It is sent to the active coil which transmits the signal to the implant coil. The processing unit also contains light emitting diodes (LED) a nd one command button, which allows the patient to control the processing unit e.g. switching the sound processor on/off. Power to the sound processor is provided by two 675 Zinc-Air batteries which are accessed by removal of the battery cover. A SoftWear  Pad (also used with the Baha A ttract Sound Processor Magn et) will be available, which distributes the force imposed by the magnets and reduces p oint pressures on the skin ( Figure 4). Complete information for the A TB SP is found in the user manual 4. 1 To be confirmed."

ATB-Implant (OSI100 Implant) consist of: Receiver - stimulator (2 and 3) The coil, magnet and case in the receiver -stimulator is reused from the Freedom Cochlear Implant platform (CI24RE), w hich has been used in Cochlear implantable systems since 2005 . The Codacs® system also use identical coil, magnet and case. A magnet located at the centre of the imp lant coil allows the coil of the external sound processor to be placed in the correct position, over the receiver - stimulator coil. The receiver -stimulator contains ATB specific electronics, which is powered by two batteries in the external sound processor. The receiver -stimulator is completely over-moulded by a silicone coating . Actuator (4) Actuator is a piezoelectric transducer which converts the signal into corresponding vibrations. The actuator d esign concept is conceived of a piezo -bender connected to two identical tungsten moving masses. When the piezo -element is electrically driven by the stimulator electronics, a vibration is generated at the central fixation clamp, the location where the actu ator is fixed to the BI300 I mplant. All external weld seam s of the ATB Actuator are over -moulded by a silicone coating. See figure 5. Figure 5. : The ATB Actuator The design of the Actuator reuses critical design features from the BIM400 Implant magnet of the Baha Attract System . The size of the actuator, includ ing the silicone coating, measures 31.4  22.6 x 4.9 mm. The Actuator will come pre -mounted on the Isolator inside the sterile blister packaging , being prepared for the IOTS testing, see section 2.3 .4.

Hence, ATB surgery reuses existing surgical tools and templ ates for Baha and CI surgery. There are only 4 new surgica l tools and 1 new template (sterile and non -sterile versions) specific to the ATB System . Table 2 lists the recommended surgical instruments for ATB surgery. The ATB specific surgical instruments us ed to prepare the bone bed for the ATB Actuator reuse desi gn features of the instruments that are used to prepare the bone bed for Baha Attract surgery; different instrument design is required due to the different shape of the ATB Actuator compared to Baha Attract implant magnet (rectangular versus circular).

Complete information for the ATB surgi cal instruments is found in the professional guides 5, 6. 2.3.2 Fitting Software (FS) Two different fitting software platforms will be used f or fitting of sound processors during this clinical invest igation, the Baha Fitting Software (BFS) (current ly released version) for the reference device Baha Power Sound Processor, and the Osia™ Fitting Software (OFS) CSDS Clin Trial version 1.02 for evalu ation of the ATB Sound Processor. The investigator shall u se the BFS to configure the Baha BP110 Power Sound Processor for each subject/user at visit 1. Communication between the fitting software and the sound processor shall be achieved using a Hi -Pro 2 p rogramming interface from GN Otometrics (GNO) and a Progra mming Cable Long Blue/Red (Figure 6). The investigator shall use the OFS to configure the operational features of the Osia Sound Processor for each subject/user at visit 4 . Communication between th e fitting software and the sound processor is achieved using a Freedom Programming Pod , Cochlear Nucleus Programming Shoe with Cable as well as CP950 Prog ramming Shoe Adaptor Cable Kit and two Battery ZN Air P675 I mplant Plus. This fitting software for the Osia Sound Processor version 1.02 is built on and has equ ivalent graphical user interface and features as the current regulatory approved Baha Fitting Software (BFS) . Complete information is found in the Instruction For Use (IFU) 7, 8. Figure 6 . Program ming set -up for a BP110, Hi -Pro2 and computer 2.3.3 Programming pod The Freedom Programming Pod, approved and used for Cochlear’s CI products, will be used as it is with the ATB System. The programming pod provides a connection between the pr ogramming computer and the ATB Sound P rocessor via a USB cable and a program ming shoe with cable as well as an adaptor cable kit and two batteries . 2.3.4 Intraoperative test system An intraoperative test system Osia ™ Intraoperative Test System (IOTS) CSDS Clin Trial version 1.0 1 will be available to confirm device integrity at the tim e of implantation. An intraoperativ e test system is available and in use for Cochlear I mplants and Codacs to verify the functionality. For ATB System , the IOTS will evaluate any potential damages to the piezo -element and to the lead before surgical closure . The integrity test will be a mandatory step of the surgical procedure, and will be performed just before the actuator is mounted onto the BI300 Implant. The IOTS functions by measuring the"
19,page_19,"CBAS5539 CIP Version 5 Template 1015045 Version 5.0 20 of 60 current consumed by the implant's audio circuitry (including the actuator). The measured frequency response provides an indication of the state of the actuator and of the actuator lead. The test system concept is similar to the existing intraoperative tests ava ilable for CI and Codacs, and uses a number of similar and /or identical components (including a compute r with dedicated software, Osia Sound Processor, Freedom Programming Pod, Cochlear Nucleus Programming Shoe with Cable as well as CP950 Prog ramming Shoe Adaptor Cable Kit and two Battery ZN Air P675 Implant Plus (Figure 7 ). The test also relies on the use of a custom silicone Isolator to provide mechanical isolation for the actuator during the test (Figure 8 ). The Isolator will come pre -mounted on the actu ator inside the sterile blister packaging. During the test the receiver -stimulator will already be in place under the patient's skin and the actuator will be mounted in the Isolator (which is secured to the BI300 Implant using the Guide pin). The test take s approximately two minutes to perform, and the software provides the user with an unambiguous test result regarding device integrity prior to closing and suturing the surgical site. A Signal Check wand (currently available for CI and Codacs) is also available to check the radio -frequency (RF) link between the tr ansmitting coil of the sound processor and the internal coil in case of no response from the implant is received during the intraoperative test. The sound processor should be switched on and the Sig nal Check wand held to the coil. If the signal check light s up the coil is working. 1. Adapter cable 2. Battery retention clip 3.

The primary safety endpoint is 6 months . One arm is selected for conductive and mixed hearing loss subjects, the other arm is selected fo r single -sided sensorineural deafness subjects. Each subje ct will be compared to his/her own preoperative unaided hearing situation, with the Baha BP110 Power Sound Processor on a softband preoperatively and with the Investigational device at 3 months . If applicable subjects with a current hearing amplification will also be tested preoperatively . 4.2 Justification for the design of the clinical investigation The design where the primary assessment consist of a comparison of the post -operative aided performance with the preoperative unaided performance is considered re levant for this purpose. The primary efficacy assessment of the investigation, i.e. threshold, free -field, pure tone average PTA4, is a relevant and objective method used by clinics internationally as a way to assess hearing performance. The test is not la nguage specific (no words used), thus rendering comparative data in an international, multilingual setting. The self -reported assessment of hearing outcome using the APHAB questionnaire was chosen as an important secondary efficacy assessment; hence, the APHAB scale was used for determination of the sample size in the investigation9. The APHAB has been used in investigations previously and has shown to be a good tool for measuring changes in patient benefits. The rationale for measuring and collect data with Baha BP110 Power Sound Processor on a Softband as a secondary assessment is based on the fact that the FDA guideline for middle ear implants suggests that a comparative non -inferiority or superi ority study design (using within -patient comparison) may b e required. The Baha BP110 Power Sound processor on a Softband was chosen for a secondary assessment, since the ATB System mimics the performance of a Baha Power Sound Processor (with the same 55 dB fitting range) on the passive transcutaneous Baha Attrac t System1. Therefore it is also a relevant choice to present as a postoperative hearing situation for the subject. This investigation is limited to adult subjects. The paediatric population constitu tes an inhomogeneous patient group (age -related), and curr ently there are no audiological tests that are suitable for comparisons across age ranges and across multiple countries/languages. The follow -up period of 12 weeks post-surgery , 8 weeks post fitting for the primary analysis is chosen as it is judged as lon g enough for the subjects to adapt and get used to the hearing performance with this investigational device. The total length of the investigation is judged long enough to collect hearing performanc e and safety data as long term data. 4.3 Objectives and outcom e measures Primary objective Outcome measure (s) To compare hearing performance with the Investigational device and the unaided hearing situation At 3 months • Thresholds audiometry, free -field [PTA 4, Mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz].

All tests shall be performed in th e sound isolated room. Equipment used for audiological testing shall be calibrated before initiation of the investigation. Calibration certificates will be asked for by the Sponsor as part of the st udy documentation. It is important to keep the same sound room and test equipment set-up during the entire clinical investigation. Changes are not allowed. If, for some exceptional reason, any significant changes would be needed with the test equipment during the investigation a new calibration needs to be perfor med together with a new unaided baseline measurement. Calibration documentation should be kept with the Investigator File. 5.2 Demographics The following demographic data will be recorded at Visit 1: • Age collected as date of birth (month and year) • Gender • Ethnicity • Nicotine use (Subjects does not smoke, ≤ 10 cigarettes /day, 11 -20 cigarettes /day, 21 40 cigarettes /day, > 40 cigarettes /day) 5.3 Medical history The following information will be recorded at Visit 1: • Relev ant medical and surgical treatment during the past three years judged by the investigator • Current concomitant medication and treatments 5.4 Baseline characteristics During visit 1 a number of baseline characteristics will be recorded; • Treatment ear (indicate left or right or both.

An existing audiogram may be used as long as it has been completed during the last six months, and contains all the required relevant frequencies (250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 and 8000Hz) . The subje ct’s pre -operative Pure Tone Average PTA4 (mean of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000Hz) should be computed and recorded to ensure the subject meets the inclusion criteria. If an audiogram is older tha n 6 months or does not contain the required frequencies, a new will be performed at Visit 1 . Frequencies required for air conduction thresholds are 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 and 8000Hz. Bone conduction thresholds are 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 6000Hz. Contralateral masking s hould be used if needed , and according to local practice . The hearing care professional shall always record the unmasked threshold and record the masked if applicable. Audiograms for bone conduction thresholds will also be performed at Visits 6, 7, and vi sit 8 to monitor hearing thresholds postoperatively . 5.6 Soft tissue thickness At visit 1 or visit 2 (start of surgery) , depending on local practice and requirements, soft tissue thickness should be measured. For the ATB System, the skin thickness should not e xceed 6 mm to ensure optimal retention and system performance. The measurement should be performed in the centre of the ma rked coil position. For complete instruction see the surgery guide 5. 5.7 Surgery The surgery, performed at visit 2, does not take accoun t for any particular circumstances or factors relevant to an individual patient or case. Other surgical approaches and variations are practiced and may be more appropriate in certain patient cases. After considering all relevant circumstances, factors and informat ion in each case, the appropriate surgical procedure is determined by the responsible investigator exercising independent medical judgment. Complete information is found in the surgery guide5. During surgery the following variables should be colle cted: • Surgery time (time between first incision to last suture) • Bone polishing/removal at the actuator site (yes/no) • BI300 Implant length (3mm/4mm)"
29,page_29,"CBAS5539 CIP Version 5 Template 1015045 Version 5.0 30 of 60 • Location of BI300 Implant (mm from the ear channel ), measured horizontally and vertically). Distance from B I300 to receiver/coil (centre to centre). An alternative option to preoperative measurements with a ruler, is to take a lateral skull radiography postoperatively and measure the distance between the implant receiver magnet and the BI300. • Type of anaesthesi a (gener al/local) • Soft tissue reduction (yes/no) • Surgical incision type ( C-shaped flap is anterior based for an anterior actuator position or posterior based flap is considered for a more posterior actuator position or other incision type ) At visit 3, app roximate ly 2 weeks after surgery sutures should be removed. 5.8 Intraoperative Test system (IOTS) At visit 2 , in the end of the surgery procedure, the IOTS test should be performed. The test takes approximately two minutes to perform, and the software provides the use r with an unambiguous test result regarding device integrity prior to closing and suturing the surgical site . It is crucial that the staff during surgery follow the instruction for use10. The software used for the IOTS is installed on a lap -top provided by the Sponsor. The software collects data from transducer of the implant and will make the Sponsor gain understanding of the behaviour and performance of the transducer once implanted on a recipient . IOTS d ata will be saved on the lap -top until stud y is end ed when it will be transferred to the Sponsor in a coded way . 5.9 Sound Processor fit ting The Baha Fitting S oftware 4.0 SR28 will be used at visit 1 when the fitting procedure should be performed for the Baha BP110 Power Sound P rocessor as a reference device. The Osia Fitting S oftware 1.027 will be used to adjust the investigational device sound processor settings for a specific subject. This will happen during Visit 4 when tests will be performed , and throughout the study . The fitting software will b e instal led on a lap -top provided by the Sponsor, and the fitting -data will be saved on the lap -top until study is ended when it will be transferred to the Sponsor in a coded way. The Digital Link Calibration (e.g. coil -to-coil measurement) that is a step in the connection step in the Osia Fitting Software, should be performed at each occasion that the software is being used to fit or fine tune the device to optimize the performance of the device throughout the study. This will also provide an indication o f the so ft tissue thickness. For the sound processors Individual Stable Gain (e.g. feedback measurements as part of the Fitting Software) the Feedback Analyser should be performed at each occasion that the software is being used to fit or fine tune the de vice to optimize the performance of the device throughout the study . For the Investigational device this data will be collected, saved and eventually transferred to the Sponsor for analysis. 5.10 Magnet choice At visit 4 (sound processor fitting) the most suita ble magn et should be selected for the sound processor to be t ested, and the instruction for u se5 should be followed . It is important that the strength is not too weak or too strong. There are 7 different strengths , starting from ½ to 6. During the f ollowin g"
30,page_30,"CBAS5539 CIP Version 5 Template 1015045 Version 5.0 31 of 60 visits the choice of sound processor magnet should be checked. There may be a need to decrease or increase the stre ngth depending on the subject’s preferenc e. 5.11 Bone Conduction (BC) Direct BC Direct is a tool in the Baha Fitting Software (current version) to estab lish the unmasked bone condition threshold with tones presented through the sound processor. At Visit 1, BC Direct data s hall be collected with the Baha BP110 Power Sound P rocessor on a Softband and shall be used to calculate the fitting (settings) of the sound process or for the Softband test . BC Direct measurements (as part of the Osia Fitting Software) will also be performed at visit 4 to visit 8 when the subject is using the investigational device . BC thresholds obtained at the following frequenc ies will be recorded; 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 Hz . 5.12 Simultaneous bilateral In the case of a subject receiving simultaneous bilateral ATB systems one of the treatment ears will be selected as the investigational ear for efficacy purp oses. Sp eech in noise performance will be documented for the second ear alone and bilaterally. However, efficacy outcomes for the investigational ear only will be pooled with the outcomes measures made for the unilaterally implanted subjects. Investigation al ear c hoice will be as judged by the responsible investigator prior to surgery. Patient -reported outcomes (APHAB, SSQ and HUI), will be collected post -surgery in a bilateral situation. Safety -related information, including adverse events, will be collect ed and r eported for each ear receiving the ATB system. 6 ASSESSMENTS Assessments that will be performed during the clinical investigation is outlined in the flow chart, see section 8 . During the assessments, the signal processing of the sound processors will be harm onised according to given instructions given in the eCRF. This will also be included in the staff training at each participating centre during the site initiations. 6.1 Postoperative audiometric assessment Bone conduction thresholds for the study ear will be monitored postoperatively, to characterize observed unaided thresholds postoperatively. These measures will occur at visit 6 (3 months postoperative) and 7 (6 months postoperative) , once healing and swelling is most likely to be resolved and repeat ed at vi sit 8 (12 months postoperative). Bone conduction thresholds are 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 6000Hz. Contralateral masking should be used if needed, and according to local practice. The hearing care professional shall always reco rd the u nmasked threshold and record the masked if applicable. 6.2 Free -field th reshold The purpose of this test is to establish the hearing thresholds in free field through a speaker in front position (0 degrees azimuth) according to the so -called ascending or modif ied Hughson -Westlake method (Figure 10 ). The test shall be performed with the non -test ear blocked (in case of normal or near-normal hearing or a large asymmetry with the non -test ear having significantly better hearing thresholds). The signal to b e used should be narrow band noise ."

At Visit 4, 6, 7 and 8 this measurement should be performed with the investigational device. 6.4 Adaptive S peech recognition in noise The purpose of this test is to establish the test subject’s ability to recognise speech in the presence of background noise. The adaptive speech test in noise shall be conducted using validated lists of phonetically balan ced sent ences, with speech presented in free field from the front (0 degrees azimuth) and noise from the back (180 degrees azimuth) (figure 11 ). The noise shall be kept constant at 65 dB SPL, and the speech shall be adapted stepwise according to the softwa re used to establish the speech -to-noise ratio (SNR) providing a 50% level of understanding. Software and speech material to be used is the Matrix test in language specific versions as applicable. The test shall be performed with the non -test ear blocked (in case of normal or near -normal hearing or a large asymmetry with the non -test ear having signif icantly better hearing threshold s). The speakers should be at the height of the test subjects head and more than 1 metre away from the test subject. There sho uld preferably be more than 1 metre of free space around the test subject in all directions. This is in accordance with the current standard11."

Prospective Osia System recipients should be advised of th e following possible effects of receiving an implant: - Normal risks associated with surgery and general anaesthesia - Increased surgical and anaesthetic risks for certain populations - Osseointegration failure - Potential causes for failure of osseointe gration include lack of adequate bone quantity/quality, trauma, infection, generalised diseases and surgical complications - Complications that may require additional medical treatment, surgery and/or removal of the device, such as:"

In addition, the ATB System will provide additional advantages as it combines benefits from both a percutaneous ( skin- penetrating) and transcutaneou s Baha system The ATB System provides efficient sound transmission through direct bone conduction, similar to a percutaneous implant . Direct bone conduction through a transducer that is directly coupled to the bone is currently only achieved with the percu taneous Baha Connect System. With the active transcutaneous ATB System, the actuator is directly attached to the bone via the osseointegrated BI300 I mplant underneath the skin, thus eliminating any loss of energy in the sound vibrations through the skin. H ence, efficiency of sound transmission is on a par with a percutaneous system. The ATB System provides the cosmetic benefits of a transcutaneous system, such as the Baha Attract System. A percutaneous implant is seen as a barrier and is often rejected by c andidates due to cosmetic concerns. A transcutaneous system, without an abutment protruding through the skin, is often perceived as a more aesthetic option. The ATB System, like the Baha Attract System, will significantly reduce the risk of implant site infections, and eliminates the need for daily maintenance care . For the transcutaneous Baha Attract System and ATB System, the implant site is sealed and does not provide a direct path for infections. Skin irritation and/or infection requiring treatment and/ or precluding the use of the sound processor are relatively frequent for percutaneous devices due to the exposed abutment and daily site care is required to maintain a reaction -free skin penetration . Some patients are not able —for medical or other reasons —to perform the daily implant site care that the skin -penetration requires. The ATB System is expected to be associated with a significantly lower risk of osseointegration failure than for the percutaneous Baha Connect System. This risk is expected to be s imilar to that of the Baha Attract System, which also uses the osseointegrated BI300 Implant. According to the latest post market surveillance report s13,14 no osseointegration failures have been reported to Cochlear’s complaints handling system , nor in the review of scientific literature for the Baha Attract System 15. Transition pathway between the systems . Surgical transition between the three systems (reusing the same osseointegrating BI300 Implant) possible if the patient’s needs change over time (provid ed the location of the BI300 Implant is suitable for the transition). 9.2 Anticipated adverse device effects Just like any surgical treatment, ATB surgery is not free of risks. Risks associated with the implantation and use of the ATB System cannot be complete ly eliminated. General risks associated with surgery under general or local anaesthesia apply, and as with any surgical procedure, there is always a risk that unantic ipated complications may occur. These risks are expected to be similar for ATB System as f or traditional Baha surgery with the Baha Connect and Baha Attract Systems and the procedure for implanting the Cochlear Implants systems ( Freedom Cochlear Implant platform (CI24RE) and Codacs® System, see section 2). Post market surveillance information i s collected and those findings relevant for the ATB System is presented below:"
43,page_43,"CBAS5539 CIP Version 5 Template 1015045 Version 5.0 44 of 60 9.2.1 ATB Sound Processor (Osia Sound Processor) The ATB SP has identical hardware as the CP950 Sound Processor for Cochlear I mplants, but with ATB specific firmware. Since the CP950 Sound Processor is recently new and no post market surveillance data is yet available , the safety data is based on literature reviews and reviewing the complaints and adverse event (reportable complaint) trending rates for the predicate devices and for the Baha Attract System. The most common complaint is magnetic retention is sues of the sound processor. Skin irritation for predicate device is not reported as an issue. For the Baha Attract system skin irritation is fairly common but not reported as a seriou s problem and often solved by adjusting the magnet strength. 9.2.2 Receiver -stimulator ( CI24RE ) During the period 1 July 2009 to Dec 2015, the cumulative number of registered implant surgeries (IS) with CI24RE implants was 153 040 (14 402 surgeries during the l ast year). Of total number of registered implant surgeries, 80 reportable complaints (0,052% of total IS) have been attributed to the receiver -stimulator. Overall, reportable complaints in the category ‘Reliability/quality/defect’ occurred at an average ra te of 0.006% of the total number CI24RE implant surgeries per month. The complaints are being monitored and there is no upward trend. The majority of complaints in the category ‘Medical/surgical issue’ have been coded as “Other medical”, “Skin flap infecti on” and “Medical/surgical issue (recipient related)” and the maximum harm for a complaint that was attributed to the device was revision surgery to explant the device. Based on the post market surveillance activities performed, the CI24RE Series of Implant s are considered to be performing in the field within acceptable limits and expectations. All known product issues are appropriately contained, or being managed through existing CAPAs. The Clinical Evaluation Report (411167, Clinical Evaluation Report Nucl eus CI24RE Cochlear Implants) provides clinical evidence to establish the acceptability of the risk benefit analysis of the CI24RE Series of Implants16. 9.2.3 Codacs During the period 18 October 2013 to 31 October 2015, the cumulative number of registered implan t surgeries with Codacs DI110 implant and DF110 Fixation System was 65 (39 during the last year). No reportable complaints were attributed to the receiver -stimulator or the lead. The number of reportable events related to medical/surgical issues or no -fault-found was 2 (3.1%). Based on the post market surveillance activities performed, the Codacs DI110 implant and the Codacs DF110 Fixation System are considered to be performing in the field within expectations (D701349, Post Market Surveillance Report, Coda cs DI110 implant and DF110 Fixation system)17. 9.2.4 BI300 Imp lant with the Baha Connect System Since launch in 2010 to Oct 2015, 55 341 BI300 implants (including abutment) have been sold with a reported monthly complaint rate around 0.1 -0.2%. The complaint relevant to the ATB System is BI300 implant loss . The rate of implant loss for the Baha Connect System is around 1%. The overall complaint rates and reportable events are well below the pre -defined escalation threshold14. 9.2.5 BI300 Implant with the Baha Attract System During the period Aug 2013 to Jan 2017 , approximately 11.000 BIM400 (Baha Attract Implant magnet including BI300) have been sold globally. The most commonly reported symptoms are skin reactions and/or pain around the implant mag net and magnet retenti on issues with an overall rate of up to 2%. The symptoms are usually reported to be mild and treated by adjusting Sound Processor (SP) Magnet strength."
44,page_44,"CBAS5539 CIP Version 5 Template 1015045 Version 5.0 45 of 60 No cases of implant loss due to osseointegration failure have been confirmed. The overall complaint rates and reportable events are well below the pre -defined escalation threshold (D784107, Post Market Surveillance Report, Baha Attract, November 2015)13. 9.3 Risks associated with participation in the clinical investigation The Investigational device is reused b y several parts from already CE marked products . There is no guarantee that the ATB Implant will not c ause any adverse device events. T he ATB Implant is expected to have a lifetime of about ten years. By the time of first implantation in the clinical inves tigation , spring 2017, it will be possible to cla im approximately 30 months of equivalent life time. Test results will be reported periodically until an equivalent lifetime of 10 years is reached. As with any new surgical product and medical device , there i s a risk that unanticipated Adverse Events may occur. The subjects will be closely monitored in the investigation and instructed to contact the responsible investigator if they experience any untoward effect. In the wors t case scenario the patient would need a revision sur gery to remove the ATB Implant, but this can be done with local anaesthesia. They will then end participation in the clinical investigation and follow normal clinical care and follow up. 9.4 Control and mitigation of risks The surgical procedu re is described in the surgery guide for the ATB System 5. The guide has been developed by the Sponsor together with a group of experienced Baha and Coch lear Implant surgeons. Although most of the surgical tools are the same as for Baha and CI implantation , there are some new tools provided. These have been validated with presence of experienced implant surgeons during th e surgical validation activity (cadaver surgical training and practical evaluation and testing of the surgical tools) and no patient impla ntation before these performed validation procedures were completed and reported. Before start of each site in the clinical investigation each investigator will have done documented surgery training according to the su rgery guide either at a cadaver lab te st or on a plastic skull. MRI examinations can be performed safely on a person with this implanted device only under very specific conditions. An MRI information package is supplied with each implant for additional information regarding magnetic resonanc e imaging18.

The sample size was calculated using simulation on study id CBAS5675 (Cochlear 2017) data which used the simulated ATB system on Mixed/Conductive subjects. The within subject S D for change Unaided to ATB in PTA4 was 9.5 dB and 11.3 SNR. Since significant result want to be detected in both arms (SSD and Conductive/Mixed) 13+13=26 subjects should be included in the investigation. 10.3.2 Sample size calculation for the secondary analysis In order to achieve 90% power to detect a clinically significant difference of 15 units in APHAB Benefit between the unaided situation and use of the Investigational device at the 3 months visit with Fisher’s one-sided non -parametric permutation test for p aired observations , one-sided test with significance level 0.0 25, on the pooled ITT population (SSD and Conductive/Mixed together) , 28 evaluable subjects are needed assuming a within subject standard deviation (SD) of 23.3 units. The within subject SD has been estimated to 23.3 in a previous Cochlear -sponsored multi -centre clinical investigation which compared APHAB scores for pre -operative unaided hearing and for post -operative use of a Baha sound processor mounted on a percutaneous implant over 12 months (Study ID CBAS5439). To compensate for drop out of two patients in the study, 30 subjects should be included in the investigation. 10.3.3 Sample size estimation for the primary safety analysis at 6 months Primary safety analysis will be evaluated at 6 months and an estimation of 50 subjects results in 25 patient years at 6 months, which will yield enough safety data for the primary safety analysis. At the 12-month analysis 50 subjects results in 50 patient years. 10.3.4 Overall sample size considerations In order to achi eve 90% power both for the primary analysis (PTA4 and SNR, Investigational Device vs. Unaided) and the primary safety analysis, 50 evaluable subjects are needed. Each arm SSD and Conductive/Mixed should at least consist of 13 patients to assure a power of 90% in both arms for the primary analysis. 10.4 General statistical methodology All statistical analyses will be paired non-parametric. In order to choose the most powerful test, the Fisher’s non -parametric permutation test for paired observations will be used for all paired analyses of continuous variables. For paired analysis of dichotomous and ordered categorical variables the Sign test will be used. The main efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT population and complementary efficacy analyses will be performed on the PP population. The main analysis will be performed after the 3 month visit. A complementary analysis will be performed 9 months after the main analysis (12 -month visit). All significance tests will be one-sided and performed at the 5% sig nificance level. Imputation of missing values (definitions made in SAP) will be performed for all efficacy variables. No imputation of baseline values or baseline carry forward will be made ."
