The number of VOCs will be analysed using negative binomial regression. The response variable is the number of VOCs experienced by a patient over the treatment period. Patient follow -up time (log-transformed) will be included as an offset in the linear predictor to adjust for patients having different exposure times. Additional covariates to be adjusted for in the linear predictor wil l be treatment group (placebo as reference group) and hydroxyurea therapy (Yes/No). The treatment effect will be tested at a 5% significance level. If the negative binomial distribution is not appropriate, a Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used.

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic, autosomal, recessive blood disorder resulting an altered haemoglobin Œ≤ -chain (HbS ). When the altered haemoglobin is deoxygenated it aggregates into large polymers, distorting the shape of the red cells to sickle -shaped. A vaso -occlusive crisis (VOC) is a severe, acute painful episode that occurs when sickle -shaped red blood cells obstruct the microcirculation and restrict blood flow to an organ or tissue, resulting in ischaemia, necrosis and organ damage. The clinical presentation varies depending on the localisation of the obstruction and there are also specific SCD complications, s uch as acute chest syndrome (ACS) where the pulmonary vasculature is affected. Vaso -occlusion is initiated and sustained by complex interactions among sickle cells, endothelial cells and constituents of plasma. Activated platelets participate in the proc ess by promoting the adhesion of sickle cells to the endothelium, and through the formation of platelet -leukocyte aggregates, which augment the inflammatory state and contribute to vaso -occlusion. In patients with SCD, platelets are activated during the n on-crisis ‚Äústeady state‚Äù and are further activated during painful episodes and markers of platelet inhibition have been shown to correlate with the frequency of pain crises ( Ataga et al 2012 ). There is a significant unmet need regarding treatment options to reduce VOCs in SCD . Curative treatment with bone marrow transplantation is only available to a very limited number of patients. Until recently, the only pharmacological treatment approved for reduction of VOCs was hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide). Hydroxyurea reduces the rate of painful crises, ACS and the need for blood transfusions in adults and children with SCD (Charache et al 1995 , Wang et al 2011 ), but patients need to be closely monitored since hydroxyurea causes myelodepression and ha s other side effects. Moreover, hydroxyurea is not approved for use in children in all markets. In July 2017, the U nited States (US) FDA approved L -glutamine for the reduction of acute com plications of SCD; however, with the limited experi ence with L-glutamine and current approval only in US, the role of this compound in the treatment paradigm remains to be established. Although the frequency of SCD complications are reduced with hydroxyur ea and with L -glutamine, most patients continue to suffer from these complications despite treatment. Inhibition of platelet activation has been proposed as a potential therapeutic option in the treatment of SCD. The antiplatelet drug ticlopidine, which has a similar mechanism of action as ticagrelor (prevention of adenosine diphosphate [ADP] -mediated platelet activation), significantly reduced the frequency of VOCs in patients with SCD ( Cabannes et al 1984 ). Another G protein -coupled platelet receptor for ADP (P2Y 12) inhibitor, prasugrel, was recently investigated in children with SCD. The Phase III study in paediatric patients sh owed a numerical reduction in number of VOC events (component of painful crises and /or ACS), with fewer painful crises in prasugrel group than on placebo (66% versus 72%), but no difference in ACS (9% in each group); however, the differences versus placebo did not reach statistical significance ( Heeney et al 2016 ). Of note is that the prasugrel doses used in this study only resulted in a mean platelet inhibition of a pproximately 20%"
16,page_16,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 17(123) (Jakubowski et al 2017 ). Too low platelet inhibition may have contributed to the insufficient efficacy in this study (Heeney et al 2016 ). Ticagrelor (BRILINTA‚Ñ¢) is an oral, direct -acting, selective, reversibly -binding P2Y 12 receptor antagonist that prevents ADP -mediated platelet activation and aggregation. Ticagrelor, 90 mg twice a day (bd), was first approved in 2010 to reduce the rate of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in adult patients with acute coronary syndromes, and is currently appro ved in >100 countries. An extended indication for ticagrelor 60 mg bd to include adult patients with a history of myocardial infarction was approved in 2015. An additional mechanism of action with ticagrelor, increasing local endogenous adenosine levels ( Nylander et al 2013 ), may contribute to a vasodilatory effect observed in healthy subjects and in patients with acute coronary syndromes as measured by coronary blood flow (Wittfeldt et al 2013 , Alexopoulus et al 2013 ), which could help increase oxygen supply to ischaemic tissue s during a VOC. A programme is currently ongoing to assess the potential therapeutic benefits of ticagrelor in reduction of the occurrence of VOCs in children with SCD. The HESTIA1 study (D5136C00007) investigated pharmacokinetic s/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD ), safety and ear ly signs of efficacy of ticagrelor in 45 patients aged 2 to 17 years . Ticagrelor exposure increased approximately proportionally to dose and the PK/PD relationship in children with SCD and appeared similar to what has been previously observed in adults wi th cardiovascular disease . Ticagrelor was well tolerated and no bleedings were reported during treatment . There were no apparent effects on symptoms related to SCD, but the number of patients and short study duration limit the conclusions on efficacy in this study . In addition, a ticagrelor study in 87 young adults (aged 18 to 30 years) with SCD compared effects from ticagrelor 10 mg, 45 mg or placebo given twice daily for 12 weeks (HESTIA2 study, D5136C00008). The proportion of days with pain as well a s analgesic use decreased in all groups, including placebo, with no apparent differences between groups . Ticagrelor was well tolerated in young adults, bleeding events were few and reported with similar frequency as placebo and no major bleeding occurred . No safety concerns were raised in HESTIA1 or HESTIA2. In summary, there is a high unmet need for treatment options in SCD and there is a scientific rationale, supported by clinical data, that platelet inhibition has the potential to reduce the risk for acute vaso -occlusions. This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ticagrelor versus placebo in children with SCD during treatment for at least 12 months and up to approximately 24 months. Detailed information on ticagrelor is found i n the Investigator‚Äôs Brochure (IB)."

Patients with clinically milder variants (eg, sickle cell-haemoglobin C [HbSC]) will not be eligible, since they usually have a lower frequency of painful crises ( Ashley -Koch et al 2000 ). The different pattern of SCD manifestations in patients with HbSC ( Gill et al 1995 ) could introduce heterogeneit y into the study population. In addition, there are data to suggest that platelet activation in HbSS is elevated compared with HbSC ( Blann et al 2007 ); thus, patients with HbSC may be less likely to benefit from P2Y 12 inhibition. To be eligible for the study, patients must have experienced at least 2 VOC s (defined as painful crisis and/or ACS) events in the past 12 months prior to V isit 1, indicating that the severity of the patient‚Äôs disease justifies preventive chronic long -term treatment . The intent is to enrol only children aged 2 years or above, since VOCs become more frequent with age . Above 2 years of age, children may have experienced more than 1 VOC, and established a pattern of frequency such that an intervention to reduce the rate of VOCs can be justified and meaningfully evaluated ( Gill et al 1995 , Platt et al 1991 ). Thus, the unmet need to prevent VOCs is most evident in ch ildren from 2 years of age and above. Due to ticagrelor mechanism of action and the potential to reduce symptoms caused by ischaemia during a vaso -occlusion, a composite endpoint with painful crises and /or ACS has been selected for the primary endpoint , see Section 2.1. Painful crisis is the most common reason for emergency d epartment visits for patients with SCD with a significant impact on young patients‚Äô lives, affecting them physically and emotionally. Acute chest syndrome is a potentially life -threatening condition involving vaso -occlusion, eg , when caused by pulmonary i nfarction or indirectly because of fat embolism secondary to bone marrow infarction, and/or a pulmonary infection ( Vichinsky et al 2000 ). Both painful crises and /or ACS are identified by patients/parents as the acute SCD -related complications having the most impact on their lives ( The Voice of the Patient 2014 ), and these endpoints are commonly used for evaluation of clinical outcome in trials in SCD. See Section 5.1.1 for the specific definiti on of the primary endpoint events in this study. Secondary e ndpoints are included to broaden the understanding of effects in patients with SCD and to also assess potential benefits on symptomatic disease burden and health -related quality of life (HRQL). 1.2.2 Dose, control group and treatment duration The ticagrelor PK/PD modelling and simulation work based on the results from HESTIA1 and HESTIA2 studies identifies 15, 30 and 45 mg bd, depending on body weight, as relevant doses in the HESTIA3 study . These doses are predicted to result in a platelet activity measured as P2Y 12 reaction units ([PRU] as measured by VerifyNow¬Æ) of less than 180, corresponding to >35% platelet inhibition in terms of reduction in PRU assuming a baseline"
18,page_18,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 19(123) PRU of 280 (which was the baseline PRU observed in HESTIA1, and similar to prasugrel Phase III DOVE study [Heeney et al 2016 ]). The predicted platelet inhibition in HESTIA3 is similar to what was observed in the 45 mg bd dose group in the HESTIA2 study in young adults, where after 1 week of tre atment the mean percentage decrease from baseline PRU was 48% before morning dose and 81% at 2 h ours after dose. The 45 mg bd dose group was well tolerated and events of bleeding were of the same number and similar compared to the placeb o and the 10 mg bd dose groups . Given the reversible mechanism of action for ticagrelor, the level of P2Y 12 inhibition during ticagrelor treatment is expected to vary within a dosing interval and peak around 2 hours after dosing . When developing the dosing strategy for th is study, the target for platelet inhibition was guided by the results from the recent prasugrel Phase III study in paediatric patients with SCD aged 2 to 17 years, showing insufficient efficacy with a mean PRU of 207 (ie, approximately 20% reduction from baseline) ( Jakubowski et al 2017 ). The lack of therapeutic benefit with prasugrel may have been related to a too low platelet inhibition ( Heeney et al 2016 ), and consequently, doses for HESTIA3 were selected to achieve a greater level of platelet inhibition . Moreover, a study with ticlopidine in adolescents and adult patients with SCD showing significant reductions in V OC ( Cabannes et al 1984 ) used doses that generally provide <60% inhibition of platelet aggregation, which provides further support for the platelet inh ibition target and the selected doses for the HESTIA3 study. There are no other drug s approved for reduction of VOCs in children with SCD with a similar mechanism of action as ticagrelor. Hydroxyurea is approved for use in children with SCD in some marke ts and more recently , L-glutamine was approved by the US FDA. Evaluation of ticagrelor when given in addition to standard of care including th ese medications , where available and when considered medically appropriate, is considered acceptable for studying the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor in this patient group as compared with placebo . Treatment duration is at least 12 months for study participants, but no longer than 24 months for any patients . The expected average follow -up is 18 months, assuming a uniformly distributed enrolment period of 12 months. Considering inclusion of patients with at least 2 VOCs in the past year, this treatment duration is consi dered long enough to evaluate effects on VOC events as well as to capture safety and tolerability data supporting a potential future long-term use of ticagrelor. 1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment The aim with ticagrelor treatment in paediatric patients w ith SCD is to reduce the rate of VOCs, with an acceptable safety profile. Considering that the anticipated benefit would be mostly symptom reduction and that patients with SCD suffer from anaemia, the acceptance for bleedings will be low. Episodes with VO Cs are the most common cause for emergency room visits for children with SCD. The pain associated with VOC can be excruciating and have a significant impact on the child‚Äôs life, and significantly disturbs routine activities such as food intake, sleep and school"
19,page_19,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 20(123) activities during several days. The painful crises are repeatedly described as the most challenging symptom of their disease by patients with SCD. An ACS is a serious and potentially life -threatening condition that may lead to respiratory failure or multi organ failure, and is a common cause of death in SCD patients. Most cases of ACS require hospitalisation for >1 week (Vichinsky et al 2000 ). Besides the acute sym ptoms, the isch aemia during vaso-occlusion causes tissue damage that over time leads to impaired organ function (eg, renal failure) or complications such as bone necro sis, joint pain or cognitive impairment . Pharmacological treatments options to prevent VOC even ts in children are few and side effects can be dose -limiting (hydroxyurea). With previous studies of anti -platelet drugs suggesting potential to reduce VOCs ( Cabannes et al 1984 , Heeney et al 2016 ) and the high unmet need for new treatments, there is a clear value in continuing to investigate the role of anti-platelet therapies in the reduction of VOCs. Inherent to their reduction in p latelet reactivity, antiplatelet agents increase the risk of bleeding. Ticagrelor has been on the market since 2010 for use in adult patients with coronary artery disease to reduce the risk for cardiovascular events. The safety profile has been thoroughl y evaluated in large trials . The PEGASUS study (D5132C00001) evaluated the combination of ticagrelor 60 or 90 mg bd with aspirin in adult patients with a history of myocardial infarction. This dual anti -platelet therapy resulted in more bleeding events o verall compared to aspirin alone; however, the majority of these bleedings were of lesser severity (eg, epistaxis, bruising and hematomas). In the adult clinical program me for ticagrelor, including several large cardiovascular outcome studies, the number of reported events of fatal bleeding have been low and similar for ticagrelor and comparators (ie, clopidogrel, placebo, and aspirin). Doses in HESTIA3 have been selected to result in a less pronounced level of platelet inhibition (~35 % to 80%) than doses used in adult patients with cardiovascular disease (>80%), and unlike in these patients, ticagrelor will not be combined with aspirin in HESTIA3. A lower bleeding risk is therefore anticipated in HESTIA3 than in previous adult cardiovascular outcome stud ies. Selected doses for HESTIA3 are within the range evaluated in children and young adults (HESTIA1 and HESTIA2). No safety concerns were raised from these studies, and there was no indication of an increased bleeding risk with ticagrelor. Prasugrel an d clopidogrel are other drugs in the P2Y 12 inhibitor class, but unlike ticagrelor , which reversibly inhibits the P2Y 12 receptors on platelets, these are irreversible P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors . The recen t paediatric Phase III study with prasugrel in childr en with SCD (Heeney et al 2016 ) investigated doses resulting in around 20% platelet inhibition, with no significa nt difference in the safety end points, including the frequency of bleeding events requiring medical intervent ion, compared to placebo. Although not in children with SCD, the CLARINET study with clopidogrel randomi sed 906 infants aged ‚â§92 days with congenital heart disease to clopidogrel or placebo for a median of 5.8 months ( Wessel et al 2013 ) using doses shown to give an average platelet inhibition of 45 % to 50% ( Wessel et al 2013 , Li et al 2008 ). No increased bleeding risk was observed for clopidogrel compared to placebo in this study. In HESTIA3, measures will be taken to minimise bleeding risk in participating patients. The eligibility criteria, restrictions and discontinuation criteria are tailored to exclude patients with increased risk for bleeding from participation, and ot her medications impacting platelet"
20,page_20,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 21(123) activity or the coagulation system are restricted. Frequent monitoring of patients is included in the protocol. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review unblinded study results regularly during the trial and will have increased attention on bleeding events. The procedures during study visits are not considered to increas e risk above routine care. Topical anaesthesia will be offered prior to blood sampling, and sampling will be coordinated in time as much as possible to reduce discomfort to children. This study will evaluate ticagrelor efficacy and safety when added to s tandard of care treatments in SCD. Hence, study participants are not withheld from any other treatments that may be used in SCD (eg, hydroxyurea) during the trial, which is important considering the use of a placebo control group. In summary, considering the high unmet need for treatme nts reducing the rate of such severe and serious condition s as VOCs in paediatric patients in SCD, previous trials in SCD populations with similar drugs suggesting potential for beneficial effects, and previous paediatric tri als in patient with SCD or other diagnoses not raising safety concerns, and the specific measures taken in the HESTIA3 study to minimise the risk to study participants, the benefit -risk balance for participants in this study is considered favourable. 1.4 Stud y design This is an international, multicentre, double -blind, randomised, parallel -group, placebo -controlled Phase III study to evaluate the effect of ticagrelor versus placebo in reducing the rate of VOCs in paediatric patients with SCD ( Figure 1). During the treatment period, patients will be monitored for occurrence of VOCs and other acute SCD complications. Study participants shoul d receive standard of care for SCD, adjusted to the individual patient at the discretion of the Investigator , including routine health care screening examinations and immunisations according to local guidelines and health care programmes. Study drug will be given on the background of standard treatments for SCD. However, restrictions apply to some medications and interventions that may be necessary for the patient's health and well -being during the study. Temporary hold of study drug dosing could therefore be needed in case of short -term treatment with a medication not to be combined with study drug or in case of surgical interventions. Patients are to be followed for up to 24 months or until a common study end date (CSED) is reached defined as 12 months after the last patient is randomised . The target population are children aged ‚â•2 to <18 years of age and body weight of ‚â•12 kg diagnosed with HbSS or HbS/Œ≤0. At least 50 evaluable patients should be recruited in each of the age groups, ‚â•2 years to <12 years and ‚â•12 years to <18 years ."

The Sponsor has the overall responsibility of the study. 1.5.2 Data Monitoring Com mittee A DMC composed of independent SCD p aediatric experts and including a platelet expert and statistician , will be appointed for this study and will report to the SC . The DMC will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of the patients in the study by assessing the safety of the intervention during the study, and for reviewing the overall conduct of the clinical study . The DMC will have access to unblinded individual data and be able to evaluate these while the study is ongoing . The DMC meeti ng schedule is shown in Table 1. Additional meetings could be initiated by the DMC chair or the Sponsor as needed. The DMC will consider recommending study terminati on for any episode of bleeding deemed related to the ticagrelor treatment that is fatal, or is a spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage, or if the accumulating data suggest a strong likelihood of excessive haemorrhagic events possibly related to ticagrelor t hat require medical intervention as reported by the Investigator. Study termination will also be considered if the number of fatal or life -threatening serious adverse events (SAEs), including but not limited to bleedings, is greater in ticagrelor -treated patients compared to placebo. The DMC will make recommendations on the progression of the study based on the totality of data (eg, AEs, safety laboratory variables, ticagrelor exposure and platelet inhibition) or other findings putting patients at undue ri sk. The Sponsor has the final decision on study progression including amendments, etc. Additionally, the DMC will do a formal interim PD assessment when 60 patients have had their PK/PD sampling after 4 weeks in the study. In this interim PD assessment, the mean of pre-dose and 2 h ours post dose PRI values at 4 weeks will be calculated for each individual and compared to their respective baseline values. The population mean of the platelet inhibition in the ticagrelor arm is expected to be above 35% during the study. If there is a ris k of not achieving the targeted inhibition level of 35 % to 80% in the study, the first task of the DMC would be to investigate if the PK values and the PK/PD relationship are as expected and in line with earlier documented PK/PD data of ticagrelor. If any finding is deemed by the DMC to not be in accordance with expected PK and PD data and all other reasons for the unexpected findings are ruled out , they will contact the Sponsor and ask for proof of treatment"

Procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled patients see Sec tion 3.3. 3.3 Subject enrolment and randomisation Investigator(s) should keep a record, the patient screening log, of patients who entered pre-study screening. Enrolment can occur 7 -28 days before randomisation. The Investigator(s) will: 1. Obtain signed informed consent/assent (per local requirements) from caregiver of the potential patient and from the patient (if applicable) before any study specific procedures are performed. 2. Assign (using the Interactive Voice/Web Response System [IXRS]) potential patient a unique enrolment number, beginning with ‚ÄòE + 4-digit site number + 3-digit patient"
28,page_28,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 29(123) number starting with 501. For example, the first patient at site 9999 would be assigned the patient number: E9999001 . This number will be used for identification (ID) throughout the study and will not be used for any other participant. 3. Determine patient eligibility. See Section s 3.1 and 3.2. 4. Assign eligible patient unique randomisation code (patient number), by accessing IXRS. Patients who have not been randomised can be re -enrolled in the study if they meet eligibility criter ia at a later date; however, no patient can be re -randomised. Any re-enrolment of patients must be done in consultation of the Sponsor ‚Äôs Study Physician and any decision must be captured in the patient ‚Äôs medical notes. If a patient withdraws from partici pation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation code cannot be reused. 3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomised subjects Patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria must not, under any circumstances, be enrolled or receiv e IP. There can be no exceptions to this rule . Patients who are enrolled , but subsequently found not to meet all the eligibility criteria must not be randomised or initiated on treatment , and must be withdrawn from the study. Where a patient does not mee t all the eligibility criteria but is randomised in error, or incorrectly started on treatment, the Investigator should inform the AstraZeneca Study Physician or representative immediately, and a discussion should occur between the Astra Zeneca Study Physic ian and the I nvestigator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the subject from treatment. The AstraZeneca Study Physician or representative must ensure all decisions are appropriately documented. In those cases where continuation of study therapy is judged not to present a concern related to safety and disease management, the rationale for continuing study therapy must be clearly documented. The patient should continue follow -up in accordance with defined study procedures. 3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups The randomisation codes will be computer generated by AstraZeneca R&D and loaded into the IXRS database. Randomisation codes will be generated in blocks to ensure approximate balance (1:1) between the 2 treatment arms (ticagrelor or placebo bd). Stratification for baseline hydroxyurea use by country will be applied. For each patient randomised the IXRS will provide the Investigator with a unique kit ID number matching the treatment arm assigned to the patient. Following randomisation, the first dose of study drug will be administered to the patient as soon as possible. At randomisation and subsequent dispensing visit s, the patient should always be provided medication with the kit ID(s) allocated by the IXRS. If a patient receives the incorrect randomised treatment at any time during the study, this must be corrected as soon as discovered after discussing with the Study Physician ."
29,page_29,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 30(123) 3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding This is a double -blind study. Ticagrelor and matching ticagrelor placebo tablets will be identical in appearance and packaging . The bottles with IPs will be labelled with unique ID numbers allocated from the IXRS, but it wil l not indicate treatment allocation. No member of the study team at AstraZeneca or representative, personnel at study centres or any contract research organisation (CRO) handling data will have access to the randomisation scheme during the conduct of the s tudy, with the exception of the AstraZeneca personnel generating the randomisation scheme and the bioanalysis personnel analysing the pharmacokinetic (PK) samples as well as AstraZeneca Supply Chain, the Patient safety data entry site and the CRO companies providing the IXRS and carrying out the packaging and labelling of IPs. This documentation will be kept in a secure location until the end of the study. There will be an independent, unblinded statistical team that will support the DMC with data during t he study. Personnel involved in the clinical study at AstraZeneca or representative will remain blinded to these analyses and will have no knowledge of the results presented to the DMC. 3.7 Methods for unblinding Individual treatment codes, indicating the tr eatment randomisation for each randomised patient, will be available to the Investigator(s) or pharmacists from the IXRS. Routines for this will be described in the IXRS user manual that will be provided to each centre. The treatment code should not be br oken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomisation. The Investigator documents and reports the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing the treatment given to patient to the AstraZeneca or representative staff. The number of individuals at the study site who become aware of the treatment status should be kept to an absolute minimum including keeping the patient blinded if possible. Treatment with study drug should be continu ed if considered appropriate. AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. Treatment codes will n ot be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual patient have been made and documented. 3.8 Restrictions The following restrictions will be applied for patients participating in the study: 1. Patients may not participate in another clinical study that involves an IP (active or placebo) or device during this study."

Females of childbearing potential (after menarche) must not become pregnant. Sexually active females of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception, which results in a low failure rate (ie, <1% per year) from enrolment to the follow -up visit. If this cannot be secured, the patient cannot continue in this study. Examples of highly effective methods inclu de implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices, or vasectomized partner . For male study participants, there are no restrictions against fathering a child when treated with ticagrelor. 3. For concomitant medications which ar e restricted during the study, see Appendix G. 4. If the patient is receiving digoxin, levels should be monitored closely following initiation of IP and with any change in IP, see Appendix G. 5. Intake of grapefruit juice is not allowed. 6. Patients should p articipat e in annual ophthalmological and TCD examinations in age groups according to guidelines. 7. On visits with PK or vasodilator stimul ated phosphoprotein (VASP) sampling, the morning dose of IP should not be taken at home. The dose will be administered at the site. See Table 2 for study assessment schedule, and Sections 5.4.1 (PK) and 5.5.2 (VASP). 3.9 Permanent discontinuation or temporary stop of investigational product 3.9.1 Permanent discontinuation Patients may be permanently discontinued from IP in the following situations: 1. The patient (or caregiver ) is at any time free to discontinue treatment or advise the patient to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment 2. AE, as judged by Investigator, that with continued treatment would put the patient at undue risk 3. Severe non -compliance with the study protocol, as judged by Investigator and/or AstraZeneca 4. Severe illness or risk to the patient as judged by the Investigator 5. Any major bleeding, for bleeding definitions see Section 6.3.8 . 6. Repeated minor bleedings not needing medical intervention unless clearly not related to study drug (eg, minor trauma during playing), as judged by the Investigator 7. For females of childbearing potential, who are sexually active an d where effective contraception cannot be secured, the study treatment must be discontinued 8. In the event of pregnancy, study drug should be immediately permanently discontinued. The patient is encouraged to continue to be followed in the study according t o the study plan. 9. Conditional or Abnormal TCD findings, ie, TAMMV values are ‚â•153 cm/sec using TCDi technique (corresponding to ‚â•170 cm/sec by the non -imaging technique), indicating an increased risk of stroke. 10. Pathological findings on any imaging techniqu e indicating increased risk of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke 11. TIA or stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) 12.

Development of proliferative retinopathy. 17. Need for chronic use of NSAIDs defined as continuous intake >3 days per week 3.9.2 Temporary discontinuation Patients may be temporar ily discontinued from IP in the following situations: 1. Clinically significant thrombocytopenia (platelet count <80 x 109/L) which mandates an interruption of IP due to patient safety in the assessment of the Investigator. Repeat laboratory studi es and standard of care should be followed until resolution of laboratory abnormality and if deemed appropriate, the IP can be restarted when platelet counts are >100 x 109/L. 2. Major or minor surgery or invasive procedures, for example, intramuscular inject ions. The IP should be temporary stopped 5 days prior to the procedure and can be restarted when bleeding risk is considered low, as judged by the Investigator. 3. Temporary need of treatment with prohibited concomitant medications, see Appendix G. The IP may be interrupted temporarily at the discretion of the In vestigator; however, such cases are recommended to be discussed with the IQVIA Study Physician and the Sponsor Physician as soon as the Investigator is aware. 4. Novel coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, see Section 3.9.4 . Discontinuation of IP does not mean discontinuation of follow -up or termination of study participation. Study assessments should continue in all cases if possible. If patients are not willing to come back to study visits, the sites are encouraged to investigate patient barriers to study visit compliance and discuss with the Clinical Research Associate (CRA ) if there is any alternative follow -up schedule which can mee t patient expectations. Prior to implementing alternative follow -up schedules, AstraZeneca approval must be granted. 3.9.3 Procedures for permanent discontinuation of a subject from investigational product At any time, patients are free to discontinue IP, witho ut prejudice to further treatment. A patient that decides to discontinue IP will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. Adverse events (AEs) will be followed up ( see Section 6) and all IPs should be returned by the patient. Patients permanently discontinuing IP should always be asked to continue the regular visits. It is essential to collect as much data as possible for all patients throughout the study and especially all potential endpoint events. Complete"

If patients are not willing to come back to study visits, the sites are encouraged to investigate patient barriers to study visit compliance and discuss with the CRA if there is any alternative follow -up schedule which can meet patient expectations. Prior t o implementing alternative follow -up schedules, AstraZeneca approval must be granted. If a patient is withdrawn from study, see Section 3.10. 3.9.4 Procedures and guidance for temporary IP discontinuation in relation to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) If a patient is diagnosed with COVID -19 or is suspected to have COVID -19 and a n AE/SAE is reported (see Section 6.3.10 ), the Investigator should determine whether the patient‚Äôs IP administration should continue or be temporarily discontinued . Patients who are discontinued from IP due to COVID -19 are to remain in the study whenever possible for safety follow -up. In case a patient is unable to attend on-site visits for undergo ing safety -related assessments as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2), due to local public health rules, patient inability or patient /caregiver decision, the patient must be temporarily discontinued from IP, unless the safety -related assessments (including vital signs, physical examination, blood samples for safety laboratory assessments, urine for urinalysis, eDevice review, ECGs, VOCs, and recording of concomitant medications and AEs) can be performed at the patient‚Äôs home and/or local laboratories or other l ocal facilities by delegated site staff . Such temporary discontinuation of IP does not mean discontinuation of follow -up. In case it is not possible to perform on -site visits, the si te staff should keep in close contact with the patient to maintain awareness of their status and o n-site visits should be replaced by telephone contacts following the same procedures as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments for telephone visits (Table 3). Deviations from the study schedule of assessments due to COVID -19 will be identified as COVID -19 related protocol deviations and recorded appropriately. In the eve nt a patient is temporarily discontinued from IP, every effort should be made to have the patient/caregiver return all unused IP and empty bottles to the study site and study site staff should perform accountability as detailed in Section 7.6. If this is not possible : ‚àí patients should be clearly instructed that, in case of any tablets leftover in bottles already dispensed to them, they are not allowed to take the IP if they are not visiting the site ‚àí remaining IP should be returned during the first possible on -site visit ‚àí reasons for not returning the IP and instructions given to the patient should be thoroughly documented ."
33,page_33,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 34(123) According to the local public health rules and recommendations, as soon as the patient is able to undergo safety -related assessments as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2), then IP can be dispensed and treatment restarted. In the event a study site is impacted by COVID -19 in a way that results in an inability to perform study activities, the study monitor should be informed as soon as possible. If a patie nt is to be withdrawn from study, see Section 3.10. 3.10 Criteria for withdrawal 3.10.1 Screen failures Screening failures are patients who do not fulfil the eligibility criteria for the study, and therefore must not be randomised . These patients should have the reason for study withdrawal recorded as ‚Äò Failure to meet randomi sation criteria ‚Äô (ie, patient does not meet the required inclusion criteria or meet any of the exclusion criteria) . This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for screen failures (not randomised patients). 3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (ie, permanent discontinue o f IP and study schedule assessments), without prejudice to further treatment. Withdrawal of consent from the study must be documented by the Investigator in the patient medical records and recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) as well as in th e Informed Consent Form (ICF). The reason for permanent discontinuation of IP, the date of the last dose of the IP, reason for withdrawal and the presence of any AEs must be documented in the eCRF . The Investigator will follow -up AEs outside of the clini cal study . The patient will return the electronic device (eDevice) . If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced after randomisation. 3.11 Disconti nuation of the study The study may be terminated at individual centres per agreement between the Principal Investigator (PI) and AstraZeneca, eg, if the study procedures are not being performed according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP), or if recruitment i s slow. Enrolment in a country may be terminated in order to ensure a reasonable international distribution of patients. AstraZeneca may also terminate the entire study prematurely if concerns for safety arise within this study (see Section 1.5.2 for DMC) or in any other study with ticagrelor. Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patient at the time of discontinuati on of follow -up must be recorded in the eCRF."

Before any study -related assessments are performed, the informed consent/assent should be provided by the caregiver/patient, see Section 10.4. At Screening, consenting patients are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibility criteria. Patients who do not meet these criteria must not b e enrolled in the study. If the patient has had any serious illness after Visit 1 but before Visit 2, the need for repeated eligibility laboratory sampling must be evaluated before randomisation. If the Visit 1 laboratory results are less than 10 days ol d at randomi sation , they can replace randomi sation safety laboratory sampling to minimi se the blood volume drawn. Unless done within previous 12 months, the Investigator must ensure TCD and ophthalmology examination are performed before proceeding in the study, see Section 3.2 for exclusion criteria related to these examinations. These examinations should thereafter be done annually during the study period. 4.2 Treatment period 4.2.1 Physical visits at study sites during the treatment period Descriptions of the procedure s for this period are included in the Schedule of Assessments for physical visits at study sites (Table 2). At Visit 2, ensure the eligibility of the patient before continuing study -related assessments. The Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) should be the first study assessment, ie, before blood sampling, electrocardiogram (ECG), etc. The patient will be administered his/her first dose of the double -blind treatment at the site. The collection of study assessments should be ensured before dispensing of the first dose. After the first dose is taken, assess palatability/swallowability. For all on -site visits, remind the pa tient: ‚Ä¢ To bring the IP bottles and the electronic Device ( eDevice ; including unscheduled visits) to the study site ‚Ä¢ Not to take their dose at home in the morning of the visits with PK/PD sampling scheduled at the visit . The patient should be reminded on ho w to use the eDevice including during a potential VOC e vent, regardless of primary setting of treatment (eg, in -patient hospitalisation, short -stay outpatient unit, emergency department or self -treated), see Section 5.1.1 . Contraceptive metho d should be reviewed and monitored in females of childbearing potential."
40,page_40,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 41(123) On visits with PedsQL, the instrument should be completed before any other study asses sments. Ensure that there are not more than 100 days between two planned visit s containing dispensing of IP to ensure tablet supply for all days. If feasible, study visits may take place at the patient‚Äôs home or other setting if travel to the site is not possible due to the COVID -19 situation. 4.2.2 Telephone visits during treatment period Descriptions of the procedures for this period are included in t he Schedule of Assessments for telephone visits during the treatment period (Table 3). Telephone visits should occur between the Investigator at the s tudy site, and the caregiver for the patient. The I nvestigator may decide to speak directly with a patient in the late teenage period, if judged appropriate based on the Investigator‚Äôs thorough knowledge of the patient. Similar to on -site visits, the tele phone visit should be documented in the patient‚Äôs medical records. Notes are to include: ‚Ä¢ Any AEs, ‚Ä¢ Whether an AE fulfils criteria for VOC endpoint or not, ‚Ä¢ Any changes of medications, ‚Ä¢ Any use of contraceptives (applicable to femal es of childbearing poten tial). See Appendix E, a Guide for Scheduled Telephone Visits for further details on conduct of the telephone visits. 4.2.3 End of study visit Patients are to be followed up to 24 months or until a common study end dat e is reached defined as 12 months after the last patient is randomised. After the CSED have been communicated by AstraZeneca or representative, all patients still in the treatment period should be scheduled for the End of Study Visit (see Table 2). The End of Study Visit should be done within 30 days after CSED. The patients should return the eDevice and the IP bottles. The Safety Follow -up Visit should be scheduled. 4.2.4 Safety follow -up visit Descriptions of the procedures for this visit are included in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). 4.2.5 Unscheduled visits For any safety or tolerability reasons, the patients may return to the clinic for an unscheduled visit."

Procedur es performed are at the discretion of the Investigator . Unscheduled visits should not affect the regular visit schedule and assessments. 5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS The Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and query handling. The Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRF as specified in the Clinical Study Protocol and in accordance with the instructions provided. The Investigator will ensure the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data recorded and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA) . The Investigator will sign the completed eCRFs . A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site. An eDevice will be used by the patient/caregiver for electronic recording of pain according to FPS-R/FLACC when experiencing a VOC, analgesic use and absence from school/work due to SCD . 5.1 Efficacy assessments 5.1.1 Vaso -occlusive crisis A VOC is the composite of a painful crisis and /or an ACS (Howard et al 2015 , Yawn et al 2014 ). Each component is defined as: A painful crisis is an onset or worsening of pain that lasts at least 2 hours, for which there is no explanation other than vaso -occlusion and which requires therapy with oral or parenteral opioids, parenteral NSAIDs, or othe r analgesics prescribed by a health care provider in a medical setting (such as a hospital, clinic or emergency room visit) or at home. An ACS is an acute illness characterised by fever and/or respiratory symptoms, accompanied by a new pulmonary infiltrate on a chest X -ray. 5.1.1.1 Collection of VOC A VOC occurring during the study should be recorded by the Investigator both as a primary endpoint event, and also as an AE . A potential VOC judged by the Investigator not to fulfil the definition of the primary endpoint should be also recorded as an AE according to standard AE reporting procedures (see Section 6). Collection of some information related to the potential VOC should be done by the patient/caregiver in real -time in the eDevice, and not based on recollection at the next planned visit. When information related to a poten tial VOC is entered in the eDevice, the Investigator will be alerted and should, unless a contact already occurred, call the caregiver within 72 hours from the onset of the potential event to enable a medical consultation and event data collection (see Appendix D, Interview Guide for VOC -triggered Telephone Calls) . Families"
42,page_42,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 43(123) will be instructed to call the site in case of a VOC, unless already contacted by th e site within 72 hours. Regardless of primary setting of treatment (eg, in -patient hospitalisation, short -stay outpatient unit, emergency department or self -treated), some VOC -related information outlined below must be documented by the caregiver in the p atient‚Äôs eDevice . The Investigator only, will judge if the potential VOC fulfil the definition of VOC (see Section 5.1.1 for definition) . If needed, the Investigator should request medical records and/or other documents from other medical facility than the study site . It will be the Investigators‚Äô responsibility to document the VOC in medical records and ensure that the VO C data in the eCRF is correct. Following information will be captured in the eDevice to be reviewed by the Investigator: ‚Ä¢ Start and stop date/time of the VOC event ‚Ä¢ Assessment of worst pain intensity will be done once daily throughout the duration the VOC event (Patient/Observer Reported), see Section 5.1.2 . ‚Ä¢ Report of anatomical location (s) of pain will be done once daily throughout the duration of the VO C event (Patient/Observer Reported). ‚Ä¢ If analgesic s are taken during the VOC (Yes/No ) and the Investigator will enter details of the analgesics (ie, name, type, dose, routes of administration, frequency ) into the eCRF . The following data should be collected in the eCRF, based on review of eDevice entries, information from the medical consultation and copies from other medical facilities : ‚Ä¢ Confirmation if the event fulfils the VOC definition ‚Ä¢ Date of any telephone contact ‚Ä¢ Start and stop date/time of the event ‚Ä¢ Primary setting for VOC treatment (eg, in -patient hospitalisation, short -stay outpatient unit, emergency department or self -treated) ‚Ä¢ Start and stop date/time of any in -patient hospitalisation ‚Ä¢ Treatments administered of th e event ‚Ä¢ Complete AE/SAE form. 5.1.1.2 Training in the collection of VOC events Patients will be supplied with a handheld eDevice for the treatment period. Caregivers must be willing to learn and use the eDevice and/or supervise the use of the eDevice. At Visit 2, all patients and their caregiver will be carefully instructed and trained on how to handle and complete the eDevice. Written information will be supplied to each patient and caregiver in an age -adapte d way in their local language. Instructions for use of the eDevice will also be described in writing in the ICF for the caregiver , in age -adapted language in the paediatric assent form (if used in certain age groups), and in the ICF for any participants t urning 18 years of age during the study period."
43,page_43,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 44(123) The patient and the caregiver will be instructed on how and where to request help if problems occur. The Investigator is responsible to ensure that this training is performed at Visit 2 and any subsequent vi sits as needed. The patient /caregiver should be reminded to use the eDevice during a potential VOC event, regardless of primary setting of treatment ( eg, in -patient hospitalisation, short -stay outpatient unit, emergency department or self -treated ). The pa tients and caregiver must bring the eDevice to each visit for the Investigator to review of eDevice entries. The patients and their caregiver should also be informed that p ain during a VOC , location of pain and use of analgesic should be entered daily to the eDevice . The daily question s on pain intensity, pain localisation and analgesic use must be responded to on the actual day ; these data cannot be entered for other dates. In case an already resolved VOC event was not registered in the eDevice, start and stop date are still possible to record retrospectively. Pain intensity, pain localisation and analgesic use cannot be record ed for these events in the eDevice. However, analgesic use during resolved eve nts need to be recorded by the Investigator in the eCRF together with any other event details as for all VOC events. When information related to a potential VOC is entered in the eDevice, the Investigator will be alerted and should, unless a contact alread y occurred, call the caregiver within 72 hours from the onset of the potential event to enable a medical consultation and event data collection. Families will be instructed to call the site in case of a VOC, unless already contacted by the site. Expectati ons on Investigator's documentation of endpoint events will be discussed at the Investigators meetings. Before the first patient is enrolled into the study at a study site, an AstraZeneca representative will review and discuss the requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol and related documents again with the study staff in the Start -up Meeting, and train them in any study -specific procedures, including collection of data for the primary efficacy endpoint. Study monitoring will include review of data ent ered for the primary efficacy endpoint to ensure the data are complete. Re -training of study staff will take place as needed. 5.1.2 Pain during a VOC Pain is commonly reported in clinical trials by having patients provide a rating of their own pain. In this st udy, pain rating will be done in the eDevice. Different measures of numerical rating scales have demonstrated good psychometric properties, but are not fit for purpose for the youngest age groups due to their limited understanding of number concepts. Therefore, pain-rating scales with a series of faces depicting different levels of pain have been developed. For young children (2 to ‚â§4 years of age), subjective observation of pain -related behaviours is recommended. The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) assessment tool is a measurement developed for and used to assess pain for children between the ages of 2 months and 7 years. The FLACC behavioural pain tool has shown good reliability and validity in assessing pain in critically ill adults and children ( Voepel -Lewis et al 2010 ). The FLACC will be caregiv er-reported for patients ‚â§4 years of age daily during the VOC event . Each of the"
44,page_44,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 45(123) 5 behaviours observed are assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2. The total FLACC score will then range between 0 and 10, with 0 representing no pain. The Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS -R) will be administered to all patients aged ‚â•5 years . When needed the caregiv er can help the child with the assessment. It is important to train caregivers not to attempt to influence child‚Äôs response in any way. The scale consists of 6 faces and scoring ranges between 0 and 10 (with an increase in numeric value by 2 [ie, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]), where 0 is no pain and 10 is very much pain . The FPS -R was validated by Hicks et al 2001 in 3 studies and has been judged as a well -established pain assessment tool in patients >4 years of age ( Cohen et al 2008 ). A body outline diagram will also be presented and the patient /caregiver will be asked to indicate the location (s) of the pain . See Appendix H for details of these pain assessments. Worst p ain ratings will be collected once daily throughout the duration of the VOC event using an eDevice. All instruments will be based on patients‚Äô age at baseline, and the same version should be used throughout the study . 5.1.3 Health -related quality of life (HRQL) The HRQL will be assessed using the PedsQL SCD Module and Multidimensional Fatigue Scale . The SCD module consists of 43 items and measures problems with the patients‚Äô pain (severity, impact, management/control), worry, emotions, treatment and communication. The SCD module measures 9 sub -scales and a total score. The Multidimensional Fatigue S cale consists of 18 items measuring problems with general, sleep/rest and cognitive fatigue . The Multidimensional Fatigue Scale measure 3 sub -scales and a total score. The SCD module and the Fatigue Scale when used in SCD have shown acceptable to excelle nt measurement properties in both the patient -reported versions for ages 5 to 18 years and the parent -reported version for ages 2 to 4 years (Panepinto et al 2013 , Panepinto et al 2014 ). Both instruments have been developed in age -specific versions . In this study, the patient -reported versions are for patients ages 5 to 7, 8 to 12, and 13 to 18 years, respectively. For pa tients 2 to 4 years of age, the parent -reported version will be reported by a caregiver . See Appendix I for details of HRQL. Data will be collected using pen and paper at t he site and will be administered at randomisation and every 6 months thereafter. Appropriate procedures for minimising bias and enhancing compliance will be followed throughout the study. To ensure this, all study personnel will be trained to instruct th e patient in a standardised way and further be responsible for providing all relevant instructions and training to the patients. A standardised procedure for the administration of the HRQL questionnaires should be applied. Each centre must allocate respon sibility for completion of the PedsQL questionnai res to a specific individual ( eg, a Research Nurse). It is also important that the significance and relevance of the data are explained carefully to participating patients/caregivers so that they"
45,page_45,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticag relor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 46(123) are motivated to comply with data collection. The following applies to completing the PedsQL questionnaires: ‚Ä¢ The patient/caregiver must complete it in private in their own time. ‚Ä¢ PedsQL should preferably be completed before any investigations or discussions about the disease with the clinic staff and prior to any other study -related procedures. ‚Ä¢ The patient/caregiver should be reassured that there are no right or wrong answers and that the answers are strictly confidential. ‚Ä¢ Help should not be given from caregivers or clinical staff with the exception that the patient can receive help from a study nurse in understanding the instructions. However, under no circumstances should help in interpreting the questions or in selecting responses be provided. ‚Ä¢ A form will be completed by the clinic staff to indicate if a questionnaire has been completed at each visit, and if not, the reason will be recorded. ‚Ä¢ On com pletion of the questionnaires they should be handed back to the person responsible for questionnaires who should check for completeness. ‚Ä¢ Only 1 answer should be recorded for each question. 5.1.4 Absence from school/work due to SCD For patient s attendi ng school or work at randomisation , absences from school/work due to SCD will be recorded weekly by the patient in the eDevice with the help of the caregiver, if needed . The patients will be asked the question ‚ÄòHave you been at ho me from school/work the last 7 days because of your disease‚Äô. If the reply is ‚ÄòYes‚Äô, the patient will be prompted to answer how many days he/she has been absent. Days off from school due to study visits will not be recorded. 5.1.5 Acute SCD complications The a cute SCD complications will be defined as the composite of individual complications and be evaluated as secondary endpoint : TIA/isch aemic stroke, hepatic sequestration and splenic sequestration, priapism and dactylitis . If the frequency allows, the indivi dual components can be assessed as exploratory endpoints. 5.2 Safety assessments 5.2.1 Laboratory safety assessments Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology, virology, coagulation and urinalysis will be taken at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). Local clinical routine procedures to reduce pain and discomfort from blood sampling in children will be followed, eg offering topical anaesthesia, coordinated sampling to avoid repeated punctures and use of in -dwelling catheters as appropriate in accordance with ethical and instruction guidelines for p aediatric blood sampling. Additional safety samples for laboratory assessment may be collected during unscheduled visits if clinically indicated at the discretion o f the Investigator . The date and time of collection will be recorded in the eCRF."
46,page_46,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 47(123) The clinical chemistry, haematology, virology and coagulation analyses will be performed at a central laboratory when possible or at an authorised/certified local laboratory as needed . All sampling, handling and transporting of samples will be in accordance with IATA Guidance Document (Appendix B). Urinalysis is to be performed at the investigational site by dipstick . Urine pregnancy test will be taken at all visits for females of childbearing potential . If female patients achieve menar che during the study, a urine pregnancy test should be performed before any study procedures at the next visits. The laboratory variables in Table 4 will be measured. Table 4 Laboratory variables Haematology/Haemostasis (whole blood) Clinical Chemistry (serum) B-Haemoglobin (Hb) S-Creatinine B-Haematocrit S-Bilirubin, total B-Leukocyte count S-Bilirubin, direct B-Leukocyte differential count (absolute count) S-Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) B-Platelet count S-Aspartate transaminase (AST) S-Alanine transaminase (ALT) Urinalysis (dipstick) S-Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) U-Hb/Erythrocytes/Blood S-Uric Acid U-Prote in/Albumin S-Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) U-Glucose S-Albumin U-beta-human chorionic gonadotropin ( Œ≤-hCG) S-Potassium S-Chloride Virology Screena S-Sodium Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) S-Glucose Hepatitis C virus (HCV) S-Haptoglobin HIV Malaria Screen (not mandatory) Coagulationa Microscopy (blood smear evaluation) International normalised ratio (INR) Rapid diagnostic tests Prothrombin time (PT) Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) B blood; S serum; U urine. a Virology screen and coagulation will be conducted at the Screening Visit only.

47,page_47,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 48(123) as source data for laboratory variables. For information on how AEs based on laboratory tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 6.3. NB. In case a patient shows an AST or ALT ‚â•3 √ó ULN and total bilirubin ‚â•2 √ó ULN , refer to Section 6.3.7 for further instructions. 5.2.2 Physical examination A complete physical examination will include an assessment of the following: general appearance , respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, hea d and neck (including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, musculo -skeletal and neurological systems. A brief examination of physical examination will include the following: general appearance , respiratory, cardiovascular and abdomen systems . Physical examination will be performed at timelines as specified in the Schedule of Assessment in Table 2. Investigators should pay special attention to new or worsening abnormalities as they may qualify as AEs, see Section 6.3.6 for details. 5.2.3 ECG 5.2.3.1 Resting 12-lead ECG A 12 -lead ECG (standard ECG with a paper speed of 25 or 50 mm/second covering at least 6 sequential beats) will be recorded after the patient has been lying down to rest for up to 5 minutes. After ECG has been recorded, the Investigator or des ignated physician will review each of the ECGs and enter as ‚ÄòNormal‚Äô or ‚ÄòAbnormal‚Äô in the eCRF. If the ECG is evaluated as ‚ÄúAbnormal‚Äù the Investigator should document the specific abnormality as clinically significant or not. A standardised ECG machine should be used and a paper copy of ECG tracing should be filed in the patient‚Äôs medical records. 5.2.4 Vital signs 5.2.4.1 Weight and height Weight and height assessments will be performed at the visits as shown in Table 2. Results available in medical records, as taken on the visit da y, will be recorded in the eCRF . The stud y site staff should use a digital precision scale if possible, and record the weight i n kilograms or pounds to the first decimal point (eg, 95.3 kg). The same scale should be used and the patient should wear a standard hospital -type gown or equivalent light clothing and no shoes for the body weight measurement at each visit. 5.2.4.2 Pulse rate and blood pressure Pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be assessed using non -invasive equipment after the patient has been sitting at rest for 5 minutes . Results will be recorded in the eCRF."
48,page_48,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 49(123) 5.3 Other assessments 5.3.1 Palatability and swallowability Palatability will be assessed by age groups. The Facia l Hedonic Scale (FHS) is a well-established method for assessing paediatric patients‚Äô responses to drug palatability for patients down to 3 years of age ( Davies and Luleu 2008 ). The FHS consists of 5 faces with descriptions ranging from ‚ÄòDislike very much‚Äô to ‚ÄòLike very much‚Äô. Patients ‚â•5 years of age will be asked to evaluate palatability immediately after dosin g using the FHS at baseline and at 6 months . For patients < 5 years of age a n observer ‚Äôs assessment of the patient‚Äôs behaviour, including willingness to swallow, will be performed directly after the patient has received the IP at baseline and at 6 months . See Appendix F for details. 5.4 Pharmacokinetics 5.4.1 Collection of samples Blood samples for determination of ticagrelor and its active metabolite (AR -C124910XX) in plasma will be taken at the times presented in Table 2. Collection of PK samples should be time matched with PD samples . The PK results will not be available to site . The actual date and time for each sample will be collected in the eCRF. A PK sample will be collected 0 hours (predose) and 2 hours postdose (no predose sample at randomisation visit) . On visits with PK and/or VASP sampling, patients should not take IP (morning dose) at home prior to the visit, as this will be administered at the site. If morning dose accidently was taken prior to visit, no new d ose will be administered at the site and no predose sample will be taken. The actual time for dosing should be noted and a postdose sample aiming for 2 hours should be taken . Regardless of time in relation to actual dose intake the time for this postdose sample should be recorded. The time of last dose intake prior to any PK visits (ie , the evening dose the day before the visit) needs also to be precisely recorded in the eCRF to be able to relate the predose PK sample concentrations to time after ticagr elor dose intake. The predose PK sample also contains important information on the relationship of ticagrelor dose to exposure and platelet inhibition response and therefore, the correct time recording of the evening dose is equally important as the sampl e itself. In case of increased dose due to increased weight, PK sample will be collected at the next following visit. The PK sample will be collected 0 hours (predose) and 2 hours postdose. Samples will be collected, labelled stored and shipped as deta iled in the Laboratory Manual. A central laboratory will be used for the logistic arrangements. 5.4.2 Determination of drug concentration Samples for determination of ticagrelor and its active metabolite (AR -C124910XX) in plasma will be analysed by Covance on behalf of the Sponsor, using an appropriate bioanalytical"
49,page_49,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 50(123) method. Full details of the analytical method used will be described in a s eparate Bioanalytical Report. All samples still within the known stability of the analytes of interest (ie, ticagrelor and its active metabolite), at the time of receipt by the bioanalytical laboratory, will be analysed. 5.4.3 Storage and destruction of pharmaco kinetic samples Pharmacokinetic samples will be disposed of after the Bioanalytical Report finalisation or 6 months after issuance of the draft Bioanalytical Report (whichever is earlier), unless requested for future analyses. Pharmacokinetic samples may b e disposed of or destroyed and anonymised by pooling. Additional analyses may be conducted on the anonymised, pooled PK samples to further evaluate and validate the analytical method. Any results from such analyses may be reported separately from the Cli nical Study Report (CSR). Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, will be performed alongside the bioanalysis of the test samples. The results from the evaluation will not be reported in the CSR but separately in a Bioanalytical Report. For each placebo patient, samples will only be analysed on a ‚Äòfor cause‚Äô basis, eg, if no quantifiable concentrations were observed in a patient‚Äôs samples when the drug was expected to be present. 5.5 Pharmacodynamics 5.5.1 Vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein Vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein is a critical protein that is expressed in platelets at high levels and plays a major role in negatively regulating secretory and adhesive events that are involved in platelet aggregation. The effect of ticagrelor on inhibition o f platelet aggregation will be assessed by the VASP assay during treatment period ( Voepel -Lewis et al 2010 ; Laine et al 2013 ). 5.5.2 Collection of samples Blood samples for determination of platelet aggregation in whole blood will be taken at the time presented in Table 2. Except for the important PD sample taken prior to fi rst dose of study drug at Visit 2 randomisation where no PK sample is taken, the c ollection of PD samples are thereafter matched with PK samples. To maintain the blinding of treatment allocation, the PD results will not be available to the site, and individual PD results will not be available to the Sponsor. The time of last dose inta ke prior to any VASP visits (ie , the evening dose the day before the visit) needs also to be precisely recorded in the eCRF to be able to relate the predose VASP inhibition to time after ticagrelor dose intake."
50,page_50,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 51(123) The predose VASP sample also contains import ant information on the relationship of ticagrelor dose to exposure and platelet inhibition response and therefore, the correct time recording of the last dose the evening before the visit is equally important as the sample itself. In case of increased dos e due to increased weight, the PD sample will be collected at the following visit. The PD sample will be collected 0 hours (predose) and 2 hours postdose. Samples will be collected and labelled as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. 5.5.3 Storage and destruction of pharmacodynamics samples Pharmacodynamic samples may be disposed of or destroyed and anonymised by pooling. Additional analyses may be conducted on the anonymised, pooled pharmacodynamic samples to further evaluate and validate the ana lytical method before finalisation of the CSR . Any results from such analyses may be reported separately from the CSR. Samples will be stored until the study is finalised , after which they will be destroyed. Detailed information about samples storage can be found in the Lab oratory Manual. The results of any investigation will be reported either in the CSR itself or as an addendum, or separately in a scientific report or publication. 5.6 Genetics (Not applicable ) 5.7 Biomarker analysis (Not applicable ) 5.8 Volume of blood The total maximum volume of blood that will be drawn from each patient at each study visit is listed in Table 5 below.

SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT The PI is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study a re familiar with the content of this section. 6.1 Definition of adverse events An AE is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (eg, nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not consider ed related to the medicinal product. The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a deterioration of a pre -existing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event A SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run -in, treatment, washout, follow -up), that fulfils 1 or more of the following criteria: ‚Ä¢ Results in death ‚Ä¢ Is immediately life-threatening ‚Ä¢ Requires in -patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation ‚Ä¢ Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity ‚Ä¢ Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect ‚Ä¢ Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix A to the Clinical Study Protocol."
52,page_52,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 53(123) 6.3 Recording of adverse events 6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events Adverse events will be collected from the time of randomisation , and throughout the study, including the follow -up period. Any SAEs sho uld be collected from when the ICF is signed. 6.3.2 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient‚Äôs last AE assessment in the study are followed up by the Investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further re cording in the electronic case report form (eCRF). AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 6.3.3 Variables The following variables will be co llected for each AE: ‚Ä¢ AE (verbatim) ‚Ä¢ The date and time when the AE started and stopped ‚Ä¢ Maximum intensity ‚Ä¢ Whether the AE is serious or not ‚Ä¢ Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no) ‚Ä¢ Action taken with regard to IP ‚Ä¢ Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: ‚Ä¢ Date AE met criteria for serious AE ‚Ä¢ Date Investigator became aware of SAE ‚Ä¢ AE is serious due to ‚Ä¢ Date of hospitalisation ‚Ä¢ Date of discharge ‚Ä¢ Probable cause of death ‚Ä¢ Date of death ‚Ä¢ Autopsy performed ‚Ä¢ Causality asses sment in relation to study procedure(s) ‚Ä¢ Causality assessment to other medication ‚Ä¢ Description of AE. It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 6.2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree o f"
53,page_53,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 54(123) disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2. The definitions for intensity rating are: ‚Ä¢ Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) ‚Ä¢ Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities) ‚Ä¢ Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities). 6.3.4 Causality collection The Investigator will assess causal relationship between IP and each AE, and answer ‚Äòyes‚Äô or ‚Äòno‚Äô to the question ‚ÄòDo you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the IP?‚Äô For SAEs , causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‚Äòyes‚Äô. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix A to the Clinical Study Protocol. 6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or car e provider or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff: ‚ÄòHave you/the child had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?‚Äô , or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When coll ecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests The results from the Clinical Study Protocol -mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared with baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory values, vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IP. If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting Investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE."

Please refer to Appendix C for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of H y‚Äôs Law . 6.3.8 Assessment of bleeding events Bleeding events will be recorded as AEs. The Investigator will do the classification of bleeding events. Bleeding events will be recorded in the eCRF. For patients experiencing a bleeding event that fulfils criteria in more than 1 category, the bleed will be assigned to the most severe ca tegory. The bleeding definitions (Mitchell et al 2011 ) are: ‚Ä¢ Major bleeding: defined as any fatal bleeding, clinically overt bleeding associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 20 g/L (2 g /dL), bleeding that is retroperitoneal, pulmonary, intracranial, or otherwise involves the central nervous system or bleeding that requires surgical intervention in an operating suite. ‚Ä¢ Clinically relevant non -major b leeding: defined as overt bleeding for which a blood product is administered and which is not directly attributable to the patient‚Äôs underlying medical condition, and bleeding that requires medical or surgical intervention to restore haemostasis, other than in an operating suite. ‚Ä¢ Minor bleeding: defined as any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that does not fulfil the above criteria for either major bleeding or clinically relevant, non -major bleeding. Menstrual bleeding resulting in a medical consultation and/or intervention will be classified as a minor bleeding event. 6.3.9 Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOCs) and acute SCD complications A VOC and acute SCD complications (TIA/isch aemic stroke, hepatic sequestration and splenic sequestration, priapism and dactylitis) occurring during the study should be recorded by the Investigator as AEs. For a definition and collection of VOC s, see Sectio n 5.1.1 and for acute SCD complication, see Section 5.1.5 . ‚Ä¢ A VOC fulfilling the criteria should also be recorded as an adverse event with the diagnosis Sickle cell anaemia with crisis. ‚Ä¢ If the VOC event includes symptoms of other acute SCD complications, these should also be recorded, but separately from the VOC e vent in the eCRF. 6.3.10 Procedures in relation to COVID -19 infection If a patient presents with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID -19 infection , the Investigator should request a test where possible and this should be recorded i n the AE field of t he eCRF as follows:"
55,page_55,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 56(123) ‚Ä¢ If test is positive, record as ‚ÄúCOVID -19 confirmed‚Äù . ‚Ä¢ If test is negative, record the AE/SAE signs and symptoms and/or other diagnosis. ‚Ä¢ If test is not available and signs and symptoms, as judged by the Investigator, are highly suspicious of COVID -19 infection, record as ‚ÄúCOVID -19 suspected‚Äù. If other concurrent diagnoses exist , eg, pneumonia, the Investigator should record as separate AEs. If an AE/SAE is associated with COVID -19, the Investigator should determine whether the patient‚Äôs IP should be continued, temporarily interrupted or permanently stopped . Refer to Section 3.9.4 for guidance on procedures in relation to COVID -19. All AE reporting instructions in this section and SAE reporting in Section 6.4 also apply to any AE/SAE associated with COVID -19. 6.4 Reporting of serious adverse event s All SAEs have to be reported to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative , whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF. If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, other than mentioned in Section 6.3.9 , then Investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day , ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it (see also Section 6.4.1 ). The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active follow -up is undertaken immedi ately. Investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow -up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar day , ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it . Once the Inv estigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone . The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator/study site staff how to proceed. The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the AstraZeneca drug."

There is currently no known antidote to reverse the effects of ticagrelor, and ticagrelor is not expected to be dialysable. Treatment of overdose should follow local standard medical practice. The expected effect of excessive ticagrelor dosing is prolonged duration of bleeding risk associated with platelet inhibition. If bleeding occurs appropriate supportive measures should be taken. In healthy adults, ticagrelor is well tolerated in single doses up to 900 mg. Gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) was dose -limiting in healthy adults following ascending single doses. Other clinically meaningful adverse effects, which may occur with overdose, include dyspnoea and ventricular pauses. In the event of overdose, observe for these potential adverse effects, and consider ECG monitoring. Measure platelet inhibition to determine the extent and duration of excessive platelet inhibition. ‚Ä¢ An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module. ‚Ä¢ An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose CRF module. If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel inform appropr iate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Pati ent safety data entry site. For overdoses associated with a SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply, see Section 6.4. For overdoses not fulfill ing SAE criteria, AstraZenceca will ensure that the overdose is reported to the AstraZeneca data entry site within 30 calendar days of awareness . 6.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca representatives. 6.6.1 Materna l exposure If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study IP should be discontinued immediately."
57,page_57,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 58(123) Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IP under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancie s (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study. If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day , ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it . The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient safety data entry site within 1 or 5 calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies. The same timelines apply when outcome information is available. The eCRF is u sed to report the pregnancy. T he outcome of the preg nancy is reported on a separate form outside the eCRF . 6.6.2 Paternal exposure There is no restriction on fathering children or donating sperm during the study. Pregnancies in partners are not to be reported. 6.7 Medication error For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that either causes harm to the subject or has the potential to cause harm to the subject. A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or subject. Medication error includes situations where an error: ‚Ä¢ Occurred ‚Ä¢ Was identified and intercepted before the patient received the drug ‚Ä¢ Did not occur, but circumstances were recogni sed that could have led to an error. Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors: ‚Ä¢ Drug name confusion ‚Ä¢ Dispensing error , eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actua lly given to the patient"

STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY ASTRAZENECA OR DELEGATE Statistical analyses are summarised below . Further details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 8.1 Statistical considerations Statistical analyses will be performed by IQVIA under the dir ection of Biometrics & Information Sciences, AstraZeneca using SAS¬Æ version 9.2 or higher and, where appropriate, additional validated software. IQVIA will finalise the SAP according to any required regulatory timelines but before review of any potential t reatment revealing data is undertaken (this includes Blind Deliverable Reviews and Data Monitoring Committee reviews). 8.2 Sample size estimate The number of VOC s is assumed to have a negative binomial distribution with shape parameter 0.8. The mean number of crises per year is assumed to be 2.0 in the placebo group with reduction of 50% in the ticagrelor group. Patients will be randomised to 1:1 ratio and with minimum follow -up of 12 months and average follow -up of 18 months, 154 patients provide about 90% p ower for a 2 -sided test of the mean number of crises for ticagrelor versus placebo, at significance level 5%. Allowing for dropouts, the sample size is increased to 182. The calculations were based on simulation with 5,000 repetitions. Scenarios and simu lations were evaluated to assess the risk with shorter and longer mean follow -up time. To ensure that the study is adequately powered the recruitment rate will be monitored and the sample size may be adjusted to a maximum of 200 patients. With a mean follow-up time of 13 month, 200 patients will provide 90% power to detect a reduction of 50% in the ticagrelor group. 8.3 Definitions of analysis sets 8.3.1 Full analysis set All randomised patients, regardless of treatment received, will be included in the Full Analysis Set. The primary statistical analysis of the efficacy of ticagrelor will be carried out on the Full Analysis Set. Patients will be analysed according to their randomised IP. 8.3.2 Safety analysis set All patients who receive at least 1 single dose of randomised IP, ticagrelor or placebo, and for whom any postdose data are available, will be included in the safety analysis set. Erroneously treated patients (eg, those randomised to treatment A but actually given treatment B) will be accounted for in the actual treatment group, where actual treatment is defined as: ticagrelor if a patient receives at least 1 dose of ticagrelor, otherwise actual treatment is placebo."
63,page_63,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Ticagrelor Study Code D5136C00009 Version 3.0 Date 20 April 2020 64(123) 8.3.3 PK analysis set All patients who receive at least 1 dose of IP and provide at least 1 post dose analysable plasma sample for PK analysis will be included in the PK analysis set. Patients with major protocol deviations including changes to the procedures that may impact the quality of the data, or any circumstances that can alter the evaluation of the PK may be excluded from the PK analysis set. 8.3.4 PD analysis set All patients who have receive at least 1 dose of IP and provide at least 1 postdose analysable sample for PD analysis will be included in the PD analysis set. Patients with major protocol deviations including changes to the procedures that may impact the quality of the data, or any circumstances that can alter the evaluation of the PD may be excluded from the PD analysis set. 8.4 Outcome measure for analyses See Section 2 for outcome measures. 8.5 Methods for statistical analyses In general; ‚Ä¢ Ticagrelor data will be pooled and analysed irrespective of dose. ‚Ä¢ Safety, p lasma concentrations of ticagrelor and active metabolite, HRQL variables will be presented using descriptive statistics and graphed as appropriate. ‚Ä¢ Categorical variables will be summarised in frequency tables (number of patients and percentage), by treatm ent group. ‚Ä¢ Continuous variables will be presented with descriptive statistics (n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation [SD], median, min, max), within treatment group. If appropriate, geometric mean and coefficient of variation (CV) will be used instead of arithmetic mean and SD, with CV (%) calculated as: ( ) ( ) 1 exp 1002‚àí ÔÉós where s is the SD of the data on a log scale. ‚Ä¢ Data will also be presented in individual patient listings. ‚Ä¢ Baseline values will be the closest observation prior to and including t he randomisation visit. 8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variable The primary analysis will be based on the intent -to-treat principle. Ticagrelor data will be pooled and analysed irrespective of dose. The number of VOCs will be analysed using negative binomial regression. Any VOC event with an onset date within 7 days from a prior event onset date will not be counted as a new"

The response variable is the number of VOCs experienced by a patien t over the treatment period. Patient follow -up time (log -transformed) will be included as an offset in the linear predictor to adjust for patients having different exposure times. Additional covariates to be adjusted for in the linear predictor will be t reatment group (placebo as reference group) and baseline hydroxyurea therapy (Yes/No). The treatment effect will be tested at a 5% significance level. If the negative binomial distribution is not appropriate, a Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used. As the Wilcoxon rank sum test cannot be adjusted for the patients follow -up time, sensitivity analyses will be performed to ensure robustness of the results. The primary analysis (under the treatment policy estimand) includes all data until patients withdraw f rom the study regardless of if they discon tinue from randomised treatment . The primary analysis uses the negative binomial regression model with logarithm of the observation period as an offset term and assumes that missing data is missing at random. Hence, the model assumes that the frequency -of-events during an unobserved period is the same as the frequency estimated using observed data. To examine the sensitivity of the results and the robustness of this assumption analyses will be performed using cont rolled multiple imputation method. For this method, an underlying negative binomial stochastic process for the number of VOCs is assumed and post study withdrawal counts will be imputed based on the observed number of events prior to the withdrawal. The following, but not limited to, missing data analysis will be performed: ‚Ä¢ Missing counts in each arm are imputed assuming the expected event rate within that arm. This method corresponds closely to the original model and the results are expected to correspo nd closely to the primary analysis . This analysis is included to allow for comparison with the partial -DRMI method. ‚Ä¢ Multiple imputation based on dropout reason (partial -DRMI); Missing counts will be imputed differently depending on the reason for dropout; meaning that counts for patients in the ticagrelor arm who withdraw consent for a potential treatment related reason are imputed based on the expected event rate in the placebo arm, whereas the remaining patients who have withdrawn consent are imputed ass uming missing at random . Potential treatment related reasons include but are not limited to AEs, deaths and development of study specified reasons. 8.5.2 Analysis of the secondary variables If numbers allow, the following will be analysed using the same analys is method as the primary endpoint: number of painful crises, number of ACSs, duration of painful crises, number of VOCs requiring hospitalisation or emergency department visits, number of days hospitalised for VOC, number of acute SCD complications, number of days hospitalised for acute SCD complications, and number of sickle cell -related red cell transfusions."

Descriptive statistics will be presented for the intensity of VOC -related pain, proportion of day‚Äôs absence from school or work due to SCD and HRQL score ; no statistical testing will be performed for these endpoints . The descriptive statistics will include n, arithmetic mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum . 8.5.3 Analysis of the exploratory variables For categorical variables, the population size (N for sample size and n for available data) and the percentage (of available data) for each class of the variable will be presented. Continuous variables will be summarised using descriptive statistics, incl uding n, arithmetic mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum values. If appropriate, geometric mean and CV will be used instead of arithmetic mean and SD. A population PK and PK /PD analysis may be performed and include an investigation of the impact of (or lack of) relevant demographic and disease -related covariates. This analysis will be reported separate from the CSR. 8.5.4 Analysis of the safety variables Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Number of patients with events and percentages will be tabulated by preferred term and system organ class. An event that occurred once or more times during the treatment period will contribute 1 observation to the numerator of the proportion. The denomin ator of the proportion will comprise all patients in the safety set. Adverse events will also be summarised by intensity/severity and separately, by causality/relatedness (as determined by the Investigator). Should a patient report the same preferred ter m/system organ class within multiple intensity/severity or causality/relatedness categories, the patient‚Äôs worst occurrence (most severe/most related) will be tabulated.

Agreements between AstraZeneca and the PI should be in place before any study -related procedures can take place, or patients are enrolled. 9.2.3 Archiving of study documents The Investigator follows the principles outlined in the CSA. 9.3 Study timetable and end of study The end of the study is defined as ‚Äòthe last visit of the last patient undergoing the study ‚Äô. The study is expected to start in Q 2 2018 and to end by Q 4 2020. The Sponsor will notify the PI(s) when recruitment is complete. 9.4 Data management by AstraZeneca or delegate Data management will be performed by IQVIA . Data will be entered into the WBDC (Inform) system at the study site. Trained site staff will be entering the data as specified in the protocol and according to the eCRF instructions. Data entered into the WBDC system will be immediately saved to a central database and changes tracked to provide an audit trail. The data will then be Source Data Verified, reviewed, queried and update d as needed. Adverse events and medical/surgical history will be classified according to the terminology of the latest version the MedDRA. Medications will be classified according to the World Health Organisation Drug Dictionary. All coding will be per formed by IQVIA . The PI is responsible for signing the eCRF and this may be delegated to a trained Investigator. The data will be validated as defined in the Data Management Plan. Quality control procedures will be applied to each stage of data handling t o ensure that all data are reliable and have been processed correctly. The Data Management Plan will also clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various functions and personnel involved in the data management process. When all data have been coded, validated, signed and locked, clean file will be declared. Any treatment revealing data may thereafter be added and the final database will be locked. A copy of the eCRF will be archived at the study site when the study is completed. Serious adverse eve nt (SAE) reconciliation SAE reconciliation reports are produced and reconciled with the AstraZeneca Global safety database."

It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. During the course of the study the Inve stigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry. The Investigator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets potential Hy‚Äôs Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. The Investigator participates, together with AstraZ eneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induce d Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting Adverse Events (AEs) and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessmen t in line with standard safety reporting processes.

For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the same day) the elevation in total bilirubin level , but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and total bilirubin level must occur. Identification of Potential Hy‚Äôs Law Cases In order to identify cases of P HL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any subject who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination: ‚Ä¢ ALT ‚â•3 √ó ULN ‚Ä¢ AST ‚â•3 √ó ULN"

No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, th e Study Physician contacts the Investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP. The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and Globa l Safety Physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate. According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Investigator will follow the instructions below. If there is an agreed alternati ve explanation for the ALT or AST and total bilirubin level elevations, a determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE: ‚Ä¢ If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the appropriate CRF . ‚Ä¢ If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE/SAE in the CRF accordingly and follow the AstraZeneca standard processes .
