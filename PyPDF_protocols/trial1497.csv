Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 4 of 173 x Evaluate the efficacy of naproxen vs. placebo for assay sensitivity using the primary and secondary endpoints indicated above. x Determine plasma levels of V120083 in subjects under clinical use conditions. x Evaluate supplemental analgesic medication use x Evaluate treatment response x Evaluate the occurrence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation or behavior using the Columbia – Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Study Design (Methodology): This is a phase 2a, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of V120083 vs placebo in subjects with moderate to severe chronic pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee (Figure 1). The total duration of the study for a given subject is up to 56 days, inclusive of a 21 day screening period; a 28 day double blind treatment period; and a 7 day follow up period. Naproxen 500 mg bid will be used as an active control to determine the assay sensitivity of the study. During the screening period, subjects will be assessed for their eligibility and those who are qualified to continue in the study will be randomized at visit 2 in equal ratios to receive 1 of the following 4 treatments in the double-blind period: V120083 30 mg bid, V120083 60 mg bid, naproxen 500 mg bid, or placebo. Clinic visits during the double-blind period will occur at week 1 (visit 3), week 2 (visit 4), and week 4 (visit 5/end-of-study visit). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be collected at visits 2, 3, 4, and 5. The PK evaluation will involve two components: intense PK sampling and sparse PK sampling. Sparse PK sampling will be conducted for all subjects enrolled (276 subjects), with samples collected at visits 3 (predose, 1 and 2 hours postdose), 4 (predose or postdose), and 5 (predose or postdose) during the treatment period. Intense PK sampling will be conducted for 24 subjects, consisting of the sparse PK schedule and visit 2 predose sample and postdose sampling at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours (day 1 of dosing). The study will include pharmacogenomics (PG) sampling that will be optional for all subjects. Starting at screening, subjects may take their own supplemental analgesic medication, ie, 500 mg acetaminophen (APAP) which can be taken as needed up to 2 g/ 24 hours for breakthrough pain, but is not to be taken within 24 hours of visit 2. Acetaminophen 500 mg will be provided as supplemental analgesic medication during the double-blind period. Subjects may take no more than 4 tablets of APAP/acetaminophen 500 mg per 24 hours (ie, no more than 2 g/24 hours) and no more than 2 tablets of APAP/acetaminophen 500 mg at any one time for breakthrough pain. All subjects must refrain from taking any supplemental analgesic medications for at least 24 hours prior to the clinic visits during the double-blind period (ie, no supplemental analgesic medication is allowed during the 24 hour period before the week 1 [visit 3], week 2 [visit 4], and week 4 [visit 5] visits during the double-blind period). An interim analysis may be performed for futility when approximately 50% of randomized subjects have completed the study. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review all unblinded safety and efficacy data from the analysis and make recommendations, as necessary, for plans for additional studies in the clinical program."

Based on in vitro data, V120083 is a CYP3A4/5 substrate and has the potential to inhibit P-gp and CYP3A4/5. Concomitant administration of CYP3A inhibitors, inducers, substrates, and P-gp substrates are restricted as follows: x Subjects taking strong CYP3A inhibitors will be excluded from the study due to potential increases in plasma levels of V120083 when co-administered with V120083. Subjects who initiate these medications during the study will be discontinued from the study. x Subjects taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors will be excluded if the dose has not been stable for at least one month prior to start of study drug dosing (see Appendix Q for a representative list of moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors). Subjects who discontinue therapy with moderate CYP3A inhibitors during the study will be permitted to continue on the study x If the subject is taking multiple moderate CYP3A inhibitor(s) or the category is unknown, the investigator should contact the medical monitor and subjects are to be carefully monitored. x Subjects taking CYP3A Inducers will be excluded from the study due to potential decrease in plasma levels of V120083. Subjects who initiate these medications during the study will be discontinued from the study. x Subjects taking CYP3A sensitive substrates and substrates with narrow therapeutic range, or P-gp substrates will be excluded from the study due to potential increases in plasma levels of such medications when co-administered with V120083. Subjects who initiate these medications during the study will be discontinued from the study. (See Appendix Q for a list of inducers and substrates) APAP/acetaminophen may be used intermittently for headache, fever, or acute pain up to the 2 g per 24 hour maximum amount; low-dose aspirin (81mg daily) for cardiovascular disease prophylaxis is allowed.

Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 10 of 173 At visit 1, after written informed consent is obtained, the subject will undergo a complete evaluation for study eligibility. To qualify for the study, subjects must meet all initial study entry criteria, including a self-reported average pain intensity rating of moderate or severe on a verbal rating scale (ie, none, mild, moderate, severe) over the 7 days prior to the screening visit. For subjects with OA pain at both knees, the investigator will identify the more painful knee joint to serve as the index knee for the study. Subjects will be instructed to record all pain assessments based on the index knee. Telephone Contact and Washout Period As soon as the laboratory results, ECG results, and radiograph results are available, the site staff will contact the subjects by telephone to inform them of the results and whether they are qualified to continue in the study. Subjects who do not meet the initial entry criteria will be considered screen failures. For subjects who meet the initial entry criteria and: x Who do not take any analgesic medications for their pain, the site staff will instruct them to record in the diary their “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores for their index knee at approximately 8 PM every evening for 3 to 7 days. These subjects may return to the study clinic for visit 2 as soon as they have “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores  4 and  9 for  3 consecutive days. All subjects must return to the study clinic for visit 2 within 96 hours of the latest qualifying pain score entry within the pain assessment period. x Who are on topical and/or oral analgesics (including NSAIDs, opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or other medications for OA), the site staff will instruct them to discontinue from these medications in accordance with accepted medical practice. Once all medications used for pain have been discontinued, the subjects will undergo an analgesic washout period of up to 9 days. During this period, the subjects will record in the diary their “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores for the index knee at approximately 8 PM every evening for 3 to 9 days. These subjects may return to the study clinic for visit 2 as soon as they reported “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores of  4 and  9 for  3 consecutive days. All subjects must return to the study clinic for visit 2 within 96 hours of the latest qualifying pain score entry within the pain assessment period. x Subject’s own supplemental analgesic medication, ie, APAP/acetaminophen, is permitted to be taken during the washout period as needed (PRN) up to 2 g/24 hours. Supplemental analgesic medication is not to be taken within 24 hours of visit 2. Concomitant medications and AEs will be documented during this telephone contact. Rescreening of subjects who previously failed screening is allowed only with the permission of the medical monitor on a case by case basis. Subjects may be considered for rescreening if they failed screening previously due to eligibility criteria that are now allowed under the current amended protocol; delay of acquiring records; out of window issues (eg, lost or delayed labs); timing of exclusionary procedures; or other reasons approved by the medical monitor. Subjects with positive hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency results, subjects with a positive urine drug test (UDT) for illicit drugs or non-prescribed opioids; and/or subjects who previously received study drug in a V120083 trial will not be permitted to be rescreened.

Prior to entering the double-blind period, the subjects’ “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores will be assessed to determine the subjects’ eligibility to continue in the double-blind period. To qualify for entry into the double-blind period, subjects must have “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores of  4 and  9 for  3 consecutive days during the pain assessment period. Subjects who do not qualify for the double-blind period will be discontinued from the study as screen failures. Subjects who are eligible for the double-blind period will have visit 2 (Day 1) scheduled in the morning. At this visit, all qualified subjects will be randomized to receive the double-blind treatments. The first dose of study drug will be administered at the study clinic. For subjects in the intensive PK subgroup, blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be collected predose and postdose at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours. These subjects will remain at the study clinic until the PK samples are collected. Clinic visits during the double-blind period will occur at week 1 (visit 3), week 2 (visit 4), and week 4 (visit 5) visits. All clinic visits should occur in the morning. During these visits, PK samples will be collected at visits 3 (predose, 1 and 2 hours postdose), 4 (predose or postdose), and 5 (predose or postdose) during the treatment period. Supplemental analgesic medication is APAP/acetaminophen 500 mg. No more than 4 tablets/24 hours (ie, no more than 2 g/24 hours), as needed, will be permitted during the double-blind period. All subjects will be instructed to refrain from taking any supplemental analgesic medication for at least 24 hours prior to the weeks 1, 2, and 4 visits (visits 3, 4, and 5, respectively) of the double-blind period and to refrain from taking study drug dose on the morning of clinic visits to allow for predose PK sampling. Subjects are allowed a ±1 day window for visit 3, and a ±2 day window for visits 4 and 5. All scheduled visits in the double-blind period will be anchored to the day of randomization (visit 2). Subjects who discontinued treatment early will be instructed to return to study clinic for an early discontinuation visit (visit 5). After the end of the study or early discontinuation, subjects will be converted to a pain regimen as deemed medically appropriate by the investigator/designee. Follow-up Period (7 days) Subjects will receive a telephone call approximately 1 week after the end-of-study visit to assess subject status and documentation of AEs and concomitant medications. Criteria and Methods for Evaluation: Efficacy Variables/Endpoints: Primary Efficacy Variable: The primary efficacy variable in this study is the “average pain over the last 24 hours” score from the mBPI-SF pain severity subscale at week 4 of the double-blind period.

Drug Concentration Measurements: Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be collected at visits 2, 3, 4, and 5. The PK evaluation will involve two components: intense PK sampling and sparse PK sampling. Sparse PK sampling will be conducted for all subjects enrolled (276 subjects), with samples collected at visits 3 (predose, 1 and 2 hours postdose), 4 (predose or postdose), and 5 (predose or postdose) during the treatment period. Intense PK sampling will be conducted for 24 subjects, consisting of the sparse PK schedule and visit 2 predose sample and postdose sampling at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours (day 1 of dosing). A single sample of blood (6 mL) will be taken for each time point. The date and time of dosing and sampling will be documented on the case report forms (CRFs). Analytical Methodology: Plasma concentrations of V120083 and possibly its metabolites will be quantified by a validated bioanalytical method. Safety Variables: Safety will be assessed using adverse events (including SAEs), clinical laboratory results, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, ECGs, C-SSRS, and results from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Pharmacogenomic Sampling: The study will include PGx sampling that will be optional for all subjects . Statistical Methods: Analysis Populations: The enrolled population consists of all individuals who sign the informed consent form. The safety population is the group of subjects who are randomized and receive at least 1 dose of the double-blind study drug. The full analysis population (FAP) is the group of subjects who are randomized, receive at least 1 dose of double- blind study drug, and have at least 1 efficacy assessment. The per-protocol population is a subset of the full analysis population and consists of all subjects in the full analysis population (FAP) who do not have major protocol violations. The Pharmacokinetics (PK) population consists of all individuals who are randomized and receive at least 1 dose of the V120083 and have at least 1 valid, quantifiable PK blood sample Efficacy Analysis: Primary efficacy analysis is based on the “average pain over 24 hours” score in the mBPI-SF pain severity subscale at week 4 and the analysis will be performed using a mixed-effect general linear model with repeated measures (MMRM). The MMRM will include treatment (4 levels: V120083 30 mg bid, V120083 60 mg bid, naproxen 500 mg bid, and placebo) and time (3 levels for weeks 1, 2 and 4) as fixed effects; the baseline pain subscale will be incorporated as fixed covariates, and subject will be a random effect. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) will be used to estimate the parameters in the model. While data from the entire double-blind period will be used to fit the linear model to get a better estimate of the variance-covariance matrix, the primary"

Secondary Efficacy Analysis: The PGIC rating score (obtained at the week 4 or end-of-study visit) will be measured on a 7-point scale in which 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse. The categories will be compared between treatment group and placebo using the Chi-squared test. Further analysis will be conducted on collapsed categories (very much improved/much improved vs improved/no change/worse/much worse/very much worse) using Fisher’s exact test. Other continuous longitudinal variables will be analyzed similarly to the primary efficacy method, using an MMRM. All hypothesis tests will be 1-sided and conducted at the 5% level of significance. Pharmacokinetic Analyses: Pharmacokinetic parameters of V120083 will be calculated based on the plasma concentrations of V120083 by using non-compartmental analysis for intense PK sampling component. A population PK analysis may be performed and will be reported in a separate report from the clinical study report. Interim Analysis: All interim analysis may be performed by the independent statistician/independent programmer and communicated to the independent (DMC. At the interim analysis, the following procedures will be performed: x Safety evaluation for early termination may be performed when 50% of subjects have completed the study. The independent statistician /programmer will provide safety data listings and summary tables by unblinded treatment arms. The DMC members will review the safety data, including AEs and clinical laboratory values. The decision to stop 1 or more treatment arms due to safety issues will be made based on clinical judgment. The arm will be stopped if there is significant physical toxicity or evidence of impending risk of physiologic harm or extremely abnormal laboratory findings related to treatment. x Efficacy evaluation for V120083 treatment arms may be performed by the independent statistician/programmer when 50% of subjects have completed the study. The 50% interim analysis will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of each dose of study drug in the study population. The DMC will review the results of the analysis and make recommendations, as appropriate, regarding plans for further studies. Lan et al (1982) introduced stochastic curtailment to stop a trial if, given current data, it is likely to predict the outcome of the trial with high probability. 32The conditional power at the scheduled end of the study, given the observed data at the interim evaluation, will be calculated with a stochastic curtailment approach to support the decision of early stop for futility. The conditional power is based on the formula given by Cui et al (1999, p. 854) and Emerson et al (2005, p. 13). 33,34 Safety Analysis: Safety analyses will include vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory parameters, AEs, ECGs, and C-SSRS results. AEs will be displayed by body system and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities®, and summarized in terms of severity and relationship to study drug. Vital signs analysis will include the mean, standard deviation, and range at baseline and at the end of the double-blind treatment period, and the change from baseline to the end of the double-blind treatment period. Laboratory parameters will be summarized for the randomized safety population by presenting summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, and range) at the baseline and end of double-blind treatment, and change from baseline values to end of double-blind treatment for each treatment group. Within-treatment comparisons during the double-blind period will be based on shift tables (3 by 3: low, normal, high classification [LNH]) for a particular laboratory test and will compare the baseline LNH to the end-of-double-blind LNH. ECG findings at each time point will be tabulated."

In the US, OA affects approximately 27 million patients of all ages.2 Pain, joint stiffness, and reduced motion lead to disability and loss of independence among patients with OA. An effective cure for OA remains elusive and analgesics provide the primary treatments. Current standard of care therapies for OA pain include use of traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can cause serious and sometimes life-threatening adverse effects associated with long-term use. Management of chronic pain, especially for OA patients, is in need of novel therapeutic options. Purdue Pharma, L.P. is developing V120083 for the management of pain due to OA. V120083 is a potent and selective TRPV1 receptor antagonist which was discovered in the collaborative research . TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily, member 1) is an ion channel located mainly on peripheral sensory neurons. TRPV1 plays a significant and unique role in the pain pathway because it is a polymodal initiator of pain signaling. Direct blockade of this channel is expected to interrupt the start of neuronal transmission of pain producing signals. TRPV1 is activated by a broad range of mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli including factors often associated with infection, inflammation or ischemia such as heat, low pH, nitric oxide, and lipoxygenase metabolite formation3, 4. TRPV1 expression on sensory neurons is also known to be increased in the presence of persistent inflammation. The hyperalgesia associated with the inflammatory process is related to this increase. The ultimate result is channel sensitization, which manifests as a potentiation of thermal, capsaicin, and pH responses in TRPV1 channels.3, 4 There are many published examples of novel TRPV1 antagonists that produce significant antihyperalgesia against thermal and mechanical endpoints in standard models of pain-like behavior in rodents. A number of these TRPV1 antagonists are currently in various stages of clinical development. Contact activation, tissue and/or cellular injury, and inflammation are each capable of direct and indirect modulation of the TRPV1 channel via multiple mechanisms. The mechanistic convergence of initiators and potentiators of the TRPV1 channel provide the conceptual basis for believing that TRPV1 antagonism might be an effective approach to treating pain associated with inflammation and nerve injury 3, 4."
24,page_24,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 25 of 173 V120083 has an analgesic effect, not only in rodent inflammatory pain models but also in rodent neuropathic pain models. These pharmacological profiles suggest an analgesic effect on chronic pain and various other pain mechanisms. In metabolism studies, in vivo metabolites in rats, dogs and humans and in vitro metabolites in cryopreserved human hepatocytes were identified. In rat and dog studies, V120083 mainly existed in an unchanged form in the plasma and the majority of V120083 was excreted as metabolites in the urine, the feces, and in bile. The major metabolic pathway of V120083 in the human plasma and cryopreserved human hepatocytes appears to be oxidation followed by glucuronidation and the formation of 5-methyl-2-oxoimidazolidinyl acetic acid (OAA), 2-oxoimidazolidinyl propanoic acid (OPA). In the 1 month repeated dose toxicity study in dogs, vomiting and low body weight accompanied with decreased food consumption were observed in both sexes treated at 600 mg/kg/day during dosing period. In the 3 month repeated dose toxicity study in dogs, these findings were also noted at the high dose of 500 mg/kg/day. In both the dog 3 month and rat 6 month repeat dose toxicology studies, the presence of study test article (V120083) manifested as crystal formation and deposition was observed in the lamina propria of the small intestine and/or mesenteric lymph node in the majority of animals in the high dose group in rats (1,000 mg/kg/day) and dogs (500 mg/kg/day). Crystals were also observed in mandibular lymph nodes and the lamina propria of several other organs in a smaller number of rats in the high dose group. The crystal deposition was identified as unchanged V120083 based on analytical identification and likely related to limitation in the solubility in body fluid including plasma. V120083 was negative in the following genotoxicity studies: in vitro bacterial reverse mutation test, mouse lymphoma assay, and in vivo micronucleus test with rat bone marrow cells. Potential genotoxicity of S189A6, an impurity of V120083, has been also evaluated. S189A6 was negative in in vitro micronucleus test and in vivo combination study of micronucleus and comet assays in rats, while S189A6 was concluded to be positive in the reverse mutation test with bacteria."
25,page_25,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 26 of 173 Some investigational TRPV1 antagonists have demonstrated deficits in thermosensory function, placing patients at risk for inadvertent cutaneous and oral burns6. These issues have not been seen in prior studies with V120083. Subjects will receive additional instructions on how to avoid thermal injury. This present study, VAN2001, is the first efficacy study planned for V120083. Osteoarthritis (OA) has been chosen as a chronic pain model of choice to demonstrate efficacy. OA is a leading cause of pain, loss of function, and disability in Western populations, and radiographic evidence of OA is present in the majority of adults by the age of 65 years 7. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as naproxen, are the most frequently used analgesics for the treatment of mild to moderate OA pain 8, and thus naproxen is being used in this study as a positive control. Although efficacious, NSAIDs are associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects and a potential increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Therefore, alternatives for the chronic treatment of OA pain are needed. Expression of the TRPV1 receptor is upregulated in animal models of OA 9. In patients with OA, injection of the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin into affected joints relieves pain, presumably by desensitizing the TRPV1 receptor10. Thus, antagonism of the TRPV1 receptor may be useful in the treatment of OA pain. Additional information pertaining to V120083, including its physicochemical properties in in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies specifically its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology, are presented in the Investigator’s Brochure 5. Refer to the V120083 Investigator’s Brochure for additional product information. Refer to Appendix E for naproxen product information."
26,page_26,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 g 7.1 Potential Risks and Benefits The safety assessments of V120083 rely on data accumulated during product development and data on other drugs in the class. Based on the preclinical and clinical data available to date, the conduct of the trial is regarded as justifiable at the planned doses and duration. V120083 is being considered as a new option for the treatment of pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee. No identified risks or new potential risks have emerged from the phase I clinical studies performed. V120083 was safe and generally well tolerated by healthy human volunteers at single doses up to 1000 mg and at multiple doses up to 300 mg bid administered for up to 14 days. The dose of V120083 (30 mg or 60 mg) selected for the proposed trial is within the dose ranges studied in the phase I trials. Important potential risks to subjects are based on nonclinical safety data of V120083 and the phase 1 clinical studies. The most common TEAEs reported in the MAD study were feeling cold and feeling hot, reported in subjects receiving higher doses (100 mg and 300 mg) of V120083. No subjects in the 30 mg dose group experienced these events and only 1 AE each of feeling cold and feeling hot were reported by placebo-treated subjects. These AEs were expected due to the mechanism of action of V120083; no clinically significant changes in body temperature were observed. One subject, who received multiple doses of 300 mg V120083, experienced an SAE of pleural effusion. This SAE was considered not related to study drug. V120083, like other TRPV1 antagonists, may attenuate response to noxious heat stimuli. Therefore, subjects receiving V120083 should be cautioned to take measures to avoid the occurrence of burn injury. Such measures include keeping the hot water thermostat  120 degrees Fahrenheit (F), checking water temperature, using potholders or oven mitts when handling cookware, and taking care when eating hot foods or drinking hot beverages. Risk minimization measures include a data monitoring committee (DMC) to review available safety and tolerability data and will be mandated to make decisions regarding the conduct of the trial according to the DMC charter and interim analysis criteria. Additionally, the sponsor or representatives will review blinded safety data throughout the trial. The DMC members will review the safety data, including but not limited to AEs and clinical laboratory values. The DMC recommendations will include: 1) Continue the study without modification; 2) Continue the study and amend the protocol, as specified; 3) Pause enrollment, pending resolution of a specified issue; 4) Terminate the study. The decision to stop 1 or more treatment groups due to safety issues will be made based on review and recommendation by the DMC. Placebos are used in this trial to conceal whether a treatment is being given or not and hence to control for the psychosomatic effects of offering treatment. Randomization will be used in this trial to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown patient attributes (eg, demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups. Blinded treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of endpoints. Taking the above information into account, benefit-risk considerations support conduct of the proposed clinical trial VAN2001 in patients with OA pain of the knee."

The total duration of the study for a given subject is up to 56 days, inclusive of a 21-day screening period; a 28-day double-blind treatment period; and a 7-day follow-up period. Naproxen 500 mg bid will be used as an active control to determine the assay sensitivity of the study. During the screening period, subjects will be assessed to determine eligibility for enrollment into the trial. As soon as the laboratory, ECG, and radiograph results are available, the site staff will contact the subjects by telephone to inform them of the results and whether they are qualified to continue in the study. Subjects who do not meet the initial entry criteria will be considered screen failures. For subjects who meet the initial entry criteria and: x Who do not take any analgesic medications for their pain, the site staff will instruct them to record in the diary their “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores (Appendix N) for their index knee at approximately 8 PM every day for 3 to 7 days; these subjects may return to the study clinic for visit 2 as soon as they have “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores  4 and  9 for  3 consecutive days. All subjects must return to the study clinic for visit 2 within 96 hours of the latest qualifying pain score entry within the pain assessment period. x Who take medication for their chronic pain (including any topical and/or oral analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsant, and other medication used for pain), the site staff instruct them to:  Discontinue use of all medication for pain (including any topical and/or oral analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsant and other medication used for pain) in accordance with accepted medical practice and,  As soon as all medication used for pain is stopped, record in the diary their “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores for their index knee at approximately 8 PM every day for 3 to 9 days; these subjects may return to the study clinic for visit 2 as soon as they reported “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores of  4 and  9 for  3 consecutive days. All subjects must return to the study clinic for visit 2 within 96 hours of the latest qualifying pain score entry within the pain assessment period. Prior to entering the double-blind period, the subjects’ “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores will be assessed to determine the subjects’ eligibility to continue in the double-blind period. To qualify for entry into the double-blind period, subjects must have “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores of  4 and  9 for  3 consecutive days during the pain assessment period. Subjects who do not qualify for the double-blind period will be discontinued from the study as screening failures. Rescreening of subjects who previously failed screening is allowed only with the permission of the medical monitor on a case by case basis. Subjects may be considered for rescreening if they failed screening previously due to eligibility criteria that are now allowed under the current amended protocol; delay of acquiring records; out of window issues (eg, lost or delayed labs); timing of exclusionary procedures; or other reasons approved by the medical monitor."

X-rays for rescreened subjects do not need to be repeated provided they were originally collected as part of this study and occurred within 1 month of rescreening. All rescreening must be approved in advance by the medical monitor. Subjects who are eligible for the double-blind period will have visit 2 scheduled in the morning. After meeting eligibility requirements, approximately 276 subjects will be stratified for randomization in a 1:1:1:1 fashion according to the baseline severity of pain score (mBPI-SF average pain) and study site at visit 2 to receive 1 of the following 4 treatments in the double blind period: V120083 30 mg bid, V120083 60 mg bid, naproxen 500 mg bid, or placebo. The first dose of study drug will be administered at the study clinic. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be collected at visits 2, 3, 4, and 5. The PK evaluation will involve two components: intense PK sampling and sparse PK sampling. Sparse PK sampling will be conducted for all subjects enrolled (276 subjects), with samples collected at visits 3 (predose, 1 and 2 hours postdose), 4 (predose or postdose), and 5 (predose or postdose) during the treatment period. Intense PK sampling will be conducted for 24 subjects, consisting of the sparse PK schedule and visit 2 predose sample and postdose sampling at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours (day 1 of dosing). The study will include pharmacogenomics (PG) sampling that will be optional for all subjects. Clinic visits during the double-blind period will occur at week 1 (visit 3), week 2 (visit 4), and week 4 (visit 5). All clinic visits must occur in the morning. During these visits, blood samples for PK analysis will be collected as outlined in the Schedule of Activities (Table 3). The study will also include pharmacogenomics (PG) sampling that will be optional for all subjects. Starting at screening phone call visit, subjects may take their own supplemental analgesic medication, ie, 500 mg acetaminophen (APAP), which can be taken as needed up to 2 g/24 hours for breakthrough pain, but it is not to be taken within 24 hours of visit 2. Supplemental analgesic medication, APAP/acetaminophen 500 mg, will be provided during the double-blind period. No more than 4 tablets/24 hours (ie, no more than 2 g/24 hours), as needed, will be permitted during the double-blind period. All subjects will be instructed to refrain from taking any supplemental analgesic medication for at least 24 hours prior to the weeks 1, 2, and 4 (visits 3, 4, and 5, respectively) of the double-blind period. Subjects are allowed a ±1 day window for visit 3, and a ±2 day window for visits 4 and 5, from baseline. All scheduled visits will be anchored to the day of randomization (visit 2). Subjects who discontinued treatment early will be instructed to return to study clinic for an early discontinuation visit (visit 5). After the end of the study/early discontinuation visit, all subjects will be converted to a pain regimen as deemed medically appropriate by the investigator/designee. An interim analysis may be performed for futility when approximately 50% of randomized subjects have completed the study. An independent DMC will review all unblinded safety and efficacy data from the interim analysis and make recommendations as necessary."
31,page_31,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 32 of 173 Follow-up Period (7 days) Subjects will receive a telephone call approximately 7 days after the end of the study/ study discontinuation visit to assess subject status and documentation of AEs and concomitant medications. A study flow chart describing the schedule of activities for this study is presented in Table 3. 9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups The analgesic effect of V120083 is currently unknown. This is a proof-of-concept study designed to evaluate the efficacy of V120083 30 mg bid and 60 mg bid compared with placebo in subjects with chronic moderate to severe OA pain of the knee. This study will employ a double-blind, parallel-group design. This method is selected because it is the most efficient and nonbiased design to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of V120083 versus ( v) placebo. The duration of the double-blind period will be 28 days. This treatment duration was selected as this length of time was sufficient to demonstrate the onset of analgesic activity for a drug that may require repeated use for efficacy and for establishing maintenance of analgesic activity for chronic pain conditions such as OA. Naproxen 500 mg bid will be used in this study as active control. Naproxen is selected for this study because it has shown to be efficacious in treating subjects with OA pain of the knee in previous proof-of-concept studies conducted by PPLP. In this study, naproxen will be used to determine assay sensitivity for a successful study regardless of efficacy of the study drug. The purpose of the placebo group is to account for the placebo effect, that is, effects from treatment that do not depend on the treatment itself. Such factors include knowing one is receiving a treatment, attention from health care professionals, and the expectations of a treatment's effectiveness by those running the research study. Without a placebo group to compare against, it is not possible to know whether the treatment itself had any effect. The study population was chosen for study as it represents significant numbers of subjects who are suboptimally treated with currently available standard-of-care therapies. Only those subjects who meet protocol-specified criteria for inadequate analgesia will be eligible to enter the double-blind period. During the study, subjects will be asked to stop all incoming analgesic medications and other medications used for chronic pain and instead receive only the study drugs to manage their OA pain of the knee. Subjects are permitted to take supplemental analgesic medication throughout the double-blind period in order to maintain subjects in the study for the 4-week time course (except for 24 hours prior to the weeks 1, 2, and 4 visits). Randomization will be used in this study to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to study treatments, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg, demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Blinded treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of endpoints."

36,page_36,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 37 of 173 Reasons for discontinuation from the study and study drug at the same time during the double-blind period consist of the following: x Adverse event (if an AE causes a subject to withdraw from the study),  Note: worsening of the condition for which the subject qualifies for study entry (ie, OA pain in the index knee) will not be considered an AE; for these subjects, the reason for discontinuation should be recorded as lack of therapeutic effect (see below), or x Subject’s choice (the subject chooses for personal reasons, to withdraw from the study, eg, family emergency precluding the subject from continuing in the study, relocation of the subject, or a new work schedule which precludes the subject from further study participation), or x Lost-to-follow-up (the study clinic personnel lose contact with the subject). Once suspecting the subject is lost-to-follow-up, the study clinic must attempt to contact the subject by phone, making at least 3 documented attempts, each at least 1 week apart. Additionally, 1 registered letter must have been sent with a copy on file. The study clinic should only deem the subject as lost-to-follow-up no less than 30 days following the first documented phone call attempt, unless circumstances preclude this (eg, phone service has been discontinued, or there is other evidence that contact is not feasible), or x Lack of therapeutic effect (the subject chooses to withdraw from the study because he/she does not feel the study drug is effectively treating his/her condition under study or the investigator/medically qualified designee chooses to discontinue the subject from the study because, in his/her opinion, the study drug is not effectively treating the subject’s condition under study. The study clinic should confirm that worsening of OA pain in the index knee, not worsening of other pain, is in fact the cause for discontinuation, or x Confirmed or suspected diversion, or x Administrative reason (the subject discontinues from study early for any logistical, nonmedical reason that is associated with either the clinical site or sponsor, eg, the sponsor stops the study or the clinical site is no longer able or no longer approved to conduct the study). If the subject discontinues due to subject’s choice, administrative, or lost to follow-up reasons, the specific circumstances surrounding the discontinuation must be recorded. The investigator/designee should document instances of inability to tolerate treatment as discontinuations due to AE and record the specific symptom(s) and/or sign(s) (eg, nausea, vomiting). Instances of inadequate pain control in the index knee should be documented as lack of therapeutic effect. Dosing must be permanently discontinued for a study subject if he/she develops any of the following: 1. QTcF values > 500 msec or > 480 msec with a concurrent increase in QTcF > 60 msec from the mean screening value 2.

Dosage and Administration: Subjects will be instructed to take supplemental medication, as needed, for breakthrough pain only, no more than 2 tablets at a time (ie, no more than 1000 mg/dose) and no more than 4 tablets per 24 hours (ie, no more than 2 g/24 hours). Subjects will also be instructed not to take any supplemental medication for at least 24 hours before any scheduled clinic visit during the double-blind period. Supplemental medication is not considered a concomitant medication and will be recorded separately from concomitant medications. Drug Supplies Instructions : Drug supplies must be kept in an appropriate secure area (eg, locked cabinet) and stored according to the conditions specified on the drug labels. All other protocol-required treatments as identified in Table 1 and Table 2 and acetaminophen are not considered concomitant medications and will be recorded separately from concomitant medications. The study drug identification numbers (Med identification #) will be provided to the clinical site on the packing list with the study drug shipment. 9.4.3 Drug Accountability The PI and study staff will be responsible for the accountability of all clinical supplies (dispensing, inventory, and record keeping) following sponsor (or designee) instructions and adhering to GCP guidelines as well as municipal, state, and federal regulations. Under no circumstances will the PI and study staff allow the study drug to be used other than as directed by this protocol. Clinical supplies will not be dispensed to any individual who is not enrolled in the study. An accurate and timely record of clinical supplies must be maintained. This includes, but may not be limited to: (a) documentation of receipt and condition of clinical supplies, (b) documentation of study drug dispensing/return, (c) documentation of clinical supply product complaints, if any, (section 9.6.6 Clinical Supplies Product Complaints), (d) documentation of return of clinical supplies to sponsor (or designee), and (e) all shipping service receipts. All forms will be provided by the sponsor (or designee). The clinical site may use comparable forms to comply with any institutional SOPs. The supplies and inventory records must be made available, upon request, for inspection by designated representatives of the sponsor (or designee), representatives of the FDA, and representatives of US (including state or local) or international health authorities. All"
40,page_40,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 undispensed study drug and empty containers are to be returned by the PI and/or study staff and ultimately to the sponsor (or designee) at the conclusion of the study, unless provision is made by the sponsor (or designee). Upon completion of drug accountability and reconciliation procedures by clinical site personnel and by sponsor (or designee) personnel, study drug that is to be returned to the sponsor (or designee) must be sealed with tamper-evident seals and shipped back to the sponsor (or designee) following all local regulatory and shipment laws. 9.4.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups Subjects will be randomized at visit 2 by Interactive Web Response System/Interactive Voice Response System (IWRS/IVRS) to receive 1 of the 4 treatment groups according to a randomization schedule generated by sponsor (or designee) and will be assigned a unique randomization number. 9.4.5 Selection of Doses in the Study The doses selected for this study are based on the safety, tolerability, and PK profiles established from two phase 1 studies in healthy human subjects. In these studies, single doses of V120083 up to 1000mg and multiple doses up to 300mg bid for up to 14 days were safe and generally well tolerated. In this phase 2a, proof-of-concept study, the near maximal safe and tolerated dose of V120083 60 mg bid was selected as the highest dose level to maximize the chances to demonstrate efficacy. Additionally, V120083 30 mg bid will be evaluated to establish the therapeutic dose range of the study drug. 9.4.6 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient The dosing frequency of bid dosing for this study was selected on the basis of multiple-dose PK data generated in a phase 1 clinical study. For the doses selected in this study, bid administration of V120083 is estimated to provide plasma concentrations sufficient to achieve efficacy for subjects in studies and is expected to yield a trough concentration at 12 hours after V120083 dosing higher than the trough observed for nonclinical efficacious dose. 9.4.7 Blinding During the double-blind period of the study, the subject and all personnel involved with the conduct, analysis, and the interpretation of the study, including the investigators, clinical site personnel, and the sponsor (or designee) staff, will be blinded to the medication codes. The randomization schedule will be kept strictly confidential, filed securely by the sponsor (or designee), and accessible only to authorized persons per sponsor’s (or designee)’s SOPs until the time of unblinding. Unblinding a subject should only be done in emergency situations for reasons of subject safety. At the initiation of the study, the clinical sites will receive instructions for unblinding a subject. In the event that an emergency unblinding is required, the investigator/medically qualified designee should make every attempt to contact the sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee before breaking the blind."
41,page_41,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 42 of 173 When the blinding code is broken, the date, time of unblinding, and reason(s) must be fully documented in the source documentation. If not already done, the sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee must be contacted as soon as possible to notify him/her of the unblinding and to discuss the reason(s) for unblinding. In the event that an emergency unblinding is required, authorized IWRS users at the clinical sites and the sponsor or designee, will have the ability to retrieve the subject’s treatment group assignment through IVRS/IWRS. If not already done, the sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee must be contacted as soon as possible to notify him/her of the unblinding and to discuss the reason(s) for unblinding. 9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy At the screening visit, study staff will record all medications, including analgesics, used by the subject during the 30 days prior to screening. At all subsequent visits, including the post-treatment follow-up period, study staff will record concomitant therapy taken by a subject during the study; the reason for its use will be recorded. Prior and concomitant therapy is defined to include all medications (over-the-counter and/or prescription, including analgesics), procedures, and significant nonpharmacological therapies that are used to treat the subject, including those used in response to an AE/SAE, during the time periods relevant to study conduct. Prohibited concomitant medications: All medications used for chronic pain, other than the study drugs and supplemental analgesic medication, are prohibited during the study. Prohibited medication used for chronic pain includes all opioids, NSAIDs (other than the study drug), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, aspirin, gabapentin, antiepileptics, and antidepressants used for chronic pain (eg, tricyclics, selective serotonin /norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors [SSRIs,SNRIs]) Muscle relaxants (eg cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol) are prohibited. Muscle relaxants cannot be initiated during the study. Other prohibited concomitant treatments include benzodiazepines, monoclonal antibodies for osteoporosis, methotrexate, any local OA treatments for the knee(s), including topical anesthetics or NSAIDs; topical, intra-articular, or systemic corticosteroids (other than inhalers); or any OA injection in the knee(s), antidepressants (other than SSRIs used for depression), warfarin or anticoagulants, cyclosporine (except ophthalmic emulsion), and marijuana. Based on in vitro data, V120083 is a CYP3A4/5 substrate and has the potential to inhibit P-gp and CYP3A4/5. Concomitant administration of CYP3A inhibitors, inducers, substrates, and P- gp substrates are restricted as follows: x Subjects taking strong CYP3A inhibitors will be excluded from the study due to potential increases in plasma levels of V120083 when co-administered with V120083. Subjects who initiate these medications during the study will be discontinued from the study. x Subjects taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors will be excluded if the dose has not been stable for at least one month prior to start of study drug dosing. See Appendix Q for a"

Subjects who discontinue therapy with moderate CYP3A inhibitors during the study will be permitted to continue on the study x If the subject is taking multiple moderate CYP3A inhibitor(s) or the category is unknown, the investigator should contact the medical monitor and subjects are to be carefully monitored. x Subjects taking CYP3A inducers will be excluded from the study due to potential decrease in plasma levels of V120083. Subjects who initiate these medications during the study will be discontinued from the study. x Subjects taking CYP3A sensitive substrates and substrates with narrow therapeutic range, or P-gp substrates will be excluded from the study due to potential increases in plasma levels of such medications when co-administered with V120083. Subjects who initiate these medications during the study will be discontinued from the study. (See Appendix Q for a representative list of inducers and substrates). x The investigator should contact the medical monitor if there are any questions or concerns. APAP/acetaminophen may be used intermittently for headache, fever, or acute pain up to the 1 gram maximum per dose and 2 g per 24 hour maximum amount; low-dose aspirin (81 mg daily) for cardiovascular disease prophylaxis is allowed. Note: Subjects will be requested not to take any APAP/acetaminophen for at least 24 hours before each clinic visit. Aspirin dose of 81 mg per day is allowed to be taken for cardiovascular disease prophylaxis . 9.4.9 Treatment Compliance Records of study drug and doses administered, including supplemental analgesic medication (ie, acetaminophen), will be kept during the study. The site monitor will review drug accountability records during site visits and at the completion of the study. Site personnel will evaluate clinical supplies returned and acetaminophen at each subject visit in accordance with section 9.4.3. In addition, as each subject completes the study, site personnel will review the records of all clinical supplies returned by the subject (including evaluation for possible trends, eg, 5% of drug missing at 3 subject visits) in accordance with section 9.4.3."

It consists of 5 grades (ranging from grade 0 = no radiographic features of OA to grade 4 = severe OA with large osteophytes, marked narrowing of the joint space, severe sclerosis, and definite deformity of the bone ends). 12 According to a review conducted by Schiphof et al, a cutoff of  2 is sufficient to distinguish definite/mild osteoarthritis from none/possible osteoarthritis.13 The K-L criteria will be used to evaluate subjects at the screening visit. Subjects meeting K-L criteria 0, 1, or 4 do not qualify for this study. x Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Score (C-SSRS) Suicidality will be monitored throughout the study using the C-SSRS (Appendix O). The C-SSRS scale consists of a baseline/screening evaluation that assesses the lifetime and prior 24 month experience of the subject with suicide events and suicidal ideation and a post baseline/”Since Last Visit” evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last study visit. The C-SSRS is a prospective assessment instrument that directly classifies suicidal ideation and behavior into categories. The C-SSRS involves a series of probing questions to inquire about possible suicidal thinking and behavior. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) The HADS is a self-screening questionnaire that is commonly used by physicians and therapists to assess levels of anxiety and depression (Appendix H). The HADS is a self-reported 14-item instrument that measures the presence and severity of anxiety and depression based on the subject’s experience over the past week. 14 It consists of 2 subscales, each having 7 items: an anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and a depression subscale (HADS-D). The 2 subscales, anxiety and depression, have been found to be independent measures. The score for each subscale ranges from 0 (no anxiety or depression) to 21, with a score of 11 or higher indicating the probable presence of the mood disorder. The questionnaire will be administered at visit 1 (screening) and visit 5 (end-of-study/study discontinuation). Subjects with scores > 10 at the screening visit do not qualify for this study. x Modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (mBPI-SF) The mBPI-SF is a self-administered questionnaire used to assess the severity of pain, and the interference of pain on daily functions (Appendix I). It has been validated in numerous trials and"
59,page_59,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 60 of 173 for use in patients with OA.17 It consists of 6 questions: 4 questions ask the subjects to rate their pain on a 0 to 10 NRS for worst pain, average pain, least pain, and current pain; 1 question asks subjects to rate their pain relief over the past 24 hours; 1 question with 7 parts that ask subjects to rate the impact of their pain on mood and everyday activities. The mBPI-SF questionnaire will be completed at each clinic visit from visit 2 to the last visit during the double-blind period. The questionnaire takes less than 5 minutes to complete. The question daily “average pain over the last 24 hours” scores will be administered daily during the screening visits (Appendix N). The full questionnaire will be administered at visits 2 through 5 (end of study/early discontinuation). x Western Ontario and McMaster OA Index (WOMAC) The WOMAC is a self-administered questionnaire used to assess subjects with OA of the hip or knee (see Appendix J). The WOMAC was validated in 1988 and is the leading outcome measure in clinical trials for knee and hip OA. 18-23 The 24-hour, 0 to 4 categorical version (LK3.1) will be administered at each visit (excluding the follow-up visit), and it will be used to monitor the course of the disease or to determine the effectiveness of medications. The following 3 subscales will be calculated and analyzed: Pain Subscale (5 items: walking; stair climbing; nocturnal; at rest; weight bearing): the pain subscale score can be 0 to 20. Stiffness Subscale (2 items: morning stiffness; stiffness occurring later in the day): the stiffness subscale score can be 0 to 8. Physical Function Subscale (17 items: descending stairs; ascending stairs; rising from sitting; standing; bending to floor; walking on flat surface; getting into or out of car; going shopping; putting on socks; rising from bed; taking off socks; lying in bed; sitting; getting into or out of the bathtub; getting on or off the toilet; heavy domestic duties; light domestic duties): the physical function subscale score can be 0 to 68. The questionnaire will be administered at visits 2 through 5 (end of study/early discontinuation). x EQ-5D EQ-5D is a standardized generic measure of health status for clinical and economic appraisal (see Appendix K). 24-29 It is based on a descriptive system that defines health in terms of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels of severity (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems/unable to). It is a valid, reliable, and widely used instrument. The questionnaire will be administered at visits 2 through 5 (end of study/early discontinuation). It takes a few minutes to complete. x Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) The SF-36 is a generic health survey with 36 items that measure functional health and well-being from the subject's perspective (Appendix L). 28 The 36 questions are grouped into 11 sections. Some of the sections consist of multiple questions. The survey is summarized into 8 dimensions/scales: physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). From the 8 health dimensions, a physical component summary and mental component"
60,page_60,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 61 of 173 summary measure are derived. The questionnaire will be administered at visits 2 through 5 (end of study/early discontinuation). The SF-36 questionnaire takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete. x Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC; Appendix M) is an ordinal scale of global evaluation which assesses the change in overall status relative to the start of the study. The scale has only1 item that measures global change of overall status (improvement or worsening) by the subject on a 7-point scale from 1 to 7, where 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse. It is a valid, reliable, and widely used instrument and has shown a high degree of correlation with a subject’s self-reported pain score. The PGIC will be administered at visit 5 (end-of-study/early discontinuation). 9.6.2 Efficacy Variables 9.6.2.1 Primary Efficacy Variable The primary efficacy assessment is the daily ""average pain over the last 24 hours” score (on an 11-point NRS scale where 0 = no pain, 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine) from the mBPI-SF pain severity subscale at week 4 of the double-blind period. 9.6.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Variable(s) x Weekly “average pain over the last 24 hours” collected by e-Diary x Average daily “pain right now” collected by e-Diary x WOMAC total scores x WOMAC pain severity subscale x WOMAC physical function subscale x WOMAC stiffness subscale x mBPI-SF total scores (all parts of 6 questions) x mBPI-SF pain severity subscale x mBPI-SF pain interference subscale x SF-36 x EQ-5D x PGIC at the end of double-blind period (week 4) x Supplemental analgesic medication use x Responder to treatment 9.6.3 Drug Concentration Measurements Samples of blood will be taken to determine plasma concentrations of V120083 in this study. For subjects in the intensive PK subgroup, blood samples will be collected at visit 2 (day 1 of"
61,page_61,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 62 of 173 dosing) predose and postdose at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours. All subjects will have PK samples collected a visit 3 (week 1; predose, 1 and 2 hours postdose); visit 4 (week 2; predose or postdose); and visit 5 (week 4; predose or postdose). The site will obtain one (6 mL) blood sample during the visit and confirm the time of the subject’s last 2 doses of study drug. The actual time when the samples are taken should be recorded. See Appendix C for information on collection, processing, storage, and shipment of PK samples. 9.6.3.1 Analytical Methodology Plasma concentrations of V120083 will be quantified by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method. 9.6.4 Safety Variable(s) 9.6.4.1 Adverse Events (AEs) AEs will be collected as described in the schedule of assessments in section 9.5.1. Details of AE data collection are described in section 10. 9.6.4.2 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations Blood and urine samples will be collected for chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis evaluation (Appendix A). The clinical laboratory evaluations will be conducted by a central laboratory. Some of blood/plasma and urine samples collected during the study may be used for future exploratory investigative studies, if and as necessary. A serum pregnancy test will be performed for female subjects who are premenopausal or postmenopausal for less than 1 year and who are not surgically sterile at screening, and at end of study or early discontinuation as applicable. A urine pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential prior to the first dose of the study drug and as indicated in Table 3. Laboratory results will be evaluated. The investigator will assess whether any values reflect AEs and if so, report them as described in section 10. Appendix B represents the criteria (ie, upper limit, lower limit criteria for each laboratory parameter) that will be used to identify subjects with alert laboratory values. The Schedule of Activities (section 9.5.1) shows the time points at which blood will be collected for clinical laboratory tests, and urine will be collected for urinalysis. 9.6.4.3 Vital Signs Height, weight, and BMI will be measured at visit 1. Vital signs will be collected at the visits designated on the Schedule of Activities (section 9.5.1). Vital signs to be collected are the following: systolic/diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate (after subject has been seated for at least 5 minutes), and temperature. When vital signs are scheduled at the same time that blood samples are obtained, the vital signs will be obtained before and as close to the scheduled blood sample as possible."
62,page_62,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 63 of 173 All vital sign abnormalities, including clinically notable vital sign abnormalities (Table 5), will be evaluated using appropriate medical judgment to determine whether they represent AEs. Vital sign abnormalities that require medical intervention (beyond confirmatory vital sign collection) are AEs. Reference ranges for the vital sign values are presented in Table 4. For values outside the reference range, the measurements will be repeated at the investigator’s discretion. Table 4 Reference Range for Vital Sign Values Vital Sign Parameter Range Systolic blood pressure 100–140 mm Hg Diastolic blood pressure 60–90 mm Hg Heart Rate 60–100 bpm Respiratory rate 12–20 breaths per minute Temperature 36.8°C–38.3°C Table 5 Criteria Used to Identify Clinically Notable Vital Sign Abnormalities Vital Sign Parameter Value Change From Baselinea Systolic blood pressure  180 mm Hg Increase of  20 mm Hg  90 mm Hg Decrease of  20 mm Hg Diastolic blood pressure  105 mm Hg Increase of  15 mm Hg  50 mm Hg Decrease of  15 mm Hg Heart rate  120 bpm Increase of  15 bpm  50 bpm Decrease of  15 bpm Respiratory rate < 12 breaths per minute — > 20 breaths per minute — a Both value and change from baseline criteria must be met to qualify as a clinically notable abnormality. 9.6.4.4 Electrocardiograms (ECGs) ECG results from 12-lead ECG will be transmitted to the central ECG provider for interpretation and will be evaluated by the investigator for clinical significance. The investigator will assess whether any findings reflect AEs and if so, report them as described in section 10, Adverse Events. In order for subjects to enter the study, the baseline QTcF value obtained at the screening visit (visit 1) should not exceed 470 msec. To remain in the study, QTcF values for ECG tracings in each visit subsequent to screening should not exceed 500 msec or 480 msec with a concurrent QTcF change of > 60 msec from baseline. If QTcF values exceed 500 msec or 480 msec with a concurrent QTcF change of > 60 msec from baseline, the subject must discontinue study drug and the reason for study drug discontinuation will be recorded as AE (section 10)."

Findings from physical examinations will be evaluated by the investigator. Findings at the screening visit will be considered medical history. The investigator will assess whether any changes from the baseline physical examination reflect AEs and if so, report them as described in section 10, Adverse Events. 9.6.4.6 Other Safety Variables Other safety variables will include: x HADS scores x C-SSRS x K-L scores 9.6.5 Other Variables 9.6.5.1 Chemotherapy-induced Taste Alteration Scale (CiTAS) Subjects will be asked to rate their evaluation of taste alterations for the 18 items and 5 subscales on the CiTAS, a 5-point Likert-type scale.31 All results will be reviewed by the staff for accuracy and completeness at the time the questionnaire is administered (Appendix P). 9.6.5.2 Pharmacogenomics Subjects will be asked if they are interested in participating in an optional exploratory pharmacogenomic portion of the study following their written informed consent for the trial. Not participating in this exploratory PG portion of the study will not affect their participation in the trial. This will involve collecting additional blood samples which may be used for future exploratory PG analysis. In general, collection of these additional blood samples will be scheduled to occur at times when blood samples are already being collected for the study."
64,page_64,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 65 of 173 Three samples of blood, totaling approximately 20 mL, will be collected from each subject during the treatment period: o 1 sample for DNA at visit 2 predose o 2 samples for protein: 1 sample at visit 2 predose, and 1 sample at visit 5. Pharmacogenomic Samples Informed consent specific for PG sampling, must be obtained prior to blood collection. To obtain sufficient DNA for PG studies, a single blood sample will be drawn at the time point specified in Table 3 into the appropriate tubes provided by the sponsor . Privacy of information collected from samples obtained for storage and future analysis will be maintained. PPLP has developed secure policies and procedures to maintain subject privacy. At the clinical site, unique codes will be placed on each PG blood sample for transfer to the sponsor designated/approved storage facility. Each code is a unique random number used only to identify each biosample of each subject. Subjects may withdraw consent for banking samples at any time by contacting the investigator responsible for administering their initial informed consent. After withdrawal of consent, no future samples will be collected and any samples with subject identification will be removed from the biorepository and their destruction documented in the repository database. Any analyses performed or data obtained from the samples prior to the subject withdrawing consent will not be deleted. Data generated from processed samples remain confidential and will be retained by PPLP for an indefinite period. Specimens will be maintained for potential analysis for up to approximately 20 years following their acquisition. Samples will be destroyed according to PPLP policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the repository database. 9.6.6 Clinical Supplies Product Complaints 9.6.6.1 Types of CSPCs Clinical Supplies Product Complaints (CSPCs) of study drug(s) consist of any issues involving: x Supply quality, quantity, packaging x Supply shipping x Supply storage x Suspected or known theft or diversion by non-subjects 9.6.6.2 Reporting of CSPCs to Sponsor or Designee All CSPCs must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) by completing the CSPC Report Form and faxing within 24 hours of first knowledge of the issue.

Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 66 of 173 information available after the initial report, should be actively sought and reported by faxed follow-up reports to the sponsor (or designee) as it becomes available. In cases of confirmed or suspected diversion, the signature of the investigator / medically qualified designee is required on the CSPC Report Form. 9.6.7 Subject Drug Discrepancies Site personnel will evaluate the study drugs dispensed / used by each subject at each visit and upon subject completion or discontinuation of the subject for any reason. All study drugs should be accounted for. Site personnel will consult the subject regarding any discrepancies of what is expected to be returned vs. what is actually returned. This discussion and its outcome should be documented in the source on the individual subject. Questions regarding the event may be referred to the Medical Monitor. Any study drug discrepancy will be reported in the Electronic Data Capture system. The discrepancy may be categorized into the following: x Subject lost drug x Subject’s drug was stolen x Subject took more than expected x Other (subject related) (any other situation which does not fall into the above categories). 9.6.8 Quality Assurance This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the protocol, SOPs, working practice documents, and applicable regulations and guidelines. Clinical site audits will be conducted periodically by the sponsor’s (or designee’s) qualified compliance auditing team, which is an independent function from the study conduct team. 9.6.9 Data Collection Electronic Data Capture will be used to record case report form (CRF) data. Electronic diaries will be used for this study. Investigators/designees will enter the information required by the protocol onto the appropriate source documents, and in CRFs in accordance with the accompanying CRF completion instructions. The CRFs will be reviewed for completeness and accuracy against the source documents by the CRAs who will periodically visit each clinical site. Any discrepancies found between the source documents and the completed CRFs will be noted, and the CRAs will ensure that appropriate clinical site personnel address the discrepancies. The investigator/medically qualified designee must verify that the data are complete and accurate via signature in the CRF as required. Subjects will enter self-reported information into their diaries and/or directly into an electronic device or on paper at the clinical site. Investigators/designees will review the diary data on an ongoing basis and periodically with the subject."

For categorical (nominal) variables (eg, gender, race), the number and percentage of subjects will be used. Demographic/baseline variables will be summarized for all subjects in the safety population. A listing will be provided for the enrolled population and the safety population. 9.7.2.2 Subject Disposition Subject disposition will be summarized by treatment groups for the double-blind period. The number and percent of subjects who completed and the number and percent of subjects who discontinued along with the distribution of the reasons for discontinuation will be presented. The number and percent of subjects in each analysis population will be presented. Subject disposition and reasons for discontinuation during screening period will be presented for the enrolled population. A listing will be provided for the enrolled population and the safety population. 9.7.2.3 Dosing and Extent of Exposure Dosing and extent of exposure will be summarized by treatment groups for the double-blind period. The double-blind period begins on the day the first double-blind study drug is administered. The number and percentage of subjects exposed to double-blind treatment for overlapping time intervals (eg, any exposure,  1 week,  2 weeks,  4 weeks) in the double-blind period will be calculated by treatment group for the safety population. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD/standard error, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided to summarize the length of exposure (in days) to each treatment. A data listing of the study drug dosage administered to each subject during the double-blind period will be provided. 9.7.2.4 Prior and Concomitant Therapy Prior and concomitant therapies will be coded to World Health Organization Drug Dictionary terms. A dictionary listing of all unique concomitant medications used in the study will be provided, sorting medications by drug class and preferred drug name. Concomitant therapy use during the double-blind period will be summarized by treatment group for the safety population. In each of these summary tables, the number of subjects taking each therapy will be presented by anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) codes (levels 1, 2, and 3). In addition, prior medications used for OA will be summarized using ATC codes by treatment group for the safety population. A data listing for all prior and concomitant therapy will be provided for the safety population."
68,page_68,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 69 of 173 9.7.2.5 Medical History Medical history will be coded to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA) terms. Coded medical history terms will be summarized for all subjects in the safety population. 9.7.3 Efficacy Analysis All efficacy analyses will be conducted on the full analysis population. An analysis of the primary efficacy variable for the per-protocol population may be performed if more than 20% of the subjects in the FAP have major protocol deviations that would affect the evaluation of efficacy. The primary hypothesis test will be 1 sided with a 5% significance level. For each of the following primary and secondary analyses, the primary contrasts will be those between placebo and each dose of study drug. The placebo and the active control will be compared to assess assay sensitivity. 9.7.3.1 Primary Efficacy Variable(s) Primary efficacy analysis is based on the daily “average pain over the last 24 hours” score from the mBPI-SF pain severity subscale at week 4 of the double-blind period. The analysis will be performed using a mixed-effect general linear model with repeated measures (MMRM). The MMRM will include treatment (4 levels: 60 mg bid or 30 mg bid of V120083, 500 mg bid naproxen, and placebo) and time (3 levels for weeks, 1, 2, and 4) as fixed effects; the baseline pain scale will be incorporated as fixed covariates, and subject will be a random effect. The treatment by time interaction effect will also be investigated. The restricted maximum likelihood approach will be used to estimate the parameters in the model. While data from the entire double-blind period will be used to fit the linear model to get a better estimate of the variance-covariance matrix (based on Akaike information criteria), the primary comparison between groups will be based on estimates/contrasts for the week 4 means. Reported results of primary analysis from MMRM will include least-squares mean (LSM) estimates, standard errors for each treatment group, the p-value for testing the differences between placebo/naproxen and each dose of V120083, and the corresponding confidence interval (90% and 95%) for the difference in LSMs. 9.7.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Variable(s) Weekly “average pain over the last 24 hours” collected by e-Diary The weekly “average pain over the last 24 hours” collected by e-Diary will be analyzed in a similar manner as for the primary endpoint. Average daily “pain right now” collected by e-Diary Summary statistics (mean, SD, median, and range) for the average daily “pain right now” scores will be provided by weeks and treatment group for all subjects in the full analysis population. The weekly average of daily “pain right now” scores will be defined as the sum of nonmissing daily “pain right now” scores reported during that week (days 1 to 7, days 8 to 14, days 15 to 21, and days 21 to 28) divided by the number of days with nonmissing scores for that week. If a subject reports fewer than 3 days of pain scores during a week, the weekly mean “pain right"
69,page_69,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 70 of 173 now” score will be set to missing. If there are > 1 “pain right now” scores reported on the same day, then the average “pain right now” score on the day will be used to calculate weekly mean “pain right now” scores. All observed data will be used. Associated 95% CIs for the treatment group means will be calculated and presented. WOMAC The WOMAC total score, pain subscale, stiffness subscale and physical function subscale will be analyzed in a similar manner as for the primary endpoint. mBPI-SF The 2 components (severity and interference of pain) of the mBPI-SF will be analyzed in a similar manner as for the primary endpoint. SF-36 There are 8 dimensions/scales: physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Special transformations are applied to the sum of the scores for a dimension in order to standardize the scales. The detailed algorithm for computing the scores for the scales will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan for the study. In addition to the 8 scales, 2 summary measures will be derived: Physical component summary (PCS) measure (aggregate of PF, RP, BP, and GH scales); and Mental component summary (MCS) measure (aggregate of VT, SF, RE, and MH scales). EQ-5D The 5-level scale EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) is a generic instrument that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care, and to collect data on quality of life and preferences/utility. The instrument comprises questions on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (“Worst imaginable health state”) to 100 (“Best imaginable health state”). The U.S. population-based index values based on crosswalk value sets for EQ-5D-5L developed by EuroQoL Research Fundation (van Hout B et al. 2012) and VAS will be analyzed in a similar manner as for the primary endpoint. In addition, responses from each of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) will be converted into binary outcomes (‘No problems’ vs ‘Problems’) based on EQ-5D-5L User Guide and the binary outcomes from each of 5 dimensions will be analyzed using a generalized estimating equation (GEE). Responder to treatment A subject’s response to treatment will be defined as the percentage reduction from the baseline mean “average pain over the last 24 hours” score to the week 4 pain score from the mBPI-SF pain severity subscale. For each subject, percentage reduction in pain from baseline through double-blind treatment will be calculated as:"
70,page_70,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 71 of 173 % reduction = 100* (bslpain – wk4) / bslpain, Where, bslpain = baseline mean pain score wk4 = week 4 pain intensity score. All subjects who discontinue study drug prior to week 4 will be considered nonresponders and will be assigned a 0% reduction in pain. The proportion of subjects with a response to treatment at week 4 will be compared using a logistic regression model with “responder” (yes/no) as dependent variable, treatment and screening mean pain score as covariate. A graph of the observed cumulative percentage of subjects v percentage reduction in pain from screening mean pain score will be generated by treatment group. Based on this graph, estimates of percentage of responders for the following cutoffs: (<0, 0, > 0, t 10%, t 20%, t 30%, t 40%, t 50%, t 60%, t 70%, t 80%, t 90%, and = 100%) for each treatment group will be computed and graphed. PGIC The PGIC rating score obtained at week 4 or end-of-study visit of the double-blind period will be measured on a 7-point scale in which 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse. The categories will be compared between treatment group and placebo using the Chi-Squared test. Further analysis will be conducted on collapsed categories (very much improved/much improved v minimally improved/no change/minimally worse/much worse/very much worse) using Fisher’s exact test. Changes from baseline values will be analyzed by treatment group separately using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline adjusted as a covariate. Supplemental Medication The percentage of subjects who require no supplemental analgesic medication usage will be calculated for each treatment group. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who do not require any supplemental analgesic medication will be constructed using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution and a correction for continuity. The average daily number of supplemental acetaminophen 500 mg will be summarized for each treatment group weekly and over 28 days. For each visit (time point), the total number of tablets taken will be calculated as the number of tablets given minus the number of tablets returned. The average daily number of tablets will be calculated by dividing the total number of tablets taken during the time interval by the number of days in the interval. Descriptive statistics ( n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) will be presented by treatment group. Due to the nature of the data, supplemental pain medication for OA tends to have a large proportion of zeros (contributed by subjects who do not take any supplemental pain medication) followed by continuous distribution of nonzero values. Therefore, the supplemental pain medication for OA will also be summarized categorically. Preliminarily, the categories will be (1) no supplemental acetaminophen tablets, (2) 0 to  0.5 tablets, (3) > 0.5 to  1.0 tablets, (4) > 1.0 to  2.0 tablets, and (5) > 2.0 tablets. Upon review of the blinded data prior to database lock, the categories will be reviewed and if any adjustments to the categories are deemed necessary, the rationale and new categories will be documented in the SAP prior to database lock."
71,page_71,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 72 of 173 Other continuous secondary variables (see section 9.6.2.2) will be analyzed similarly to the primary efficacy method, using an MMRM. 9.7.4 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 9.7.4.1 Pharmacokinetic Variable(s) Plasma V120083 concentrations, sampling times, dosing histories, and individual-specific demographics, including age and weight, will be collected. For intense PK sampling component, time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last sampling after dosing (AUC 0-8) will be calculated. 9.7.4.2 Pharmacokinetic Statistical Analysis All individual subject plasma concentration data will be listed. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, geometric mean, coefficient of variation for geometric mean, median, minimum, and maximum) will be tabulated by treatment and visit for predose individual plasma concentrations (troughs), which are sampled at 12 ± 1 hours postdose at visit 3, 4, and 5. For intense PK sampling component, descriptive statistics for plasma concentrations at visit 2 will be tabulated by treatment and nominal sampling time. The time course of individual and mean plasma concentrations will be graphically presented. Pharmacokinetic parameters of V120083 will be calculated based on the plasma concentrations of V120083 by using non-compartmental analysis for intense PK sampling component. The actual elapsed sampling times will be used in the PK metrics calculations. Descriptive statistics for PK metrics will be tabulated by treatment. A population PK analysis may be performed and will be reported in a separate report from the clinical study report. 9.7.5 Statistical / Analytical Issues 9.7.5.1 Adjustments for Covariates Details of adjustments for covariates for the efficacy variables and the definition of these covariates are contained in section 9.7.3. For each primary and secondary efficacy variable analyzed using MMRM, the baseline values will be included as covariate in the model. Exploratory/subgroup analyses with adjustment for covariates may be performed for further scientific interest in order to look for explanatory variables related to the occurrence of primary safety and efficacy endpoints. Models predicting study endpoints may be developed with potential covariates inclusion in the analysis. The covariates will be chosen and pre-specified from among the baseline and demographic variables. 9.7.5.2 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data The distribution of prognostic factors between subjects with complete data and those who discontinue study drug early will be examined to evaluate any potential sources of bias. In the"
72,page_72,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 73 of 173 absence of any apparent systematic loss, data will be analyzed assuming that these observations are missing at random. mBPI-SF If more than half of the items in either the severity of pain subscale or the interference of pain subscale are missing, then the resulting subscale score will be treated as missing. Otherwise, if half the items or less in a particular subscale are missing, then for the purpose of computing the subscale score, the item’s scoring value will be imputed by the mean score from the other items within the subscale. WOMAC The pain subscale of the WOMAC at week 4, will be obtained by adding the responses to questions 1 through 5. A mean score will also be computed for the 3 subscales and composite scale by averaging the response to the questions instead of summing them. x Pain Subscale: calculated by averaging items 1 to 5. If 2 or more pain scores are missing, then the pain subscale will be set to missing; otherwise, the average of the nonmissing pain scores will be used for the missing pain scores. x Stiffness Subscale: calculated by averaging items 6 to 7. If both stiffness scores are missing, then the stiffness subscale will be set to missing. If 1 stiffness score is missing, then the nonmissing stiffness score will be used in the analysis. x Physical Function Subscale: calculated by averaging items 8 to 24. If 4 or more physical functioning scores are missing, then the physical functioning subscale will be set to missing; otherwise, the average of the nonmissing physical function scores will be used for the missing physical functioning scores. x Composite Scale: calculated by averaging 3 subscale averages: (pain subscale + stiffness subscale + physical functioning subscales)/3. If 1 or more of the subscales is missing, then the composite scale will be set to missing. PGIC and other efficacy endpoints No imputation will be done for the PGIC or other efficacy endpoints. 9.7.5.3 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring An interim analysis may be conducted when approximately 50% of randomized subjects have completed the end-of-study visit. The unblinded interim analyses and data review will be performed by an independent committee consisting of a statistician, clinician, and programmer not associated with the study team. Additional data reviews may be conducted as deemed necessary. The sponsor may request additional (ad hoc) DMC recommendations throughout the study. Details will be further pre-specified in the DMC and corresponding interim analysis statistical analysis plan documents. At the interim analysis, the following procedures will be performed: x Safety evaluation for early termination will be performed when 50% of subjects have completed the study. The independent statistician/programmer will provide safety data listing and summary tables by unblinded treatment groups. The DMC members will review the safety data, including but not limited to AEs and clinical laboratory values."
73,page_73,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 74 of 173 The decision to stop 1 or more treatment groups due to safety issues will be made based on clinical judgment. The arm will be stopped if there is significant physical toxicity or evidence of impending risk of physiologic harm or extremely abnormal laboratory findings related to treatment. x Efficacy evaluation for V120083 treatment groups may be performed by the independent statistician/programmer when 50% of subjects have completed the study. The 50% interim analysis may be performed to evaluate the efficacy of each dose of study drug in the study population. The DMC will review the results of the analysis and make recommendations, as appropriate, regarding plans for further studies. Lan et al 32 introduce stochastic curtailment to stop a trial if, given current data, it is likely to predict the outcome of the trial with high probability. The conditional power at the scheduled end of the study, given the observed data at the interim evaluation, will be calculated with a stochastic curtailment approach to support the decision of early termination for futility. SAS 9.2 PROC SEQTEST will be used to calculate the conditional power based on the formula given by Cui et al 33 and Emerson et al34Additional info will be pre-specified in the DMC charter. 9.7.5.4 Homogeneity Across Clinical Sites Although subjects will be assigned unique subject numbers sequentially within sites, there is no plan currently to include site as a factor in the statistical models as a main effect because of the large number of sites that are expected to be used for the study. In addition, enrollment at some sites will be very small. Per ICH guidance (E9 section 3.2), a graphical exploration of the homogeneity of treatment effects across sites will be provided for the primary efficacy variable if appropriate. 9.7.5.5 Multiple Comparisons / Multiplicity No multiplicity adjustment will be performed for this study. 9.7.5.6 Examination of Subgroups No formal subgroup analyses are planned for efficacy and safety variables. 9.7.6 Safety Analyses Evaluation of safety will be performed for all subjects in the safety population. 9.7.6.1 Adverse Events (AEs) AEs will be coded to MedDRA terms (version 18.1). A listing sorted by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term will include all lower level terms and verbatim descriptions associated with the Preferred Terms. Data for AEs will be analyzed using the treatment-emergent signs and symptoms (TESS) philosophy. Treatment-emergent signs and symptoms are defined as AEs that: x Emerge during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment; or x Re-emerge during treatment, having been present at pretreatment but stopped prior to treatment; or x Worsen in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous."
74,page_74,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 75 of 173 Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be assigned to study drug according to their onset date. AEs that start after a subject’s last dose but within 7 days of dosing will be considered TEAEs and will be assigned to the last treatment administered. AEs that start more than 7 days after the last dose of study drug will be considered non-TEAEs. Only TEAEs will be included in summary tables. However, all AEs will be included in a by-subject AE listing. The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by SOC, MedDRA Preferred Term and treatment (if appropriate) by presenting the number and percentage of subjects with an AE. A subject will be counted only once in the incidence count for a specific MedDRA Preferred Term, although a MedDRA Preferred Term might be reported more than once for a particular subject. Separate summaries will be provided for TEAEs by maximum severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relationship (yes, no) to study drug. A TEAE will be considered related to study drug if the investigator reported the event to be “definitely, probably, possibly, or unlikely” related to treatment. In addition, a table of TEAEs occurring in  5% of the subjects in at least 1 treatment group will be presented. x Individual subject listings of AEs that resulted in death, of other SAEs and of AEs that led to treatment discontinuation, dose interruption, or dose reduction will be generated. These listings will include the treatment group and dose (if applicable) at the time of AE onset, start and stop dates of the AE, days on study, and days on treatment. Summary tables (eg, incidence of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation) may be generated depending upon the incidence of these significant AEs. x Summaries of TEAEs occurring in the double-blind period will be generated by treatment group for subjects in the safety population. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be summarized as well. A list of AESIs are defined in section 10.3.2. 9.7.6.2 Laboratory Values Clinical laboratory values will be evaluated for each laboratory parameter by subject. For each laboratory test, abnormal values will be identified as those outside (above or below) the reference range, and will be flagged in the by-subject listings. Reference (normal) ranges for laboratory parameters will be included in the clinical study report for this protocol. Laboratory test results will be assigned an LNH classification according to whether the value is below (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory parameter’s reference range. Within treatment comparisons during the double-blind period will be based on 3 by 3 tables (shift tables) that, for a particular laboratory test, compare the prerandomization LNH classification to the LNH classification at the end of double-blind treatment. Summary statistics (n, mean, SD, minimum, maximum, and median values) for end of double-blind (EODB) and change from baseline to EODB values of continuous laboratory parameters will be produced by treatment group for subjects in the safety population. All clinical laboratory results will be evaluated for markedly abnormal values, see Table 7. A listing of all subjects in the safety population with at least 1 markedly abnormal laboratory value will be prepared; for a given subject, in addition to the flagged markedly abnormal laboratory parameters, the listing will present the results of all scheduled and unscheduled study evaluations of the same laboratory parameter whether or not they are markedly abnormal. The incidence of markedly abnormal laboratory tests will be summarized by treatment group for subjects in the safety population. For these calculations, each subject may be counted once in"

End of double-blind value = the last scheduled test result obtained during treatment with double-blind study drug. Laboratory evaluations occurring  7 days after the last dose of study drug will not be included in the calculations listed above.

Vital sign summary tables will be presented by treatment group for subjects in the safety population. Vital sign values will be evaluated on an individual basis by subject. Abnormal vital sign values will be identified as those outside (above or below) the reference ranges defined in Table 4. For each continuous vital sign parameter descriptive summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation/standard error, median, and range) will be prepared for values observed. Summary statistics for the change from baseline to the end of the double-blind will also be presented. Vital sign abnormalities that meet or exceed the “clinically notable vital sign” values (Table 5) will be listed. The incidence of clinically notable vital signs during the double-blind period will be presented by treatment for all subjects in the safety population. 9.7.6.4 Electrocardiograms ECG parameters collected include: heart rate (bpm), PR interval (msec), RR interval (msec), QRS interval (msec), uncorrected QT interval (msec), QTcB (Bazett’s correction) interval (msec), and QTcF (Fridericia’s correction) interval (msec)."

In addition, certain summary tables may be generated for ECGs collected during exposure to the study drugs across the double-blind period. The following listings and summary tables will be generated: 1. Summary statistics (n, mean, SD, minimum, and maximum) of the baseline value, the value at each scheduled evaluation, and the corresponding change from baseline for each continuous ECG parameter. 2.

For each selected ECG morphology finding, the count (%) of subjects with the specific finding absent or present at baseline vs. end of phase (eg, end of run-in period, end of double-blind period). 7. Listing of subjects with treatment-emergent ECG morphology findings. For these analyses, the following rules will apply: o The baseline value of each ECG parameter will be defined as the average of all ECG values collected prior to the start of study drug. o In listings summaries 1 through 3 above, the value of the ECG parameters at each scheduled post-baseline evaluation will be calculated as the average of the tracing results collected at that time. o For listings 4 through 7, every ECG tracing will be evaluated (ie, no average will be calculated). o For listings 6 and 7, a subject will be categorized as having a specific morphology finding present at baseline if the finding is observed in at least 1 ECG tracing obtained prior to the start of study drug. A specific ECG morphology finding will be considered present at the end of a phase/period if it is observed in at least 1 ECG tracing collected during that phase/period. o For listing 7, an ECG morphology finding will be considered treatment emergent if it is observed in at least 1 postbaseline ECG tracing but is absent from all screening baseline tracings. Outliers (display 5 above) are defined as follows: o Heart rate: a value for a subject is considered to be an outlier at a postscreening time point if the heart rate measurement at that time point is < 50 bpm and at least a 25% decrease from the subject’s baseline mean heart rate (ie, a bradycardia"

For display 7 listed above, the specific ECG morphology findings consist of the following: o Abnormal U wave o Atrial fibrillation o Right bundle branch block (RBBB) o Left bundle branch block (LBBB) o Left anterior hemiblock (LAH) o Myocardial infarction (MI) o ST depression o T wave (biphasic and/or inverted). For each of the of the findings listed above, a subject will be categorized as having the specific treatment-emergent ECG abnormality if it is observed in at least 1 postscreening period ECG morphologic determination, but is absent from all screening baseline results.

79,page_79,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 80 of 173 For the assessment of the CiTAS, scores received from each subscale will be evaluated rather than the total score received from the entire scale. The subscale scores will be obtained by dividing the number of the items into the sum of scores of those items as follows: x Decline in basic taste: Add up score from question 2 to question 6, and divide it by 5. x Discomfort: Add up score from question 13 to question 18, and divide it by 6. x Phantogeusia and parageusia: Add up score from question 10 to question 12, and divide it by 3. x General taste alterations: Add up score from question 1 and question 7 to question 9, and divide it by 4. The maximum score is 5 points, whereas the minimum score is 1 point that can be received from subscales. 9.7.8 Other Analyses 9.7.9 Determination of sample size A total of up to 276 subjects is planned to be randomized to the double-blind period of this study using a 1:1:1:1 randomization ratio; ie, approximately 69 subjects are to be randomized to each of the 4 treatment groups (V120083 [60 mg or 30 mg], naproxen [active comparator], or placebo). The actual number of subjects treated will depend on the outcome of the interim analysis. The analgesic effect size of V120083 is unknown. Therefore, the sample size calculation is based on a clinically important difference for OA pain reduction of 1 unit on an 11-point NRS (0 to 10). This study may provide appropriate information for the data variability in the sample size calculations. The standard deviation (SD) for average pain over last the 24 hours, an individual question of the Summary of Modified Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (mBPI-SF) at week 4, was approximately 2.34. With a fixed sample size study design, the sample size needed for 80% power to detect this difference with a significance level of 0.05 (1-sided) is 69 subjects per arm, assuming a 1:1 randomization ratio of each active arm to placebo. The sample size calculation was performed with nQuery+nTerim 3.0. 10 ADVERSE EVENTS 10.1 Definition An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, regardless of whether administered any pharmaceutical product or placebo. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment."
80,page_80,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 81 of 173 An AE can be: x Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. x Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease. x Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (eg, headache) not present at baseline. x Any case of abuse of alcohol, illicit drugs, or prescription drugs; abuse of study drug(s) or protocol -specified drug(s); addiction. x A pregnancy that occurs or becomes confirmed during a clinical study (see section 10.3.1). x Abnormal laboratory values or other clinical tests (eg, ECG or X-ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, discontinuation from study drug, or are considered to be medically significant. o All laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated by the investigator to determine if indicative of an adverse event. 10.2 Assessment 10.2.1 Criteria for Assessing Severity The investigator/medically qualified designee will evaluate the comments of the subject and the response to treatment in order that he/she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE. Severity refers to the accumulated intensity of discomfort / impairment of health since the last recording of AEs and will be assessed according to the following criteria: Mild: Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated. Moderate: Enough discomfort to interfere with usual activity and may warrant intervention. Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affects clinical status and warrants intervention. The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness (see section 10.2.3 for the definition of SAE). 10.2.2 Criteria for Assessing Causality The question of the relationship of an AE to study drug should be determined by the investigator/medically qualified designee after thorough consideration of all facts that are available. Assessment of causality is based on considering associative connections (time or place), pharmacological explanations, previous knowledge of the drug, presence of characteristic clinical or pathological phenomena, exclusion of other causes, and/or absence of alternative explanations. The causal relationship of an AE to study drug will be assessed according to the following criteria:"
81,page_81,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 82 of 173 Reasonable possibility: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event [21CFR312.32]. No reasonable possibility : The evidence does not suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. 10.2.3 Criteria for Assessing Seriousness All AEs must be evaluated as potential SAEs. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: x Results in a fatality x Is life-threatening, ie, the subject was at immediate risk of fatality from the AE as it occurred. (This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have been fatal.) x Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization o The following types of hospitalizations are not considered SAEs for regulatory reporting purposes:  Hospitalization(s) for planned (pre-scheduled) medical procedures known at the time of screening  Protocol-specific hospital admission  Respite care  Admission for the treatment of pre-existing condition (known at the time of screening) not associated with the development of a new adverse event or with the worsening of the pre-existing condition  Observation/same day/ambulatory procedures. x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study drug) x Is a medically important event or reaction. o Other important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in fatality or hospitalization but may, based on appropriate medical judgment, jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes in the definition of SAE listed above, should also be considered SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Cases of abuse, addiction, or substance dependence involving study drug(s) or protocol-specified drug(s) AND cases of abuse, addiction, or substance dependence involving alcohol or other drug(s) occurring after the initiation of protocol-specified drug(s) or study drug(s) for which there is no relevant history must be reported as SAEs (see section 10.3.3). Subjects involved in suspected or known abuse must be discontinued from the study."
82,page_82,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 83 of 173 10.3 Adverse Events – Reporting All AEs will be reported starting from the time informed consent for study participation is provided. A cluster of signs and symptoms that results from a single cause should be reported as a single AE (eg, fever, elevated white blood cell count, cough, abnormal chest X-ray, etc. can all be reported as “pneumonia”). AEs assessed as non-serious will be reported through the 7 days following the subject’s last study drug dose or until the last study visit, whichever is later. Nonserious AEs that are ongoing at the subject’s last study visit must be followed until resolution or for 30 days after the subject’s last study drug dose, whichever comes first. AEs assessed as SAEs will be reported as per section 10.3.3. 10.3.1 Additional Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies A pregnancy is not by definition an AE, but it is handled as an AE because it is not a condition that should occur during the clinical trial, requires the subject to be discontinued from the study, and requires ongoing monitoring of the pregnancy by the investigator. A pregnancy that occurs or becomes confirmed during a clinical study must be recorded as an AE on the AE CRF and submitted electronically to the sponsor. The pregnancy must also be reported to the sponsor (or designee) using the Notification of Pregnancy Form within 24 hours of first knowledge of the pregnancy to Sponsor. x The investigator/medically qualified designee should discuss every pregnancy (either subject or subject’s partner) with the Medical Monitor. x The investigator/medically qualified designee will follow up with the subject or subject’s partner every 3 months throughout the pregnancy and report to the sponsor (or designee) using the Notification of Pregnancy Form. x Following the estimated date of delivery, the investigator/medically qualified designee will follow up with the subject or subject’s partner and report to the sponsor (or designee) using the Pregnancy Outcome Questionnaire. While pregnancy itself is not considered an SAE, any SAEs related to the pregnancy of the subject (see below) or occurring in a subject during the subject’s pregnancy or after delivery, must be documented using the SAE CRF. SAEs occurring in the child (ie, congenital anomalies or other conditions present at birth, whether genetically inherited or occurring in utero) must be documented and reported to the sponsor (or designee) on a separate SAE CRF (see section 10.3.3 for SAE reporting procedures). Reportable SAEs associated with pregnancy include, but are not limited to: x Pregnancy losses (eg, spontaneous abortion, late fetal fatality, elective termination) x Life-threatening developments (eg, placental abruption, fetal distress) x Congenital anomalies x Neonatal fatality, or x Any event resulting in maternal hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization or maternal fatality."
83,page_83,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 84 of 173 10.3.2 Additional Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events of Special Interest The following AESIs will be recorded and reported via the AE of Special Interest Notification Form: x Disturbances in thermal sensation, which may include: o inhibition of thermal sensation and associated AEs such as thermal burns o heat sensitivity x Taste disturbance AESIs must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) as soon as possible of first knowledge. AESIs that also meet criteria of SAEs (see section 10.2.3) must additionally be reported via the SAE CRF Data Form (see section 10.3.3). Criteria for placing the study on clinical hold and temporarily halting dosing is outlined in section 7.1 Potential Risks and Benefits. 10.3.3 Additional Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events Additional Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events All SAEs must be reported starting from the time informed consent for study participation is provided. If the investigator becomes aware of an SAE within 30 days after the subject’s last dose of study drug, or protocol-specified drug, or standard treatment, or within 30 days after the last study visit or follow-up phone call, the SAE must be reported. SAEs must be followed until the event resolves, the event or sequelae stabilize, or it is unlikely that additional information can be obtained after demonstration of due diligence with follow-up efforts (ie, the subject or health care practitioner is unable to provide additional information, or the subject is lost to follow-up). All SAEs must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of first knowledge of the SAE following the SAE CRF Completion Instructions. In the initial report, all available information should be provided. The SAE CRF must be signed by the investigator/medically qualified designee (must be MD or DO). The investigator or sponsor (or designee), depending on local regulations, must inform the IRB about such AEs in accordance with ICH guidelines and the practices of the governing IRBs. Follow-up information, or new information available after the initial report, should be actively sought and reported to the sponsor (or designee) as it becomes available following the SAE CRF Completion Instructions SAE CRFs should contain the following information, at a minimum: x The reportable event x Study drug (if known) x Protocol number x Subject number x Investigator name"

All documents that will be submitted to the sponsor (or designee) that contain information regarding the SAE (including but not limited to, ancillary source document(s), medical or hospital charts, notes) must be redacted (blacked out) for protected health information, including subject initials. The assigned subject number should be recorded on each of the documents submitted to the sponsor. These documents should be faxed to . The investigator/medically qualified designee (must be MD or DO) must notify the sponsor’s (or designee’s) medical monitor by telephone immediately if: x The SAE CRFs cannot be completed to meet the 24-hour reporting requirement due to business hours (or other plausible reason) or, x An SAE is being reported during weekend hours (beginning at 5 PM Eastern Time Friday through 12 AM Eastern Time Monday) or, x An SAE is reported on a holiday (beginning at 5 PM Eastern Time of the business day before the holiday through 12 AM Eastern Time of the next business day). All available information should be provided in the phone contact including: x Protocol number. x Investigator name. x Subject number. x AE with serious criterion. x Investigator/medically qualified designee (must be MD or DO) causality assessment(s) for each SAE. The SAE must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) as soon as possible upon reopening for business following the SAE Case Report Form Completion Instructions. See section 9.4.7 for description of the emergency unblinding procedure. 11 ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS 11.1 Changes to Protocol Any change to the protocol will be in the form of a written protocol amendment or administrative change document that will be issued by the sponsor or designee. Amendments specifically affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study require additional approval by the applicable IRB(s)/IEC(s) of all clinical sites. The protocol requirements should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the investigator/medically qualified designee, or by the sponsor (or designee), in the interest of preserving the safety of subjects included in the study. If an immediate change to the protocol"
85,page_85,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 86 of 173 is deemed by the investigator /medically qualified designee to be necessary for safety reasons, the sponsor’s Medical Monitor (or designee) must be notified promptly and the IRB/IEC for the site must be informed according to the IRBs/IECs documented process. Changes affecting only administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol amendments or IRB/IEC approval, but the IRB/IEC must be kept informed of such changes. Therefore the clinical site will send the administrative change document to the IRB/IEC according to the IRBs/IECs documented process. 11.2 Discontinuation of Study The sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for safety or administrative reasons at any time. A written statement fully documenting the reasons for discontinuing the study will be provided to the clinical site(s) and IRB/IEC. Criteria for placing the study on clinical hold and temporarily halting dosing is outlined in section 7.1 Potential Risks and Benefits. If, in the opinion of the investigator, the clinical observations in the study suggest that it may be unwise to continue, the investigator may discontinue their participation in the study or part of the study. A written statement fully documenting the reasons for discontinuation will be provided to the sponsor (or designee) and IRB. 11.3 Disclosure and Confidentiality This protocol will be registered and maintained on ClinicalTrials.gov in accordance with federal and local regulations. The contents of this protocol and any amendments and results obtained during the course of this study will be kept confidential by the investigator, the investigator’s staff, and IRB/IEC and will not be disclosed in whole or in part to others or used for any purpose other than reviewing or performing the study without the written consent of the sponsor. Accordingly, the investigator is prohibited from publishing any data collected or results obtained during the course of this study without the prior written approval of the sponsor. These obligations of confidentiality and nonuse shall in no way diminish such obligations as set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement between the sponsor and the investigator. All persons assisting in the performance of this study must be bound by the obligations of confidentiality and non-use set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement between the investigator and sponsor or designee. 11.4 Monitoring Procedures The CRA will visit the study clinic at suitable intervals and be in frequent contact with the site through verbal and written communication. The investigator will allow the CRA to inspect the clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy facilities to assure compliance with GCP. The investigator and staff are expected to cooperate with the CRA, to be available during a portion of the monitoring visit to answer questions, and to provide any missing information. It is essential that the CRA have access to all study and subject related documents at any time these are requested. The CRFs and corresponding original subject source documents are to be fully available for review by the CRA to verify data accuracy and adherence to study protocol. The CRA will adhere to all requirements for subject confidentiality."
86,page_86,"Clinical Protocol Confidential Purdue Pharma L.P. Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 87 of 173 11.5 Records Retention The investigator has the responsibility to retain all study documents, including but not limited to the protocol, site source documents, copies of CRFs, Investigator's Brochure, regulatory documents (eg, FDA 1572 form, ICFs, and IRB/IEC correspondence) in accordance with ICH E6 (4.9.5) and 21 CFR 312.62(c). In addition, if applicable the sponsor (or designee) will send a list of treatment codes by study subject to the investigator after the clinical database for this study has been unblinded. The clinical site should plan on retaining study documents per the site contract. 11.6 Inspection Procedures A government regulatory authority may conduct an inspection during the study or after its completion. If an inspection is requested by a regulatory authority the investigator or designee must immediately inform the sponsor that a request has been made. 11.7 Publication of Results Any formal presentation or publication of data collected as a direct or indirect result of this trial will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator(s) and the appropriate personnel at the sponsor’s site. Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement. For multicenter studies, it is mandatory that the first publication is based on data obtained from all analyzed subjects as stipulated in the protocol by the sponsor’s statisticians, and not by the investigators themselves. Investigators participating in multicenter studies must agree not to present data gathered individually or by a subgroup of centers prior to the full, initial publication, unless this has been agreed to by all other investigators and the sponsor. The sponsor must receive copies of any intended communication at least 30 working days in advance for an abstract or oral presentation and 60 days in advance for a manuscript. This is to allow the sponsor to review the communication for accuracy (thus avoiding potential discrepancies with submissions to regulatory authorities), to verify that confidential information is not being inadvertently divulged, to allow for the filing of additional patent protection, to provide any relevant supplementary information, and to allow establishment of co-authorship. The authorship of communications arising from pooled data will include selected members from clinical sites as well as sponsor personnel."

Protocol: VAN2001 Protocol Amendment 1 Page 94 of 173 Appendix C: Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection, Processing, Storage, and Shipment Detailed instructions are provided in the study-specific Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Manual (PK Manual) which will be provided separately to the clinical site. Collect PK blood samples to analyze V120083 concentrations in plasma using labeled 4 mL-draw K 2EDTA Vacutainer® evacuated collection tubes. After obtaining the PK blood sample, mix collection tube thoroughly by slowly inverting the collection tube several times. Place the collection tube in an ice/water bath immediately after collection and inversion. Within 30 minutes of blood sample collection, centrifuge the blood samples in a refrigerated centrifuge set at approximately 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at approximately 4°C. Transfer clear supernatant (plasma), using clean disposable pipettes, split equally into appropriately prelabeled cryotubes (primary and back-up). Within 60 minutes of blood sample collection, store plasma samples in a freezer set to maintain a temperature of -20°C. At times agreed upon by the sponsor and the clinical site, one set of samples (primary) will be packed in sufficient dry ice and shipped to the sponsor designated bioanalytical laboratory as per the Sample Shipment schedule. The second set (back-up samples) will be shipped separately to the sponsor designated bioanalytical laboratory as per the Sample Shipment schedule. On the day of shipment, clinical site staff will notify (via telephone or email) the contact person at the bioanalytical laboratory about the shipment and provide the tracking number of the pending shipment."
