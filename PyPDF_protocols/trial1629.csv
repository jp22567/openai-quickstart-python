Part A A schematic of the study design for Part A is provided below. Approximately 12 subjects (F/F or F/MF genotypes) are planned for enrollment. During the Treatment Period, subjects will be administered VX-445/TEZ/IVA for approximately 15 days. A review of safety, tolerability, and available PK data will be completed by an internal Vertex team after Part A to confirm or adjust the dose(s) chosen for Part B. Additional subjects may be enrolled as needed in Part A, based on emerging PK data, to confirm the dose(s) for Part B. Part A Study Design Part B A schematic of the study design for Part B is provided below. Part B will initiate after completion of the internal Vertex team’s review of available data in Part A that will confirm or adjust the dose(s) to be evaluated in Part B. Approximately 56 subjects (F/F or F/MF genotypes) are planned for enrollment to ensure approximately 45 subjects complete Part B. Approximately 25 subjects with F/MF genotypes and approximately 20 subjects with F/F genotypes are targeted for enrollment in Part B. During the Treatment Period, subjects will be administered VX-445/TEZ/IVA for approximately 24 weeks. Subjects who complete the Part B Treatment Period and have not permanently discontinued study drug will be offered the opportunity to enroll in an optional open-label extension safety study (enrollment will be based on the eligibility criteria specified within the Open-label Extension Safety Study protocol)."

6,page_6,"Protocol VX18-445-106, Version 3.0 Page 7 of 78 Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedStatistical AnalysesData from Parts A and Part B will be analyzed separately. Part A Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled in Part A. Sample size calculations were determined based on VX-445 PK using noncompartmental analysis-based parameters, such as clearance and volume of distribution. Based on the variability observed in adults, data from 12 subjects will allow 80% power to target a 95% CI within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimate of clearance for VX-445. Part B With 45 subjects expected to complete Part B, there is a 90% chance of observing an AE in at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate is 5%, and a >95% chance of observing an AE in at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate is 10%. For the primary endpoint, summary statistics will be provided for treatment-emergent AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, standard 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry. IDMC Reviews An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct periodic safety review(s) of study data as outlined in the IDMC charter (Part B only)."

23,page_23,"Protocol VX18-445-106, Version 3.0 Page 24 of 78 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated5 INTRODUCTION 5.1 Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive chronic disease with serious morbidities and frequent premature mor tality. CF affects more than 70,000 individuals worldwide1 (approximately 30,000 in the US2and 45,000 in the EU3). Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan disease .4, 5 CF is caused by decreased quantity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene.6CFTR is an ion channel that regulates the flow of chloride and other ions across epithelia in various tissues, including the lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands.7Decreased CFTR quantity or function results in the failure to regulate chloride transport in these tissues leading to the multisystem pathology associated with CF.8In the lungs, obstruction of airways with thick mucus, establishment of a chronic bacterial infection in the airways, and damaging inflammatory response s are all thought to play a role in causing irreversible structural changes in the lungs, leading to respiratory failure. Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality.9 The most common disease-causing CFTR mutation is F508del , which accounts for approximately 70% of the identified alleles in people with CF.10Approximately 40% to 45% of people with CF are homozygous for F508del (F/F), and approximately 85% have at least 1F508del allele .2, 3 Based on the understanding of the molecular defects caused by CFTR mutations, 2 complementary approaches have been develope d to address the decreased quantity and/or function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators increase the channel open probabilit y (channel gating activity) of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface to enhance ion transport. With differing mechanisms of action, a combination of correctors and potentiators increases F508del CFTR-mediated chloride transport more than either type of modulator alone. The therapeutic activity of CFTR modulators has been established with products developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and approved for the treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco #), lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA (Orkambi®), and tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA (Symdeko #/Symkevi®). VX-445 is a next-generation CFTR corrector. In vitro, the triple combination (TC) of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) increased CFTR chloride transport more than any of the dual combinations (VX-445/TEZ, VX-445/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) or individual components (VX-445, TEZ, and IVA) when added to human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells derived from 2 groups of CF patients: those heterozygous for F508del with a second CFTR allele carrying a minimal function (MF) mutation that is not responsive to IVA and TEZ/IVA (F/MF genotypes); and those homozygous for F508del (F/F genotypes). Additional information about VX-445/TEZ/IVA can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 5.2 Study Rationale Given the progressive nature of CF, there is a strong rationale for preventing disease progression by treating patients earlier in life.

Screening data from the previous study will be considered sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this study. Procedures required by this protocol will only be done if the procedures were not performed for the previous study. All screening data from these subjects must be obtained within 28 days before administration of study drug. 9.1.1.1 Repetition of Screening Assessments Parts A and B Screening assessments may be repeated once to establish study eligibility. If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibilit y criteria and completed within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 9.1.1.2 RescreeningParts A and B Subjects may be rescreened once. If a subject is rescreened, the subject will provide informed consent and assent (as applicable), and all screening assessments will be repeated, except for: !CFTR genotyping !Ophthalmologic examination (if performed within 3 months before the date of informed consent) If a subject is rescreened, a new screening window will begin when the first rescreening assessment has been initiated. 9.1.1.3 Extension of Screening Period WindowParts A and B A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks for the following reasons: !Repetition of the Screening Pe riod assessments (Sectio n 9.1.1.1) !Unexpected operational or logistic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria !Scheduling of ophthalmologic examination (Section 11.5.5) 9.1.2 Treatment Period Parts A and B The Treatment Period will last approximately 15 days in Part A and 24 weeks in Part B. Study drug administration details are provided in Section 9.6.

The IDMC objectives and operational details will be defined in a separate document (IDMC Charter), which will be finalized before the first subject is screened. The IDMC will conduct regular planned reviews of study data as outlined in the IDMC Charter. 9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups This is an open-label study. Rando mization is not required because all subjects will be treated identically. An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to dispense dosage based on subject weight at Day 1. 9.3 Rationale for Study Elements 9.3.1 Study Design The subjects studied are from the population that is expected to benefit from treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA."
33,page_33,"Protocol VX18-445-106, Version 3.0 Page 34 of 78 Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedPart A The open-label design is considered adequate to evaluate the PK and safety of VX-445/TEZ/IVA in this pediatric population. Evaluation of a single-dose level is sufficient for the assessment of VX-445/TEZ/IVA across subjects in different weight ranges to confirm the doses and appropriate weight cutoff for Part B. Part B Part B is designed to evaluate the long-term safety in the pediatric CF population. This design is in harmony with guidelines for the study of human subjects, especially children, and balances safety concerns with potential benefits for the individual. 9.3.2 Study Population Parts A and B Patients with an F/MF genotype (30% of all patients with CF) generally have severe disease and do not have approved CFTR modulator therapy available to them; clinical studies of LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA did not show improvement in lung func tion in this patient population. Without an available CFTR modulator therapy, patients with F/MF genotypes must continue to rely on adjunctive treatments and symptomatic therapies to manage their severe CF disease. Patients with an F/F genotype also have continuing unmet need despite the availability of CFTR modulators for this populatio n. Based on in vitro data and preliminary clinical data, VX-445/TEZ/IVA is expected to provide a clinically relevant advantage over currently available treatments for F/MF and F/F patients. Given the progressive nature of CF, there is a strong rationale for treating patients earlier in life. Experience with CFTR modulators in pediatric sub jects ≥6 to ≤11 years of age, including with TEZ/IVA, suggests that the safety profile of VX-445/TEZ/IVA will be similar in children and adults, which supports evaluation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA in pediatric subjects in the present study. 9.3.3 Study Drug Dose and DurationParts A and BVX-445 Dosage A VX-445 dose of 200 mg qd was evaluated in Phase 3 studies of adult and adolescent (≥12 years of age) CF subjects with F/MF and F/F genotypes. The 200-mg dose was selected based on an assessment of the benefit- risk profile from Phase 2 Study VX16-445-001 (Study 445-001) which evaluated a range of VX-445 doses (50 mg qd, 100 mg qd, and 200 mg qd) in TC with TEZ/IVA in CF subjects with F/MF and F/F genotypes. In Study 445-001, the TC was generally safe and well tolerated in all VX-445 dose groups. Subjects with F/MF genotypes who received the VX-445 200 mg qd TC demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in ppFEV 1(within-group mean [SE] absolute change of 13.8 [1.4] percentage points from baseline [P<0.0001], compared with a mean absolute change of 0.0 [2.0] percentage points in subjects who received placebo [ P= 0.9943]). A similar magnitude of change was observed in subjects with F/F genotypes compared with subjects who received the active comparator of TEZ/IVA. Part A The VX-445 dose of 100 mg qd selected for evaluation in Part A was determined based on population-PK modeling utilizing da ta from adults and simulating exposures over a range of"
34,page_34,"Protocol VX18-445-106, Version 3.0 Page 35 of 78 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporatedbody weights typical for a population of 6- to <12-year-olds, ranging from 15 to 50 kg. The simulations indicate that a VX-445 dose of 100 mg qd is predicted to provide exposures that would not exceed the exposures observed in adults dosed with 200 mg qd. Hence, the VX-445 100-mg qd dose was predicted to be safe and was selected to be evaluated in Part A for all subject weight groups. Part B For Part B, subjects in the higher weight range will be administered VX-445 200 mg qd. The appropriate weight cutoff for the switch from 100 mg qd to 200 mg qd was determined based on population-PK modeling which was updated w ith preliminary PK data from Part A and data from studies conducted in adult and adolescent CF subjects. For Part B, a VX-445 dose of 100 mg qd will be evaluated in subjects weighing <30 kg. In subjects weighing ≥30 kg, a VX-445 dose of 200 mg qd will be evaluated. These doses are predicted to be safe based on PK data from Part A, data obtained from adults in the Ph ase 2 Study 445-001, and preliminary data obtained from adults and adolescents (12- to <18-year-olds) in Phase 3 Studies 445-102 and 445-103. TEZ and IVA Dosages TEZ will be administered as 50 mg qd and IVA will be administered as 75 mg every 12 hours (q12h) in all subjects in Part A and in subjects weighing <30 kg in Part B. In Part B, doses of TEZ 100 mg qd and IVA 150 mg q12h will be administered in subjects weighing ≥30 kg. The dosages and weight cutoff in Part B were selected based on an evaluation of PK and safety of TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 6 to 11 years of age in Part A of Study VX15-661-113 (Study 661-113). Part B of Study 661-113 assessed the safety and efficacy of TEZ/IVA at these doses in CF subjects 6 to 11 years of age. Part A Duration of Dosing The 15-day duration of dosing was chosen to provide an adequate assessment PK, safety, and tolerability of VX-445/TEZ/IVA before exposing subjects to a longer duration of treatment in Part B. Part B Duration of Dosing The 24-week duration of dosing was chosen to provide an adequate assessment of long-term safety. 9.3.4 Rationale for Study Assessments Parts A and B The PK, safety, efficacy, and PD assessments are standard parameters for clinical studies in drug development and are generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study of subjects with CF. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmologic examinations are recommended for monitoring of pediatric patients treated with IVA-containing drug regimens, and have been added to the standard safety assessments."

For subjects who are screened but are not subsequently enrolled, details of prior medication will be documented only in the subjects’ source documents. !Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from 28 days before the Day 1 Visit through completion of study participati on. Stable treatment re gimen is defined as the current treatment regimen for CF that subj ects have been following for at least 28 days before the Day 1 Visit. Subjects should not init iate long-term treatment with new medication from 28 days before the Day 1 Visit through completion of study participation. Guidelines for stable treatment reg imens for CF are as follows: o Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. o Subjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto the inhaled antibiotic. o Subjects who alternate between 2 different i nhaled antibiotics should remain on the same cycling schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled antibiotics. !Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days. !VX-445 may inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, which may increase the exposure of medicinal products that are substrates for these transporters. Substrates such as statins, glyburide, nateglinide, and repaglinide should be used with caution."

Should any unacceptable toxicity arise, individual subjects will be withdrawn from the study and dosing will cease. 9.8 Study Drug Interruption and Stopping RulesPart B In subjects who have interrupted study drug f or >72 hours for any reason, the investigator should resume study drug only after a thorough investigation of the cause for interruption. The investigator will evaluate the subject’s clinical stability and should consider resumption of study drug only after the subject is clinically stable and there is no comorbidity or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the subject. The medical monitor should be notified of an interruption of study drug that lasts >72 hours for any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such interruption. In subjects for whom study drug was previously interrupted, the medical monitor should be notified of any plan to discontinue study drug, before the discontinuation has occurred, if possible. 9.8.1 Liver Function TestsParts A and B The central laboratory will notify the medical monitor of ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN that are derived from centrally submitted samples. Subjects with new treatment-emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, with or without total bilirubin >2 × ULN, must be followed cl osely, including confirmatory testing performed by the central laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the init ial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmat ory testing, a local laboratory may be used. Local laboratory results must be reported immed iately to the medical monitor, and the subject must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if any of the following criteria are met: !ALT or AST >8 × ULN !ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks !ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression. Study drug administration must be discontinued if the following criteria are met:"

If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or clinical jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the duration of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elev ation interruption threshold recurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the init ial elevation by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 9.8.2 Rash Parts A and B Individuals who develop a generalized rash wi ll be monitored closely. Study drug dosing should be interrupted if a subject develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a rash that is considered a serious adverse event (SAE). The investigator will notify the medical monitor of any rash that results in interruption of study drug, is Grade 3 or higher (Section 13.1.1.4) , or is an SAE. Investigators should consider addition al evaluation including laboratory testing (e.g., complete blood count with differential, liver function tests), photographs of the rash, and dermatology consultation. The investigator may consider resumption of study drug if considered clinically appropriate. 9.9 Removal of Subjects Parts A and B Subjects may withdraw from the study at any ti me at their own request. Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at th e discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be followed, provided th at the subject has not withdrawn consent (and assent, as applicable). In addition, a subject must be discontinued from study drug treatment if the subject meets any of the following criteria: !Has a screening CFTR genotype that does not confirm study eligibility if a previous CFTR genotype laboratory report was used to es tablish eligibility. These subjects must be discontinued from the study (Section 8.1) !Meets any of the stopping (discontinuation) criteria (Section 9.8) !Becomes pregnant (Section 11.5.6.2) Subjects who discontinue study drug treatment should return for study assessments, as noted in Section 9.1.4."

Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at the study site and analyzed at the central laboratory. A local laboratory may be used for the Week 20 sample if a subject cannot return to the site for the blood draw. The urine pregnancy test on Day 1 must be negative before the first dose of study drug is administered to the subject. Additional pregnancy tests may be required according to local regulations and/or requirements. CF genotype (Screening Period only): CF genotyping will be performed on all subjects to confirm the genotype documented in the subject's medical record. This assessment does not need to be repeated in the case of rescreening or for confirmed subjects in Part A who wish to participate in Part B. G6PD Activity Test (Part A Screening Peri od Only): A blood samp le will be collected for a quantitative G6PD activity assay, which will be pe rformed in an established laboratory that runs the assay routinely. The use of a local laboratory that routinely runs the assay is permissible following approval by the medical monitor. Drug and Alcohol Screening (Screening Period [ Part A Only] and Day 1 [ Part A Only ]): opiates, methadone, cannabinoids, cocaine, amphetamines/methamphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cotinine, and alcohol will be assessed by a urine test. Subjects may undergo random urine drug screen and alcohol testing if deemed appropriate by the investigator. Drug screen result will be negative for all subjects to receive study drug. Drug and alcohol testing may be performed at the discretion of the investigator in Part B. Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if judged by the investigator to be clinically appropriate. For the purposes of study conduct and unless noted otherwise (e.g., G6PD activity test), only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically signif icant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value. 11.5.3 Physical Examinations and Vital SignsParts A and B A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and select study visits. At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and symptom-directed vital signs assessments can be performed at the di scretion of the investig ator or healthcar e provider . A PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and throat; respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital ex aminations will be pe rformed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs. Symptom-directed PEs and symptom-directed vi tal signs assessment may be performed if appropriate."

Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic a nd diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and respiration rate. These will be assessed following at least a 5-minute rest in the seated or supine position. Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be assessed following at least a 5-minute rest and before study drug dosing. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry will be collected before study drug dosing. 11.5.4 Electrocardiograms Parts A and B Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout. Additional standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: !The ECG will be done before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such as blood draws. !The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5 minutes before having an ECG. !ECGs will be performed in triplicate at the Day 1 Visit (Part A only). A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through completion of study participation will be recorded as AEs. To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified i ndividual at the study site will make comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60 msec from the baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 a dditional ECGs will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60 msec from baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. 11.5.5 Ophthalmologic ExaminationParts A and B Ophthalmologic examinations do not need to be completed if there is documentation of bilateral lens removal for the subject. All examinations will be conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist and will include: !measurement of best-corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; and !pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp. The screening examination does not need to be conducted if there is documentation of an examination meeting th e protocol requirements that was conducted within 3 months before the date of informed consent. Any clinically significant abnormal findings will be reported as AEs."

Statist ical analysis details will be provided in the statist ical analysis plan ( SAP), and clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology analysis plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the study. 12.1 Sample Size and Power Part A Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled in Part A. Sample size calculations were determined based on VX-445 PK, using noncompartmental analysis (NCA)-based parameters, such as clearance and volume of distribution. Based on th e variability observed in adults, data from 12 subjects will allow 80% power to target a 95% CI within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimate of clearance for VX-445. Part B The planned enrollment is approximately 56 subjects. Approximately 45 subjects are expected to complete Part B. Incidence of AEs is a saf ety endpoint. Table 12-1 presents estimates of the probability for observi ng at least 1 subject with an AE for the given incidence ( θ) and sample size. The study will have at least 90% chance of observing an AE in at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate is 5%; and a >95% chance of observing an AE in at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate is 10%. The probabilities have been calculated by assuming a binomial distribution for the number of AEs using SAS ®.

This analysis set will be used for all individual subject data listings and disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified. 12.3 Statistical Analysis 12.3.1 General Considerations Parts A and B Data from Part A and Part B will be analyzed separately. Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be presented to 1 decimal place. Treatment-emergent (TE) period for Parts A and B will include the time from the first dose of study drug in the respective Part through 28 days after the last dose, or the completion of study participation date, whichever is earlier. Baseline for Part A, unless otherwise specified, is defined as the most recent nonmissing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected be fore the first dose of study drug in Part A. For ECGs, baseline will be defined as the most recent pretreatment measurement (or the average of replicate measurements, if the most recent pretreatment measurement is obtained in replicates) before the first dose of study drug. For sweat chloride, the baseline value will be the mean of assessment values on the left and the right arm at the most recent time point prior to the first dose of study drug. The measurement end time can be up to 30 minutes after dosing to be considered in the calculation for baseline sweat chloride. Baseline for Part B will be similarly defined. Absolute change from baseline will be calculated as post-baseline value – baseline value. Relative change from baseline will be calculated as (post-baseline value – baseline value)/baseline value."

This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed. An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1. 13.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically-significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract in fection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of the following: !Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment !Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention !A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically signi ficant will be made by the investigator. A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not au tomatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life-threatening AE. 13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.6. All subjects w ill be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:"
63,page_63,"Protocol VX18-445-106, Version 3.0 Page 64 of 78 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated!Description of the event !Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” !Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) !Severity !Causal relationship to study drug(s) !Action taken !Outcome !Concomitant medication or other treatment given 13.1.1.4 Adverse Event SeverityThe investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm (Accessed February 2019). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” In considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1. Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity Classification Definition Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities Life-threatening (Grade 4)Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death 13.1.1.5 Adverse Event Causality Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2."
64,page_64,"Protocol VX18-445-106, Version 3.0 Page 65 of 78 Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedTable 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality Classification Definition Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational study drug, a plausib le mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event reappeared on re-exposure to the investigational study drug. Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administration of the investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease. Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be related to factors other than investigational study drug. Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject’s medical record). 13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3. Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE Classification Definition Dose not changed Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE Dose reduced Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE Drug interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE Drug withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE Not applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible. 13.1.1.7 Adverse Event Outcome An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4."

Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow-up) 13.1.1.8 Treatment Given The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any tr eatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absen ce of any kind of treatment for an AE. 13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: !Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs duri ng participation in the study or occurs after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug) !Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred !Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization !Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) !Congenital anomaly or birth defect !Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home) If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., so cial hospi talization for purpos es of respite care) will not be considered to indicate an SAE."
66,page_66,"Protocol VX18-445-106, Version 3.0 Page 67 of 78 Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedClarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocard ial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pos e a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations. 13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through completion of study participation, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS. In addition, all SAEs that occur after completion of study participation and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . SAEs will be recorded on the Ver tex Organized Sa fety Information Co llection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a rec ognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the inve stigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 13.1.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless of the presumed relationship to the i nvestigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to repo rt follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities. Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via: Email: (preferred choice) Fax: For questions, contact telephone: 13.1.2.4 Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IECs, and participating investigators in accordance wi th ICH Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements, as applicable. In addition, Vertex, or authorized designee, will be responsible for the submission of safety letters to central IECs. It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee to promptly notify the local IRB/local IEC of all unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human subjects."

The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant. Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into a CRF by study site personnel using a secure, validated, web-based electronic data capture (EDC) application. Vertex will have read-only access to site-en tered clinical data in the EDC application. Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator for resolution. Any changes to study data will be made to the CRF and documented in an audit trail, which will be maintained within the clinical database. 13.4 Monitoring Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by Vertex will be followed to comply with GCP guidelines. On-site checking of the CRFs/SAE Forms for completeness and clarity, cross-checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be performed. The study will be monitored by Vertex or it s designee. Monitoring will be done by personal visits from a representative of Vertex, or designee (study site monitor), who will review the CRFs/SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements. Protocol deviations will be monitored and identified throughout study conduct as outlined in the Protocol Deviation Plan. 13.5 Electronic Data Capture Vertex will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on the EDC application sufficient to permit study site personnel to en ter or correct information in the CRFs on the subjects for which they are responsible. A CRF will be completed for each enrolled study subject.

73,page_73,"Protocol VX18-445-106, Version 3.0 Page 74 of 78 Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedAPPENDIX A Eligible MF CFTR Mutations “MF” mutations are a subset of minimal function mutations that are non-responsive to IVA and TEZ/IVA. A mutation is considered an MF mutation if it meets at least 1 of the following 2 criteria: (1) No biological plausibility of translated protein (genetic sequence predicts the complete absence of CFTR protein), or (2) in vitro testing that supports lack of responsiveness to IVA and TEZ/IVA.Inclusion of MF Mutations Based on In Vitro Testing Mutations that were considered to be MF mutations based on in vitro testing met the following criteria in in vitro experiments: !baseline chloride transport that was <10% of wildtype CFTR !an increase in chloride transport of <10% over baseline following the addition of IVA and TEZ/IVA in the assay Eligible MF Mutations The list below represents acceptable mutations, which are detectable by an FDA-cleared genotyping assay or other method (e.g., sequencing); however, this list may not include every eligible mutation, and investigators should contact the medical monitor regarding other mutations that may also meet study eligibility criteria."
