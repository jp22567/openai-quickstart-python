INTRODUCTION Stroke represents the second single most frequent cause of death for people older than 60 years, the most frequent cause of permanent disability, and the second most common cause of dementia, and uses approximately 3 –7% of the total health -care expenditure in high-income countries. By 2050, more than 1.5 billion people in the world will be a ged 65 years or older and the global burden of stroke will keep increasing in parallel with the ageing popula tion.1 Although a remarkable progress has been made in the management of patients with acute ischemic stroke during the past 10 years, with the widespread implementation of specialist stroke units, evidence of the efficacy of intravenous (IV) thrombolytic treatment, and reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) establishing the value of endovascular thrombectomy , 2 stroke still represents the first cause of permanent disability in adult people . In consequence, there is a pressing need to continue investigat ing new treatments for this devastating disease . 2.1 Background and rationale 2.1.1 Overview of reperfusion therapy in acute ischemic stroke Intravascular thrombosis remains a leading cause of death and disability for which thrombolysis is the only pharmacological remedy. The thrombolytic, rt-PA, has become essentially synonymous with thrombolysis but its use, or that of one of its longer half -life derivates, has been declining due to its inadequate efficacy in AMI, incompatibility with PCI, limited efficacy and risk of ICH in ischemic stroke, and too high a bleeding risk for most patients with venous thromboembolism. Instead, intra -arterial dev ices have become the treatment of choice in AMI are becoming more frequently used in ischemic stroke as well. The resort to these time -consuming methods to treat very time -sensitive conditions is a reflection on the inadequacy of current thrombolysis. The main aim of acute ischemic stroke treatment is to salvage the penumbra or volume of hypo -perfused, non -functional, yet still viable tissue surrounding the infarcted core, and several reperfusion therapies have shown positive clinical results. A meta -analysis of individual patient data from nine randomized trials comparing intravenous alteplase with placebo or open control showed that alteplase increased the odds of a good stroke outcome (i .e., a modified Rankin scale score of zero or one at 3 –6 months), with earlier treatment associated with bigger proportional benefi t.3 Accordingly, rapid administration of IV recombinant tissue -type plasminogen activator ( rt-PA) to appropriate patients remains the mainstay of early treatment of acute ischemic st roke.4 However, IV rt-PA induces recanalization in only 40% of the cases ,5 and th is rate is even lower in occlusions of the"
13,page_13,"STUDY PROTOCOL CHOICE Version 3.0 November 28, 201 9 CONFIDENTIAL Page 14 of 54 M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery or the intracranial internal carotid artery, where the rate of recanalization is approximately 20% and 10%,6,7 respectively. IA thrombolysis involves administration of high concentrations of thrombolytic agents near the thrombus, utilizing lower doses than systemic administration , which may result in lower systemic complications, and less local neurotoxic effects of thrombolytic agents. The disadvantages of the IA modality include the potential delay required to obtain initial cerebral angiography and position of the micro -catheter for administration of the thrombolytic agent. IA throm bolysis also allows the simultaneous use of mechanical devices to facilitate thrombolysis ,8 and c ombining the IA delivery with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) increases the surface area exposed to the thrombolytic agents. Th e concern of delaying treatment onset using the IA route alone led to the initiative of delivering the IA thrombolysis following IV thrombolysis. Thus, th e Emergency Management of Stroke (EMS) bridging trial, which had a randomized, double -blind, placebo control design, demonstrated high er recanalization rates (53%) in the combined IV/IA alteplase treatment group than in the IA alteplase group (28%).9 In this study, 35 patients were treated within 3 hours of symptom onset and received IV rt-PA (0.6 mg/kg, 60 mg maximum, 10% of the dose a s a bolus over 1 minute and the remainder over 30 minutes) or placebo. This was followed by immediate cerebral a ngiography a nd local IA administration of rt-PA through the catheter if a clot in the appropriate arterial distribution was identified. A maximu m local IA dose of 20 mg was given and the infusion was continued for a maximum of 2 hours. In EMS , there was no difference in clinical outcomes between the 2 groups and no significant difference in the rate of symptomatic ICH. Indeed, there were no parenchymal hematomas in the trial; symptomatic ICH within 24 hours occurred in 1 placebo/IA patient only; beyond 24 hours, symptomatic ICH occurred in 2 IV/IA patients only. The Interventional Management of Stroke Trial III (IMS II I) was a PROBE, 2 -arm, superiority trial that enrolled 656 patients with a major ischemic stroke who received IV rt- PA within 3 hours of stroke onset . 10 Patients were randomly allocated 1:2 to standard dose IV rt-PA (0.9 mg/kg) or to IV rt-PA 0.6 mg/kg followed by endovascular therapy with a device and/or IA rt-PA, if occlusion persisted and if the endovascular intervention could be begun within 5 hours and completed within 7 hours of onset. For subjects who the study neurointerventionalist el ected to treat with the standard micro -catheter infusion of rt -PA, as in the IMS I Pilot Trial, the rt -PA concentration for IA administration was 0.5 mg/1 ml solution (50 mg/100 cc - reconstituted with 50 cc of sterile water without preservatives and diluted to 100 cc total with 50 cc normal saline). A maximum IA dose of 22 mg was administered over two hours of infusion. The trial was stopped early for futility after 656 of"
14,page_14,"STUDY PROTOCOL CHOICE Version 3.0 November 28, 201 9 CONFIDENTIAL Page 15 of 54 projected 900 subjects were enrolled. There was no significant difference in outcome between the IV rt-PA only group and the endovascular group for the primary end point of the percentage of patients with a good outcome as measured by modified Rankin Scale (mRS ) score of 0 to 2 or for death at 90 days. Findings in the endovascular -therapy and intravenous rt-PA groups were similar for mortality at 90 days (19.1% and 21.6%, respectively; P = 0.52) and the proportion of patients with symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 30 hours after initiation of t -PA (6.2% and 5.9%, respectively; P = 0.83). Yet, the IMS III trial showed that the proportion of patients who obtained a mRS score of 2 or less at 90 days of the therapy (primary outcome of the study) increased in parallel with the magnitude of reperfusion measured using the Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grade .11 Thus, the primary outcome occurred in 12.7% of the 55 patients with a TICI score of 0, in 27.6% of the 29 patients with a TICI score of 1, in 34.3% of the 108 patients with a TICI score of 2a, in 47.9% of the 119 patients with a TICI score of 2b, and in 71.4% of the 7 patients with a TICI score of 3 (P<0.001). These results highlight the importance of obtaining complete brain reperfusion to maximize the benefits of mechanical thrombectomy. Prior small case series have demonstrated that IA therapy with thrombolytic agents,12 ,13 Mechanical Clot Disruption (MCD),14 or a combination of IA thrombolytic agents with MCD 15,16 are safe and effective with and without prior full -dose IVT in restoring flow in acute large artery occlusions. Nine IA thrombolytic agents, when used in low doses, have been found to be safe in conjunction with MCD. A series of 8 patients suggested that an IA rt-PA dose up to 40 mg is safe,17 but these patients did not receive prior IVT. The overall efficacy and safety of IA versus IV thrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke was updated in a recent meta -analysis18 that showed that IA thrombolysis in patients was significantly more likely to result in a favourable outcome than was IVT. However, other meta -analyses using different study selection criteria found no significant benefit of IA over IV.19 Altogether, IA thrombolysis initiated within 6 h o f stroke onset might be considered in carefully selected patients who have contraindications to the use of IV alteplase, although alteplase does not have US Food and Drug Administration approval for intra -arterial use, and the adverse effects associated wi th this administration route have yet to be established .20 Unfortunately, t here are no published reports of observational or randomized studies of IA thrombolysis performed after MT to attempt improving the perfusion rate of territories distal to the proximal arterial occlusion. In 2015, several RCTs showed that MT results in complete vessel recanalization in three of four treated patients, and this treatment was superior to IV alteplase in improving stroke outcomes in selected patients with large proximal artery occlusions. 21,22,23,24,25 A"
15,page_15,"STUDY PROTOCOL CHOICE Version 3.0 November 28, 201 9 CONFIDENTIAL Page 16 of 54 comprehensive systematic review and meta -analysis of eight RCTs ( totalling 2049 patients) confirmed that MT was associated with an increased likelihood of good outcome (i.e., a modified Rankin scale score of zero to two at 90 days) compared with standard alteplase treatment.26 Patients receiving alteplase before MT also had a sig nificant improvement in outcome compared with patients who received only one of these treatment approaches (Yarbrough et al. 2015). MT in combination with IA pharmacologic thrombolysis has been associated with higher rates of recanalization.27 In a recent individual patient data meta -analysis by the HERMES group of patients with large -vessel ischemic stroke, earlier treatment with MT + medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone was associated with lower degrees of disability at 3 months and the clin ical benefit became non -significant after 7.3 hours.28 More recently, the DAWN (Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) or computerized tomography perfusion (CTP) assessment with clinical mismatch in the triage of wake up and late presenting strokes undergoing neu ro- intervention with Trevo) data was reported .29 Patients with wake -up and late -presenting stroke were screened and if they met the inclusion criteria (age ≥18 years, NIHSS ≥10, pre-mRS 0 –1, time -last-seen -well to randomization 6 –24 hours, excluding large i nfarcts and confirmation of large vessel occlusion on CTA or MRA) underwent imaging with the RAPID software, CTP or DWI. Qualifying patients had to meet the following clinical imaging mismatch criteria: patients’ ≥80 years old had to have NIHSS ≥10 with a core ˂21cc; ˂80 year old patients had to have NIHSS ≥10 with a core of ˂31cc or NIHSS ≥20 with a core of ˂51cc. The symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) rate was 4.8% in the treatment arm versus 3.2% in th e control arm. A statistically significant difference was observed in neurological deterioration (defined as greater than 4 points worse on the NIHSS by five days) between the two groups with 10.5% in the treatment arm versus 22.1% in the control arm (p˂0. 01). In the weighted mRS based co -primary outcome, the mean mRS value in the treatment group was 5.5 versus 3.4 in the control group; a 2.1 difference in the weighted mRS score, which is highly significant with a Bayesian probability of superiority of >0.9 999 (which is similar to p˂0.0001). The co -primary endpoint of 90 -day functional independence was 48.6% in the treatment group versus 13.1% in the control group; a 35.5% actual difference, which is highly significant with a Bayesian probability of superior ity of >0.9999. This translates to a number needed to treat of 2.8 to achieve functional independence. Despite the unquestionable value of current reperfusion therapies less than half of the patients that receive MT show permanent benefits. 15–19 A likely relevant reason to these insufficient clinical benefits is the lack of adequate brain reperfusion despite successful recanalization (futile recanalization). In the recent endovascular trials, “successful” brain reperfusion occurred in 75% of treated patients, including a group of 37% of patients who"
16,page_16,"STUDY PROTOCOL CHOICE Version 3.0 November 28, 201 9 CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 of 54 obtained complete reperfusion (mTICI 3 sc ore) and a group of 38% of patients who obtained only near complete reperfusion (mTICI 2b score ) on cerebral angiography . Although several studies have shown a graded association between the amount of brain tissue re -perfused and the degree of clinical ben efit,30 the most recent endovascular trials did not report individual stroke outcomes amongst patients with mTICI 2b or 3 score s. 2.1.2 Maximizing brain reperfusion: a target for treatment improvement Structural and functional alterations in the microvasculature may be major barriers for adequate reperfusion of the ischemic brain regardless of complete recanalization and constitute the no -reflow phenomenon .31,32 In experimental models , downstream microvascular thrombosis (DMT) may occur early during brain ischemia and before recanalization , and this mechanism may be a major contributing factor to incomplete reperfusion.33 It is possible that a similar mechanism may limit the therapeutic potential of MT in patients with acute stroke . Originally attributed to spasm or cellular swelling around the vessel wall, th e no reflow phenomenon is currently ascribed to microvascular clogging triggered by neutrophils trapped within the microcirculation ,34 clogging of the perivascular space,35 distal micro -embolism,36 and oxidative stress generated in pericytes,37,38 or arteriolar smooth muscle cells.39 In experimental studies, this clogging was prevented or reversed using genetic or pharmacological manipulations of cell mediated inflammation,40 but these measures were futile or harmful at the bedside.41 Considering the nature of the se mechanisms, we believe that IA thrombolytic therapy is a pharmacological approach that deserve s adequate testing is patients with incomplete reperfusion following MT. Mechanical embolus retrieval does recanalize the occluded larger arteries without considering the status of the distal smaller arteries. However, recanalization of the primary arterial occlusive lesion does not necessarily transla te into reperfusion of ischemic tissue through the distal capillaries. IA pharmacologic therapy remains the only possible alternative in such situations to ensure complete angiographic reperfusion to the ischemic tissue. 2.1.3 Justification of CHOICE While previous studies of improving brain reperfusion using IA thrombolytic therapy were done before the recanalization of a proximal LVO, in this project we intend to administer IA thrombolysis after the successful recanalization of a LVO. Indeed, this temporal approach might prove to be crucial to facilitate a greater access of the drug to the distal vascular bed and thus allow a more effective lytic effect on microcirculatory thrombi. The current guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) states that the use of salvage technical adjuncts including IA fibrinolysis may be reasonable to achieve a satisfactory"
17,page_17,"STUDY PROTOCOL CHOICE Version 3.0 November 28, 201 9 CONFIDENTIAL Page 18 of 54 angiographi c result in patients treated with MT (Class IIb recommendation).[20] Yet, the usefulness, and effectiveness of salvage IA thrombolysis are not well established. The AHA/ASA also recommends that the angiographic technical goal of MT is to achieve a mTICI 2b or 3 scores.[20] Yet, growing evidence shows that combining these two mTICI scores into a single category of angiographic results may be misleading because they may show significant differences in clinical and radiologic outcomes. [11,42,43] To better addre ss this issue, we reviewed recently our own experience, and compared the clinical and radiologic outcomes of patients with a mTICI 3 or a mTICI 2b score at the end of MT .44 All these patients received stent -retrievers and pretreatment IV alteplase was administered to approximately one third of the patients. The outcomes were evaluated in multivariate models following the HERMES Collaborators criteria, [ 28] and the covariates assessed in the models included age, sex, baseline stroke severity, target occlusion location, ASPECTS, pre -treatment IV alteplase, time to recanalization and the collateral score. Between March 2010 and May 2016, 125 of 347 (36%) patients treated with MT at Hospital Clínic of Barcelona met the entry criteria of the study. Contr arily, 222 patients were excluded for (1) a posterior circulation stroke (n = 31); (2) lost to follow -up due to transfer to a referral Primary Stroke Center after MT (n = 113); (3) unavailability of multimodal brain imaging (n = 37); or (4) mTICI 2a/1/0 sc ore at the end of MT (n = 41). Recanalization of the local occlusion occurred within a median (IQR) of 285 (210 –369) minutes of symptom onset; 51 (41%) patients achieved an mTICI 2b score and 74 (59%) patients a mTICI 3 score. Patients with final mTICI 2b or 3 scores did not show significant differences in demographics, risk factors, target occlusion location, use of bridging intravenous alteplase before MT, or size of infarct core calculated either with the ASPECTS on NCCT or on CTP (Table 1). Expectedly, a mTICI 3 score was associated with shorter time to recanalization from stroke onset, and less number of device passes. A final mTICI score 3 was more frequent in patients with good leptomeningeal collateral scores, and this association was highly signific ant in a multivariate model adjusted for the predefined covariates of the study, (odds ratio 2.765 95% CI 1.248 –6.123). The primary outcome measure of the study showed that more patients with mTICI 3 were in a better score category on the mRS at 90 days th an were patients with mTICI 2b, and this difference was statistically significant in ordinal regression analysis adjusted for confounders (odds ratio 2. 018, 95% CI 1.033 –3.945). Excellent outcome at 90 days was reported in 18 (35%) of 51 patients achieving an mTICI 2b score and in 41 (55%) of 74 patients achieving a n mTICI 3 score, (adjusted odds ratio 2.739, 95% CI 1.124 –6.182). Early dramatic recovery at 24 hours was diagnosed in 25 (49%) patients with mTICI 2b and in 54 (73%) patients with mTICI 3, (adjusted odds ratio 3.078, 95% CI 1.384 –6.849). Finally, the mortality and the rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage did not differ between patients with mTICI 3 or 2b scores."
18,page_18,"STUDY PROTOCOL CHOICE Version 3.0 November 28, 201 9 CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 of 54 Collectively, this study demonstrated the relevance of achieving a n mTICI 3 score at the end of MT to maximize the functional benefits of brain reperfusion. Compared with patients with a n mTICI 2b score, patients who achieved a mTICI 3 had better overall health transitions in the full range of the mRS, increased proportion s of excellent outcome and early dramatic recovery, less infarct growth and smaller final infarcts. Altogether, these results justify the search of more effective reperfusion therapies and call for a change of current practice recommendations in patients t reated with MT indicating that only an mTICI 3 angiographic score should be considered success after MT. 2.2 OBJECTIVES The study objective is to evaluate whether rt -PA is safe and efficient as an add -on to mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ische mic stroke and complete or near - complete recanalization of a proximal vessel occlusion and successful brain reperfusion on cerebral angio gram (corresponding to mTICI score 2b/3). 2.3 TRIAL DESIGN Multicenter , randomized , placebo -controlled, double blind , phase 2b trial of acute stroke patients treated with MT, in which two therapies are compared: rt-PA or placebo .

Concomitantly, a whole brain CT -Perfusion (CTP) or DWI -MRI will be performed before transfer of the patient to the angio suit e. The protocol for CTP acquisition will be harmonized by the Neuroimaging Core Lab as described in the Appendix . Patients will then receive MT according to the general methods described below. At 10 minutes of completion of the experimental therapy the angiographic results will be recorded on anterior -posterior and lateral projections for central scor ing according to the modified Treatment of Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) grading score (See below section 3.3 for further clarification ). At 24 +12 hours of randomization , a NCCT (or MRI) will be performed to assess the presence of early bleeding complications following ECASS 3 criteria (Appendix). At 48 +24 hours of randomization , a brain MRI with DWI and T2* sequences will be performed to measure the volume of the infarction, estimate the growth of the infarction and assess the presence of late bleeding complications (Appendix). If a brain MRI cannot be performed for contraindications, intole rance or unavailability, a NCCT will be indicated. The admission NCCT (or MRI) , admission CTP (or DWI -MRI) , post-MT angiography, 24h NCCT and 48h brain MRI or NCCT will be transferred to the Central Imaging Core Lab (CICL) for storage and reading w ithin 72 hours of image acquisition (Appendix). Other study visits and study assessments are specified in Appendix 6.5. 3.3 Interventions Patients with confirmed large vessel occlusion (LVO) of the anterior, middle or posterior cerebral artery and treated with MT will receive alteplase (Actylise®) or placebo if the mTICI score on cerebral angiography is 2b /3. Patients displaying an mTICI sco re 2b /3 on cerebral angiography before a first pass with an endovascular device could still be eligible for randomization into the study because we define the onset of mechanical thrombectomy as the time of groin puncture. Endovascular treatment will be ca rried out according to the usual practice of each center. Once the intracranial occlusion is confirmed, thrombectomy will be performed using any of"

The use of balloon catheter wil l be at the discretion of the interventionalist, as well as the thrombectomy system, which may be by aspiration, by means of stent -retriever devices or combination of both techniques. On the contrary, patients treated with devices under study will not be included in CHOICE. Likewise, the type of anesthesia will be decided by the t eam that performs the procedure, and none of the options, local anesthesia, sedation or general anesthesia, are grounds for exclusion. Once the thrombectomy procedure is finished, the cases that meet the inclusion criteria from the point of view of final r eperfusion, that is, those with a mTICI 2b /3 will be randomized. The maximum will be six passes or six aspirations for the patient to meet the criteria for inclusion in CHOICE. The thrombectomy procedure will be considered complete once the neurointerventi onalist considers that the angiographic result is good enough and it does not seem reasonable by endovascular thrombectomy techniques to continue the procedure to obtain a better revascularization. Aside from procedurally administered heparinized saline, I V heparin is prohibited until after the 24 hour neuro -imaging has been performed to minimize the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Blood pressure should be tightly controlled during the first 24 hrs to less than 185/110 mmHg. If TICI ≥2b is achieved , BP go al should be less than 160/90 mmHg. Given the association between hyperglycemia and SICH in patients undergoing IA thrombolysis , a target blood glucose level of less than 160 mg/dL is recommended. The neurointerventionalist will receive the medication to be injected according to protocol, proceeding to inject said medication through a distal access catheter or microcatheter located proximal to the residual thrombus (if still present) and distally to the origin of the lenticulostriated branches. The adminis tration of placebo / rTPa will be infused for 15 '. The superselective catheterization of the occluded branch (s) to perform the administration of the medication vs. the injection of said medication from more proximal positions will be at the decision of t he neurointerventionalist depending on the difficulty of access, risk of distal catheterization, patient agitation, occluded branches , etc. It should be recorded in the angiography images, that will be sent to the Core Lab, if the placebo / rTPa infusion has been performed from M1 or from any of the bifurcation branches ( an image of the position of the catheter from which the placebo / rTPa injection was made has to be sent ). It is recommended not to inject the medication / placebo immediately proximal to an occluded artery, without exit, because of the risk of directly accumulating a greater concentration of the drug there."

All ICH will be classified by a central core -lab using the ECASS 3 criteria. Symptomatic ICH will be defined as per the ECASS3 definition: deterioration in NIHSS score of ≥4 points within 24 hours from treatment and evidence of any apparently extravascular blood in the brain in the 2 4 hours follow -up imaging scans. The incidence of any asymptomatic hemorrhage measured at 24 hours will also be compared . 3.5.6 Adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 3.5.6.1 Definitions and Classification An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient temporarily associated with the use of the investigational drug, whether or not considered related to the investigational drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the drug, whether or not considered related to the drug. Any AE experienced by the study subject after enrolment (equal to the time of randomizatio n) must be recorded in the CRF. All AEs and SAEs will be monitored and collected from the time of enrolment (defined as time of randomization ) through 90 day follow -up visit. All SAEs and SUSAR must be reported to CRA or designee within 24 hours of becoming aware of their occurrence in order to comply with regulatory reporting requirements. In the event that the eCRF is unavailable a written form sent by e -mail or fax is acceptable (the required form will be filed in the ISF) Underlying (pre -existing) symptoms or diseases are not reported as Adverse Events (AEs) unless there is an increase in severity or frequency during the course of the investigation, but they need to be reported in the eCRF as Relevant Medical History. Death should not be rec orded as an adverse event, but should only be reflected as an outcome to another specific AE/SAE. A qualified medical investigator must review all information available to determine the seriousness , causality , severity and outcome of the AE as well as to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event, which requires immediate notification to the sponsor or its designated representative. All AEs and the treatment and follow -up required must be documented in the subject’s medical records and in the eCRF ."
26,page_26,"STUDY PROTOCOL CHOICE Version 3.0 November 28, 201 9 CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 of 54 A procedural complication may constitute an AE if it results in an untoward change from the subject’s baseline health. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that: a) Led to a death, injury or perman ent impairment to a body structure or a body function. b) Led to a serious deterioration in health of the subject, that either resulted in: - A life -threatening illness or injury, or - A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or - In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or - In medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness c) Led to foetal distress, foetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. Note: Planned hos pitalization for pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by the Clinical Investigation Plan, without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event. Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry, hematology, ur inalysis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g. ECG, vital signs) that are judged by the investigator as clinically significant will be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE as previously defined. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study will be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are associated with a disease reported in the medical history, unless judged by the investigator as more severe than expected for the subject’s condition, or that are present or detected at the start of the stud y and do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs or SAEs. 3.5.6.2 Recording of AEs and SAEs When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostic reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE into the CRF. It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to the sponsor in lieu of completion of the appropria te AE/SAE CRF pages and forms. For each adverse event, start and stop dates, action taken, outcome, intensity and relationship to study drug (causality) must be documented. If an AE changes in frequency or intensity during a study, a new entry of the event must be made in the CRF. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In the absence of a diagnosis, the individual"
27,page_27,"STUDY PROTOCOL CHOICE Version 3.0 November 28, 201 9 CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 of 54 signs/symptoms should be documented. All details of any treatments initiated due to the adverse event should be recorded in the subject’s notes and the CRF/form. 3.5.6.3 Prompt Reporting of SAEs SAEs require immediate action. Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred, he/she will immediately notify the clinical coordinator via telephone within one working day. The study SAE form must be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event, signed by the investigator (or appropriately qualified designee), and reported into the e CRF or to the study manager , within one working day of first becoming aware of the event. The equivalent SAE page should be filled in on the CRF. If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to receive additional information before reporting the event and completing the form. The form will be updated when additional information is received. The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report. In accordance with local IEC requirements, the investigator must also notify their Ethics Committee of any SAEs according the guidelines of the Ethics Committee. The investigator and others responsible for subject care should institute any supplementary investigations of SAEs base d on their clinical judgment of the likely causative factors. This may include seeking further opinion from a specialist in the field of the adverse event or requesting extra tests. If a subject dies, any post -mortem findings, including histopathology will be provided if available. No medical help, diagnosis, or advice should be withheld from the subject due to an inability to contact the study manager/medical monitor. When entered a SAE into the eCRF, an alert will be received by the designed persons (i.e.: monitor) 3.5.6.4 Evaluating AEs and SAEs 3.5.6.4.1 Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study. The assessment will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement. The intensity of each A E and SAE recorded in the CRF or SAE form should be assigned to one of the following categories: Mild Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated Moderate Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may warrant intervention"

Severity is a category utilis ed for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as “serious” when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as previously described in Section 3.5.7.1 Definitions and Classification . 3.5.6.4.2 Assessment of Causality The Principal Investigator or a medically -qualified designee must assess the relationship between investigational d rug and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the investigational d rug administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator wil l also consult the study drug information in the determination of his/her assessment. The causal relationship to the study drug assessed by the Investigator (or medically qualified delegate) should be assessed using the following classifications: Unrelated No temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified, and the event determined to be due to a concurrent illness or effect of another drug reaction and is not related to the study drug. Possibly related Temporal association, but other aetiologies are likely to be the cause; however, involvement of the study drug cannot be excluded based on available information Probably related Temporal association and there is no other reasonable medical explanation for the event based on available information 3.5.6.4.3 Assessment of Expectedness Expected adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is consistent with the applicable study drug information (e.g. Investigators’ Brochure) for an unapproved medicinal product). Unexpected adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with information in the study drug information."

All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact and are designated as on-going , will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes , until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up. Once resolved, the appropriate AE/SAE CRF page(s) will be updated. The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, or consultation with other health care professiona ls. New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE form, with all changes signed and dated by the investigator. 3.6 Statistical methods 3.6.1 General Remarks The statistical analysis will be carried out in accordance with the principles specified in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Topic E9 (CPMP / ICH / 363/96)45. A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)46 agreed upon by the sponsor and the Project Statistician will be available before the un -blinding of the data base. This SAP will follow the general regulatory recommendations given in the ICHE947 guidance, as well as other specific guidance on methodological and statistical issues48. Also, it will stick to the recommendations given by the consensus documents of the scientific journals49,50,51 to improve reliability and value of medical research literature by promoting transparent and accurate reporting of clinical research studies. The SAS System52 (Release 9.4, or an upgraded version), or equivalent validated statistical software, will be the statistical software used to analyze the data sets. A summary of the overall approach to statistical analysis is presented hereafter. 3.6.2 Sample size calculatio n A sample size of 100 patients per treatment arm in a 1:1 allocation will have at least 80% statistical power for the primary outcome (mRS with 0 -1 score values) assuming a rate of 40% in the control arm and a 21% benefit in the experimental arm (odds ratio (OR) of 2.33) for a 5% two -sided type I error. This sample size will also guarantee the study power for that relative treatment benefit even if the success rate in the control group rises up to ≈56%. No study losses are accounted for since all randomised patients will be included in the analysis."

Data will be examined for compliance with the trial protocol by the monitor and the data manager. Deviations will be sent to the project statistician to plan listings for the Data Blind Review (DBR). The objective is to carry out the population selection and definition of the final study populations as well as a preliminary assessment of the quality of the trial data. 3.6.4 Analysis populations There will the following analysis populations for this s tudy: 1) Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS): All patients who are randomized into the study and who have received the investigational med icinal product (IMP) will be included in the mFAS population. 2) Per Protocol Population: Per protocol (PP) patient sets wil l be defined as those patients included in the mFAS set without major protocol deviations that might impact the study’s main assessments. These deviations will be assessed during the data review prior to database lock. 3) The Safety population is defined as all randomized participants who received the investigational drug (any of the tree arm treatment). In this study the Safety population will have the same definition than the mFAS subset and thus, all safety analysis will be conducted on the mFAS population . The precise reasons for excluding participants from each population will be fully defined and documented independently of the randomization codes during the Data Blind Review and before the database lock. 3.6.5 Randomisation Procedure Randomisation codes were produced by means of the PROC PLAN of the SAS system, with a 1:1 ratio of assignment between both arms, stratifying by centre, and use of IV alteplase (no or yes) , in blocks multiple of 2 elements. The codes will released to the manufacturer site, which is independent from the study sponsor and be managed from the eCRF in a blinded manner."

The inferential analyses will be limited to the efficacy variables, and the adverse events. For adverse events the following criteria is predefined: bleeding events (major, minor, ov erall), organ - system according to the MedDRA codes, and the MedDRA preferred -terms with at least 10% overall prevalence or at least the 5 more prevalent preferred -terms. 3.6.6.1 Primary endpoint The proportion of patients with a mRS 0 to 1 at 90 days will be estimated using a log - binomial regression model including the stratification variables, except centre. In the unexpected event that the model does not fit, the Poisson regression model with long -link and robust variance estimator will be used instead53,54,55,56,57. 3.6.6.2 Secondary endpoints and safety outcomes Binary outcomes Binary efficacy and safety (mortality at 90 days and sICH rates at 24 hours) outcomes will be analysed as described for the primary endpoint. Shift outcomes The shift analysis of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) will be analyzed using the proportional odds model58, combining into single worst rank the last two categories (5: severe incapacity and 6: death) and the stratification variables except centre. The common odds ratio can also be interpreted as the average shift over the total ordinal outcome scale caused by the treatment under study59,60,61. The stratified non -parametric van Elteren test62, using modified ridit scores which is as a direct extension of the extension of the Wilcoxon's r ank-sum test for 2 -samples, will be calculated as a sensitivity analysis to compare the modified Rankin scale as an ordinal rather than a binary outcome, without assuming proportional odds63,64. The median of the absolute values the 95% confidence interval ( 95%CI) will calculated using the Hodges -Lehmann methods (i.e. median of all cross differences between treatments based on the Mann -Whitney distribution)65,66. Continuous outcomes Continuous variables will be analyzed using Mixed Models67, including in the model the baseline measurement, the stratification variables except centre, treatment as well as the interaction between treatment and time, declaring time as categorical. The variance -"

If this anal ysis fails to converge, the following structures will be tested in the following order until convergence: AR(1) (Auto - Regressive first order), Toeplitz and CS (Compound Symmetry). Contrasts between dialysis groups will be performed by time -point. The treat ment effect will be estimated through adjusted means –Least Square Means (LSMeans) – its standard error – Standard Error of Mean (SEM) - and its 95%CI. Differences between treatments will be estimated through the differences between LSMeans, SEM and 95%CI. 3.6.6.3 General strategy for the rest of variables The rest of variables will be analyzed according to the following strategy: the Fisher’s exact test to compare categorical variables, the dependent or independent t -test for continuous Gaussian -distributed variables and the Mann -Whitney for ordinal and non -Gaussian continuous data. The surviva l function for death as well as the median [95% confidence interval -95%CI -] will be estimated by means of the Kaplan -Meier method. Group comparisons will be conducted using the stratified the log -rank test and, hazard ratios -HR- (95%CI) were taken from t he Cox model68. 3.6.7 Multiplicity adjustments and interim analysis The analysis will follow the principles specified in the ICHE969 and the CPMP/EWP/908/9970 Points to Consider on Multiplicity issues in Clinical Trials guidelines. No interim analysis is planned for this study. For this reason, there is no statistical criterion for early termination of the trial. 3.6.8 Handling of missing data The handling of missing data will follow the principles specified in the ICH -E932 and the CPMP/EWP/1776/99 Rev1. Guideline on Missing Data in confirmatory trials Guidelines71. Missing data on the primary outcome or other binary efficacy secondary outcomes will be considered as failures, irrespectively to the reason for missingness. For mRS the worst case imputation will be used (i.e. imputing the worst category of the scale). With regards to the continuous variables, mixed models72,73,74 are robust to the presence of missing at random (MAR) and conducts the analysis with all participants despite the presence of missingness. Of note, this method calculates the estimations based on the variance - covariance structure but without any formal imputations. No formal imputations will be performed for the rest of variables and the analyses will be based on the Available Data Only (ADO) appro ach."

In case of any post -hoc subgroup analysis, they will be justified and identified as data -driven and, they will follow the principles and regulatory recommendations75. The following strategy will be conducted before splitting the analysis into subgroups: 1. Test of the overall treatment effect 2. Test of the treatment -by-subgroup interaction at the 10% level of significance 3. Test of the treatment effect in each subgroup category If the three criteria are met, then the subgroup analysis will be given the maximal level of evidence for this analysis. However, this subgroup analysis is predefined as exploratory and the interpretation should be taken with caution. If any of the criterion are not meet, the chances of type I error incr ease are higher and this will have an impact in the interpretation. 3.7 Study feasibility The sites participat ing in CHOICE performed in 2016 575 MT procedures that were registered in the Sistema Online d’Informació de l’Ictus Agut (SON IIA) Registry. For pooled data analysis of five RCT s of MT reported an average rate of 38% of mTICI2b score and an average rate of 50,3% of mTICI3 score at the end of MT. These figure s allow to estimate that the total potential annual accrual rate at the participating sites is sufficient to terminate the trial within the allotted recruitment duration of 24 months . 4. DATA MANAGEMENT / MONITORING AND QUALITY CONTROL 4.1 Data collection methods An electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF) will be completed for each study subject, summarizing all clinical screening and study data. Subjects will only be referred to in the eCRF by their subject number and initials in order to retain subject confidentiality."

TICI is graded by visually estimating ho w much of the initial antegrade capillary blush defect (or target downstream territory [TDT] is reperfused (numerator). The TICI scale distinguishes no perfusion (TICI grade 0; Figure 2 ), minimal flow past the occlusion but no perfusion (grade 1; Figure 3 ), minor partial reperfusion (grades 2a; Figures 4 and 5), major partial reperfusion (2b; Figure 2), and complete reperfusion without any flow defects (grade 3; Figures 3 and 4). The original TICI system defined TICI 2b as restoration of more than two thirds of the TDT. This is in contrast to the subsequent modification (modified treatment in cerebral ischemia [mTICI]) introduced by the IMS investigators, which uses a threshold of more than half of the TDT.85 The advantage of mTICI is its simplicity (ea se of visually estimating 1/2 versus 2/3 reperfusion), and previous work has demonstrated excellent inter -rater agreement for distinguishing <50% versus ≥50% reperfusion of the downstream territory.86 Fig 2 Top, Anteroposterior (first 2 boxes) and later al (last 2 boxes) in an early arterial and late capillary phases depicting TICI 0 at baseline.
