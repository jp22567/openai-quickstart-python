Investigator(s) : Multicenter study. Site(s) and Region(s): It is anticipated that the study will be conducted in at least 18countries. Regions will include North America Europe , the Middle East, and Africa ,Latin America, and Asia -Pacific. Approximately 175 sites will be utilized. Study period (planned): 2017 to2020Clinical phase: 3 Objectives: Prim ary: Toevaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing remission, based on composite score of patient -reported symptoms and centrally read endoscopy, in subjects w ith moderate to severe ulcerative colitis ( UC). Key Secondary : To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in achieving endoscopi c rem ission, based on centrally read endoscopy. To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in achieving clinical remission, based on composite score of patient -reported symptoms. To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing clinical response, base d on composite score of patient -reported symptoms and centrally read endoscopy. To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in achieving mucosal healing, based on endoscopic and histological assessment. Other Secondary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SHP647. To evaluate the effect of SHP647 induction treatment on other clinical outcomes. To evaluate the effect of SHP647 on abdominal pain, urgency, diarrhea, and absolute stool frequency and bleeding scores. To evaluate the effect of SHP647 on health -related quality of life. To evaluate the effect of SHP647 on incidence of hospitalizations and totalinpatient days. Rationale: This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing remission in subjects with moderate to severe UC. SHP647 has been investigated in 2 completed dose -finding studies (A7281001 and A7281009) in subjects w ith moderate to severe UC; a third study (A7281010), an open -label long -term safety extension study, is ongoing. The Phase 1 study, A7281001, w hich investigated the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of SHP647, supports furt her clinical development of SHP647 using subcutaneous ( SC)administration. Therefore, SC doses of 25 mg or 75 mg of SHP647 or placebo on Day 1 (Week 0), Week 4, and Week 8 are recommended for the Phase 3 studies SHP647 -301 and SHP647 -302. For non-commercial use only"
13,page_13,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 13 Protocol SHP647 -302 SHP647 06Jul2017 Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration: The test product is SHP647, which will be provided as a sterile aqueous buffered solution for SC administration in a glass prefilled syringe (PFS) w ith a fixed needle. Each PFS contains 1 mL of SHP647 solution at an appropriate concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 or 75 mg). Additional information is provided in the current SHP647 investigator’s brochure . The reference product is placebo, which will be provided in a PFS w ith a fixed needle contain ing 1 mL of placebo solution for SC administration .The placebo solution will contain the same sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain SHP647 . Methodology: A total of 825subjects (330 subjects at 25mg SHP647, 330subjects at 75mg SHP647, and 165placebo subjects) are planned for enrollment into the study. Subjects must be at least 16years of age and no more than 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent/assent form . The study consists of a screening period up to 6 w eeks and a 12 -week treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3treatments (25mg SHP647, 75mg SHP647, or placebo) in a 2:2:1 ratio. Random ization will be stratified based upon thesubject’s status of prior anti -TNF (tum or necrosis factor) treatment (naïve or experienced) and glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocorticoids at baseline versus not on glucocorticoids at baseline). Subjects will receive SC injections of SHP647 orplacebo , using a PFS, on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 4), and Week 8 (Visit 5). Subjects will undergo efficacy, safety, and health outcome assessments at these visits . Patient -reported UC signs and symptom data (includ ingstool frequency ,rectal bleeding severity and frequency, diarrhea frequency, urgency frequency, and abdom inal pain worst severity ) will becollected using a daily electronic diary (e-diary )during the treatment period. The Mayo score is a measure of UC disease activity consisting of the following 4subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of endoscopy , and physician global assessment (PGA). The partial Mayo score consists of the Mayo score without the endoscopic subscores. The com posite sco re is a recommended measure consisting of the Mayo score without the PGA subscore , and will be used for the prim ary efficacy endpoint. The Mayo scores and composite score will be based on subject daily e- diary entries . At the end of the 12 -week treatment p eriod, eligible subjects w ill be offered the opportunity to participate in a double- blind maintenance study (SHP647 -303; for subjects who achieve clinical response) or a long -term safety extension (LTS) study (SHP647 -304; for subjects w ho do not achieve a clinical response). Subjects who withdraw early from the 12 -week treatment period or who do not w ish to enter the maintenance study (SHP647 -303) or LTS study (SHP647 -304) will continue into a 16-week safety follow -up period .Only those subjects who complet e the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647 -301 or SHP647 -302) w ill be eligible to continue in the maintenance study or LTS study .

The completer set will consist of all subjects in the FAS who have completed the final scheduled prim ary assessment for this study. Prim ary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects in remission at the Week 12visit. Remission is defined as a composite score of patient -reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy as follows : stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 w ith at least a 1-point change from baseline AND rectal bleeding subscore of 0 AND endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability). The primary efficacy endpoint will be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75 mg SHP647) to the placebo group using a Cochran -Mantel Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test str atified by status of prior anti -TNF treatment and glucocorticoid use at baseline (Visit 2).

25,page_25,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 25 Protocol SHP647 -302 SHP647 06Jul2017 1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing disease marked b y ulceration and inflammation of the colonic mucosa and submucosa. Initially it usually involves the rectum but may extend proximally to involve a portion of, or the entiret y of, the colon. In the earl y stages, hemorrhagic and ery thematous tissue is observed, progressing to mucosal ulceration with purulent exudates in severe cases. The ulcera tion pattern is continuous and may extend the entire length of the colon. Perforation of the bowel wall causing ileus and peritonitis can occur with transmural extension of the ulceration. Blood y diarrhea with or without mucus and lower abdominal pain with periods of remission and exacerbation are the most common sy mptoms. The incidence of UC isestimated to be up to 24.3 cases per 100,000 persons per year in Europe and up to 19.2 cases per 100,000 persons per yearin North America . No clear difference in incidence has been observed between men and women. Although UC can occur at an y age, peak incidence has been observed in the second to fourth decades of life (Molodecky et al., 2012 ) . Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong condition with a serious effect on the quality of life. Current treatment primaril y consists of sy mptomatic management with dietary modifications and opiates (loperamide), as well a s disease modify ing agents such as 5 -aminosalicy lic acid (5 -ASA), systemic glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine/6 -mercaptopurine, cyclosporine), and biologic therapy with anti- tumor necrosis factor ( TNF )or anti -integrin agents. Despite recent advances, there is still an unmet need for an effective pharmacological treatment that will induce and maintain remission. 1.2 Product Background and Clinical Information The selectivit y of l ymphocy te homing to specialized ly mphoid tissue and mucosal si tes of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is influenced b y the endothelial expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM). MAdCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin super family of cell adhesion molecules and is mostly expressed on the cell surface of high endothelial venules of organized intestinal lymphoid tissue such as Peyer’s patches and mesenteric l ymph nodes (Briskin et al., 1997 ; Liaskou et al., 2011 ; Shyjan et al., 1996). MAdCAM play s a role in gut immune surveillance, and also appears to facilitate excessive ly mphocy te infiltration under conditions of chronic GI inflammation. The α4β7integrin is the recognized ligand for MAdCAM , and expression of this ligand on populations of CD4+and CD8+T cells, as well as on subsets of Bcells,distinguish esthem as unique gut homing ly mphocy tes. SHP647 (previously known as PF -00547659) is a fully human immunoglobulin G2 kappa (IgG 2k)monoclonal antibody that binds to human MAdCAM to reduce l ymphocy te homing to the gut and GI inflammation. SHP647 binds MAdCAM -1 with high affinity and selectivity that prevents the binding of α4β7+lymphocy tes to MAdCAM expressing sites in the high endot helial venules of the GI tract. Alway s refer to the latest version of the SHP647 investigator’s brochure for the overall risk/benefit assessment and the most accurate and current information reg arding the pharmacokinetics, efficacy ,and safet y of SHP647 .

STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 2.1 Rationale for the Study SHP647, a fully human IgG 2k antihuman MAdCAM monoclonal antibody , is under development for the treatment of UC. SHP647 prevents the binding of α4β7+lymphocy tes to MAdCAM -expressing sites with high affinity and selectivity . Principal sites of MAdCAM expression on normal tissue include intestine, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, spleen, and to a lesser extent lung, liver, and bladder but not the cent ral nervous s ystem (CNS) (Steffen et al., 1996). Although selective targeting of the MAdCAM receptors is a novel approach, the basic interferenc e of l ymphocyte homing by preventing the binding of these α 4β7+lymphocy tes to the MAdCAM receptor and the resultant efficacy in UC is well established (Feagan et al., 2013 ). SHP647 is differentiated from other molecules used for the treatment of UC in that it blocks the interaction of α4β7+lymphocy tes to the MAdCAM receptor by selectivel y binding to MAdCAM in the gut (and related tissues) whereas other molecules only target the integrins on the infiltrat inglymphocy tes. Additionally , SHP647 does not bind to the vascular cell adhesion molecule ;therefore, SHP647 is not expected to be an effective treatment formultiple sclerosis, or affect l ymphocy te homing or surveillance in the CNS. This study is designe d to evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing remission in subjects with moderate to severe UC . SHP647 has been investigated in 2 completed dose-finding studies (A7281001 and A7281009) in subjects with moderate to severe UC; a third study (A7281010), an open -label long -term safet y extension study , is ongoing. Phase 1 study A7281001 evaluated both single (0.03- 10.0 mg/kg intravenous [ IV]; 3.0 mg/kg subcutaneous [ SC]) and multiple doses (0.1 -3.0 mg/kg IV; 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg SC) of SHP647 in subjects with UC . Safety evaluation revealed a safet y profile for SHP647 similar to that of placebo, with no pattern of adverse events (AEs) suggestive of increased risk of opportunistic infections or CNS effects, and no evidence of adverse effects on laboratory parameter s, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital si gns, or neurological function. Events leading to withdrawal were due to exacerbations of the underl ying UC. Study A7281009 was a Phase 2b proof - of-concept (randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled, parallel, dose -ranging) stud y designed to evaluate the efficacy, safet y, and pharmacokinetics of SHP647 in subjects with moderate to severe UC. Treatment was assigned in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to dose levels of 7.5, 22.5, 75, or 225 mg SHP647 or placebo administered SC once every 4 weeks (Q4W at Weeks 0, 4, and 8) . The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of subjects in clinical remission at We ek 12, with remission defined as a total May o score of ≤2 with no individual subscore >1 (seeAppendix 2 for details of the May o score ).More subjects wer e in clinical remission at Week 12 in SHP647- treated groups than in the placebo group, with statistical significance ach ieved for the 7.5, 22.5, and 75 -mg doses (Vermeire et al., 2017 ). Based upon the total May o score with a centrally read endoscopic severit y component, the increase in clinical remission rates over placebo at Week 12 for the 7.5, 22.5 , and 75- mg doses were 8.0% (p=.043), 12.8% (p=.010), and 11.8% (p= .012).

There was no evidence of an adverse safet y signal, and there was no increase in the frequency of infections in MAdCAM -bearing tissues as evidenced b y similar rates of nasophary ngitis among treatment arms. Based on the ef ficacy and safet y data in Study A7281009 and the s ystemic population pharmacokinetic ( PK)and pharmacod ynamic ( PD)modeling and simulation, clinical remission, clinical response and mucosal healing rates were higher in subject s with UC receiving doses of 22.5 and 75 mg Q4W than in those receiving doses of 7.5 mg and 225 mg Q4W. The induction responses were not demonstrated either at Week 4 or Week 8, but were observed at Week 12 regardless of dose level. Nodifference in the clinical responses between a 22.5- mg dose and a 25-mg dose is expected based on the current understanding of the mode of action of SHP647 and clinical observations to date. To better understand the exposure (dose) - response relationship in this population and understand individual patient exposure needs, the 25- mg and 75 -mg doses (Q4W) will be tested in the Phase 3 program. Therefore, SC doses of 25 mg or 75 mg of SHP647 or placebo on Day 1 (Week 0), Week 4, and Week 8 are recommended for the 2planned Phase 3 studies SHP647 -301 and SHP647 -302.

STUDY DES IGN 3.1 Study Design and Flow Chart This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of SHP647 in inducing remission in subjects with moderate to severe UC . A total of 825 subjec ts (330 subjects at 25 mg SHP647, 330 subjects at 75 mg SHP647, and 165placebo subjects) are planned for enrollment into the study (Figure 1). Subjects must be at least 16 years of age and no more than 80 y ears of age at the time of signing the informed consent/assent form. The study consists of a screening period up to 6 weeks and a 12 -week treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects will be rand omly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments ( 25mg SHP647, 75 mg SHP647, or placebo ) in a 2:2:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified based upon the subject’s status of prior anti -tumor necrosis factor ( TNF )treatment (naïve or experienced) and glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocorticoid s at baseline versus not on glucocorticoid s at basel ine). Subjects will receive SCinjections of SHP647 or placebo , using a prefilled s yringe (PFS) ,on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 4), and Week 8 (Visit 5) . Subjects will undergo efficacy , , , safety , and health outcome assessments at the se visits as detailed in Table 1. At the end of the 12-week treatment period , eligible subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in adouble -blind maintenance study (SHP647 -303; for subjects who achieve clinical response ) or along-term safet y extension (LTS) study (SHP647- 304; for subjects who do not achieve a clinical response ) as shown in Figure 1. Subjects who withdraw earl y from the 12-week treatment period or who do not wish to enter the maintenance study (SHP647- 303) or LTS study (SHP64 7-304) will continue into a 16-week safet y follow -up period .Only those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647 -301 or SHP647 -302) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance stud y or LTS stud y.

Over the past decade, health authority thinking regarding efficacy endpoints for UC has evolved such that the traditional Mayo score is no longer recommended. Current regulatory guidance (FDA Ulcerative Colitis: Clinical Trial Endpoints Guidance for Industry [Draft], 2016; EMA Guideli ne on the Development of New Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis [Draft], 2016 )includes a dual measurement of patient -reported signs and s ymptoms outcomes (stool frequency and rectal bleeding), and clinician- reported endoscopic outc omes (scoring an y endoscop y with evidence of friabilit y as a 2), including histology .Per agreement with health authorities, these 3 outcomes will be reported as a composite score. Data will be collected to calculate the total May o score using both the tra ditional and modified endoscop y subscore as a sensitivity anal ysis and to estimate the impact of the modification on the primary endpoint. The clinical relevance of the traditional May o score is supported by its correlation with significant improvement in disease -specific HRQL as measured by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and in generic HRQL as measured by the Short Form -36 (SF -36) questionnaire . 3.1.2 Rationale for Key Secondary Endpoint s The first 2 key secondary endpoints are included to c omply with EMA advice. European Medicines Agency would agree to the composite primary endpoint only if supported by a key secondary anal ysis, where the patient -reported s ymptoms and clinician -reported endoscop y are analyzed as “co -primary ”.Placebo 25 mg SHP647 75 mg SHP647Screening: Up to 6weeksRandomization Maintenance study (SHP647 -303) or LTS study (SHP647 -304) W0 W4 W8 Dosing: @ Treatment period : 12weeks16-week safety follow -up periodaWeek12/End of Treatment For non-commercial use only"

This endpoint has not been previously tested. Mucosal healing as akey secondary endpoint comprises both endoscopic and histologic components as recommended in the draft FDA and EMA guidance on UC ( FDA Ulcerative Colitis: Clinical Trial Endpoint s Guidance for Industry [Draft] , 2016; EMA Guideline on the Development of New Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis [Draf t], 2016). The Geboes Score ( see Appendix 2 ) will be used to evaluate histologic remission and to complement the endoscopic subscore in the assessment of mucosal healing. 3.2 Duration and Study Completion Definition Each subject’s final visit in this study may be at the end of the treatment period (Week 12) if continuing to Study SHP647- 303 or SHP647 -304, or at the end of the safety follow -up period (Week 28) if not continuing to either of these studies. In either case, the final visit will be in person at the site. A subject’s maximum duration of participation is expected to be approximately 34 weeks: a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a treatment period of 12 weeks, and a safet y follow -up period of 16 weeks (if applicable). It is expected that t he study will be completed in approximately 3years. The Study Completion Date is defined as the date the final subject, across all sites, completes their final protocol -defined assessment . Please note that this includes the follow -up visit or contact, whichever is lat er. The Study Completion Date is used to ascertain timing for study results posting and reporting. 3.3 Sites and Regions It is anticipated that the study will be conducted in at least 18countries.

Subjects should inform the investigator of an y changes to their smoking habits dur ing the stud y;however, these data will not be captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF ). Use of nicotine patches should be recorded as concomitant medication (see Section 5.2). For the purposes of this protocol, dietary supplements (such as vitam ins, minerals, purified food substances, and herbals with pharmaceutical properties) are considered to be concomitant medications ( see Section 5.2). 4.4 Reproductive Potential The potential effects of SHP647 on embry ofetal or postnatal development have not y etbeen assessed in animals or humans; these will be assessed in future studies. To minimize the risk of unintentional exposure of the embry o or fetus in the clinical study , all sexually active male and female subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator ,are biologically capable of having children and with their partners are at risk of pregnancy , must agree to use an acceptable form of contraception , in accordance with the package instructions/leaflet, for the duration of the active treatment period and for at least 16 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. True abstinence is considered to be a highl y effective contraception (ie, a method that results in a failure rate of <1% per year) when it is in line with the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to investigational product, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. During th e screening visit, the investigator or designee in consultation with the subject will confirm the subject’s childbearing potential status. For subjects of childbearing potential, it must be confirmed and documented that the subject has selected the most ap propriate method of contraception from the permitted list of contraception methods. Subjects must affirm the consistent and correct use of at least 1of the selected methods. Regular contraception check discussion swill take place at the time points specified in Table 1(ie, ateach site visit) and will be documented. In addition , the subject must be instructed to call the site immediately ifthe selected contraception method is discontinued or if p regnancy is known or suspected. For non-commercial use only"

Each PFS contains 1mLof SHP647 solution at an appropriate concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 or 75 mg). Additional information is provided in the current SHP647 investigator’ s brochure. The reference product is placebo ,which will be provided in a PFS with a fixed needle containing 1mLof placebo solution for SC administration .The placebo solution will contain the same sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain SHP647. 6.1.1 Blinding the Treatment Assignment The placebo s yringes and solution will match the SHP647 sy ringes in appearance. The fill volume for all sy ringes will be the same. 6.2 Administ ration of Investigational Product 6.2.1 Interactive Response Technology for Investigational Product Management An interactive response technology (IRT)system will be used for screening and enrolling subjects, recording subject visits, randomization, investigati onal product supply dispensation and management, inventory management and suppl y ordering, investigational product expiration tracking and management, and emergency unblinding . Please refer to the Study Manual for additional details regarding the IRT s ystem . 6.2.2 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment This is a double -blind, placebo- controlled stud y. The actual treatment given to individual subjects is determined by a randomization schedule. The total Mayo score will be calculated at baseline (Vi sit 2) before rando mization. Endoscopic subscore based on the central reader’s assessment will be used to determine eligibility . Subjects with a total May o score of ≥6, including a centrally read endoscopic subscore ≥2, rectal bleeding subscore ≥1, and stool frequency subsco re ≥1, and who fulfill all other eligibility criteria , will be randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 via a computer -generated randomization schedule to receive SC injection sof 25 mg SHP647, 75 mg SHP647, or placebo , respectivel y. The randomization will be perfor med centrall y and str atified by status of prior anti -TNF therap y (2 strata: naïve versus experienced) and glucocorticoid use at baseline (2 strata: on glucocorticoid s at baselin e versus not on glucocorticoid s at baseline). To ensure that the allocation of subjects with prior anti- TNF therap y exposure is similar to that observed in Study A7281009, the percentage of subjects with prior anti -TNF therap y exposure will be capped at 60% of the sample population. There will be no cap on the number of anti -TNF naïve subjects randomized. For non-commercial use only"
45,page_45,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 45 Protocol SHP647 -302 SHP647 06Jul2017 Subject numbers are assigned to all eligible subjects as they consent to take part in the study . Within each site (numbered uniquely within a protocol), the subject number will be assigned to subjects according to the sequence of pre sentation for study participation. The randomization number represents a unique number corresponding to investigational product allocated to the subject, once eligibility has been determined. Individual subject treatment will be automatically assigned by the IRT s ystem. Investigational product packaging identification numbers, separate from randomization numbers/unique identifiers, may also be assigned to subjects for specific treatment assignment as dictated b y the study . In these cases, the same investiga tional product packing identification number may not be assigned to more than 1 subject. 6.2.3 Dosing Investigational product ( SHP647 or placebo) will be adm inistered subcutaneously by qualified site personnel Q4W (Weeks 0, 4, and 8) . SeeSection 7.2for the tim ing of dosing relative to other procedures. Investigational product should be administered in the anterolateral right or left thighs. If there are clinical reasons wh y the drug cannot be administered in the leg, the drug may be administered in the deltoid area or abdomen with appropriate documentation. The location of the investigational produ c tadministration will be recorded . After the first administration of investigational product, the subject must be observed by a member of the stud y staff for at least 30 minutes (the total duration should be determined at the discretion of the investigator). For subsequent administrations, observation of the subject is at the discretion of the investigator. Injection site and allergic reaction monitoring should be comp leted bya member of the study staff . Investigator -directed delay s in dosing due to abnormal laboratory findings or AEs should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the subject should continue with the treatment .Only those subjects wh o complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647 -301 or SHP647 -302) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance stud y or LT S study . The investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will e nsure that all investigational product is dispensed by qualified staff members. 6.2.4 Unblinding the Treatment Assignment Whenever possible , the investigator or subinvestigator should contact the Shire phy sician and/or assigned medical monitor before breaking th e blind.

STUDY PROCEDURES 7.1 Study Schedule The investigator may schedule visits ( unscheduled visits) in addition to those listed on the schedule of activities (Table 1) inorder to conduct evaluations or assessmen ts required to protect the we ll being of the subject. 7.1.1 Screening Period 7.1.1.1 Screening Visit (Visit 1) Subjects will be screened within 6 weeks before the baseline visit (Visit 2) to determine eligibility to participate in the study and to perform the other assessments and procedures specifi ed in Table 1. Each subject or subject’s parent or legally authorized representative must participate in the informed consent process and provide written informed consent /assent before any assessments or procedures specified in the protocol are performed. Screening assessments may take place over more than 1 day (at least 2 visits will be necessary to complete the screening procedures ,including endoscopy ). A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent or assent, as applicable (and whose parents or legally authorized representatives have given informed consent , as applicable), failed to meet the inclusion criteria and/or met at least 1 of the exclusion criteria, and has not been randomized or administered investigationa l product . A subject may be re screened if their condition has changed and they may potentially be eligible. Subjects may be rescreened 1 time. NOTE: S creening laboratory tests, if considered by the investigator to be transient and inconsistent with the subject’s clinical conditio n, may be repeated once during the screening period for confirmation . Results of repeated tests must be reviewed for eligibility prior to the screening endoscop y procedure . Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (if preferred) must be performed on all subje cts after the majority of other eligibility criteria (eg, laboratory values) are met. Endoscopy must be performed during the screening period within 10 day s before baseline (Visit 2), preferabl y within 5to7days before the baseline visit , to obtain the c entrally read endoscopic subscore (see Section 7.2.2.1). Biops y samples will be collected for histological evaluation using the Geboes Score classification. Subjects at risk of colorectal cancer, as defined in exclusion criterion 5 ( see Section 4.2), must have a colonoscop y performed at screening. If a subject has had the following procedures performed as a part of standard medical care within 12weeks before screening (Visit 1), these procedures do not need to be repeated as a part of screening: Chest x -ray D ocumented negative PPD test or IGRA for TB For non-commercial use only"

The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1will be performed. After e ligibility has been reconfirmed and all base line procedures and assessments have been completed , each subject will be randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment groups as described in Section 6.2.2 and the first dose of investigational product will be administered. Results of the baseline laboratory tests a re not required for investigational product administration but must be reviewed as soon as possible thereafter. 7.1.2 Treatment Period 7.1.2.1 Visit 3 (Week 2) Visit 3 is scheduled to take place on Day 14 ±3 days (Week 2 ).

Part1 of Visit 6 should be sch eduled preferabl y within 5 to 7 days before P art2; this will allow sufficient time for data from the centrall y read endoscopy to be available at P art2 of the visit . The Week 12/ET assessments and procedures that will take place during Part 1 are specified in Table 1. Part 2 of Visit 6 will take place on Day 84 ±3 days. The Week 12/ET assessments and procedures tha t will take place during Part 2 are specified in Table 1. At Part 2 of Visit 6 , after review of the May o score, health outcome assessments, and safet y assessments, it will be determined whether the subject should enter the safety follow -up period of this s tudy or enroll in the maintenance (SHP647 -303) or LTS (SHP647 -304) studies . Entry into the maintenance or LTS studies is dependent upon the subject’s response and whether the subject agrees to participate. The Week 12 assessments and procedures will also f orm the ET assessments for an y subjects who are withdrawn earl y or discontinued from the study . 7.1.3 Follow -up Period : Visits 7 and 8 (Weeks 20 and 28) Subjects who are withdrawn earl y from the study , or who do not enter either the maintenance or LTS studies, should enter the safet y follow -up phase for safet y monitoring.

During the safety follow -up period, the Week 20 visit (Visit 7) will take place on Day 140 ±7days.This visit will routinely be conducted b y telephone; however, as an exception the visit can be performed as a study site visit if preferred. At the end of the safet y follow -upperiod, there will be a visit at the sit e on Day 196 ±7 days, which will form the Week 28visit (Visit 8). The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1 will be performed , including query ingfor SAEs, AEs, and concomitant medications and procedures . All AEs and SAEs that are not resolved a t the time of this visit will be followed to closure (see Section 8.1). Subjects who are proceeding to the maintenance or LTS studies will not enter the safety follow - up period. 7.1.4 Additional Care of Subjects after the Study No after care is planned for this s tudy. 7.2 Study Evaluations and Procedures Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside the control of th e investigator, which may make it unfeasible to perform the tests and procedures. In these cases, the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safet y and well -being of the subject. When timing of procedures and assessments coincide, the fol lowing order should be followed: Health outcome and patient - reported questionnaires Vital signs and ECG Blood sample collection Investigational product administration Endoscopy (generall y performed at a separate visit; see Section 7.2.2.1). 7.2.1 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics Demographic characteristics will be recorded at the screening visit (Visit 1) . Each subject’s stool frequency before s ymptoms of UC started or during remission will be recorded at the screening visit.

52,page_52,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 52 Protocol SHP647 -302 SHP647 06Jul2017 7.2.2 Efficacy The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects in remission at the Week 12 visit. Remission is defined as a composite score of pat ient-reported s ymptoms using dail y electronic diary (e-diary ) and centrally read endoscop y as described in Section 9.8.1. 7.2.2.1 Endoscopy and Histology Endoscopy will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1and will consist of either flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (if preferred). If it is necessary , bowel preparation should be conducted as per local routine. The position of the endoscope will be based on the length of the instrument at various levels of insertion as well as the morphological features of the intestine as seen during endoscopy at baseline. The endoscopy report and an y photographs and/or video recordings taken during the procedure per local custom should be filed in the subject’s medical record . During endoscop y, 2biopsy samples will be collected from the most inflamed ar ea of the sigmoid colon at Week 12/ET. Endoscopy and biopsy procedures will be defined in an endoscop y instructions manual and/or reference card(s), on which all sites will be trained. Endoscopy results will be reviewed by a central re ader. Biopsy samples will be centrally reviewed using the Geboes Score classification sy stem ( see Appendix 2 ) for the evaluation of histological disease severit y in UC with higher numbers corresponding to more inflammation. 7.2.2.2 Mayo Score The Mayo score is a m easure of UC disease activity . May o scores (total or partial) will be recorded at the time points specified in Table 1. The total May o s core ranges from 0 to 12 points andconsists of the following 4 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores in dicating more severe disease (see Appendix 2 ): Stool frequency (0-3) Rectal bleeding (0 -3) Findings of endoscop y (0-3) Physician global assessment (PGA , 0-3). The partial May o score consists of the May o score without the endoscopic subscores and ranges from 0 to 9 points. The composite score is a recommended measure consisting of the May o score without the PGA subscore and ranges from 0 to 9 points. The composite score will be used for the primary efficacy endpoint.

53,page_53,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 53 Protocol SHP647 -302 SHP647 06Jul2017 Calculation of the total and partial Mayoscore sand composite score requires a self -assessment by the subject for stool frequency and the amount of blood in the stool. These data on stool frequency and rectal bleeding will be captured in the PRO -UC daily e-diary (see Section 7.2.2.3). The May o stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores will be calculated based on each subject ’s daily e-diary data recorded over the most recent 3 days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) prior to the visit excluding the following day s: day of any bowel prep aration , day of endoscopy , any days between day of bowel preparation and day of endoscopy , and the 2 days after the day of endoscop y. The mucosal appearance during the sigmoidoscopic portion of the endoscopic examination will be assessed for the May o endoscopic subs core based on the scoring s ystem provided in the protocol ( see Appendix 2 ). The endoscopic appearance will be read b y both the study site investigator and a central reader through video recorded during the procedure. Centrall yread endoscopic subscores wil l be used for both eligibility and efficacy analy ses. The PGA acknowledges the 3 other criteria: the subject ’s recollection of abdominal discomfort and general sense of wellbeing and other observations (such as phy sical findings and the subject’s performan ce status). The endoscopic subscore and the PGA must be performed b y a physician qualified to perform endoscop y, and it is recommended that the same phy sician performs all such assessments for a particular subject throughout the stud y. 7.2.2.3 Patient -reported Out come – Ulcerative Colitis E- Diary Patient- reported UC signs and sy mptom data will be collected using a daily e -diary during the treatment period. Collection of the daily e-diary data must begin at least 10 days before the baseline visit (Visit 2).

It is important to note that assessments based on neurological evaluations are collected and evaluated in a different manner than observed or volunteered AEs. Given these differences, no attempt will be made to reconcile any apparent discrepancies between observed or volunteered AEs and data from neurological assessment collected from subjects. In vestigators may determine if any finding on neurological testing constitutes an AE. Adverse event incidence rates will not be calculated from these neurological evaluation data but rather from the AE information recorded b y the investigator. 7.2.3.4 Adverse Event Collection At each stud y visit, subjects will be questioned in a general way to ascertain if AEs have occurred since the previous visit ( eg,“Have you had an y health problems since your last visit?”) .

Additional collection times or changes to collection times will be permitted, as necessary to ensure appropriate collection of safet y data. Vit al signs include blood pressure, pulse , respiratory rate, and temperature . Vital signs should be recorded before laboratory blood collection and endoscopic procedures are performed . Single measurements of sitting blood pressure will be recorded at each time point. Blood pressure should be determined by cuff with the subject’s arm supported at the level of the heart and recorde d to the nearest mm Hg using the same method, the same arm (preferabl y the dominant arm), and the same position throughout the study . Respiratory rate will be measured with the subject in a comfortable position.

Results of the virology screen will be reviewed and verified b y the study moni tor, but will not be collected in the CRF database. Stool microbiology will be performed at the screening visit (Visit 1) . The detection of Clostridium difficile by toxigenic stool culture (stool culture followed by detection of toxin) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of the colonization or infection with pathogenic C.difficile . Comparable sensitivity may be achieved by direct testing of stool via point -of-use rapid membrane enzy me immunoassay card for both C. difficile toxin A and B and glutamate dehy drogenase antigen on a card. Use of the card for point -of-care screening is encouraged where permitted b y local regulation ; any samples showing a positive result with this method should be sent for toxigenic stool culture . Molecular techniques such as PCR for detection of toxin RNA are also acceptable alternatives. Refer to the laboratory manual for further guidance and instruction for C. difficile screening. A tuberculosis ( TB)test(purified protein derivative [ PPD]or QuantiFERON TB Gold) will be performed at the screening visit (Visit 1) . A documented negative PPD test within 12 weeks before baseline (V isit2)is acceptable. The IGRA official reading and method or test must be located in the source documentation.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire The IBDQ is a ps ychometrically validated PRO instrument for measuring the dise ase-specific HRQL in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease, including UC. The IBDQ consists of 32 items, which are grouped into 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, sy stemic symptoms , and social function ( Irvine et al., 1994 ). The 4 domains are scored as follows: Bowel s ymptoms: 10 to 70 Systemic s ymptoms: 5 to 35 Emotional function: 12 to 84 Social function: 5 to 35. The total IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 224. For the total score and each domain, a higher score indicates better HRQL . A score of at least 170 corresponds to clinical remission and an increase of at least 16 points is considered to indicate a clinically meaningful improvement. The IBDQ is presented in Appendix 2 .

ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS ASSES SMENT 8.1 Definition of Adverse Events, Period of Observation, Recording of Adverse Events An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE can therefore be an y unfavorab le and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH Guidance E2A 1995) . All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent and/or assent is signed until the end of the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.3. This includes events occurring during the screening phase of the study , regardless of whether or not inve stigational product is administered . Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of sy mptoms should be recorded . If a diagnosis has not been made, then each s ymptom should be listed individually . All AEs should be captured in the subject’s source docume nt . In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be captured in the subject’s source document . All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained . When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented. 8.1.1 Severity Categorization The severit y of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event i ncluding the start and stop dates for each change in severit y . An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new event . Worsening of pre treatment events, after initiation of investigational product, must be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dy spepsia before dosing of investigational product, but the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of severe dy spepsia [with the appropr iate date of onset] is recorded in the subject’s source document ). The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions: Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic inter vention . The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention . The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. For non-commercial use only"
64,page_64,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 Protocol SHP647 -302 SHP647 06Jul2017 Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantl y affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 8.1.2 Relationship Cat egorization A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for each AE . The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been cau sed b y the investigational product . If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related .”Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause -and- effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related .”The causality assessment must be documented in the source document. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition RelatedThe temporal relationship betw een the event and the administration of the investigational product is compelling and/or follow s a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident. Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying medical condition, concom itant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationshi p exists between the investigational product and the event. 8.1.3 Outcome Categorization The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the stud y in the eCRF . Outcomes are as follows: Fatal Not recovered/Not Resolved Recovered/Resolved Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae Recovering/Resolving Unknown . 8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease Under Study Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed as AEs as long as they are within the normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and a re part of the efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be recorded as an AE.

65,page_65,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 65 Protocol SHP647 -302 SHP647 06Jul2017 8.1.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations A change in the value of a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG asses sment can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during treatment with the investigational product, a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of an alread y abnormal value . When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, must be taken into consideration. If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG values which were not present at the pretreatment value observed closest t o the start of study treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible explanation ( eg,concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values. The investigator should decide, ba sed on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinicall y significant and therefore represents an AE. 8.1.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.3. Any report of pregnancy for any female study participant or the partner of a male study participant must be reported within 24 hours to Shire Global Pharmacovigilance using the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form. A copy of the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form (and any applicable follow - up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire m edical m onitor using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol .The pregnant female study participant must be withdrawn from the study . Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition of the in fant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar day s postpartum. Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congeni tal abnormality are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Non -serious AEs Required by the Protocol Form . Note : An elective abortion is not considered an SAE. In addition to the above, if the investiga tor determines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Non-serious AEs Required by the Protocol Form as well as the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregna ncy Report Form .

For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below. Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigation al product are not considered reportable as medication errors. Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation. The administration and/or use of the unassigned treatment is/are alway s reportable as a medication error.

Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization . Note: Hospitalizations, which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery for pre- existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be classified as SAEs . For example, an admission f or a previousl y scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an elective or previousl y scheduled surgery that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s). Results i n persistent or significant disability /incapacity . Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect . Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SA E when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requirin g intensive treatment in an ED or at home; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse . 8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame All SAEs (regardless of relationshi p to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.3 and must be reported to Shire Global Pharmacovigilance andthe CRO/Shire medical m onitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event.

The resolution date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms resolve, or the date the event is considered chronic. In the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectivel y. In addition, any signs or sy mptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed consent form, or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution date of the SAE, must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate. 8.2.6 Fatal Outcome Any SAE that results in the subject’s death ( ie,the SAE was noted as the primary cause of death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date . For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered no t resolved, without a resolution date recorded. For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless another investigational product action was previously taken ( eg,drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the a ction taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The investigational product action of “ withdrawn ” should not be selected solel y as a result of the subject’s death. 8.2.7 Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee, and Site Reporting Thesponsor or the CRO is responsible for notify ing the relevant regulatory authorities, US central Institutional Review Boards (I RBs), and European Union (EU) central Ethics Committees (ECs) of related, unexpected SAEs. In addition the CRO is responsible for notify ing active sites of all related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the SHP647 program .

DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS 9.1 Data Collection The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the inform ation required by the protocol in the e CRF . A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy . Discrepancies betwee n source data and da ta entered i n the e CRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel . When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by authorized site personnel . Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit and/or at the investigator’s meeting . Once a subject is randomized, it is expected that site personnel will complete the e CRF entry within approximately 3 business day s of the subject’s visit. 9.2 Clinical Data Management Data are to be entered into a cli nical database as specified in the CRO’s data manag ement plan . Quality control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values re quiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures . Data queries requiring clarification are to be communicated to the site for resolution . Only authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections ar e documented in an auditable manner. 9.3 Data Handling Considerations Data that may potentiall y unblind the treatment assignment ( ie,investigational product serum concentrations, antibodies to investigational product, treatment allocation, and investigational product preparation/accountability data) will be handled with special care during the data cleaning and review process. These data will be handled in such a way that, before unblinding, any data that may unblind study team personnel will be presented as b linded information or otherwise will not be made available . If applicable, unblinded data may be made available to quality assurance representatives for the purposes of conducting independent drug audits. 9.4 Statistical Analysis Process The study will be ana lyzed by the sponsor or its agent . The statistical anal ysis plan ( SAP)will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and safet y data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other study informa tion such as subject disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications . The SAP will also include a description of how missing, unused and spurious data will be addressed. The SA P will be finalized before unblinding to preserve the integrity of the statistical analy sis and study conclusions. For non-commercial use only"
70,page_70,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 70 Protocol SHP647 -302 SHP647 06Jul2017 All statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS®Version 9.3 or higher (SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC, USA). Unless otherwise specified, summa ry tabulations will be presented by treatment group. All data listings will be sorted by treatment group, site, and subject number, and will include the subject’s age, sex, and race. For categorical variables, the number and percentage of subjects within e ach category (with a category for missing data as needed) of the parameter will be presented. For continuous variables, the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum values will be presented. 9.5 Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Design, and Data Monitoring Committee There is no planned interim analy sis or adaptive design in this study . An external DMC will be established to review the overall safety of the study subjects on an ongoing basis . The DMC will be responsible fo r the ongoing monitoring of safet y of subjects enrolled in the study according to the DMC charter. Recommendations made by the DMC to alter the conduct of the study or to amend the protocol will be forwarded to Shire for review and for a final decision. Shire or its designee will notify investigative sites and regulatory authorities as appro priate, of DMC recommendations ( which may include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints). Further details regardin g the DMC can be found in the DMC charter, which will be available before the administration of investigational product to any subject .Anal yses of the data for DMC review will be conducted according to the DMC charter and DMC SAP. Because no formal hypothesis testing for safety assessments is planned, multiplicity concerns regarding repeated analyses are not applicable . 9.6 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations Graphical methods are used to control the global family -wise t ype I error rate (FWER) at the .05level (2-sided) for the comparisons of the 2 SHP647 treatment groups with the placebo group. Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise treatment compari sons for the primary endpoint. Therefore, the power analysis and sample size estimation was calculated based on the chi -square test of proportions using nQuery Advisor Version 7.0 for an individual SHP647 dose compared with placebo. Assuming a .025 (2 -sided) significance level for each pairwise treatment co mparison, approximately 1375 subjects will be screened to randomize 825 subjects (2:2:1 allocation ratio: 330subjects in the 25mgSHP647 treatment group , 330 subjects in the 75mgSHP647 treatment group , and 165 subjects in the placebo group) which would yield an approximately 93% power to detect individual pairwise treatment difference in the primary efficacy endpoint, remission at Week 12, of 11% (5% placebo versus 16% SHP647).

Remission is de fined as a composite score of patient -reported s ymptoms usi ng dail y e-diary and centrall yread endoscopy as follows: stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change from baseline AND rectal bleeding subscore of 0 AND endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability ) The primary effica cy endpoint will be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75mg SHP647) to the placebo group using a Cochran -Mantel Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test stratified by status of prior anti -TNF treatment and glucocorticoid use at baseline (Visit 2). Subjects with missing remission data at the Week 12 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders. The endoscop y score will be based on centrally read results. The primary endpoint will be tested by the following hy pothesis: H0: δ= 0 H1: δ≠ 0 Where δ is the common treatment difference across strata, j=1 to m. The common treatment difference is a weighted average of the stratum- specific treatment differences. The estimate of the common treatment difference along with the corresponding strat ified Newcombe 95% confidence interval (CI) using the method of Yan and Su ( 2010) and CMH p-value will be presented for each active treatment group to pl acebo comparison . Sensitivity analy ses which explore the impact of missing data on the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted. These anal yses may compare imputations of the missing values which favor placebo (eg, worst case) and/or imputations which f avor active treatment (eg, best case). In addition, imputation methods based on informative missingness and other missing data mechanisms may be performed. Additional sensitivity anal yses will also be conducted using the per-protocol set and the completer set.Additional anal yses may be developed in the SAP.

A full list of important subgroups will be described within the SAP. Within subgroups, efficacy endpoints will be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg SHP647 and 75 mg SHP647) with the placebo group using a Chi -square test. Subjects with missing remission data at the Week 12 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders. The endoscopy subs core will be based on centrall y read results. The estimate of the treatme nt difference, along with the corresponding Newcombe (hy brid- score) 95% CI and Chi-square test p -value, will be presented. Adjustments for Multiplicity The global FWER for the statistical tests of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be strongl y controlled at .05 (2 -sided). To control the FWER, graphical methods discussed in Bretz et al ( 2009) will be utilized to propagate α from primary to key secondary endpoints and between the two SHP647 treatment group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split equall y at the .025 level (2 - sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the primary endpoint (P) and alpha is propagated in a hierarchical manner to each of the 4key secondary endpoints (K1-K4) within a pairwise treatment comparison .

Additionally , Shire adheres to external guidelines ( eg, Good Publication Practices 2) when forming a publication steering committee, which is done for large, multicenter Phase 2 -4 and certain other studies as determined b y Shire . The purpose of the publication steeri ng committee is to act as a non commercial body that advises or decides on dissemination of scientific study data in accordance with the scope of this policy . All publications relating to Shire products or projects must undergo appropriate t echnical and intellectual propert y review, with Shire agreement to publish before release of information. The review is aimed at protecting the sponsor’s proprietary information existing either at the commencement of the study or generated during the study . To the extent permitted by the publisher and cop yright law, the principal investigator will own (or share with other authors) the copy right on his/her publications . To the extent that the principal investigator has such sole, joint or shared rights, the principal investigator grants the sponsor a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to make and distribute copies of such publications. The term “publication” refers to an y public disclosure including original research articles, review articles, oral presentations, abstracts and posters at medical congresses, journal supplements, letters to the editor, invited lectures, opinion pieces, book chapters, electronic postings on medical/scientific websites, or other disclosure of the study results, in printe d, electronic, oral or other form. Subject to the terms of the paragraph below, the investigator shall have the right to publish the study results, and any background information provided by the sponsor that is necessary to include in an y publication of st udy results, or necessary for other scholars to verify such study results . Notwithstanding the foregoing, no publication that incorporates the sponsor’s confidential information shall be submitted for publication without the sponsor’s prior written agreement to publish and shall be given to the sponsor for review at least 60 days before submission for publication .

Investigator(s) : Multicenter study. Site(s) and Region(s): It is anticipated that the study will be conducted in at least 18countries. Regions will include North America Europe , the Middle East, and Africa ,Latin America, and Asia -Pacific. Approximately 210sites will be utilized. Study period (planned): 2017 to2020Clinical phase: 3 Objectives: Prim ary: Toevaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing remission , based on composite score of patient -reported symptoms and centrally read endoscopy, in subjects w ith moderate to severe ulcerative colitis ( UC). Key Secondary : To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in achieving endoscopi c rem ission, based on centrally read endoscopy. To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in achieving clinical remission, base d on composite score of patient -reported symptoms. To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing clinical response, base d on composite score of patient -reported symptoms an d centrally read endoscopy. To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in achieving mucosal healing, based on endoscopic and histological assessment using the Geboes Score grading system . Other Secondary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SHP647. To evalu ate the effect of SHP647 induction treatment on other clinical and endoscopic outcom es(including Mayo-based remission and clinical response, partial Mayo score over time, clinical remission over time, endoscopic remission, and deep remission) . To evaluate the effect of SHP647 on abdominal pain, urgency, diarrhea, and absolute stool frequency and bleeding scores. To evaluate the effect of SHP647 on health -related quality of life (as measured by the Inflammatory Bow el Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ] and the Sho rt Form -36 Health Survey [SF -36]). To evaluate the effect of SHP647 on incidence of hospitalizations and total inpatient days. Rationale: This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHP647 in inducing remission in subjects w ith moderate to severe UC. SHP647 has been investigated in 2 completed dose -finding studies (A7281001 and A7281009) in subjects w ith moderate to severe UC; a third study (A7281010), an open -label long -term safety extension study, is ongoing. The Phase 1 study, A7281001 , which investigated the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of SHP647, supports further clinical development of SHP647 using subcutaneous ( SC)administration. SC doses of 25 mg or 75 mg of SHP647 or placebo on Day 1 (Week 0 ), Week 4, and Week 8 are recommended for the Phase 3 studies SHP647 -301 and SHP647 -302. For non-commercial use only"
142,page_142,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 21 SHP 647-302 Protocol Amendment 1 SHP647 05 Sep 2018 Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration: The test product is SHP647, which will be provided as a sterile aqueous buffered solution for SC administra tion in a glass prefilled syringe (PFS) with a fixed needle. Each PFS contains 1 mL of SHP647 solution for injection at an appropriate concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 or 75 mg). Additional information is provided in the current SHP64 7 investigator’s brochure. The reference product is placebo, which will be provided in a PFS w ith a fixed needle containing 1 mL of placebo solution for SC administration. The placebo solution will contain the same sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain SHP647. Methodology: A total of 825 subjects (330 subjects at 25 mg SHP647, 330 subjects at 75 mg SHP647, and 165 placebo subjects) are planned for enrollment into the study. Subjects must be at least 16 years of age and no m ore than 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent/assent form . The study consists of a screening period up to 6 w eeks and a 12 -week treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects w ill be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments (25 mg SHP647, 75 mg SHP647, or placebo) in a 2:2:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified based upon the subject’s status of prior anti -TNF (tumor necrosis factor) treatment (naïve or experienced) and glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocorticoids at baseline versus not on glucocorticoids at baseline). Subjects will receive SC injections of SHP647 or placebo , using a PFS, on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 4), and Week 8 (Visit 5). Subjects will undergo efficacy, , safety, and health outcome assessments at these visits . Patient -reported UC signs and symptom data (including stool frequency, rectal bleeding severity and frequency, diarrhea frequency, urgency frequency, and abdominal pain worst severity) will be collected using a daily electronic diary ( e-diary )during the treatment period. The Mayo score is a measure of UC disease activity consisting of the following 4subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of endoscopy, and physician global assessment (PGA). The partial Mayo score consists of the Mayo score without the endoscopic subscores. The composite score is a recommended measure consisting of the Mayo score w ithout the PGA subscore, and will be used for the primary efficacy endpoint. The Mayo scores and composite score w ill be based on subject daily e -diary entries . At the end of the 12 -week treatment period, eligible subjects w ill be offered the opportunity to participate in a double- blind maintenance study (SHP647 -303; for subjects wh o achieve clinical response) or a long -term safety extension (LTS) study (SHP647 -304; for subjects w ho do not achieve a clinical response). Subjects who withdraw early from the 12 -week treatment period or who do not w ish to enter the maintenance study (SHP 647-303) or LTS study (SHP647 -304) will continue into a 16-week safety follow -up period .Only those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647 -301 or SHP647 -302) w ill be eligible to continue in the maintenance study or LTS study.

Subjects with evidence of active or latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) or subjects with this history who have not completed a generally accepted full course of treatment before random ization are excluded. All other subjects must have either the Mantoux (purified protein derivative [PPD]) tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) performed. Subjects who have no history of previously diagnosed active or latent tubercu losis are excluded if they have a positive Mantoux (PPD) tuberculi n skin test (ie ≥5mm induration) or a positive IGRA (the latter to be tested at the site’s local laboratory) during screening or w ithin 12 weeks before randomization.

Prim ary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint i s remission at the Week 12 visit. Remission is defined as a composite score of patient -reported symptoms us ing daily e- diary and centrally read endoscopy as follows : stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 w ith at least a 1-point change from baseline AND rectal bleeding subscore of 0 AND endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability). The primary efficacy endpoint will be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75 mg SHP647) to the placebo group using a Cochran -Mantel Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test str atified by status of prior anti -TNF treatment and glucocorticoid use at baseline (Visit 2). Subjects with mis sing remission data at the Week 12 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders. The endoscopy s core will be base d on centrally read results. The primary endpoint will be tested by the following hypothesis: H0: δ= 0 H1: δ≠ 0 Where δis the common treatment difference across strata, j=1 to m. The common treatment difference is a weighted average of the stratum -specific treatment differences. The global family -wise type I error rate (FWER )for the statistical tes ts of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be strongly controlled at .05 (2 -sided). To control the FWER, graphical methods discussed in Bretz, et al 2009 will be utilized to propagate α from primary to key secondary endpoints and between the two SH P647 treatment group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2 -sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the primary endpoint (P) and alpha is propagated in a hier archical manner to each of the 4key sec ondary endpoints (K1 -K4) within a pairw ise treatment comparison. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Endoscopic rem ission, as defined by centrally read endoscopic subscore 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability), at the Week 12 visit. Clinical remission, as d efined by stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 w ith at least a 1 -point change from baseline in stool frequency subscore, and rectal bleeding subscore of 0, at the Week 12 visit. Clinical response based on composite score at the Week 12 visit. Clinical respon se (com posite) is defined as a decrease from baseline in the composite score of patient -reported symptoms using daily e -diary and centrally read endoscopy of at least 2 points and at least 30%, w ith an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleed ing ≥1 point or a subscore for rectal bleeding ≤1. Mucosal healing based on endoscopic and histological assessment at the Week 12 visit. Mucosal healing is defined by centrally read endoscopic subscore 0 or 1 (modified, exc ludes friability) and centrally read Geboes score of ≤2. The key secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same approach as described for the primary efficacy endpoint.

155,page_155,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 34 SHP647 -302 Protocol Amendment 1 SHP647 05 Sep 2018 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 1.1 Indication and Current Tr eatment Options Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing disease marked b y ulceration and inflammation of the colonic mucosa and submucosa. Initially it usually involves the rectum but may extend proximally to involve a portion of, or the entiret y of, the colon. In the earl y stages, hemorrhagic and ery thematous tissue is observed, progressing to mucosal ulceration with purulent exudates in severe cases. The ulceration pattern is continuous and may extend the entire length of the colon. Perforation of the bowel wall causing ileus and peritonitis can occur with transmural extension of the ulceration. Blood y diarrhea with or without mucus and lower abdominal pain with periods of remission and exacerbation are the most common sy mptoms. The incidence of UCisestimated to be up to 24.3 cases per 100,000 persons per year in Europe and up to 19.2 cases per 100,000 persons per year in North America . No clear difference in incidence has been observed between men and women. Although UC can occur at an y age, peak incidence has been observed in the second to fourth decades of life (Molodecky et al. 2012 ). Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong condition with a serious effect on the quality of life. Current treatment primaril y consists of sy mptomatic management with dietary modifications and opiate antidiarrheal drugs (loperamide), as well as disease modify ing agents such as 5 -aminosalicy lic acid (5 -ASA), sy stemic glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine/6 -mercaptopurine, cy closporine), and biologic therapy with anti -tumor necrosis factor ( TNF )or anti -integrin agents. Despite recent advances, there is still an unmet need for an effective pharmaco logical treatment that will induce and maintain remission. 1.2 Product Background and Clinical Information The selectivit y of l ymphocy te homing to specialized ly mphoid tissue and mucosal sites of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is influenced b y the endothelial expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM). MAdCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin super family of cell adhesion molecules and is mostly expressed on the cell surface of high endothelial venules of organized intestinal lymphoid tissue such as Peyer’s patches and mesenteric l ymph nodes (Briskin et al. 1997 ;Shyjan et al. 1996 ;Liaskou et al. 2011) . MAdCAM play s a role in gut immune surveillance, and also appears to facilitate excessive ly mphocy te infiltration under conditions of chronic G I inflammation. The α4β7integrin is the recognized ligand for MAdCAM , and expression of this ligand on populations of CD4+and CD8+T cells, as well as on subsets of Bcells, distinguishes them as unique gut homing ly mphocy tes. SHP647 (previously known as PF -00547659) is a f ully human immunoglobulin G2 kappa (IgG 2k)monoclonal antibody that binds to human MAdCAM to reduce l ymphocy te homing to the gut and GI inflammation. SHP647 binds MAdCAM-1 with high affinity and selectivity that prevents the binding of α4β7+lymphocy tes to MAdCAM expressing sites in the high endot helial venules of the GI tract.

In UC study A7281009, induction with SHP647 at doses of 7.5 mg, 22.5 m g, or 75 mg every 4 weeks resulted in statistically significantly higher proportions of subjects in remission at Week 12 based on total May o score (both local and central read) when compared with placebo treatment. In CD study A7281006, induction with SHP 647 did not meet the primary endpoint; no statistically significant differences were observed between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm in CDAI -70 response rate at Week 8 or Week 12. Post hoc anal yses suggested evidence of drug effect in subjec ts with more inflammation at baseline, as indicated b y higher serum concentrations of CRP or Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES -CD). In UC induction study A7281009, decreases in fecal calprotectin were observed in all groups, including placebo; however, there were no statistically significant differences in the decrease in fecal calprotectin between any dose level of SHP647 and placebo. Decreases in hsCRP were also observed in all 4 treatment groups; however, other than the 75 mg dose group at Week 12, no statistically significant differences were observed in active treatment vs placebo. In the induction Study A7281006 in subjects with CD, compared to placebo, nominall y statistically significant decreases in fecal calprotectin were observed in the 75 mg gro up at Week 8 and in the 22.5 mg and 75 mg groups at Week 12. Generall y, decreases from baseline in hsCRP were observed in all 4 treatment groups over the 12 -week induction period. Compared to placebo, nominally statistically significant decreases in hsCRP were observed in all 3 active treatment groups (22.5 mg, 75 mg, and 225 mg) at Week 12. There was no evidence of a dose response for either of these parameters. A nominally statistically significant increase was observed in circulating β7+ central memory T lymphocy tes at Weeks 8 and 12, consistent with the predicted mechanism of action. The most common SAEs across all studies were CD and UC. In Study A7281006, the randomized, placebo -controlled induction study in CD, TEAEs were most comm only reported within the GI disorders sy stem organ class (SOC) followed by the infections and infestations SOC. The most common all -causalit y TEAEs were CD (worsening and progression of underly ing disease), followed by pyrexia, headache, and arthralgia, a ll of which had similar incidences in the placebo treatment group compared with the active treatment groups. In Study A7281009, the randomized, placebo -controlled induction study in UC, TEAEs were most commonly reported within the GI disorders SOC followed by the infections and infestations SOC. The most common all -causalit y TEAE was headache, followed b y abdominal pain, nasophary ngitis, UC (worsening and progression of underl ying disease), and nausea, all with similar incidence between placebo -and drug -treated subjects. The long- term, open -label safety studies (Studies A7281007 and A7281010) were not placebo-controlled, but permitted exposure to the investigational product at doses of 75 mg or 225mg every 4 weeks for 18 and 36 months, respectivel y. In St udy A7281007, the most common all -causalit y TEAE was CD (worsening or progression), arthralgia, nasopharyngitis, and abdominal pain.

I n the placebo -controlled induction studies, nasophary ngitis was not reported more frequentl y in SHP647 -than placebo -treated subjects, but occurred at relatively high frequency during long -term safet y studies. SHP647 does not appear to be associated with impaired CNS immune surveillance. No case of PML or m yocarditis has been reported. SHP647, in doses of 7.5mg, 22.5 mg, and 75 mg, appears to increase the rate of remission in subjects with UC, and may have an effect in patients with CD who have greater evidence of inflammation based on biomarker or endoscopic data.

SHP647 prevents the bin ding of α4β7+lymphocy tes to MAdCAM -expressing sites with high affinity and selectivity . Principal sites of MAdCAM expression on normal tissue include intestine, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, spleen, and to a lesser extent lung, liver, and bladder but not the central nervous s ystem (CNS) (Steffen et al. 1996). Although selective targeting of the MAdCAM receptors is a novel approach, the basic interference of l ymphocyte homing by preventing the binding of these α 4β7+lymphocy tes to the MAdCAM receptor and the resultant efficacy in UC is well established (Feagan et al. 2013 ). SHP647 is differentiated from other molecules used for the treatment of UC in that itblocks the interaction of α4β7+lymphocy tes to the MAdCAM receptor by selectivel y binding to MAdCAM in the gut (and related tissues) whereas other molecules only target the integrins on the infiltrati ng lymphocy tes. Additionally , SHP647 does not bind to the vascular cell adhesion molecule; therefore, SHP647 is not expected to be an effective treatment for multiple sclerosis, or affect l ymphocy te homing or surveillance in the CNS. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing remission in subjects with moderate to severe UC. SHP647 has been investigated in 2 completed dose-finding studies (A7281001 and A7281009) in subjects with moderate to severe UC; a third study (A7281010), an open -label long -term safet y extension study , is ongoing. Phase 1 study A7281001 evaluated both single (0.03 -10.0 mg/kg intravenous [ IV]; 3.0 mg/kg subcutaneous [ SC]) and multiple doses (0.1 -3.0 mg/kg IV; 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg SC) of SHP647 in subjects with UC. Safety evaluation revealed a safet y profile for SHP647 similar to that of placebo, with no pattern of adverse events (AEs) suggestive of increased risk of opportunistic infections or CNS effects, and no evidence of adverse effects on laboratory parameters, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, or neurological function. Events leading to withdrawal were due to exacerbations of the underl ying UC. Study A7281009 was a Phase 2b proof -of-concept (randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled, parallel, dose -ranging) study designed to evaluate the efficacy , safet y, and pharmacokinetics of SHP647 in subjects with moderate to severe UC. Treatment was assigned in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to dose levels of 7.5, 22.5, 75, or 225 mg SHP647 or placebo administered SC once eve ry 4 weeks (Q4W at Weeks 0, 4, and 8) . The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of subjects in clinical remission at We ek 12, with remission defined as a total May o score of ≤2 with no individual subscore >1 (seeAppendix 2 for details of the May o score ). More subjects wer e in clinical remission at Week 12 in SHP647- treated groups than in the placebo group, with statistical significance ach ieved for the 7.5, 22.5, and 75 -mg doses (Vermeire et al. 2017 ). Based upon the to tal May o score with a centrall y read endoscopic severit y component, the increase in clinical remission rates over placebo at Week 12 for the 7.5, 22.5, and 75- mg doses were 8.0% (p=.043), 12.8% (p=.010), and 11.8% (p=.012).

159,page_159,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 38 SHP647 -302 Protocol Amendment 1 SHP647 05 Sep 2018 When theclinical remission rate at Week 12 was analy zed by stratum of previou s anti -TNF exposure (experienced or naïve), a similar trend was observed ac ross dose levels in both the anti-TNF experienced and anti -TNF naïve subjects. There was no evidence of an adverse safet y signal, and there was no increase in the frequency of infections in MAdCAM -bearing tissues as evidenced b y similar rates of nasopharyn gitis among treatment arms. Based on the efficacy and safet y data in Study A7281009 and the s ystemic population pharmacokinetic ( PK)and pharmacod ynamic ( PD)modeling and simulation, clinical remission, clinical response and mucosal healing rates were higherin subject s with UC receiving doses of 22.5 and 75 mg Q4W than in those receiving doses of 7.5 mg and 225 mg Q4W. The induction responses were not demonstrated either at Week 4 or Week 8, but were observed at Week 12 regardless of dose level. No differe nce in the clinical responses between a 22.5 -mg dose and a 25-mg dose is expected based on the current understanding of the mode of action of SHP647 and clinical observations to date. To better understand the exposure (dose) - response relationship in this p opulation and understand individual patient exposure needs, the 25- mg and 75 -mg doses (Q4W) will be tested in the Phase 3 program. Therefore, SC doses of 25 mg or 75 mg of SHP647 or placebo on Day 1 (Week 0), Week 4, and Week 8 are recommended for the 2 planned Phase 3 studies SHP647 -301 and SHP647 -302. The Phase 1 study , A7281001, which investigated the safet y, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of SHP647, supports further clinical development of SHP647 using SCadministration . 2.2 Study Objectives 2.2.1 Primary Objective The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing remission, based on composite score of patient -reported s ymptoms and centrall yread endoscop y,in subjects with moderate to severe UC. 2.2.2 Seco ndary Objectives 2.2.2.1 Key Secondary Objective s The key secondary objectives are as follows: To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in achieving endoscopic remission, based on centrall yread endoscopy. To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in achieving clinical remission, based on composite score of patient -reported sy mptoms. To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in inducing clinical response, based on composite score of patient -reported sy mptoms and centrally read endoscop y. To evaluate the efficacy of SHP647 in achieving mucosal healing, based on a centrall yread endoscopic and histological assessment using the Geboes Score grading system .

A total of 825 subjects (330 subjects at 25 mg SHP647, 330 subjects at 75 mg SHP647, and 165placebo subjects) are planned for enrollment into the study (Figure 1). Subjects must be at least 16 years of age and no more than 80 y ears of age at the time of signing the informed consent/assent form. The study consists of a screening period up to 6 weeks and a 12- week treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects will be rand omly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments ( 25mg SHP647, 75 mg SHP647, or placebo ) in a 2:2 :1ratio. Randomization will be stratified based upon the subject’s status of prior anti -tumor necrosis factor ( TNF )treatment (naïve or experienced) and glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocorticoid s at baseline versus not on glucocorticoid s at baseline ) . Subjects will receive SCinjections of SHP647 or placebo , using a prefilled s yringe (PFS) ,on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 4), and Week 8 (Visit 5) . Subjects will undergo efficacy , , , safety , and health outcome assessments at these visits as detailed in Table 1 . At the end of the 12- week treatment period , eligible subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in adouble -blind maintenance study (SHP647 -303; for subjects who achieve clinical response ) or along-term safet y extension (LTS) study (SHP647- 304; for subjects who do not achieve a clinical response ) as shown in Figure 1. Subjects who withdraw earl y from the 12-week treatment period or who do not wish to enter the maintenance study (SHP647- 303) or LTS stud y (SHP647 -304) will continue into a 16-week safet y follow- up period .Only those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647 -301 or SHP647 -302) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance stud y or LTS study .

Over the past decade, health authority thinking regarding efficacy endpoints for UC has evolved such that the traditiona l May o score is no longer recommended. Current regulatory guidance ( FDA Ulcerative Colitis: Clinical Trial Endpoints Guidance for Industry [Draft], 2016; EMA Guideline on the Development of New Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis [Draft], 2016 ) includes a dual measurement of patient -reported signs and s ymptoms outcomes (stool frequency and rectal bleeding), and clinician- reported endoscopic outcomes (scoring an y endoscop y with evidence of friabilit y as a 2), including histology .Per a greement with health authorities, these 3 outcomes will be reported as a composite score. Data will be collected to calculate the total May o score using both the traditional and modified endoscop y subscore as a sensitivity anal ysis and to estimate the impa ct of the modification on the primary endpoint. The clinical relevance of the traditional May o score is supported by its correlation with significant improvement in disease -specific HRQL as measured by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) an d in generic HRQL as measured b y the Short Form -36 (SF -36) questionnaire .Placebo 25 mg SHP647 75 mg SHP647Screening: Up to 6weeksRandomization Maintenance study (SHP647 -303) or LTS study (SHP647 -304) or W0 W4 W8 Dosing: @ Treatment period : 12weeksWeek12/End of Treatment 16-week safety follow -up per ioda For non-commercial use only"
164,page_164,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 43 SHP647 -302 Protocol Amendment 1 SHP647 05 Sep 2018 3.1.2 Rationale for Key Secondary Endpoint s: The first 2 key secondary endpoints are included to comply with EMA advice. European Medicines Agency would agree to the composite primary endp oint only if supported by a key secondary anal ysis, where the patient -reported s ymptoms and clinician -reported endoscop y are analyzed as “co -primary ”. The clinical response endpoint is based on the new composite score, and also represents 1 of the entry criteria for the maintenance study. This endpoint has not been previously tested. Mucosal healing as akey secondary endpoint comprises both endoscopic and histologic components as recommended in the draft FDA and EMA guidance on UC ( FDA Ulcerative Colitis: Clinical Trial Endpoint s Guidance for Industry [Draft] , 2016; EMA Guideline on the Development of New Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis [Draft], 2016). The Geboes Score ( see Appendix 2 ) will be used to evaluate histologic remission and to complement the endoscopic subscore in the assessment of mucosal healing for the key secondary endpoint . 3.2 Duration and Study Completion Definition Each subject’s final visit in this study may be at the e nd of the treatment period (Week 12) if continuing to Study SHP647 -303 or SHP647 -304, or at the end of the safety follow -up period (Week 28) if not continuing to either of these studies. In either case, the final visit will be in person at the site. A subject’s maximum duration of participation is expected to be approximately 34 weeks: a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a treatment period of 12 weeks, and a safet y follow-up period of 16 weeks (if applicable). It is expected that t he study will be complete d in approximately 3years. The Study Completion Date is defined as the date the final subject, across all sites, completes their final protocol -defined assessment . Please note that this includes the follow -up visit or contact, whichever is later . The Stud y Completion Date is used to ascertain timing for study results posting and reporting. 3.3 Sites and Regions It is anticipated that the study will be conducted in at least 18countries.

Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the dur ation of exposure to investigational product, and withdrawal are not appropriate methods of contraception. During the screening visit, the investigator or designee in consultation with the subject will confirm the subject’s childbearing potential status. For subjects of childbearing potential ,it must be confirmed and documented that the subject has selected the most appropriate method of contraception from the permitted list of contraception methods. Subjects must affirm the consistent and correct use of a t least 1 of the seselected methods. Regular contraception check discussions will take place at the time points specified in Table 1(ie, ateach site visit) and will be documented. In addition , the subject must be instructed to call the site immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if p regnancy is known or suspected. 4.4.1 Contracepti ve Methods for Female Study Subjects Sexually active females of childbearing potential must alread y be using an established highl y effective form of contr aception, and must be advised to use appropriate contraceptives throughout the stud y period and for 16 weeks following the last dose of investigational product.

Each PFS contains 1mLof SHP647 solution for injection at an appropriate concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 or 75 mg) . Additional information is provided in the current SHP 647 investigator’ s brochure. The reference product is placebo, which will be provided in a PFS with a fixed needle containing 1mLof placebo solution for SC administration .The placebo solution will co ntain the same sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain SHP647. 6.1.1 Blinding the Treatment Assignment The placebo s yringes and solution will match the SHP647 sy ringes in appearance. The fill volume for all sy ringes will be the same. 6.2 Administra tion of Investigational Product 6.2.1 Interactive Response Technology for Investigational Product Management An interactive response technology (IRT)system will be used for screening and enrolling subjects, recording subject visits, randomization, investigational product supply dispensation and management, inventory management and suppl y ordering, investigational product expiration tracking and management, and emergency unblinding. Please refer to the Study Manual for additional details regardin g the IRT s ystem. 6.2.2 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment This is a double -blind, placebo- controlled stud y. The actual treatment given to individual subjects is determined by a randomization schedule. The total Mayo score will be calculated at baseline (Visit 2) before randomization. Endoscopic subscore based on the central reader’s assessment will be used to determine eligibility . Subjects with a total Mayo score of ≥6, including a centrally read endoscopic subscore ≥2, rectal bleeding subscore ≥1, and stool frequency subscore ≥1, and who fulfill all other eligibility criteria , will be randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 via a computer -generated randomization schedule t o receive SC injection sof 25 mg SHP647, 75 mg SHP647, or placebo , respectivel y. The randomization will be performed centrall y and str atified by status of prior anti -TNF therap y (2 strata: naïve versus experienced) and glucocorticoid use at base line (2 strata: on glucocorticoid s at baselin e versus not on glucocorticoid s at baseline). To ensure that the allocation of subjects with prior anti- TNF therap y exposure is similar to that observed in Study A7281009, the percentage of subjects with prior a nti-TNF therap y exposure will be capped at 60% of the sample population. Additionally , in Japan onl y, enrollment of Japanese subjects with prior anti- TNF therap y exposure will be capped at 60%, to ensure comparability to the rest of the global study popula tion. There will be no cap on the number of anti-TNF naïve subjects randomized. For non-commercial use only"

Within each site (numbered uniquely within a protocol), the subject number wil l be assigned to subjects according to the sequence of presentation for study participation. The randomization number represents a unique number corresponding to investigational product allocated to the subject, once eligibility has been determined. Individual subject treatment will be automatically assigned by the IRT sy stem. Investigational product packaging identification numbers, separate from randomization numbers/unique identifiers, may also be assigned to subjects for specific treatment assignment as dictated b y the study . In these cases, the same investigational product packing identification number may not be assigned to more than 1 subject. 6.2.3 Dosing Investigational product (SHP647 or placebo) will be administered subcutaneously by qualified site pers onnel Q4W (Weeks 0, 4, and 8) . See Section 7.2for the timing of dosing relative to other procedures. Investigational product should be administered in the anterolateral righ t or left thigh. If there are clinical reasons wh y the investigational product cannot be administered in the thigh, the investigational product may be administered in the deltoid area or abdomen with appropriate documentation. The location of the investigational product administration will be recorded. After the first administration of investigational product, the subject must be observed b y a member of the stud y staff for at least 30 minutes (the total duration should be determined at the discretion of the investigator). For subsequent administrations, observation of the subject is at t he discretion of the investigator. Injection site and allergic reaction monitoring should be completed by a member of the study staff. Investigator -directed delay s in dosing due to abnormal laboratory findings or AEs should be discussed with the medical mo nitor to determine whether the subject should continue with the treatment .Only those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647 -301 or SHP647 -302) will be eligible to continue in the mainten ance stud y or LT S study .

Each subject or subject’s parent or legally authorized representative must participate in the informed consent process and provide written info rmed consent /assent before any assessments or procedures specified in the protocol are performed. Screening assessments may take place over more than 1 day (at least 2 visits will be necessary to complete the screening procedures ,including endoscopy ) . A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent or assent, as applicable (and whose parents or legally authorized representatives have given informed consent , as applicable), failed to me et the inclusion criteria and/or met at least 1 of the excl usion criteria, and has not been randomized or administered investigationa l product . A subject may be rescreened if their condition has changed and they may potentially be eligible. Subjects may be rescreened 1 time . NOTE: S creening laboratory tests, if co nsidered b y the investigator to be transient and inconsistent with the subject’s clinical condition, may be repeated once during the screening period for confirmation .Results of repeated tests must be reviewed for eligibility prior to the screening endosc opy procedure. Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (if preferred) must be performed on all subjects after the majority of other eligibility criteria (eg, laboratory values) are met. Endoscopy must be performed during the screening period within 10 day s before baseline (Visit 2), preferabl y within 5to7days before the baseline visit ,to obtain the centrally read endoscopic subscore (see Section 7.2.2.1). Biops y samples will be collected for histological evaluation using the Geboes Score classification and . Subjects at risk of colorectal cancer, as defined in exclusion criterion 5 (see Section 4.2), must have a colonoscopy performed at screening , unless the subject has had a surveillance colonoscopy performed within 1 year prior to screening, and an y adenomatous poly ps found at that examination ha vebeen excised. Colonoscopy report and pathology report (if biopsies are obtained) from the colonoscopy performed during screening or in the prior year confirming no presence of dy splasia and colon cancer must be available in the source documents . If a subject has had the following procedures performed as a part of standard medical care within 12weeks before screening (Visit 1 ), these procedures do not need to be repeated as a part of screening: Chest x -ray Documented negative PPD test or IGRA for TB .

Part1 of Visit 6 should be scheduled preferabl y within 5 to 7 days before Part 2; this will allow sufficient time fo r data from the centrall y read endoscopy to be available at Part 2 of the visit . The Week 12/ET assessments and procedures that will take place during Part 1 are specified in Table 1 . Part 2 of Visit 6 will take place on Day 84 ±3 days. The Week 12/ET asse ssments and procedures that will take place during Part 2 are specified in Table 1. At Part 2 of Visit 6 , after review of the May o score, health outcome assessments, and safet y assessments, it will be determined whether the subject should enter the safety follow -up period of this study or enroll in the maintenance (SHP647- 303) or LTS (SHP647 -304) studies. Entry into the maintenance or LTS studies is dependent upon the subject’s response and whether the subject agrees to participate. The Week 12 assessments and procedures will also form the ETassessments for an y subjects who are withdrawn earl y or discontinued from the study . 7.1.3 Follow -up Period : Visits 7 and 8 (Weeks 20 and 28) Subjects who are withdrawn early from the study, or who do not enter either the mai ntenance or LTS studies, should enter the 16- week safet y follow -up phase for safet y monitoring.

At the end of the safet y follow -upperiod, there will be a visit at the site on Day 196 ±7 days, or 16 weeks ±7 days after the subject’s last visit in the treatment period for subjects who are withdrawn earl y from the study, which will form the Week 28 visit (Visit 8). The assessments and procedures spe cified in Table 1will be performed, including query ingfor SAEs, AEs, and concomitant medications and procedures . All AEs and SAEs that are not resolved at the time of this visit will be followed to closure (see Section 8.1). Subjects who are proceeding t o the maintenance or LTS studies will not enter the safety follow -up period . 7.1.4 Additional Care of Subjects after the Study No after care is planned for this study . 7.2 Study Evaluations and Procedures Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -requir ed tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside the control of the investigator, which may make it unfeasible to perform the tests and procedures. In these cases, the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safet y and well -being of the subject. When timing of procedures and assessments coincide, the following order should be followed: Health outcome and patient -reported questionnaires Vital signs and ECG Laboratory sample collection Endoscopy (generall y performed at a separate visit; see Section 7.2.2.1). Investigational product administration Note: Blood and tissue samples may be stored for up to the duration allowed by local regulations , but for no lo nger than 25 years. 7.2.1 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics Demographic characteristics will be recorded at the screening visit (Visit 1) .

Remission is defined as a composite score of pat ient-reported s ymptoms us ing dail y electronic diary (e-diary )and centrall yread endoscopy as described in Section 9.8.1. 7.2.2.1 Endoscopy and Histology Endoscopy will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1and will consist of either flexible sigmoidoscopy or colono scopy (if preferred). If it is necessary , bowel preparation should be conducted as per local routine. The position of the endoscope will be based on the length of the instrument at various levels of insertion as well as the morphological features of the in testine as seen during endoscopy at baseline. The endoscopy report and an y photographs and/or video recordings taken during the procedure per local custom should be filed in the subject’s medical record. During endoscop y, 2biopsy samples will be collected from the most inflamed area of the sigmoid colon at screening and Week 12/ET. Endoscopy and biopsy procedures will be defined in an endoscop y instructions manual and/or reference card(s), on which all sites will be trained. Endoscopy results will be revie wed by a central reader. Biopsy samples will be centrally reviewed using the Geboes Score classification sy stem and (see Appendix 2 ) for the evaluation of histological disease severity in UC with higher numbers corresponding to more inflammation . The Geboes score will be used for the key secondary efficacy evaluation and . Subjects at risk for colorectal cancer (s ee exclusion criterion number 5) must have a colonoscop y performed during the screening period with results available within 10 days before the baseline visit (Visit 2), unless the subject has had a surveillance colonoscop y performed within 1 year prior to screening, and any adenomatous poly ps found at that examination have been excised. Colonoscopy report and pathology report (if biopsies are obtained) from the colonoscop y performed during screening or in the prior y ear confirming no evidence of dy splasia and colon cancer must be available in the source documents. 7.2.2.2 Mayo Score The May o score is a measure of UC disease activity . May o scores (total or partial) will be recorded at the time points specified in Table 1 . The total May o score ranges from 0 to 12 points and consists of the following 4 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe di sease (see Appendix 2 ): Stool frequency (0-3) Rectal bleeding (0 -3) Findings of endoscop y (0-3) Physician global assessment (PGA , 0-3).

The composite score is a recommended measure consisting of the May o score without the PGA subscore a nd ranges from 0 to 9 points. The composite score will be used for the primary efficacy endpoint. Calculation of the total and partial Mayo score sand composite score requires a self -assessment by the subject for stool frequency and the amount of blood in the stool. These data on stool frequency and rectal bleeding will be captured in the PRO -UC daily e-diary (see Section 7.2.2.3). The May o stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores will be calculated based on each subject ’s daily e-diary data recorded o ver the most recent 3 days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) of the last 10 day s prior to the visit excluding the following day s: day of any bowel prep aration , day of endoscopy , any days between day of bowel preparation and day of endoscopy , and the 2days after the day of endoscopy . The mucosal appearance during the sigmoidoscopic portion of the endoscopic examination will be assessed for the May o endoscopic subscore based on the scoring s ystem provided in the protocol ( see Appendix 2 ). The endoscopic appear ance will be read b y a central reader through video recorded during the procedure. Centrally read endoscopic subscores will be used for both eligibility and efficacy analy ses. The PGA acknowledges the 3 other criteria: the subject ’s recollection of abdominal discomfort and general sense of wellbeing and other observations (such as phy sical findings and the subject’s performance status). The endoscopic subscore and the PGA must be performed b y a physician qualified to perform endoscop y, and it is recommended that the same phy sician performs all such assessments for a particular subject throughout the stud y. 7.2.2.3 Patient -reported Outcome –Ulcerative Colitis E- Diary Patient- reported UC signs and sy mptom data will be collected using a daily e -diary starting during the screening period . Collection of the daily e -diary data must begin at least 10 days before the baseline visit (Visit 2). Subjects will enter data on UC sign sand sy mptoms items using anelectronic handheld device that will be provided to subjects at the start of the study . Compliance is assessed by site staff at each visit. The site staff willinstruct the subject on the appropriate use of the e -diary ,particularly when compliance is below 80% (eg, <23 out of 28 e- diary entries) when compared with the pre vious visit. Subjects will be asked to record the following signs and symptom data, as experienced over the previous 24 hours, in thee-diary : Stool frequency Rectal bleeding severity and frequency Diarrhea frequency Urgency frequency Abdominal pain worst severity .

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH Guidance E2A 1995) . All AEs are collect ed from the time the informed consent and/or assent is signed until the end of the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.3. This includes events occurring during the screening phase of the study , regardless of whether or not investigational produc t is administered . Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of sy mptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each s ymptom should be listed individually . All AEs should be captured in the subject’s source document. In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be captured in the subject’s source document . All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status or all variables h ave returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or th e event is otherwise explained . When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented. 8.1.1 Severity Categorization The severit y of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including the start and stop dates for each change in severit y. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new event . Worsening of pre treatment events, after initiation of investigational product, must be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experien ces mild intermittent dy spepsia before dosing of investigational product, but the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of severe dy spepsia [with the appropriate date of onset ] is recorded in the subject’s source document ). The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions: Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention . The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention . The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no signi ficant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantl y affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. For non-commercial use only"
198,page_198,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 77 SHP647 -302 Protocol Amendment 1 SHP647 05 Sep 2018 8.1.2 Relationship Categorization A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for each AE . The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused b y the investi gational product . If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related .”Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause -and- effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related .”The causality assessment must be documented in the source document. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definit ion RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident. Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between t he investigational product and the event. 8.1.3 Outcome Categorization The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the stud y in the eCRF . Outcomes are as follows: Fatal Not r ecovered/Not Resolved Recovered/Resolved Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae Recovering/Resolving Unknown . 8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease Under Study Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed as AEs as long as they are within the normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the eff icacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be recorded as an AE. 8.1.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations A change in the value of a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG assessment can represen t an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during treatment with the investigational product, a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of an alread y abnormal value .

If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG values which were not present at the pretreatment value observed closest to the start of stu dy treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible explanation ( eg,concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values. The investigator should decide, based on the above c riteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinicall y significant and therefore represents an AE. 8.1.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent i s signed until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.3. Any report of pregnancy for any female study participant or the partner of a male study participant must be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department using the S hire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form . A cop y of the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form (and any applicable follow - up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire m edical monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol .The pregnant female study participant must be withdrawn from the study . Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar day s postpartum. Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnor mality are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire “ Clinical Study Serious A dverse Event and Non- serious AE as Required b y the Protocol Form .” Note : An elective abortion is not considered an SAE. In addition to the above, if the investigator d etermines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire “ Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Non- serious AE as Required b y the Protocol Form ”as well as the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnan cy Report Form. The test date of the first positive serum/urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( - hCG )test or ultrasound result will determine the pregnancy onset date. 8.1.7 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medicatio n error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they result in an AE/SAE as described in Section 8.2.

For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below. Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigationa l product are not considered reportable as medication errors. Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation. The administration and/or use of the unassigned treatment is/are alway s reportable as a medication error. Theadministration and/or use of an expired investigational product should be considered as a reportable medication error. There is no specific antidote for overdose with SHP647. Treatment should be sy mptomatic and supportive. 8.1.8 Unexpected Adverse Event An unex pected AE is an AE whose nature, severity, specificit y, or outcome is not consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the reference safet y information (RSI ). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product, but are not specificall y mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation. The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor using the IB as the RSI . This determination will include considerations such as the number of AEs previously observed, but not on the basis of what might be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of a product. 8.1.9 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is defined as any suspected adverse reaction to study treatment (ie, including active comparators) that is both serious and unexpected.

Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event wh ich hy pothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . Note: Hospitalizations, which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery for pre-existing cond itions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospita lization for an elective or previously scheduled surgery that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s).

Note: I mportant medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to p revent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an EDor at home; blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 7.1.3 and must be reported totheShire Global Drug Safety Department andthe CRO/Shire medical m onitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by the investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. 8.2.5 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates The onset date of the SAE is defined a s the date the event meets serious criteria . The resolution date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms resolve, or the date the event is considered chronic. In the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectivel y. In addition, any signs or sy mptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed consent form, or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution dat e of the SAE, must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate. 8.2.6 Fatal Outcome Any SAE that results in the subject’s death ( ie,the SAE was noted as the primary cause of death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing event s at the time of death, unless another investigational product action was previously taken ( eg,drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn ), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the su bject never received investigational product). The investigational product action of “ withdrawn ” should not be selected solel y as a result of the subject’s death. For non-commercial use only"

Abnormal values in ALT concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of drug -induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and should alway s be considered important medical events. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying co nditions. Subjects who present with the following laboratory abnormalities per Table 5should be evaluated further to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values. The measurement(s) should be re confirmed with another blood draw pr eferabl y within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding of potential concern. Please refer to lab manual for further instructions. Guidance for Dosing Interruption: Investigator -directed delay s in dosing due to abnormal laboratory findings or AEs should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the subject should continue with the treatment. Only those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647 -301 or SHP647 -302) will be eligib le to continue in the maintenance stud y or L TS study .

A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy . Discrepancies betwee n source data and data entered i n the eCRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel . When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by authorized site personnel . Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit and/or at t he investigator’s meeting . Once a subject is randomized, it is expected that site personnel will complete the e CRF entry within approximately 3 business day s of the subject’s visit. 9.2 Clinical Data Management Data are to be entered into a clinical database a s specified in the CRO’s data management plan . Quality control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures . Data queries requiring clarification are to be communicated to the site for resolution . Only authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner. 9.3 Data Handling Considerations Data that may potentiall y unblind the treatment assignment ( ie,investigational product serum concentrations, antibodies to investigational product, treatment allocation, and investigational product prepara tion/accountability data) will be handled with special care during the data cleaning and review process. These data will be handled in such a way that, before unblinding, any data that may unblind study team personnel will be presented as blinded informati on or otherwise will not be made available . If applicable, unblinded data may be made available to quality assurance representatives for the purposes of conducting independent drug audits. 9.4 Statistical Analysis Process The study will be anal yzed by the spon sor or its agent . The statistical anal ysis plan ( SAP)will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and safet y data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other study information such as subj ect disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications . The SAP will also include a description of how missing, unused and spurious data will be addressed. The SAP will be finaliz ed before unblinding to preserve the integrity of the statistical analy sis and study conclusions. For non-commercial use only"
207,page_207,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 86 SHP647 -302 Protocol Amendment 1 SHP647 05 Sep 2018 All statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS®Version 9.3 or higher (SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC, USA). Unless otherwise specified, summary tabulations wi ll be presented b y treatment group. All data listings will be sorted by treatment group, site, and subject number, and will include the subject’s age, sex, and race. For categorical variables, the number and percentage of subjects within each category (with a category for missing data as needed) of the parameter will be presented. For continuous variables, the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum values will be presented. 9.5 Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Design, and Data Monitoring Committee There is no planned interim analy sis or adaptive design in this study . An external DMC will be established to review the overall safety of the study subjects on an ongoing basis . The DMC will be responsible for the ongoing mon itoring of safet y of subjects enrolled in the study according to the DMC charter. Recommendations made by the DMC to alter the conduct of the study or to amend the protocol will be forwarded to Shire for review and for a final decision. Shire or its design ee will notify investigative sites and regulatory authorities as appropriate, of DMC recommendations (which may include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints). Further details regarding the DMC can be found in the DMC charter, which will be available before the administration of investigational product to any subject .Anal yses of the data for DMC review will be conducted according to the DMC charter and DMC SAP. Because no formal hypothesis testing for safety assessments is planned, multiplicity concerns regarding repeated analyses are not applicable . 9.6 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations Graphical methods are used to control the global family -wise t ype I error rate (FWER) at the .05level (2-sided) for the comparisons of the 2 SHP647 treatment groups with the placebo group. Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise treatment compari sons for the primary endpoint. Therefore, the power anal ysis and sample size estimation was calculated based on the chi- square test of proportions using nQuery Advisor Version 7.0 (Statistical Solutions L td, Cork, Ireland) for an individual SHP647 dose compared with placebo. Power calculations are made based on a ssuming a . 025 (2- sided) significance level for each pairwise treatment comparison. Approximately 1375 subjects will be screened to randomize 825subjects (2:2:1 allocation ratio: 330 subjects in the 25 mg SHP647 treatment group, 330 subjects in the 75 mg SHP647 trea tment group, and 165 subjects in the placebo group) which would y ield an approximately 93% power to detect individual pairwise treatment difference in the primary efficacy endpoint, remission at Week 12, of 11% (5% placebo versus 16% SHP647). Expected remi ssion rates at Week 12 are based on observed rates from theA7281009 study and placebo remission rates from literature (Feagan et al. 2013 ;Sandborn et al. 2017 ).

Remission is de fined as a composite score of patient -reported s ymptoms using dail y e-diary and centrally read endosco py as follows: stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change from baseline AND rectal bleeding subscore of 0 AND endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability ). The primary efficacy endpoint will be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75mg SHP647) to the placebo group using a Cochran -Mantel Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test stratified by status of prior anti -TNF treatment and glucocorticoid use at baseline (Visit 2). Subjects with missing remission data at the Week 12 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders. The endoscop y score will be based on centrally read results. The primary endpoint will be tested by the following hy pothesis: H0: δ= 0 H1: δ≠ 0 Where δ is the common treatment difference across strata, j=1 to m. The common treatment difference is a weighted average of the stratum- specific treatment differences. The estimate of the common treatment difference along with the correspo nding stratified Newcombe 95% confidence interval (CI) using the method of Yan and Su ( 2010) and CMH p-value will be presented for each active treatment group to placebo comparison . Sensitivity analy ses which explore the impact of missing data on the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted. These anal yses may compare imputations of the missing values which favor placebo (eg, worst case) and/or imputati ons which favor active treatment (eg, best case). In addition, imputation methods based on informative missingness and other missing data mechanisms may be performed. Additional sensitivity anal yses will also be conducted using the per-protocol set and the completer set .Additional anal yses may be developed in the SAP. All sensitivity anal yses will be described in the SAP. Prespecified subgroup analy ses are planned for the primary endpoint including, but not limited to gender, prior anti -TNF treatment, gluc ocorticoid use at baseline, region, age group, randomization stratum, and other important sub groups. A full list of important subgroups will be described within the SAP. Within subgroups, efficacy endpoints will be compared for each active treatment group (25mg SHP647 and 75 mg SHP647) with the placebo group using a Chi-square test. For non-commercial use only"

Adjustments for Multiplicity The global FWER for the statistical tests of the primary and key secondar y endpoints will be strongl y controlled at .05 (2 -sided). To control the FWER, graphical methods discussed in Bretz et al ( 2009) will be utilized to propagate α from primary to key secondary endpoints and between the two SHP647 treatment group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split equall y at the .025 level (2 -sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the primary endpoint (P) and alpha is propagated in a hierarchical manner to each of the 4key secondary endpoints (K1-K4) within a pairwise treatment comparison.

Figure A1 Algorithm for C.difficile Diagnosis Using the Quick Check Card Test If the Alere Quik Chek card test is not available, then a diagnosis may be established by following either of the algorithms shown in Figure A2 (using PCR for toxin), Figure A3 using toxigenic culture) or Figure A4 (using toxigenic culture, followed b y PCR). The rationale for the method in Figure A3 is that the majority of PCR tests are expected to be negative for toxin, thus obviating the need for th e test at the central laboratory . The expected turnaround time at the central laboratory for a GDH card test is expected to be shorter than that for stool culture for C.difficile at the local laboratory . The details of the sensitivity and specificity of these tests were reported b y Khanna ( Khanna et al. 2017 ). When medically reasonable, treatment decisions should b e deferred until an etiology has been determined. When this is not feasible, management of sy mptoms should be dictated by the clinical situation. For non-commercial use only"

When this is not feasible, management of sy mptoms should be dictated by the clinical situation. If management requires a prohibited treatment (eg, intravenous glucocorticoids for induction or maintenance studies) the subject should be withdrawn from treatment. If treatment has been deferred, once an etiology is determined (eg, C. difficile , disease exacerbation, Camp ylobacter), appropriate treatment should be promptly implemented without waiting for a scheduled visit. I f the etiology is determined to be C. difficile , treatment guidelines conforming to the current I DSA recommendations for C. difficile infection (McDonald et al. 2018) or the recent expert review on C. difficile infection in IBD (Khanna et al. 2017) should be consulted. If C. difficile infection was identified, clinical improvement should be noted within about 5 days after the start of treatment. I f improvement does not occur, the etiology is most likely an IBD flare secondary to C. difficile and treatment failure assessment should proceed per the protocol. Another possible explanation is primary failure of C. difficile therapy which is unlikely . If an infectious etiology other than C.difficile is identified, it should be managed as appropriate, with reference to current clinical guidelines (Shane et al. 2017 ). If any infectious etiology is determined, the site should contact the medical monitor to make him or her aware of the diagnosis and to discuss treatment and ongoing stud y participation.

Investigator(s): Multicenter study. Site(s) and Region(s): It is anticipated that the study will be conducted in at l east 18 countries. Regions will include North America Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, Latin America, and As ia-Pacific. Approximately 210 sites will be utilized. Study period (planned): 2017 to 2020 Clinical phase: 3 Objectives: Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab in in ducing remission, based on composite score of patient-reported symptoms and centrally read endoscopy, in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Key Secondary: • To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab in achievi ng endoscopic remission, ba sed on centrally read endoscopy • To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab in achieving clinical remission, based on composite score of patient-reported symptoms • To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab in inducing clinical response, based on composite score of patient-reported symptoms and centrally read endoscopy • To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab in achie ving mucosal healing, based on endoscopic and histological assessment using th e Geboes Score grading system. Other Secondary: • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ontamalimab • To evaluate the effect of ontamalimab induction tr eatment on other clinical and endoscopic outcomes (including Mayo-based remission and clinical response, partial Mayo score over time, clinical remission over time, endoscopic remission, and deep remission) • To evaluate the effect of ontamalim ab on abdominal pain, urgency, diarrhea, and absolute stool frequency and bleeding scores • To evaluate the effect of ontamalimab on health-rela ted quality of life (as measured by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ] and the Short Form-36 Health Survey [SF-36]) • To evaluate the effect of ontamalimab on incidence of hospitalizations and total inpatient da ys. Rationale: This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ontamalimab in inducing remission in subjects with moderate to severe UC. Ontamalimab has been investigated in subjects with moderate to severe UC in 3 completed studies: 2 dose-finding studies (A7281001 and A7281009) and an open-label, long-term safety extension (LTS) study (A7281010), which was ongoing at the time of the original protocol and has since completed. The Phase 1 study, A7281001, which investigated the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics (PK) , and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of ontamalimab, supports further clinical development of ontamalimab using subcutaneous (SC) administration. Subcutaneous doses of 25 mg or 75 mg of ontamalimab or placebo on Day 1 (Week 0), Week 4, and Week 8 are recommended for the Phase 3 studies SHP647-301 and SHP647-302. For non-commercial use only"
288,page_288,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 SHP647-302 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 11 Nov 2019 Investigational product, dose, and mode of administration: The test product is ontamalimab, which will be provided as a sterile aqueous buffered solution for SC administration in a glass prefilled syringe (PFS) with a fixed needle. Each PFS contains 1 mL of ontamalimab solution for injection at an appropriate concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 or 75 mg). Additional information is provided in the current ontamalimab investigator’s brochure. The reference product is placebo, which will be provided in a PFS with a fixed needle containing 1 mL of placebo solution for SC administration. The placeb o solution will contain the same sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain ontamalimab. Methodology: A total of 740 subjects (296 subjects at 25 mg ontamalimab, 296 subjects at 75 mg ontamalimab, and 148 subjects on placebo) are planned for enrollment into the study. Subjects must be at least 16 years of age and no more than 80 years of age at the time of signi ng the informed consent/assent form. The study consists of a screening period up to 6 weeks and a 12-week treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments (25 mg ontamalimab, 75 mg ontamalimab, or placebo) in a 2:2:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified based upon the su bject’s status of prior anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment (naïve or experienced) and glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocorticoids at baseline versus not on glucocorticoids at base line). Subjects will receive SC injections of ontamalimab or placebo, using a PFS, on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 4), and We ek 8 (Visit 5). Subjects will undergo efficacy, safety, and health outcome assessments at these visits. Patient-reported UC signs and symptom data (including stool frequency, rectal bleeding severity and frequency, diarrhea frequency, urgency frequency, and abdominal pain worst severity) will be collected using a daily electronic diary (e-diary) during the treatment period. The Mayo scor e is a measure of UC disease activity consisting of the following 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of endoscopy, and physician global assessment (PGA). The partial Mayo score consists of the Mayo score without the endoscopic subscore s. The composite score is a recommended measure consisting of the Mayo score withou t the PGA subscore, and will be used for the primary efficacy endpoint. The Mayo scores and composite scor e will be based on subject daily e-diary entries. At the end of the 12-week treatment period, eligible subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in a double-blind maintenance study (SHP647-303; for subjects who achieve clinical response) or an LTS study (SHP647-304; for subjects who do not achi eve a clinical response). Subjects who withdraw early from the 12-week treatment period or who do not wish to enter the mainte nance study (SHP647-303) or LTS study (SHP647-304) will continue into a 16-week safety follow-up period. Only thos e subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance study or LTS study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria: Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study. 1.

Subjects with evidence of active or latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) or subjects with this history who have not completed a generally accepted fu ll course of treatment before randomization are excluded. All other subjects must have either the Mantoux (purified protein derivative [PPD]) tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) performed. Subjects who have no history of previously diagnosed active or latent TB are excluded if they have a positive Mantoux (PPD) tuberculin skin test (ie ≥5 mm induration) or a positive IGRA (the latter to be tested at the site’s local laboratory) during screening or within 12 weeks before screening. If IGRA test cannot be performed locally, a central laboratory may be used, with prior agreement from the sponsor. • An IGRA is strongly recommended for subjects with a prior Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination, but may be used for any subject. Documentation of IGRA product used and the test result must be in the subject's source documentation if performed locally. Acceptable IGRA products include QuantiFERON TB Gold Plus In-Tube Test. • If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may be repeated, and if a negative result is obtained, enrollment may proceed. In subjects with no history of tr eated active or latent TB, a positive test on repeat will exclude the subject. Subjects with a history of active or latent TB infection must follow instructions for “Subjects with a prior diagnosis of active or latent TB are excluded unless both of the following criteria are met” in this criterion. • Subjects with repeat indeterminate IGRA results, with no prior TB history, may be enrolled after consultation with a pulmonary or infectious disease specialist who determines low risk of infection (ie, subject would be acceptable for immunosuppress ant [eg, anti-TNF] treat ment without additional action). This consultation must be included in source documentation. Results from a chest x-ray, taken within the 12 weeks before or during screening (Visit 1) must show no abnormalities suggestive of active TB infection as determined by a qualified medical specialist.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy analyses will be ba sed on the FAS and subjects w ill be analyzed according to their randomized treatment, regardless of the treatment they actually received. The primary efficacy endpoint is remissi on at the Week 12 visit. Remission is defined as a composite score of patient-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy as follows: • stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change from baseline AND • rectal bleeding subscore of 0 AND • endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability). The primary efficacy endpoint will be co mpared for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75 mg ontamalimab) to the placebo group using a Cochran-Mantel Haenszel chi-square test stratified by status of prior anti-TNF treatment and glucocorticoid use at baseline (Visit 2). Subjects with missing remission data at the Week 12 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders. The en doscopy score will be based on centrally read results. The primary endpoint will be tested by the following hypothesis: H0: δ = 0 H1: δ ≠ 0 Where δ is the common treatment difference across strata, j=1 to m. The common treatment difference is a weighted average of the stratum-specific treatment differences. The global family-wise Type I error rate (FWER) for the statistic al tests of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be strongly controlled at .05 (2-sided). To control the FWER, graphical methods discu ssed in Bretz et al. (2009) will be utilized to propagate α from primary to key secondary endpoints and between the 2 ontamalimab treatment group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split equa lly at the .025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the primary endpoint (P) and alpha is propagated in a hierarchical manner to each of the 4 key secondary endpoints (K1-K4) within a pairwise treatment comparison. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: • Endoscopic remission, as defined by centrally read endosc opic subscore 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability), at the Week 12 visit. • Clinical remission, as defined by stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change from baseline in stool frequency subscore, and rectal bleeding subscore of 0, at the Week 12 visit. • Clinical response based on composite score at the Week 12 visit. Clinical response (composite) is defined as a decrease from baseline in the composite score of patient-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy of at least 2 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding ≥1 point or a subscore for rectal bleeding ≤1. • Mucosal healing based on endoscopic and histological a ssessment at the Week 12 visit. Mucosal healing is defined by centrally read endoscopic subscore 0 or 1 (modified, excludes friability) and centrally read Geboes score of ≤2. For non-commercial use only"

Subjects with missing key secondary endpoint data at the Week 12 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders. Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: • Remission, defined as a total Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy [modified, excludes friability], and physician’s gl obal assessment) exceeding 1, at the Week 12 visit. • Clinical response based on total Mayo score at the Week 12 visit. Clinical response (Mayo) is defined as a decrease from baseline in the total Ma yo score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding ≥1 point or an absolute su bscore for rectal bleeding ≤ 1. • Partial Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore >1 at the Week 4, 8, and 12 visits. The partial Mayo score does not include the endoscopy subscore. • Clinical remission as defined by stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change from baseline in stool frequency subscore, and rectal bleeding subscore of 0, at Weeks 4 and 8. • Endoscopic remission at the Week 12 visit with endoscopic subscore of 0. • Clinical remission at the Week 4, 8, and 12 visits with both rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores of 0. • Deep remission at the Week 12 visit. Deep remission is defined as both endoscopic and rectal bleeding subscores of 0, and stool frequency subscore ≤1 and a centrally read Geboes score of ≤2. • Change from baseline at the Week 12 visit in abdominal pain, diarrhea, and urgency item scores, absolute stool frequency, absolute rectal bleeding and total sign/symptom score based on subject daily e-diary entries (average of rectal bleeding, stool frequency, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and urgency). • Change from baseline in IBDQ domain and total (absolute) scores (time frame: Week 0, Week 8, up to Week 12, or early termination [ET]). • Change from baseline in SF-36, version 2, acute (physical and mental component summary scores and individual domain scores) to the Week 12/ET visit. • Incidence of all-cause hospitalizations and total inpatient days. Other secondary endpoints will be summarized by descriptive statistics and presented by treatment group. Where appropriate, other secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed with the following analysis methods. Binary endpoints will be analyzed using the same approach as described for the primary endpoint. Subjects with missing binary endpoint data at a visit will be co nsidered failures and counted as nonresponders. Continuous endpoints that are only measured at baseline and the Week 12 visit will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance model with fixed effects for treatment group (categorical), status of prior anti-TNF treatment (categorical), and glucocorticoid use at baseline (categorical ), and the baseline value as a continuous covariate. From this model, estimates of the least squares means, treatment differences, standard errors, p-values, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for least square s mean treatment differences will be provided. Continuous endpoints that are measured repeatedly over time will be analyzed using a linear repeated measures mixed model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation. The model will include fixed effects for treatment group (categorical), visit ( categorical), treatment group by visit inter action, status of prior anti-TNF treatment (categorical), and glucocorticoid use at baseline (categorical); baseline value as a continuous covariate; and repeated measures across visit for subject. From this model, estimat es of least squares means, tr eatment differences, standard errors, p-values, and 95% CIs for least squares mean treatment differences for each visit will be provided.

301,page_301,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 32 SHP647-302 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 11 Nov 2019 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing disease marked by ulcera tion and inflammation of the colonic mucosa and submucosa. Initially it usually involves the rectum but may extend proximally to involve a portion of, or the entirety of, the colon. In the early stages, hemorrhagic and erythematous tissue is obser ved, progressing to mucosal ulcera tion with purulent exudates in severe cases. The ulceration patter n is continuous and may extend th e entire length of the colon. Perforation of the bowel wall causi ng ileus and peritonitis can occur with transmural extension of the ulceration. Bloody diarrhea with or without mucus and lower a bdominal pain with periods of remission and exacerbation are the most common symptoms. The incidence of UC is estimated to be up to 24.3 cases per 100,000 persons per year in Europe and up to 19.2 cases per 100,000 persons per year in North America. No clear difference in incidence has been observed be tween men and women. Although UC can occur at any age, peak incidence has been observed in the second to fourth decades of life (Molodecky et al., 2012 ). Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong condition with a serious effect on the quality of life. Current treatment primarily consists of symptomatic management with dietary modifications and opiate antidiarrheal drugs (loperamide), as well as dise ase modifying agents such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), systemic glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine [AZA]/6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], cyclosporine), and biologic thera py with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or anti-integrin agen ts. Despite recent advances, there is still an unmet need for an effective pharmacological treatment th at will induce and maintain remission. 1.2 Product Background and Clinical Information The selectivity of lymphocyte homing to specialized lymphoid ti ssue and mucosal sites of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is influenced by the endothelial expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM). MAdCAM is a memb er of the immunoglobulin super family of cell adhesion molecules and is mostly expresse d on the cell surface of high endothelial venules of organized intestinal lymphoi d tissue such as Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes (Briskin et al., 1997 ; Shyjan et al., 1996 ; Liaskou et al., 2011 ). MAdCAM plays a role in gut immune surveillance, and also appears to faci litate excessive lymphocyte infiltration under conditions of chronic GI inflammation. The α 4β7 integrin is the recognized ligand for MAdCAM, and expression of this ligand on populations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as on subsets of B cells, distinguishes them as unique gut homing lymphocytes. Ontamalimab (previously known as PF- 00547659 and SHP647) is a fully human immunoglobulin G2 kappa (IgG 2κ) monoclonal antibody that bi nds to human MAdCAM to reduce lymphocyte homing to the gut and GI inflammation. Ontamalimab binds MAdCAM-1 with high affinity and selectivit y that prevents the binding of α4β7+ lymphocytes to MAdCAM expressing sites in the high endot helial venules of the GI tract.

In UC Study A7281009, inducti on with ontamalimab at doses of 7.5 mg, 22.5 mg, or 75 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W) resu lted in statistically significantly higher proportions of subjects in remi ssion at Week 12 based on total Mayo score (both local and central read) when compared with placebo treatment. In CD Study A7281006, induction with ontamalimab did not meet the primary endpoint; no statistically significa nt differences were observed between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm in CD Activity Index-70 response rate at Week 8 or Week 12. Post hoc analyses suggested eviden ce of drug effect in subjects with more inflammation at baseline, as indicated by higher serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) or Si mple Endoscopic Score for CD. In UC induction Study A7281009, decreases in fecal calprotectin were obs erved in all groups, including placebo; however, there were no statistical ly significant differences in the decrease in fecal calprotectin between any dose level of ontamalimab and placebo. Decreases in high-sensitivity (hs)CRP were al so observed in all 4 treatment groups; however, other than the 75 mg dose group at Week 12, no statistically sign ificant differences were observed in active treatment versus placebo. In the induction Study A7281006 in subj ects with CD, compared to placebo, nominally statistically significant decreases in fecal calprotectin were observed in the 75 mg group at Week 8 and in the 22.5 mg and 75 mg groups at Week 12. Generally, decreases from baseline in hsCRP were observed in all 4 treatment groups over the 12-week induction period. Compared to placebo, nominally statisti cally significant decreases in hsCRP were observed in all 3 active treatment groups (22.5 mg, 75 mg, and 225 mg) at Week 12. There was no evidence of a dose response for either of these parameters. A nominally statistically significant increase was observed in circulating β7 + central memory T lymphocytes at Weeks 8 and 12, consistent with the pr edicted mechanism of action. The most common serious adverse events (SAEs) across all studies were CD and UC. In Study A7281006, the randomized, placebo-controlled induction study in CD, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were most commonly re ported within the GI disorders system organ class (SOC) followed by the infections and infe stations SOC. The most common all-causality TEAEs were CD (worsening and progression of underlying disease) , followed by pyrexia, headache, and arthralgia, all of which had si milar incidences in the placebo treatment group compared with the active treatment groups. In Study A7281009, the randomized, placebo-controlled induction study in UC, TEAEs were most commonly reported within the GI disorders SOC followed by the infections and in festations SOC. The most common all-causality TEAE was headache, followed by abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, UC (worsening and progression of underlying disease) , and nausea, all with similar incidence between placebo- and drug-treated subjects. The long-term, open-label safety studie s (Studies A7281007 and A7281010) were not placebo-controlled, but permitted exposure to the investigational product at doses of 75 mg or 225 mg Q4W for 18 and 36 mont hs, respectively.

In Study A7281010, the most common all-ca usality TEAEs were UC (worsening or progression), arthralgia , and nasopharyngitis. Ontamalimab appears to be generally well tolerate d, with the majority of TEAEs distributed at similar frequencies among treatment arms with only peripheral edema, gastroenteritis, and arthralgia more frequently reported in ontamalim ab- than placebo-treated subjects in the pooled induction studies. In the placebo-controlled induction studies, nasopharyngitis was not reported more frequently in ontamalimab- than placebo-treated subjects, but occurred at relatively high frequency during long-term safety studies. Ontamalimab does not appear to be associated with impaired central nervous system (CNS) immune surveillance. No case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or myocarditis has b een reported. Ontamalimab, in doses of 7.5 mg, 22.5 mg, and 75 mg, appears to increas e the rate of remission in s ubjects with UC, and may have an effect in patients with CD who have greate r evidence of inflammation based on biomarker or endoscopic data.

Ontamalimab prevents the binding of α4β7+ lymphocytes to MAdCAM-expressing sites with high affinity and selectivity. Principal sites of MAdCAM expression on normal tissue include intestine, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, spleen, and to a lesser extent lung, liver, and bladder but not the CNS (Steffen et al., 1996 ). Although selective targeting of the MAdCAM receptors is a novel approach, the basic interference of lymphocyte homing by preventing the binding of these α4β7+ lymphocytes to the MAdCAM receptor and the resultant e fficacy in UC is well established ( Feagan et al., 2013 ). Ontamalimab is differentiated from other molecules used for the treatment of UC in that it blocks the interaction of α 4β7+ lymphocytes to the MAdCAM receptor by selectively binding to MAdCAM in the gut (and related tissues) wherea s other molecules only target the integrins on the infiltrating lymphocytes. Additionally, onta malimab does not bind to the vascular cell adhesion molecule; therefore, ontamalimab is not expected to be an effective treatment for multiple sclerosis, or affect lymphocyte homing or surveillance in the CNS. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab in inducing remission in subjects with moderate to severe UC. Ontamalimab has been investigated in subjects with moderate to severe UC in 3 completed studies: 2 dose-finding studies (A7281001 and A7281009) and an open-label, long-term safety extension (LTS) study (A7281010), which was ongoing at the time of the original protocol and has since completed. Phase 1 Study A 7281001 evaluated both single (0.03–10.0 mg/kg intravenous [IV]; 3.0 mg/kg subcutaneous [SC] ) and multiple doses (0.1–3.0 mg/kg IV; 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg SC) of ontamalimab in subjects with UC . Safety evaluation revealed a safety profile for ontamalimab similar to that of placebo, with no pattern of adverse ev ents (AEs) suggestive of increased risk of opportunistic in fections or CNS effects, and no evidence of adverse effects on laboratory parameters, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, or neurological function. Events leading to withdrawal were due to exacerbations of the underlying UC. Study A7281009 was a Phase 2b proof-of-concept (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, dose-ranging) study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK of ontamalimab in subjects with moderate to severe UC. Treatment was assigned in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to dose levels of 7.5, 22.5, 75, or 225 mg ontamalimab or placebo administered SC Q4W at Weeks 0, 4, and 8. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 12, with re mission defined as a total Mayo score of ≤2 with no individual subscore >1 (see Appendix 2 for details of the Mayo scor e). More subjects were in clinical remission at Week 12 in the ontamalimab-t reated groups than in the placebo group, with statistical significance achieved for the 7.5, 22.5, and 75 mg doses ( Vermeire et al., 2017 ). Based upon the total Mayo score with a ce ntrally read endoscopic severi ty component, th e increase in clinical remission rates over placebo at Week 12 for the 7.5, 22.5, and 75 mg doses were 8.0% (p=.043), 12.8% (p=.010), and 11.8% (p=.012), respect ively. When the clinical remission rate at Week 12 was analyzed by stratu m of previous anti-TNF exposur e (experienced or naïve), a For non-commercial use only"
305,page_305,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 36 SHP647-302 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 11 Nov 2019 similar trend was observed across dose levels in both the anti-TNF experienced and anti-TNF naïve subjects. There was no evidence of an adverse safety signal, and there was no increase in the frequency of infections in MAdCAM-bearing tissues as evidenced by similar rates of nasopharyngitis among treatment arms. Based on the efficacy and safety data in Study A7281009 and the systemic population PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling and simulation, clinical remission, c linical response and mucosal healing rates were highe r in subjects with UC recei ving doses of 22.5 and 75 mg Q4W than in those receiving doses of 7.5 mg and 225 mg Q4W. The induction responses were not demonstrated either at Week 4 or Week 8, but were observed at Week 12 regardless of dose level. No difference in the clinical responses between a 22.5 mg dose and a 25 mg dose is expected based on the current understanding of th e mode of action of ont amalimab and clinical observations to date. To better understand the exposure (dose)-response relationship in this population and understand individual patient expo sure needs, the 25 and 75 mg doses (Q4W) will be tested in the Phase 3 program. Therefore, SC doses of 25 mg or 75 mg of ontamalimab or placebo on Day 1 (Week 0), Week 4, and Week 8 are recommended for the 2 planned Phase 3 studies SHP647-301 and SHP647-302. The Phase 1 study, A7281001, which investigated the safety, tolerance, PK, and PD properties of ont amalimab, supports further clinical development of ontamalimab using SC administration. 2.2 Study Objectives 2.2.1 Primary Objective The primary objective of the study is to evalua te the efficacy of ontamalimab in inducing remission, based on composite score of patient-re ported symptoms and centrally read endoscopy, in subjects with moderate to severe UC. 2.2.2 Secondary Objectives 2.2.2.1 Key Secondary Objectives The key secondary objectives are as follows: • To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab in achieving endoscopic remission, based on centrally read endoscopy • To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab in achieving clinical remission, based on composite score of patient-reported symptoms • To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab in inducing clinical response, based on composite score of patient-reported symptoms and centrally read endoscopy • To evaluate the efficacy of ontamalimab in achieving mucosal healing, based on a centrally read endoscopic and histological assessment us ing the Geboes Score grading system.

A total of 740 subjects (296 subjects at 25 mg ontamalimab, 296 subjects at 75 mg ontamalimab, and 148 subjects on placebo) are pla nned for enrollment into the study ( Figure 1 ). Subjects must be at least 16 years of age and no more than 80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent/assent form. The study consists of a screeni ng period up to 6 weeks and a 12-we ek treatment period. After the screening period, eligible subjects will be randomly assigne d to receive 1 of 3 treatments (25 mg ontamalimab, 75 mg ontamalimab, or placebo) in a 2:2:1 ratio. Randomiza tion will be stratified based upon the subject’s status of prior anti- TNF treatment (naïve or experienced) and glucocorticoid use at baseline (on glucocorticoids at baseline vers us not on glucocorticoids at baseline). Subjects will receive SC injections of ontamalimab or placebo, using a prefilled syringe (PFS), on Week 0/Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 4), and Week 8 (Visit 5). Subjects will undergo efficacy, safety, and health outcome assessments at these visits as detailed in Table 1 . At the end of the 12-week treatment period, elig ible subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in a double-blind maintenance study (S HP647-303; for subjects who achieve clinical response) or an LTS study (SHP647-304; for subjects who do not achieve a clinical response) as shown in Figure 1 . Subjects who withdraw early from th e 12-week treatment period or who do not wish to enter the maintenance st udy (SHP647-303) or LTS study (SHP647-304) will continue into a 16-week safety follow-up period. Only those subjects who complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the i nduction studies (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance study or LTS study.

Over the past decade, health authority thinking regarding efficacy endpoints for UC has evolved such that the tr aditional Mayo score is no longer recommended. Current regulatory guidance (Food and Drug Admini stration [FDA] Ulcerativ e Colitis: Clinical Trial Endpoints Guidance for Industry [Draft], 2016; European Me dicines Agency [EMA] Guideline on the Development of New Medici nal Products for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis [Draft], 2016) includes a dual measuremen t of patient-reported signs and symptoms outcomes (stool frequency and rectal bleeding), and clinicia n-reported endoscopic outcomes (scoring any endoscopy with evidence of friabi lity as a 2), including histology. Per agreement with health authorities, these 3 outcomes will be reported as a composite score. Data will be collected to calculate the total Ma yo score using both the traditional and modified endoscopy subscore as a sensitiv ity analysis and to estimate the impact of the modification on the primary endpoint. The clinical relevance of the traditional Mayo sc ore is supported by its correlation with significant improvement in di sease-specific HRQL as measured by the IBDQ and in generic HRQL as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire.

310,page_310,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 41 SHP647-302 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 11 Nov 2019 3.1.2 Rationale for Key Secondary Endpoints: The first 2 key secondary endpoi nts are included to comply with EMA advice. The EMA would agree to the composite primary endpoint only if supported by a key secondary analysis, where the patient-reported symptoms and clinician-repo rted endoscopy are analy zed as “co-primary”. The clinical response endpoint is based on the new composite score, and also represents 1 of the entry criteria for the maintenance study. This endpoint has not been previously tested. Mucosal healing as a key sec ondary endpoint comprises both endoscopic and histologic components as recommended in the draft F DA and EMA guidance on UC (FDA Ulcerative Colitis: Clinical Trial Endpoints Guidance for Industry [Draft], 2016; EMA Guideline on the Development of New Medicinal Products for th e Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis [Draft], 2016). The Geboes Score (see Appendix 2) will be used to evaluate histologic remission and to complement the endoscopic subscore in the assess ment of mucosal healing for the key secondary endpoint. 3.2 Duration and Study Completion Definition Each subject’s final visit in th is study may be at the end of the treatment period (Week 12) if continuing to Study SHP647-303 or SHP647-304, or at the end of the safety follow-up period (Week 28) if not continuing to either of these stud ies. In either case, the final visit will be in person at the site. A subject’s maximum duration of particip ation is expected to be approximately 34 weeks: a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a treatment period of 12 weeks, and a safety follow-up period of 16 weeks (if applicable). It is expected that the study will be completed in approximately 3 years. The Study Completion Date is defined as the date the final subject, acro ss all sites, completes their final protocol-defined assessment. Please note that this includes the follow-up visit or contact, whichever is later. The Study Comple tion Date is used to ascertain timing for study results posting and reporting. 3.3 Sites and Regions It is anticipated that the study will be conducted in at least 18 countries .

The relevance of this findi ng to humans is unknown but cannot be excluded. Based on the exposure in the Phase 2 clinical study A7281009 (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] from 0 to 672 hours [AUC 0-672h ] at 6140 µg ∙h/mL following repeated SC administration of 75 mg SHP647 Q4W), matern al exposure (AUC) in cynomolgus monkeys within a similar duration at 30 and 60 mg/kg on ce every 10 days is approximately 77 times and 172 times the clinical ex posure, respectively. To minimize the risk of unintentional exposure of the embryo or fetus in the clinical study, all sexually active male and female subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are biologically capable of having children and with their partners are at risk of pregnancy, must agree to use an appropriate form of contracep tion (ie, highly effective methods for female and medically appropriate methods for male study subj ects), in accordance with the package instructions/leaflet, for the durat ion of the active treatment period and for at least 16 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. True abstinence is considered to be a highly effective contraception (ie, a method that results in a failure rate of <1% per year) when it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovul ation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to investigational product, and withdrawal are not appropriate methods of contraception. During the screening visit, the investigator or designee in consultation with the subject will confirm the subject’s childbearing potential status. For subjects of childbearing potential, it must be confirmed and documented that the subject has selected the most appropriate method of contraception (ie, highly effective methods for female and medically appropriate methods for male study subjects) from the permitted list of contraception methods. Subjects must affirm the consistent and correct use of at least 1 of th ese selected methods. Regular contraception check discussions will take place at the time points specified in Table 1 (ie, at each site visit) and will be documented. In addition, the subject must be instructed to call the site immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinue d or if pregnancy is known or suspected. 4.4.1 Contraceptive Methods for Female Study Subjects Sexually active females of childbearing potential must already be usi ng an established highly effective form of contraception, and must be advised to use appropriate contraceptives throughout the study period and for 16 weeks followi ng the last dose of i nvestigational product. If hormonal contraceptives are used they should be administered according to the package insert. Contraception methods with low user dependency should preferably be used, in particular when contraception is introduced as a result of partic ipation in the clinical study. The following highly effective contraceptive methods are considered to be methods with low user dependency: • Intrauterine device • Intrauterine hormone-releasing system • Bilateral tubal occlusion For non-commercial use only"

Female subjects should be in one of the following categories: • Postmenopausal (12 consecutive months of spontaneous amenorrhea and ≥51 years of age); postmenopausal status should be conf irmed by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) testing. • Surgically sterile (having undergone one of the following surgical acts: hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral sa lpingectomy) and at least 6 weeks poststerilization or has me dically confirmed ovarian failure. • Females of childbearing potential with a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening and a negative urin e pregnancy test result at ba seline (Visit 2). Females of childbearing potential must agree to practice true abstinence (refrain from sexual activity that could result in pregnancy) or agree to use appropriate methods of highly effective contraception. Highly effective contraception (ie, methods that result in a failur e rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly) are: • Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraceptives associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) stabilized for at least 30 days before the screening visit (Visit 1) • Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associ ated with inhibition of ovulation plus a barrier method • Intrauterine device • Intrauterine hormone-releasing system • Bilateral tubal occlusion • Male sterilization/vasectomized partner with documented absence of sperm in the postvasectomy ejaculate • True abstinence (see Section 4.4). 4.4.2 Contraceptive Methods for Male Study Subjects Contraception is required for all sexually active male subjects, who with their female sexual partners, must agree to use one of the followi ng appropriate methods of contraception throughout the study period and for 16 weeks following th e last dose of inve stigational product.

Appropriate methods for female se xual partners of male subjects are (unless the female sexual partner is sterile [surgically or documented nonsurgical sterility]): • Use of a highly effective method of contraception listed in Section 4.4.1 OR an acceptable method of contraception (f ailure rate of >1% per year) o Female condom with spermicide (use by female sexual partner); however, if spermicide is not available in the country, additional contraception (ie, one of those listed below) must be used in addition to a female condom o Intrauterine device with spermicide o Contraceptive sponge with spermicide o Intravaginal system (eg, vaginal ring with spermicide, a diaphragm with spermicide, or a cervical cap with spermicide). 4.5 Withdrawal of Subjects A subject may withdraw from the study at a ny time for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the physic ian or at the institution. The investigator or sponsor may withdraw the subject at any time (eg, in the inte rest of subject safety). The investigator is encouraged to discuss withdraw al of a subject from investig ational product with the medical monitor when possible. If investigational product is discontinued, regardless of the reason, the evaluations listed for Week 12/early termination (ET; Visit 6) are to be performed. All subjects who discontinue treatment with investigational product should also undergo the protocol-specified 16-week safety follow-up period. In the event that subjects are unable to attend in person for the follow-up visits, all efforts should be made to collect info rmation on AEs and concomitant medications. Comments (spontaneous or elicited) or complain ts made by the subject must be recorded. The reason for termination and date of stopping investigational product must be recorded. Subjects who discontinue will not be replaced. 4.5.1 Subject Withdrawal Criteria Additional reasons a subject may be withdrawn from study treatment include but are not limited to: • Adverse events • Serious AEs • Pregnancy • Protocol deviations For non-commercial use only"

Use of biologics for indications other than UC during the 90 days before screening must also be recorded. Prior and concomitant UC-specific treatments from the previous 10 years will be recorded. The subject’s entire history of biologic UC-specific treatments will be recorded. Subjects must have had an inadequate response to, or lost response to, or ha d an intolerance to at least 1 conventional treatment such as su lfasalazine or 5-ASA, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX) , or anti-TNF agents. Please see Appendix 4 for guidance on defining prior treatment failure a nd intolerance to prior treatment for UC. 5.2 Concomitant Treatment Concomitant treatment refers to all treatment taken between the dates of the first dose of investigational product and the end of the safety follow-up period, inclusive. 5.2.1 Permitted Treatment Subjects must remain on stable doses of permitted UC treatments until completion of the Week 12 visit, unless decreases are required b ecause of AEs. Stable doses of the following treatments for UC are permitted as concomitant medication: • Oral 5-ASA or sulfasalazine, pr oviding that the dose is stable for at least 2 weeks before baseline (Visit 2) • Immunosuppressants (AZA, 6-MP, or MTX), provid ing that the dose is stable for at least 8 weeks before baseline (Visit 2) • Oral glucocorticoids (predni sone or equivalent [see Appendix 3] up to a maximum of 20 mg/day or oral budesonide up to a maximu m of 9 mg/day or or al beclomethasone up to a maximum of 5 mg/day), providing that the dose is stable for at least 2 weeks before screening endoscopic procedure.

Each PFS contains 1 mL of ontamalimab solution for injection at an appropria te concentration to provide the intended dose of drug (25 or 75 mg). Additional information is provided in the current ontamalimab IB. The reference product is placebo, which will be pr ovided in a PFS with a fixed needle containing 1 mL of placebo solution for SC administrati on. The placebo solution will contain the same sterile aqueous buffered solution as the test product but will not contain ontamalimab. 6.1.1 Blinding the Treatment Assignment The placebo syringes and solution will match the ontamalimab syringes in appearance. The fill volume for all syringes will be the same. 6.2 Administration of In vestigational Product 6.2.1 Interactive Response Technology for Investigational Product Management An interactive response technology (IRT) system will be used for screening and enrolling subjects, recording subject visits, randomizati on, investigational product supply dispensation and management, inventory management and supply ordering, investigatio nal product expiration tracking and management, and emergency unblin ding. Please refer to the Study Manual for additional details regarding the IRT system. 6.2.2 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The actual treatment given to individual subjects is determined by a randomization schedule. The total Mayo score will be calculated at base line (Visit 2) before randomization. Endoscopic subscore based on the central reader’s assessment will be used to determine eligibility. Subjects with a total Mayo score of ≥ 6, including a centrally read endoscopic subscore ≥ 2, rectal bleeding subscore ≥1, and stool frequency subscore ≥1, and who fulfill all other eligibility criteria, will be randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 via a computer-g enerated randomization sc hedule to receive SC injections of 25 mg ontamalimab, 75 mg ontamalimab, or placebo, respectively. The randomization will be performed centrally and st ratified by status of prior anti-TNF therapy (2 strata: naïve versus experienced) and gluc ocorticoid use at baseline (2 strata: on glucocorticoids at baseline versus no t on glucocorticoids at baseline). To ensure that the allocation of subjects with prior anti-TNF therapy exposure is similar to that observed in Study A7281009, the percentage of subj ects with prior anti-T NF therapy exposure will be capped at 60% of the sample populati on. Additionally, in Japan only, enrollment of Japanese subjects with prior an ti-TNF therapy exposure will be capped at 60%, to ensure comparability to the rest of the global study popul ation. There will be no cap on the number of anti-TNF naïve subjects randomized. For non-commercial use only"
325,page_325,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 56 SHP647-302 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 11 Nov 2019 Subject numbers are assigned to all eligible subjec ts as they consent to take part in the study. Within each site (numbered uniquely within a pr otocol), the subject number will be assigned to subjects according to the sequence of presentation for study participation. The randomization number represents a unique nu mber corresponding to i nvestigational product allocated to the subject, once elig ibility has been determined. Individual subject treatment will be automatically assigned by the IRT system. Investigational product packag ing identification numbers, separate from randomization numbers/unique identifiers, may also be assigned to subjects for specific treatment assignment as dictated by the study. In these cases, the same investigational product packing identification number may not be assigned to more than 1 subject. 6.2.3 Dosing Investigational product (ontamalimab or placeb o) will be administered subcutaneously by qualified site personnel Q4W (W eeks 0, 4, and 8). See Section 7.2 for the timing of dosing relative to other procedures. Investigational product shoul d be administered in the anterolate ral right or left thigh. If there are clinical reasons why the inve stigational product ca nnot be administered in the thigh, the investigational product ma y be administered in the deltoid area or abdomen with appropriate documentation. The location of the investigatio nal product administration will be recorded. After the first administration of investigati onal product, the subject must be observed by a member of the study staff for at least 30 minutes (the total duration should be determined at the discretion of the investigator). For subsequent administrations, obser vation of the subject is at the discretion of the investigator. In jection site and allergic reactio n monitoring should be completed by a member of the study staff. Investigator-directed delays in dosing due to abnormal laboratory findings or AEs should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the subject shou ld continue with the treatment. Only those subjects w ho complete the full course of investigational product treatment in the induction studies (SHP647-301 or SHP647-302) will be eligible to continue in the maintenance study or LTS study. The investigator, or an appr oved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all investigational product is dispen sed by qualified staff members. 6.2.4 Unblinding the Treatment Assignment Whenever possible, the investigat or or subinvestigator should c ontact the Shire physician and/or assigned medical monitor before breaking the b lind. It is understood that in an emergency situation it may not be possible to communicate with the study team before breaking the blind. The safety of the subject should be of primary concern. When the blinding code is broken the reasons must be fully documented. For non-commercial use only"

Upon breaking the blind, the subject is withdrawn from the study, but should be followed up for safety purposes. The IRT will notify the relevant personnel in the event of any code break. Code-break informati on is held by the pharmacist/designated person at the site. 6.3 Labeling, Packaging, Storage, and Handling 6.3.1 Labeling The sponsor will provide the investigator with packaged investigati onal product labeled in accordance with specific country regulatory requirements. All investigational prod uct is labeled with a minimum of the following: protocol number, medication identification number, dosage form (including product name and quantity in pa ck), directions for use, storage conditions, expiry date (if applicable), batch number and/or p ackaging reference, the statements “For clinical trial use only” and/or “CAUTION: New Dr ug – Limited by Federal (or US) Law to Investigational Use”, and the sponsor’s name and address. Additional labels may be applied in order to m eet local or institutional requirements, but must not: • Contradict the clinical study label • Obscure the clinical study label • Identify the study subject by name. Additional labels may not be added without the sponsor’s prior written agreement. 6.3.2 Packaging Investigational product is packaged in the follo wing labeled containers: PFS with nominal fill volume of 1 mL. The PFS will be packaged in a labeled carton. Changes to sponsor-supplied packaging before dosing may not occur without prior written agreement by the sponsor. 6.3.3 Storage The investigator has overall res ponsibility for ensuring that inves tigational product is stored in a secure, limited-access location.

Such a device (ie, cert ified minimum/maximum thermometer) would require manual resetting upon each recording. The sponsor must be notified immediately upon discovery of any excursion from the established range. Temperature excursions will require site investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the inve stigational product and wi ll provide supportive documentation as necessary. Under no circumstances should the product be di spensed to subjects until the impact has been determined and the product is deemed appropriate for use by the sponsor. The sponsor should be notified immediately if ther e are any changes to th e storage area of the investigational product that coul d affect the integrity of the product(s), eg, fumigation of a storage room. 6.3.4 Special Handling The investigational product should be protected from light and should not be frozen. Do not shake. 6.4 Drug Accountability Investigators will be provided with sufficient am ounts of the investigatio nal product to carry out this protocol for the agreed number of subjects.

Each subject or subject’ s parent or legally author ized representative must participate in the informed consent process and provide written informed consent/assent before any assessments or procedures specified in the protocol are performed. Screening assessments may take place over more than 1 day (at least 2 vis its will be necessary to complete the screening procedures, including endoscopy). A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent or assent, as applicable (and whose parents or legally authorized repr esentatives have given informed c onsent, as applicable), failed to meet the inclusion criteria a nd/or met at least 1 of the excl usion criteria, and has not been randomized or administered investigationa l product. A subject may be rescreened if their condition ha s changed and they may potentially be eligible. Subjects may be rescreened 1 time. Note: Screen ing laboratory tests, if considered by the investigator to be transient and inconsistent with the subject’s clinical condition, may be repeated once during the screening period for confirmation. Results of repeated tests must be reviewed for eligibility prior to the sc reening endoscopy procedure. Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (if preferred) must be performed on all subjects after the majority of other eligibility criteria (eg, laboratory values ) are met. Endoscopy must be performed during the screening period within 10 days before baseli ne (Visit 2), preferably within 5 to 7 days before the baseline visit, to obtain the centrally read endoscopic subscore (see Section 7.2.2.1). Biopsy samples will be collected for histological evaluation using the Geboes Score classification and . Subjects at risk of colorectal cancer, as defined in exclusion criterion 5 (see Section 4.2 ), must have a colonoscopy performed at screening, unless the subject has had a survei llance colonoscopy performe d within 1 year prior to screening, and any adenomatous polyps f ound at that examination have been excised. Colonoscopy report and pathology report (if biopsies are obtai ned) from the colonoscopy performed during screening or in the prior year conf irming no presence of dysplasia and colon cancer must be available in the source documents.

330,page_330,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 61 SHP647-302 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 11 Nov 2019 If a subject has had the following procedures perform ed as a part of standard medical care within 12 weeks before screening visit (Visit 1), these procedures do not need to be repeated as a part of screening: • Chest x-ray • Documented negative PPD test or IGRA for TB. 7.1.1.2 Baseline Visit (Visit 2; Week 0) The baseline visit will take pl ace on Day 1 (Week 0). The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1 will be performed. After eligibility has been reconfirmed and all baseline procedures and assessments have been completed, each subject will be randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment groups as described in Section 6.2.2 and the first dose of investigational product will be administered. Results of the baseline laboratory tests are not required for inve stigational product administration but must be reviewed as soon as possible thereafter. 7.1.2 Treatment Period 7.1.2.1 Visit 3 (Week 2) Visit 3 is scheduled to take place on Day 14 ±3 days (Week 2). The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1 will be performed. 7.1.2.2 Visits 4 and 5 (Weeks 4 and 8) Visits 4 and 5 are scheduled to take place on Day 28 ±3 days (Week 4) and Day 56 ±3 days (Week 8), respectively. The assessmen ts and procedures specified in Table 1 will be performed. 7.1.2.3 Final On-treatment Visits: Visit 6, Parts 1 and 2 (Week 12/Early Termination) The Week 12/ET visit (Visit 6) consists of 2 parts. Part 1 of Visit 6 must be completed within 10 days (preferably, within 5 to 7 days) before Part 2; this will allow sufficient time for data from the cen trally read endoscopy to be available at Part 2 of the visit. The Week 12/ET assessments and procedures that will take pl ace during Part 1 are specified in Table 1 . Part 2 of Visit 6 will take place on Day 84 ±3 days. The Week 12/ET assessments and procedures that will take place during Part 2 are specified in Table 1 . At Part 2 of Visit 6, after review of the Mayo score, health outcome assessments, and safety assessments, it will be determined whether the subject should enter the safety follow-up period of this study or enroll in the maintenance (SHP647-303) or LTS (SHP647-304) studies. Entry into the maintenance or LTS studies is depende nt upon the subject’s response and whether the subject agrees to participate. For non-commercial use only"

During the safety follow-up period, the Week 20 visit (Visit 7) will take place on Day 140 ±7 days or 8 weeks ±7 days after the su bject’s last visit in the treatment period for subjects who are withdr awn early from the study. This visit will routinely be conducted by telephone; however, as an exception the visit can be performed as a study site visit if preferred. At the end of the safety follow-up period, there will be a visit at the site on Day 196 ±7 days, or 16 weeks ±7 days after the subject’s last visi t in the treatment period for subjects who are withdrawn early from the study, which will form the Week 28 visit (Visit 8). The assessments and procedures specified in Table 1 will be performed, including querying for SAEs, AEs, and concomitant medications and procedures. All AEs a nd SAEs that are not resolved at the time of this visit will be followed to closure (see Section 8.1). Subjects who are proceeding to the maintenance or LTS studies will not enter the safety follow-up period. 7.1.4 Additional Care of Subj ects After the Study No aftercare is planned for this study. 7.2 Study Evaluations and Procedures Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol-required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is antici pated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside the control of the investigator, which may make it unfeasible to perform the tests and procedures. In these cases, the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the subject. When timing of procedures and assessments co incide, the following order should be followed: • Health outcome and patien t-reported questionnaires • Vital signs and ECG • Laboratory sample collection • Endoscopy (generally performed at a separate visit; see Section 7.2.2.1). • Investigational pr oduct administration. Note: Blood and tissue samples may be stor ed for up to the duration allowed by local regulations, but for no lo nger than 25 years. For non-commercial use only"

Each subject’s stool frequency before symptoms of UC started or during remission will be recorded at the screening visit. The refe rence/normal stool frequency questions in Appendix 2 will be asked and the responses documented. 7.2.2 Efficacy The primary efficacy endpoint is remission at th e Week 12 visit. Remission is defined as a composite score of patient-reported symptoms us ing a daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy as described in Section 9.8.1. 7.2.2.1 Endoscopy and Histology Endoscopy will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1 and will consist of either flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (if preferred). If it is necessary, bowel prepara tion should be conducted as per local routine. The position of the endoscope will be based on the length of the instrument at various levels of insertion as well as the morphological features of the intestine as seen during endoscopy at baseline. The endoscopy report and any photographs and/or video recordings taken during the proce dure per local custom should be filed in the subject’s medical record. During endoscopy, 2 biopsy samples will be collected from the most inflamed area of the sigmoid colon at screening and Week 12/ET. Endoscopy and biopsy procedur es will be defined in an endoscopy instructions manual and/or refere nce card(s), on which all sites will be trained. Endoscopy results will be reviewed by a central reader. Biopsy samples will be centrally reviewed using the Geboes Sc ore classification system and (see Appendix 2) for the evaluation of histological disease severity in UC with higher numbers corresponding to more inflammation. The Geboes score will be used for the key secondary efficacy eval uation and . Subjects at risk for colorectal cancer (see exclusion criterion number 5) must have a colonoscopy performed during the screening peri od with results available within 10 days before the baseline visit (Visit 2), unless the subj ect has had a surveillance colono scopy performed within 1 year prior to screening, and any adenomatous polyps found at that examination have been excised.

333,page_333,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 SHP647-302 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 11 Nov 2019 7.2.2.2 Mayo Score The Mayo score is a measure of UC disease activ ity. Mayo scores (total or partial) will be recorded at the time points specified in Table 1 . The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 points and consists of the following 4 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease (see Appendix 2): • Stool frequency (0-3) • Rectal bleeding (0-3) • Findings of endoscopy (0-3) • Physician global assessment (PGA; 0-3). The partial Mayo score consists of the Mayo sc ore without the endoscopi c subscores and ranges from 0 to 9 points. The composite score is a recommended measure consisting of the Mayo score without the PGA subscore and ranges from 0 to 9 points. The composite score will be used for the primary efficacy endpoint. Calculation of the tota l and partial Mayo scores and composite score requires a self-assessment by the subject for stool frequency and the amount of blood in the stool. These data on stool frequency and rectal bleeding will be captured in the patient-reported outcome (PRO)-UC daily e-diary (see Section 7.2.2.3). The Mayo stool frequency and re ctal bleeding subscores will be calculated based on each subject’s daily e-diary data reco rded over the most recent 3 da ys (consecutive or nonconsecutive) of the last 10 days prior to the visit excludi ng the following days: day of any bowel preparation, day of endoscopy, any days between day of bow el preparation and day of endoscopy, and the 2 days after the day of endoscopy. The mucosal appearance during the sigmoidoscopic portion of the endoscopic examination will be assessed for the Mayo endoscopic subscore based on the scoring system provided in the protocol (see Appendix 2). The endoscopic appearance will be read by a central reader through video recorded during the procedure. Centrally read endoscopic subscores will be used for both eligibility and efficacy analyses. The PGA acknowledges the 3 other criteria: the subject’s recollec tion of abdominal discomfort and general sense of well-being and other obs ervations (such as phys ical findings and the subject’s performance status). The endoscopic s ubscore and the PGA must be performed by a physician qualified to perform endoscopy, and it is recommended that the same physician performs all such assessments for a pa rticular subject th roughout the study.

Collection of the dail y e-diary data must begin at least 10 days before the baseline visit (Visit 2). Subjects w ill enter data on UC signs and symptoms items using an electronic handheld device that will be provided to subjects at the start of the study. Compliance is assessed by site staff at each visit. The site staff will instruct the subject on the appropriate use of the e-diary, particularly when compliance is below 80% (eg, <23 out of 28 e-diary entries) when compared with the previous visit. Subjects will be asked to record the following signs and symptom data, as experienced over the previous 24 hours, in the e-diary: • Stool frequency • Rectal bleeding severity and frequency • Diarrhea frequency • Urgency frequency • Abdominal pain worst severity. The full PRO-UC e-diary consists of 6 items. Th e first 2 items (stool frequency and rectal bleeding severity) will be used to determin e the Mayo stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores, which will be used to calculate th e total and partial Mayo sc ores and the composite score.

Given these differences, no attempt will be made to reconcile any apparent discrepancies between observed or volunteered AEs and data from neurological assessment collect ed from subjects. Investigators may determine if any finding on neurological testing constitute s an AE. Adverse event incidence rates will not be calculated from these neurological evaluati on data but rather from the AE information recorded by the investigator. 7.2.3.4 Adverse Event Collection At each study visit, subjects will be questione d in a general way to ascertain if AEs have occurred since the previous visit (eg, “Have you had any health problems since your last visit?”). Adverse events are collected from the time inform ed consent and/or assent is signed until the end of the defined follow-up period stated in Section 7.1.3.

Additional collection times or changes to collection times will be permitted, as necessary to ensure appropriate collection of safety data. Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature. Vital signs should be recorded before laboratory blood collection and endos copic procedures are performed. Single measurements of sitting blood pressure will be recorded at each time point. Blood pressure should be determined by cuff with the subject’s arm supported at the level of the heart and recorded to the nearest mmHg using the same method, the same arm (preferably the dominant arm), and the same position throughout the study.

An AE can therefore be any unfavor able and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempora lly associated with th e use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whethe r or not related to the medici nal (investigational) product (International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] Guidance E2A 1995). All AEs are collected from the tim e the informed consent and/or assent is signed until the end of the defined follow-up period stated in Section 7.1.3. This includes events occurring during the screening phase of the study, regardless of whether or not investigational product is administered. Where possible, a diagnosis rather th an a list of symptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each symptom should be listed individually. All AEs should be captured in the subject’s sour ce document. In addition to unto ward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational produc t indication should also be captured in the subject’s source document. All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achie ved (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsen ing of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented. 8.1.1 Severity Categorization The severity of AEs must be re corded during the course of the event including the start and stop dates for each change in severity. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new event. Worsening of pretreatment events, after initia tion of investigational product, must be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dyspepsia before dosing of investigational product, but the dyspepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administ ered, a new AE of severe dyspepsia [with the appropriate date of onset] is recorded in the subject’s source document). The medical assessment of severity is determined by using the following definitions: Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not gene rally interfere with us ual activities of daily living. Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therap eutic intervention. The event interferes with usual act ivities of daily livi ng, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. For non-commercial use only"
345,page_345,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 76 SHP647-302 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 11 Nov 2019 Severe: A type of AE that interrupt s usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 8.1.2 Relationship Categorization A physician/investigator must make the assessmen t of relationship to in vestigational product for each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the ev ent may have been caused by th e investigational product. If there is no valid reason for suggest ing a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related.” Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undeterm ined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause-and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.” The causality assessment must be documented in the source document. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition Related The temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other ther apies, or accident. Not Related The event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event. 8.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest will be cap tured and monitored during this study. Investigators will report all AESIs to the sponsor, regardle ss of causality, using the same timelines as described for SAE reporting (see Section 8.2.2). The following describe the AESIs and the criteria for reporting AESIs. 8.1.3.1 Hypersensitivity Potential hypersensitivity, serum sickness, vascu litis, and Arthus reactions to ontamalimab will be regarded as AESIs. These events must be reported on Shire “Clinical Study SAE and Nonserious AE as Required by the Protocol Fo rm” and within the time frame mandated for SAEs (see Section 8.2.2 ). It is well known that the administration of foreign proteins can cause immune responses including hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis and serum sickness. Other immune responses to foreign proteins include the development of ADAs and NAbs. Monoclonal antibodies have been used in hum an therapeutics since the 1980s. The first monoclonal antibody approved for human use (O RTHOCLONE OKT3®), was a murine protein which caused rapid production of NAbs. Since then, much effort has been expended to reduce the immunogenicity of these useful therapeutic proteins by reducing the extent of “foreignness” from chimeric antibodies such as infliximab, to humanized antibodies such as vedolizumab, and For non-commercial use only"

Figure 4 Potential Immunogenicity of Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies Ontamalimab is a fully human antibody of th e immunoglobulin G2 subclass. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of ontamalimab, in whic h over 700 subjects were treated for up to 3 years, there has been no case of anaphylaxis. There have been 2 reported case s of drug hype rsensitivity: serum sickness attributed to concomitant administration of penici llin; and a reaction characterized by dyspnea, facial erythema, and chest pain with onset 2 days after administration of the fifth dose of ontamalima b. The latter event mimicked a reaction that the subject had previously experienced after 4 doses of infliximab. In addition, low titer activity has been observed in ADA assays, includi ng pretreatment samples and placebo-treated subjects, and no subject has had a 2-fold or greater increase in A DA titer. Analysis of PK and clinical parameters has shown no difference between subjects whose ADA assays results are positive as compared with those whose are negative. Nonetheless, the possibility of a hypersensitiv ity reaction occurring after drug exposure cannot be fully ruled out. The reactions of concern are Type I (anaphylaxis) and Type III (immune complex) reactions. The clinical presentation of anaphylactic reactions is described in Table 5 . For non-commercial use only"
347,page_347,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 78 SHP647-302 Protocol Amendment 2 Ontamalimab 11 Nov 2019 Table 5 Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis (Type 1 Hypersensitivity) Anaphylaxis is highly likely when below criterion and at least any one of the following criteria a and b are fulfilled : Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) AND AT LEAST 1 OF THE FOLLOWING: a) Respiratory compromise (eg, dy spnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stri dor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) b) Reduced BPa or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) BP=blood pressure; PEF=peak expiratory flow a Low systolic BP for children is defined as less than 90 mmHg from 11 to 17 years. Source: Adapted from Sampson et al., 2006 . Type III hypersensitivity responses, including thos e mediated by immune complexes and T-cells (delayed hypersensitivity responses in the older l iterature), are relatively rare with respect to therapeutic protein products and a high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary for the diagnosis (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research - Gu idance for industry: Im munogenicity assessment for therapeutic protein products, 2014). Type III hypersensitivity reactions involve the formation of biologic/ADA immune complexes in the circulation which, when present in the correct stoichiometric ratio, become deposited in tissu es. Once immune complexes are deposited, they can elicit complement activation and inflamma tion, leading to tissue damage. When immune complexes are deposited in tissues, they tend to localize in small postcapillary venules where there is loss of laminar blood flow, in sites of ultrafiltration where ther e is high pressure and fenestrated endothelium (eg, choroid plexus, cilia ry body, synovium, and glomeruli), in sites of turbulent blood flow (eg, coronary artery branch es off aorta, aortic bifurcations, and cardiac valve leaflets), and in re nal glomerular endothelium. Signs and symptoms of immune complex depositi on typically have onset 1 to 3 weeks after exposure ( Warrington et al., 2018 ) usually improving in 7 to 10 days, with full recovery in 2 to 4 weeks and may include fever, rash (includi ng hives), arthralgia, myalgia, vasculitis, Arthus reaction, general ill feeling, itching, and swollen lymph nodes. Some of these findings, such as fever, rash, arthralgia, and myalgia are consiste nt with findings associated with IBD and may therefore be very difficult to assign to a partic ular etiology. When such a reaction is suspected, samples for laboratory assessment will be obtained and stored. Tests will be performed if the diagnosis is confirmed and request ed by the adjudication committee.

Outcomes are as follows: • Fatal • Not Recovered/Not Resolved • Recovered/Resolved • Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae • Recovering/Resolving • Unknown. 8.1.5 Symptoms of the Disease Under Study Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed as AEs as long as they are within the normal day-to-day fluctuation or expected progre ssion of the disease and ar e part of the efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, si gnificant worsening of the symptoms should be recorded as an AE. 8.1.6 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations A change in the value of a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG assessment can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during treatment with the investigational product, a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of an already abnormal value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the re ference range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment w ith the investigational product, a nd the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference ra nge, must be taken into consideration. If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG values which were not present at the pretreatment value observe d closest to the start of study treatment, further investigations should be pe rformed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plau sible explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values. The investigator should decide , based on the above criteria a nd the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a clinical labora tory, vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinically significant and therefore represents an AE. 8.1.7 Pregnancy All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined follow-up period stated in Section 7.1.3.

The pregnant female study participant must be withdrawn from the study. Every effort should be made to gather info rmation regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition of the infant. It is the re sponsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 30 calendar days after th e initial notification and approximate ly 30 calendar days postpartum. If the pregnancy outcome is a live birth, the vital st atus and clinical conditi on of the infant should be obtained and documented at 1 year postpartum. Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and must be reported us ing the Shire “Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Nonserious AE as Required by the Prot ocol Form”. Note: An elective abortion is not considered an SAE. In addition to the above, if the investigator dete rmines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Sh ire “Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Nonserious AE as Required by the Protocol Fo rm” as well as the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Re port Form.

Note: The 24-hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication e rrors unless these result in an SAE. The categories below are not mutually exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category. • Abuse – Persistent or sporadic intentional inta ke of investigational product when used for a nonmedical purpose (eg, to alte r one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that may be detrimental to the individual and/or society • Misuse – Intentional use of inves tigational product other than as directed or indicated at any dose (Note: this includes a situation wher e the investigational pr oduct is not used as directed at the dose pres cribed by the protocol) • Overdose – Intentional or uninten tional administration of i nvestigational product at a dose interval that is less than 2 weeks between doses • Medication Error – An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of an investigational product. For studies, me dication errors are repo rtable to the sponsor only as defined below.

The administration and/or use of an expired i nvestigational product should be considered as a reportable medication error. There is no specific antidote fo r overdose with ontamalimab. Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. 8.1.9 Unexpected Adverse Event An unexpected AE is an AE whose nature, severit y, specificity, or outcome is not consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the reference safety information (RSI). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are men tioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacologi cal properties of the product, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation. The expectedness of AEs will be determined by the sponsor using the IB as the RSI. This determination will include considerations such as the number of AEs previously observed, but not on the basis of what might be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of a product. 8.1.10 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is defined as any suspected adverse reaction to study treatment (ie, in cluding active comparators) that is both serious and unexpected. The event(s) must meet all of the following: • Suspected adverse reaction • Serious • Unexpected • Assessed as related to study treatment. 8.2 Serious Adverse Event Procedures 8.2.1 Reference Safety Information The reference for safety information for this st udy is Section 6.8 of th e ontamalimab IB, which the sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators. 8.2.2 Reporting Procedures All initial and follow-up SAE reports must be re ported by the investigat or to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department and the CRO/Shire medical monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event.

Note: The te rm “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. • Requires inpatient hospitaliz ation or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization. Note: Hospitalizations, which are the result of elec tive or previously scheduled surgery for pre-existing conditions, which ha ve not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be cl assified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an elective or previously scheduled surgery that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s). • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. • Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect. • Is an important medical event. Note: Importa nt medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical even ts include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an ED or at home; blood dyscrasias or c onvulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization; or the de velopment of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame All SAEs (regardless of relati onship to study) are collected fro m the time the subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow-up period stated in Section 7.1.3 and must be reported to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department and the CRO/Shire medical monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event.

The resolution date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the symptoms resolve, or the date the event is considered chronic. In the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge dates are considered the onse t and resolution dates, respectively. In addition, any signs or sympto ms experienced by the subject af ter signing the informed consent form, or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolu tion date of the SAE, must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate. 8.2.6 Fatal Outcome Any SAE that results in the subject ’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary cause of death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolv ed, without a resolution date recorded. For any SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless another investigational product action was previously taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product shoul d be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The investigational product ac tion of “withdrawn” should not be selected solely as a result of the subject’s death. 8.2.7 Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee, and Site Reporting The sponsor or the CRO is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities , US central institutional review boards (IRBs), and European Union (EU) central ethics committees (ECs) of related, unexpected SAEs (ie, SUSARs). In addition, the CRO is responsible for notifying ac tive sites of all related, unexpected SAEs (ie, SUSARs) occurring during all interventiona l studies across the ontamalimab program. The investigator is responsibl e for notifying the local IRB, lo cal EC, or the relevant local regulatory authority of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required. 8.2.8 Safety Monitoring for Potential Ca ses of Drug-induced Liver Injury The following safety monitoring and stopping criteria are provided for elevated hepatic blood tests based on normal and elevated base line ALT and total bilirubin levels. Abnormal values in ALT concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other ca uses of liver injury are considered potential cases of drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) a nd should always be considered important medical events.

The measurement(s) should be reconfirmed with another blood draw preferably within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding of potential concern. Plea se refer to laboratory manual for further instructions. Guidance for Dosing Interruption: Investigator -directed delays in dosing due to abnormal laboratory findings or AEs should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the subject should continue with the treatment.

A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy. Discrepancies between source data and data entered in the e CRF will be addressed by qualified site personnel. When a data discrepancy warrants correction, th e correction will be made by authorized site personnel. Data collection procedures will be discu ssed with the site at th e site initiation visit and/or at the investigator’s meeting. It is exp ected that site personnel will complete the eCRF entry within approximately 3 busines s days of the subject’s visit. 9.2 Clinical Data Management Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management plan. Quality control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data are to be reviewed and checked for om issions, errors, and values requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queri es requiring clarification are to be communicated to the site for resolution. On ly authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner. 9.3 Data Handling Considerations Data that may potentially unbli nd the treatment assignment (ie, investigational product serum concentrations, antibodies to inve stigational product, treatment allocation, and investigational product preparation/accountability data) will be handled with special care during the data cleaning and review process. These data will be handled in such a way that, before unblinding, any data that may unblind study team personnel w ill be presented as blinded information or otherwise will not be made available. If appli cable, unblinded data may be made available to quality assurance representatives for the pur poses of conducting independent drug audits. 9.4 Statistical Analysis Process The study will be analyzed by the sponsor or its agent . The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and safety data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other study information such as su bject disposition, demogr aphics and baseline characteristics, investigationa l product exposure, and prior an d concomitant medications. The SAP will also include a descripti on of how missing, unused and spur ious data will be addressed. The SAP will be finalized before unblinding to pres erve the integrity of the statistical analysis and study conclusions. For non-commercial use only"

Further details regarding the DMC can be found in the DMC charter, which will be available before the administration of inve stigational product to any subject. Analyses of the data for DMC review will be conducted according to the DMC charter and the DMC SAP. Because no formal hypothesis testing for safety assessments is pl anned, multiplicity concerns regarding repeated analyses are not applicable. An external hypersensitivity adjudication committ ee will be established to review data from subjects who experience a suspected Type I or Type III hypersensitivity reaction in order to confirm the nature and etiol ogy of the reaction, to determin e whether testing should be performed on stored blood samples, and to finalize recommendations of permanent discontinuation or rechallenge with investigational product. Further details regarding the adjudication committee can be found in the adjudication charter. 9.6 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations Graphical methods are used to control the global family-wise Type I error rate (FWER) at the .05 level (2-sided) for the comparisons of the 2 ontamalimab treatment groups with the placebo group. Alpha is initially split equall y at the .025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the primary endpoint.

Power calculations are made based on assuming a .025 (2-sided) significance level for each pairwise treatment comparison. Approximately 1346 subjects will be screened to randomize 740 subjects (2:2:1 allocation ra tio: 296 subjects in the 25 mg ontamalimab treatment group, 296 subjects in the 75 mg ontamalimab treatm ent group, and 148 subjects in the placebo group) which would yield an approximately 90% power to detect individua l pairwise treatment difference in the primary efficacy endpoint, remission at Week 12, of 11% (5% placebo versus 16% ontamalimab). Expected remission rates at Week 12 are based on observed rates from the A7281009 study and placebo remission rates from literature ( Feagan et al., 2013; Sandborn et al., 2017 ). No adjustment for missing data is required in these sample size calculations as subjects with missing data for remission at Week 12 are imputed as failures and the above rates account for these subjects. With the sample size of 740 subjects, Table 7 provides the power for detecting a treatment difference between a ontamalimab treatment group and the placebo group for the key secondary endpoints.

Remission is defined as a composite score of patient-reported symptoms using daily e-diary and centrally read endoscopy as follows: • stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 with at least a 1-point change from baseline AND • rectal bleeding subscore of 0 AND • endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (m odified, excludes friability). The primary efficacy endpoint will be compar ed for each active treatment group (25 mg or 75 mg ontamalimab) to the placebo group using a Cochran-Mantel Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test stratified by status of prior anti-TNF treatment and glucocorticoid use at baseline (Visit 2). Subjects with missing remission data at the Week 12 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders. The endoscopy score will be based on centrally read results. The primary endpoint will be tested by the following hypothesis: H0: δ = 0 H1: δ ≠ 0 Where δ is the common treatment difference across strata, j=1 to m . The common treatment difference is a weighted average of th e stratum-specific treatment differences. The estimate of the common treatment differe nce along with the corresponding stratified Newcombe 95% confidence interval (C I) using the method of Yan and Su ( 2010) and CMH p-value will be presented for each active treatment group to placebo comparison.

These anal yses may compare imputations of the missing values which favor placebo (eg, worst case) and/ or imputations which favor active treatment (eg, best case). In addition, imputa tion methods based on informative missingness and other missing data mechanisms may be performed. Additional se nsitivity/supplementary analyses will also be conducted using the PP analysis set and the completer set. Additional anal yses may be developed in the SAP. All sensitivity/supplementary analyses will be described in the SAP. Prespecified subgroup analyses are planned for the primary endpoint including, but not limited to gender, prior anti-TNF treatment, glucocor ticoid use at baseline, region, age group, randomization stratum, and other important subgroups. A full list of important subgroups will be described within the SAP. Within subgroups, efficacy endpoints will be compared for each active treatment group (25 mg ontamalimab an d 75 mg ontamalimab) with the placebo group using a Chi-square test. Subjects with missing remission data at the Week 12 visit will be considered failures and counted as nonresponders. The endoscopy subscore will be based on centrally read results. The estimate of the treatment difference, al ong with the corresponding Newcombe (hybrid-score) 95% CI and Chi-square test p-value, will be presented. Adjustments for Multiplicity The global FWER for the statisti cal tests of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be strongly controlled at .05 (2-sided). To contro l the FWER, graphical methods discussed in Bretz et al. ( 2009) will be utilized to propagate α from primary to key secondary endpoints and between the 2 ontamalimab treatment group and placebo comparisons. Alpha is initially split equally at the .025 level (2-sided) for each of the pairwise treatment comparisons for the primary endpoint (P) and alpha is propaga ted in a hierarchical manner to each of the 4 key secondary endpoints (K1-K4) within a pairwise treatment comparison.

Figure A1 Algorithm for C. difficile Diagnosis Using the Quick Check Card Test If the Alere Quik Chek card test is not availa ble, then a diagnosis may be established by following either of the algorithms shown in Figure A2 (using PCR for toxin), Figure A3 using toxigenic culture) or Figure A4 (using toxigenic culture, follow ed by PCR). The rationale for the method in Figure A3 is that the majority of PCR tests are expected to be negative for toxin, thus obviating the need for the test at the central laboratory. The e xpected turnaround time at the central laboratory for a GDH card test is expected to be shorter than that for stool culture for C. difficile at the local laboratory. The de tails of the sensitivity and specificity of these tests were reported by Khanna ( Khanna et al., 2017 ). When medically reasonable, treatment decisions should be deferred until an etiology has been determined. When this is not feasible, manage ment of symptoms should be dictated by the clinical situation. For non-commercial use only"

When this is not feasible, manage ment of symptoms should be dictated by the clinical situation. If management requires a prohibited treatment (eg, IV glucocorticoids for induction or maintenance studies) the subj ect should be withdrawn from treatment. If treatment has been deferred, on ce an etiology is determined (eg, C. difficile , disease exacerbation, Campylobacter), appropriate treatme nt should be promptly implemented without waiting for a scheduled visit. If the etiology is determined to be C. difficile , treatment guidelines conforming to the current Infectious Diseas es Society of America recommendations for C. difficile infection ( McDonald et al., 2018 ) or the recent expert review on C. difficile infection in IBD ( Khanna et al., 2017 ) should be consulted. If C. difficile infection was identified, clinical improve ment should be noted within about 5 days after the start of treatm ent. If improvement does not occur, the etiology is most likely an IBD flare secondary to C. difficile and treatment failure assessment should proceed per the protocol. Another possible explanati on is primary failure of C. difficile therapy which is unlikely. If an infectious e tiology other than C. difficile is identified, it should be managed as appropriate, with reference to current clinical guidelines ( Shane et al., 2017 ). If any infectious etiology is determined, the s ite should contact the medical monitor to make him or her aware of the diagnosis and to disc uss treatment and ongoing study participation.
