Standard care includes providing survivorship care plans that initially focused on information delivery alone, which has demonstrated limited efficacy for improving health outcomes. An increased emphasis on the process of patient engagement and support of non -pharmacologic self -management (SM; symptom management, medication adherence, screening, healthy behaviors) is needed to improve care plans. Holistic consideration of individual - level contextual factors such as values or tradeoffs with existing behaviors, could more sustainably integrate SM into survivors’ life context. Facilitating SM with consideration of context is consistent with systems thinking. System Support Mapping (MAP) is a systems thinking activity that involves creatin g a visual diagram of how SM occurs within cancer survivors’ life context that facilitates self -awareness and patient -driven engagement in SM. W e propose to conduct a one -arm pilot study of MAP among 24 colorectal cancer survivors within one year of comple ting active treatment to describe study feasibility, intervention acceptability, and outcome variability . MAP can also be a powerful tool to reduce health disparities since it allows for simultaneous consideration of individual -level and multi -level contex tual factors (i.e., geographic, social, institutional). Health disparities exist such that colorectal cancer survivors who are rural residents have higher cancer mortality than do urban cancer survivors. Furthermore, rural survivors are at increased risk f or self -reported poorer health and engage in more health compromising behaviors compared to urban survivors. Therefore, w e will also identify multi -level contextual factors influencing SM and e xamine how study results vary by rural -urban context to inform future studies. MAP is a novel approach that may generalize to improving care for other chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease."

Approximately 66% of the 135,000 people diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the United States each year will survive for at least 5 years post diagnosis.1 As cancer survivors are expected to live longer, there is a shift in perspective to viewing cancer as a chronic illness, which is accompanied by increased need for cancer survivors to partner with physicians and become more actively engaged in SM to optimize their own health outcomes.2,3 The Institute of Medicine and others recommend that patients receive a comprehensive survivorship care plan when transitioning form active treatment to survivorship that provides a treatment summary and outlines follow -up care needs including multiple complex SM activities (e.g., psychosocial support, symptom management, health behaviors).3,4 A weakness of initial research on survivorship care plans is that in terventions have solely focused on information delivery and demonstrated limited efficacy for improving self -reported health outcomes.4 Recommended future directions for improving upon information -focused survivorship care planning involve increasing the emphasis on the process of patient engage ment and support of non -pharmacologic SM (e.g., health behaviors).4–6 One particularly strong survivorship care planning intervention that improved self - reported health was designed to be p atient -centered and focused on the process of engaging cancer survivors with one session that included goal setting, establishing a plan to improve health, and increasing the motivation, information, skills, and confidence necessary to engage in SM.6 Yet, this intervention focused on survivors’ cancer treatment narrative and did not holistically consider individual - level contextual factors such as values or tra deoffs with existing behaviors, which would more sustainably integrate SM into survivors’ existing life context and ultimately facilitate translation of the intervention into practice.7,8 Self-awareness of contextual influences on behavior will engage survivors in sustainable SM. The conceptual framework for improving the quality of cancer care presented in an Institute of Medicine report starts with engaged patients.9 This report defines pati ent engagement in cancer care as “A system that supports all patients in making informed medical decisions consistent with their needs, values, and preferences in consultation with their clinicians who have expertise in patient -centered communication and s hared decision making.” Self -determination Theory also emphasizes that supporting patients’ partnership in healthcare decisions will enhance patients’ engagement in SM and ultimately lead to more sustainable improvement in health outcomes.10 According to Self -determination Theory, self -awareness is a necessary first step in facilitating patients’ patient -driven (i.e., autonomous) motivation for engaging in SM.11 Patient -driven goals are more likely to be achieved than goals that are extrinsically motivated.12 This point is illustrated by an intervention to facili tate the SM in other chronic diseases that provided participants with the opportunity to self -select their goals rather than prescribing specific behavior changes.13 Results showed that this process of patient -driven goal setting successfully changed health behaviors and reduced hospitalizations.13 Yet, patients may need guidance to facilitate self -awareness and identify what they need to engage in multiple recommended SM activities w ith consideration of their broader life context. Systems Support Mapping (MAP) facilitates self -awareness of contextual factors. Systems thinking unpacks complex behaviors (e.g., SM), while exploring how individual patient choices are facilitated and cons trained by broader contextual systems.14 System S upport Mapping (MAP) is a structured systems thinking activity to facilitate survivors’ creation of a visual diagram to tangibly illustrate and create self -awareness for how a SM behavior relates to the broader context of tradeoffs with other behaviors and achieving most -valued outcomes. MAP facilitates self -awareness of the complex broader system and the ability for patients to clearly identify any discrepancies or intervention targets for SM. Highlighting discrepancies between current and desired states i s used as a technique to generate patient -driven motivation for behavior change.15,16 Tying individual SM behaviors to broader life values"

Similarly, identifying how changing SM holistically affects broader contextual systems will more sustainably integrate SM. Having patients select patient -driven goals for SM with a consideration of t heir life context will set the stage for engaging in patient -driven SM. MAP has primarily been applied to systems in the community setting with the exception of Dr. Befus’ (Co -Investigator) work in collaboration with Dr. Lich (Consultant) that took an indi vidual -focused approach to understanding SM and health equity in women with migraine occupying lower social locations .17 Thus, it is novel to apply an individual -focused MAP to guide patient engagement in SM with a focus on non -pharmacologic approaches during the transition from active cancer treatment to survivorship. MAP can be a powerful tool to reduce health disparities since it allows for simultaneous consideration of (1) individual -level and (2) multi -level contextual factors.14,18 Rural cancer survivors’ are especially likely to benefit from guidance to facilitate self -awareness an d select patient -driven goals due to their need to consider complex multi -level contextual factors (i.e., geographic, social, institutional).18,19 For example, geographic context is associated w ith the ability to access to supportive care services (e.g., psychologist, religious leader).19–21 Rural residents may share a social context such as the importance of self -reliance.19 Furthermore, results from our research and oth ers show that a large portion (30 -40%) of cancer survivors seek methods for SM outside of conventional cancer care institutions through means such as use of complementary health approaches (CHA) at higher rates than the general public22–24 and use of CHA is higher in rural communities.25,26 Thus, interventions are needed that consider multi -level contextual factors in order to optimize SM and address rural -urban disparities in health outcomes.27 Health disparities exist such that colorectal cancer survivors who are rural residents have higher cancer mortality than do urban cancer survivors.28 Furthermore, rural survivors are generally at increased risk fo r self -reported poorer health (e.g., psychological distress, symptoms) and engage in more health compromising behaviors (e.g., smoking and physical inactivity) compared to urban survivors.27 Such health compromising behaviors are associated with mortality.29 MAP may improve individual -level SM, while a lso identifying how individual -level SM interacts with multi -level contextual factors associated with rural -urban disparities (e.g., education, travel barriers).27 Additionally, MAP will identify key stakeholders and leverage points needed to inform future multi -level studi es.17 Figure 1 shows t he proposed conceptual model, which places Self - Determination Theory in context of other factors influencing patient -centered care and health disparities.9,18,30 –32"

We will quantitatively and qualitatively describe recruitment and retention; intervention completion and acceptability; and variability and changes in proposed outcomes (i.e., measures of patient engagement, health outcomes) to guide future study planning. We will analyze collected maps, and describe factors and targets for intervention at multiple levels (individual/geographic/social/institutional). 2.1 Primary Objective 2.1.1 T o evaluate the feasibility of the MAP intervention in colorectal cancer surviv ors, as characterized by enrollment, intervention adherence, and retention rates . We hypothesize >50% of eligible patients will enroll and that >70% of participants will complete the intervention and be retained in the study. 2.2 Secondary Objectives 2.2.1 To evaluate intervention acceptability as characterized by participant ratings. 2.2.2 To describe outcome variability to inform future studies. 2.2.3 To identify multi -level contextual factors influencing SM. 2.2.4 To qualitatively assess feasibility, acceptability using semi -structured interviews. 2.2.5 To examine how study results vary by rural -urban context. 3.0 Patient Selection We will enroll 24 participants with equal numbers of patients from urban and rural communities over 10 months. To identify potential patients, programming with Epic will be used to provide automated reports identifying patients within one year of completing active treatmen t for colorectal cancer. W e will also post the study on Be Involved . The Project Manager will screen the report and communicate with attending physicians, physician assistants, clinic nurses and/or the patient navigator regarding patients’ potential eligib ility for the study . Research staff will approach patients either in person or remotely (e.g., telephone, myWakeHealth, mail) regarding their interest in study participation . Ways to contact the study team if they wish to opt out of the study will be inclu ded. A study team member will then follow up with all patients who respond to the letter with an interest in participation. Of the patients who do not decline, the study coordinator will approach at their next clinic visit or by phone to provide study information and answer questions to determine willingness to participate. The consent will be signed remotely or in person. If signed remotely, patients will be asked to send the form back to us by a secure means (e.g., REDCap, mail) . In the case that the pati ent is consented remotely, either a hard copy or email attachment of the informed consent document will be provided to the participant. We will compensate participants $50. We will document recruitment in a Screening Log including reasons for ineligibility, eligible patients approached, number who declined participation, and number successfully recruited. After making sure"

A copy of the consent form will be given to the participant, and the original copy will be kept in the participant’s file. 3.1 Inclusion Criteria 3.1.1 Adults ≥18 years of age 3.1.2 Diagnosed with stage I -III colorectal cancer 3.1.3 Within 2 years of completing active treatment for colorectal cancer 3.1.4 Cognitively able to complete interviews as judged by the study team 3.1.5 Able to understand, read and write English Children under the age of 18 with colorectal cancer will be excluded due to the rarity of colorectal cancer in this population according to the National Cancer Institute (incidence rate ≤ 0.6) and because they are likely to have distinct needs and experien ces if diagnosed this young. Further, it is unlikely that the study would recruit sufficient numbers in this subset of the cancer survivor population to gain meaningful results. Results from this research may inform future studies in children with cancer u nder 18 who are generally different from adults and should be researched separately. 3.2 Exclusion Criteria 3.2.1 Declined participation in the study 3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities The target population for this study is adult men and women who have completed active treatment for colorectal cancer. We expect that women and minorities will be represented as is consistent with the proportion seen in the past five years at the Wake Fore st Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center . For this pilot study, non -English speaking patients will be excluded because the intervention will be implemented in English. Pending results of the pilot, a future study to determine the efficacy of translating the intervention will be proposed. Experts at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Office for Cancer Health Equity will review our protocol and suggest additional strategies to enhance the ability to recruit a representative sample. The OCHE inclu des a Hispanic Clinical Trial Patient Navigator who provides guidance to Hispanic participants throughout the research process and will be involved in educating any potential Hispanic study participants on clinical trials prior to in -person interaction wit h the Project Manager. The intervention is designed to reduce barriers to recruitment and to be presented in a manner that will be culturally sensitive with the aim of reaching all patients. 4.0 Registration Procedures All patients entered on any WFBCCC trial, whether treatment, companion, or cancer control trial, must be linked to the study in EPIC within 24 hours of Informed Consent . Patients must be registered prior to the initiation of treatment."

Complete the Eligibility Checklist ( Appendix A ) 2. Complete the Protocol Registration Form ( Appendix B) 3. Alert the Cancer Center registrar by phone, and then send the signed Informed Consent Form, Eligibility Checkl ist and Protocol Registration Form to the registrar, either by fax or e -mail. *Protocol Registration is open from 8:30 AM - 4:00 PM, Monday -Friday. 4. Fax/e-mail ALL eligibility source documents with registration. Patients will not be registered without all required supporting documents. Note: If labs were performed at an outside institution, provide a printout of the results. Ensure that the most recent lab values are sent. To complete the registration process, the Registrar will:  assign a patient study number  register the patient on the study 5.0 Study Outcomes and Study Measures We will collect data at two different levels, the individual -level (feasibility, outcome measures), and multi -level contextual factors (MAP data ). We will collect self -reported data either remotely or in person at baselin e and two weeks after MAP. 5.1 Primary Outcome (Feasibility) Enrollment rate will be calculated as the percent of eligible participants approached who agree to participate. Participation rate will be calculated as the percent of participants who complete t he study intervention among those enrolled. Retention rate will be calculated as the number of participants who complete the study measures among those enrolled . 5.2 Secondary Outcomes 5.2.1 Self-reported ratings of intervention acceptability 5.2.2 Proximal outcomes 5.2.2.1 Measures of autonomy [Index of Autonomous Functioning]33 5.2.2.2 Self-efficacy for manag ing cancer [Self -efficacy to Manage Chronic Disease Scale and PROMIS self -efficacy for managing symptoms short form ]34–36 5.2.2.3 Relatedness [HEAL Patient -Provider Connection] ,37 only assessed at follow -up because this construct is assessing the experience with the MAP facilitator."

The intervention will be implemented individually to outpatients. Trained facilitators will guide participants to create a visual diagram of their SM activities within their broader life context (MAP). MAP helps participants tangibly see complex SM activities on paper, which make s them more actionable . MAP was acceptable to participants in our preliminary work, which included social and economically marginalized women .17 Each participant will be provided with a piece of poster -sized paper with five concentric circles on it and six pads of differently -colored sticky notes used to represent different rings.

Each resulting MAP will describe participants’ most bothersome life impacts of cancer, SM activities with a focus on non -pharmacologic approaches, facili tators and needs for SM, and outcomes and tradeoffs of SM. We will ask participants to reflect aloud , discuss any discrepancies between current and desired outcomes of SM, and brainstorm about what they need to reconcile them. We will then have participant s identify one goal that is important and achievable in the next two weeks and set action steps.43 Dr. Befus (Co -Investigator) will train study staff who have experience with conducting qualitative research (Q -PRO staff) to facilitate MAPs. MAP will take 60 -90 minutes, be digitally recorded, and transcribed to ensure treatment fidelity and facili tate analysis. Participants will be off-treatment upon completion of this one session. Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7. 6.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines This behavioral intervention will not affect usual care. 6.4 Duration of Follow Up Patients will be followed for two weeks after this minimal -risk behavioral intervention is administered for adverse events monitoring. Follow -up for serious adverse events and mortality after the intervent ion is implemented will take place during the routine clinic visits that the patient will have during the 2 follow - up window ( also referenced in Appendix D). If no visit occurs during this window, a phone call confirmation should be made to the patient to determine vital status and whether any adverse events and in particular, Grade 4 unexpected and Grade 5 adverse events occurred during that window of time and recorded on Appendix E. 6.5 Criteria for Removal from Study There are no additional criteria for r emoval from the study. 7.0 Adverse Events List and Reporting Requirements Expected adverse experiences for the study intervention are as follows:  Emotional distress (i.e., mild anxiety or mild depressive symptoms) Each interventionist will monitor and note any adverse events experienced during the MAP session (e.g., patients’ expression of emotional distress , request to discontinue the session). The study team will only document adverse events during the two -week p eriod following the intervention. 7.1 Adverse Event Characteristics  CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov )."

STRC currently requires that all unexpected 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these trials be reported to them for review. All WFBCCC Clinical Research Management (CRM) s taff members assisting a P rincipal Investigator in investigating, documenting and reporting an SAE qualifying for STRC reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC as well as the entire committee via the email notif ication procedure of the occurrence of an SAE. 7.3 WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adverse events shall be promptly reported to the IRB , according to institutional policy . Reporting to the IRB is required regardless of the funding source, study sponsor, or whether the event involves an investigational or marketed drug, biologic or device. Reportable events are not limited to physical injury, but include psychological, econ omic and social harm. Reportable events may arise as a result of drugs, biological agents, devices, procedures or other interventions, or as a result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or other interactions with research subjects. All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to the IRB and other applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others. The Principal Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible for ensuring the prompt repo rting of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others to the IRB. The Principal Investigator is also responsible for ensuring that all reported unanticipated risks to subjects and others which they receive are reviewed to determine whether t he report represents a change in the risks and/or benefits to study participants, and whether any changes in the informed consent, protocol or other study -related documents are required. Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occ urring at a site where the study has been approved by the WFUHS IRB (internal events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of the event. Any unanticipated problems i nvolving risks to subjects or others occurring at another site conducting the same study that has been approved by the WFUHS IRB (external events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study te am becoming aware of the event. Any event, incident, experience, or outcome that alters the risk versus potential benefit of the research and as a result warrants a substantive change in the research protocol or informed consent process/document in order t o insure the safety, rights or welfare of research subjects."

Rates will be summ arized using point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. In exploratory analyses, we will compare participants’ intervention completion and retention by baseline characteristics using chi -square tests and t - tests. 9.2 Analysis of Secondary Objective s To meet Objective 2.2.1, we will use descriptive statistics to summarize participant ratings of acceptability. Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals) will be used to summarize proximal outcomes and change in health outcomes by assessment measure to meet Objective 2.2.2. The primary interest will be in estimating the variance for use in planning future studies. For Objective 2.2.3 , the internal study team will work with external collaborators through an iterative process to facilitate a qualitative content analysis44 of the large quantity of textual MAP data. Specifically, we will first enter text data from the completed paper maps into a software program co-developed by Steve Chall ( external Senior Programmer, University of North Carolina -Chapel Hill Renaissance Computing Institute ) and Dr. Lich ( Consultant) using the ssm function to create a digital map.17,45 Steve Chall will translate the text MAP data into lists that can be sorted by the study team (using the sort program). The sort program will allow us to group and code similar terms or concepts. Next, we will send our sort files back to Steve Chall and he will use Python programming language to help aggregate the large amounts of textual"

These matrices will be saved in the form of Excel (.csv ) files , which are compatible with other statistical software . We will ultimately present resulting counts and descriptive statistics of findings alongside descriptive categories and themes. To meet Objective 2.2.4, we will also conduct a qualitative content analysis .44 Qualitative data will be sent to an external vendor to be transc ribed. Two internal study team members will double -code at least 10% of coding of transcripts from the semi -structured interviews and resolve any disagreements to ensure that we achieve robust and unbiased results. We will evaluate qualitative and quantitative analyses in a mixed -methods framework for consistency and discrepancies across all analyses to refine the protocol. To meet Objective 2 .2.5, w e will examine all quantitative and qualitative analyses by urban -rural status as classified using the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy definition of rural .40 For quantitative measures, we will compute desc riptive statistics by urban -rural status and will use Fisher’s exact tests and Wilcoxon ran k sum tests to compare urban and rural participants. Qualitative results will be summarized by urban -rural status. We will also compare MAP results by rural -urban st atus. 9.3 Power and Sample Size The target sample size is based on estimating rates of feasibility measures to inform the design of an efficacy trial. If the recruitment rate is below 50% and intervention completion and retention rates are below 70%, a larger study may not be feasible. Assuming a negative binomial dis tribution and true rate of 50%, the probability that we would have to approach 61 or more people to recruit 24 is <0.05. Therefore, if we approach ≥ 61 participants to enroll 24, it is unlikely the true probability is above 50%, and we will conclude the stu dy may not be feasible. Out of the 24 participants, if the true rate of intervention completion and study retention is 70%, we expect 13 or more will participate/be retained, so if 12 or fewer do not participate/are not retained the study may not be feasib le; we have 80% power to test that the hypothesis that the rate is 70% compared to the alternative that is 46% or less. The number of participants interviewed will be determined when theoretical saturation is reached. We estimate that we will need 8-12 pa rticipants in each group (rural -urban) .46 9.4 Estimated Accrual Rate We will enroll 24 participants over 10 months at a rate of 3 participants per month. We expect this rate to be feasible since the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) sees approximately 60 patients with colorectal cancer who initiate chemotherapy each year and thus approximately the same number will be within a year of completing treatment when the study begins (plus a potential 5 per month after that who complete treatment and become eligible). Our study team (i.e., Dr. Sohl, Dr. Tooze, and Meg O’Mara ) has experience working together to recruit patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and conducting behavioral intervention research. Over 75% of patients approached have ag reed to participate in our current behavioral intervention study in colorectal cancer patients initiating active treatment (K01 AT008219; PI: Sohl). The proposed research is less time sensitive and intensive for participants than the current study, so we e xpect to have similar success. 9.5 Estimated Study Length"

Once these AEs and SAEs are entered, the following document describes how to initiate STRC reporting using the SAE form in WISER that is subm itted for unexpected grade 4 and any grade 5 (death during protocol intervention) SAEs on CCCWFU Institutional interventional trial patients. There are multiple entities that require reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for what is reported, and how it is reported. Rules used by other entities (Institutional Review Board (IRB), AdEERS, MedWatch, etc.) should NOT be used to evaluate whether an event should be reported to STRC. Only the rules for reporting described in this document should be considered. As defined in the NCI Data Table 4 reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional Interventional studies covered by these reporting requirements are defined as: In-house, internally reviewed trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry sponsorship in which the center is a primary contributor to the design, implementation, and monitoring of the trial, or participation in a multi -site trial initiated by an institutional investigator at another center. Institutional trials a re almost always authored by a researcher here at CCCWFU. Cooperative group protocols are not considered Institutional, but Research Base trials are classified as Institutional. The STRC is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional Intervent ional studies, as defined above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these trials be reported to the STRC for review. All staff members assisting a PI in documenting and reporting an SAE that qualifies for STRC reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC by phone (or in -person), followed by informing the entire committee via the required email notification. THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any faculty or staff member on the study team for a CCCWFU Institutional Interventional trial. Ultimately, the protocol PI has the primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading and assignment of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention. However, when an SAE event as des cribed below is observed, it is the responsibility of the person who observed the event to be sure that it is reported to the STRC. What is considered an SAE under this mandatory procedure? Any unexpected grade 4 event and all grade 5 events (death during protocol intervention) should be reported. These events should be reported if they occur while a patient is on study treatment or if they occur within 30 days of last study treatment (even if patient begins a new treatment during the 30 days). This window of 30 days should be the standard window to be used in all protocols unless a specific scientific rationale is presented to suggest that a shorter window can be used to identify events. In addition, if it is not clear whether the Grade 4 is unexpected it should be reported."

In those situations the adverse events that will not require STRC reporting must be specified in the text of the approved protocol. STRC notification responsibilities of the person (e.g., nurse) handling the reporting/documenting of the SAE in WISER: 1. Make a phone call (or speak in person) to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as listed below (page if necessary) —see note 2 below 2. Enter a new SAE into the SAE module that is located in the Subject>> CRA Console in WISER WITHIN 24 HOURS of first knowledge of the event. Information can be entered and saved, but the STRC members will not be notified until a date is entered into the STRC Notification Date Field. This will ensure that all persons that need to be made aware of the event (i.e., study team members and STRC members) will be notified; remember to file a copy of your confirmation. 3. Ensure that you document that the appropriate p erson(s) on the STRC has been contacted. Indicate the name of the STRC clinician that was contacted in the comments field in the SAE console of the particular subject. 4. In addition, it is very important to enter whether or not the protocol should be suspen ded based on the discussion with the STRC clinician. This is the major function of the email notification. This should also be entered in the comments field in the SAE console of the subject. 5. Follow up/update the clinical member(s) of STRC regarding any n ew developments or information obtained during the course of the SAE investigation and reporting process.

Allow up to 30 minutes for the backup to respond to a phone call or page before contacting another member. These times (30 minutes) are a general guideline. You must use your best judgme nt as a clinical research professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is appropriate to contact backup clinicians. If the event occurs near the end of day, then leave messages (voice or email) as appropri ate and proceed with submitting your STRC notification form. It is important that you have taken reasonable steps and documented that you have initiated some type of contact to one or more of the clinical members of STRC. STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:"
