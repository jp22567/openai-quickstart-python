Procedural pain associated with IA injection of the investigational product , CNTX -4975- 05, will be controlled primarily through adjunct controlled joint cooling and secondarily by pre-medication with IA lidocaine . Types of Subjects: The study population will contain 3 types of subjects, with a targeted minimum of 150 subjects of each type: 1.Subjects with unilateral or bilateral OA of the knee, with one knee (the index knee) with moderate to severe pain ( K-L grade 1 -4) and the other knee (the contralateral knee) with no to mild pain. These subjects will recei ve an injection of CNTX -4975- 05 into the index knee only. 2.Subjects with bilateral OA of the knees, with both knees having moderate to severe pain ( K-L grade 1 -4, with wors e pain being the index knee). These subjects will receive an injection of CNTX -4975- 05 into each knee (1 week apart , most painful knee [index knee] first, then the following week, the contralateral knee). 3.Subjects who have unilateral or bilateral OA of the knee, with one knee with moderate to severe pain ( the index knee [K -L grades 1 -4]) and previous PJR or TJR in the other knee ( the contralateral knee). These subjects will receive an injection of CNTX -4975- 05 into the index knee only. All s ubjects will receive CNTX -4975- 05 injected into the index knee ; subjects with bilateral OA will receive an injection in to both knees (injections will be separated by 1 week) . Subjects will be followed for 8 weeks. Pre-Medication: Prior to the injection procedure, t he investigator may, at his or her discretion, pre - medicate subjects with an oral dose of an opioid or non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drug ( NSAID ). The skin at the point of the anticipated injection (s) may also be infiltrated with 1 to 2 mL of lidocaine and/o r a topic al analgesic such as ethyl chloride spray. It is recommended not to use more than 2 methods of local analgesia about the knee (s) to be injected . Injection of CNTX -4975- 05: ALL subjects are required to be administered an IA injection of a full 15 mL of lidocaine (w ithout epinephrine) ( 1% or 2% , depending on the assigned treatment regimen) to ensure: 1) the lo cal targeted concentration of CNTX -4975 in the joint; 2)distension of the joint capsule to improve access of CNTX -4975 to the joint space; and 3) to provide some analgesia . The full 15 mL of lidocaine (without epinephrine) and the full 2 mL of CNTX -4975- 05 must be injected into the knee joint, as directed. The 5 flexion -extension moves of the knee after IA CNTX -4975- 05 is injected into the knee also improve access of CNTX -4975 to the entire joint space. The lidocaine may have some modest effect on pain, but the concentration and dispersion of CNTX -4975 into the joint are the primary reasons for lidocaine use."

If not us ing ultrasound guided IA injection, then with a clinical IA injection, joint fluid must be identified within the needle hub before injection of 2% lidocaine (without epinephrine) and CNTX -4975- 05. After injection of CNTX -4975, t he knee joint will be passively flexed and extended 5 times over 1 minute to facilitate distribution of the CNTX -4975 within the knee. All subjects must be monitored for at least 30 minutes (or longer, as required by the protocol) after study drug injection to ensure that they do not have a hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis. The duration of cooling and the knee pain upon discontinuation of cooling must be entered into the electronic case report form [eCRF]. If cooling must be reapplied, the time and knee pain level must be recorded in the eCRF, and timing of subsequent pain assessments should be on the standard time lines in the eCRF.

The index knee in these subjects is the one with wors e pain with walking. Where both knees have equal pain with walking, then the knee on the subject’s domina nt side will be designated the index knee. Safety will be assessed by injection site assessment s (erythema and edema), assessment of procedure pain, AEs, physical examination findings, vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiogr ams (ECG s), clinical laboratory test results , and sensory testing. PLANNED NUMBER OF SUBJECTS Approximately 850 subjects will be enrolled . STUDY ENTRY CRITERIA Inclusion Criteria: 1. Male or female subjects between 40 and 95 years of age (inclusive) 2. Confirmation of OA of the knee: radiography of both knees using standard standing films (scored by the investigator) or using the f ixed flexion method , taken during the Screening Visit (prior radiographs of the knees of sufficient quality that have been taken within 2 years of the S creening Visit may be used for K -L grading ). The index knee must show evidence of chronic OA with a K -L grade of 1, 2, 3 or 4. Subjects who were screen failures for the United States (US) CNTX -4975i -OA-301 or CNTX -4975i -OA-304 trials may be considered for this trial if the K -L grade of the index knee is 1 -4, inclusive . 3. Confirmation of OA of the index knee: American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria (ACR confirmation of bilateral knee OA for subjects who will have bilateral knee injections of CNTX -4975- 05). 4. For subjects for monoarticular knee injection, the index knee must have m oderate to severe pain ( ≥5 and ≤ 9) at screening associated with OA , which must be stable for a minimum of 6 months prior to Screening, as a ssessed by the investigator. These subjects may have: a) unilateral or bilateral OA , with the index knee having moderate to severe pain, and the contralateral knee having none to mild pain, OR b) unilateral or bilateral OA , with the index knee having moderate to severe pain and the other knee having had a P JR or TJR within 5 years of the Screening Visit. The knee with the PJR/TJR is not to be injected with CNTX -4975- 05. For subjects for bilateral kn ee injection, the index knee must have m oderate to severe pain (≥5 and ≤9) at screening associated with OA , and greater pain in the index knee than in the contralateral knee. Their pain must be stable for a minimum of 6 months prior to Screening, as assessed by the investigator . The index knee in these subjects is the o ne with the worst pain with walking. Where both knees have equal pain with walking, then the knee on the subject’s dominant side will be designated the index knee. For qualifying knee pain with walking, subjects will use a n NPRS (0 -10; 0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain) to rate their knee pain with walking (both knees, except knees with PJR/TJR). The PJR/TJR pain should be rated using the NPRS scale, but will not be a qualifying pain score. 5. Body mass index ≤45 kg/m 2. 6. Subjects must have failed 2 or more prio r therapies. Failure is deemed to be inadequate relief in the opinion of the investigator. A therapy may be deemed to have been inadequate because of one or more of the following: a) unacceptable AEs;"

Subjects may come into the study with a single analgesic of their choice for their OA knee pain (prescription or OTC). The current pain medication must be identified as that taken only for pain in the knee OA or pain in the PJR/TJR , and not for another pain indication. The subjects will complete a daily paper diary of their background knee analgesic medications during the screening period and throughout the trial. Other analgesics may be taken for occasional pain but should not be taken within 24 hours of a clinic visit ; these are to be recorded as concomitant medications, not as rescue/background medication for knee osteoarthritis. Exclusion Criteria : 1. Joint replacement surgery of the index knee at any time, or open surgery of the index knee in the past 24 months.

Ratios of the mean values of test/control will have 95% confidence intervals constructed for each treatment regimen versus the Breg Cooling Control G roup. For a treatment regimen to be considered clinically acceptable, it must be no more than 30% worse than the Breg Cooling Control Group and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the treatment regimen must be greater than 0.7. This analysis will be performed on the ITT population."

A sensitivity analysis will be performed that creates a composite score using the original scales (with the pain scores still reverse- scored to ensure the direction of the effect remains the same), using the ITT population. All other continuous secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoint s will be summarized using descriptive statistics by subject type, experimental injection procedure, and week/visit, as appropriate, and analyzed using a mixed -model repeated measures analysis or by analysis of covariance, as appropriate. Categorical endpoints will be compared between treatments using Pearson’s chi -square or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the safety population. SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION Approximately 850 subjects will receive CNTX -4975- 05 in an open -label manner. This sample size was chosen based on the need to fulfill safety requirements for regulatory review . STUDY AND TREATMENT DURATION The overall study duration is expected to be 13 months, with 10 months of active enrollment and about 3 months for screening and treatment follow -up. The sequence and maximum duration of the study periods will be as follows: • Screening Period up to 15 days. • Treatment Period (open -label): 1 day per knee treated, maximum 2 days • Post-treatment peri od: 8 weeks from the first CNTX -4975- 05 IA injection The maximum CNTX -4975- 05 treatment for each subject is 2 days. The maximum study duration for each subject is approximately 10 weeks."

No other benefits of participation are anticipated. The potential risks of study participation include those associated with exposure to CNTX -4975-05 and the risks of medical evaluation, including venipuncture and IA injection . Subjects will be injected with 1% or 2% lidocaine (without epinephrine) to provide distension of the joint capsule for access to the whole joint for CNTX -4975- 05 and secondarily for sensory blockade. In principle, subjects with substantial reduction of pain and improvement in function after injection could overuse the joint and subject the index joint to overuse and an acceleration of the knee OA . A summary of the pharmaceutical properties and known potential risks of CNTX -4975 is provided in the current version of the investigator’s brochure ( IB). 3 The investigator must become familiar with all sections of the CNTX -4975-05 IB before the start of the study."

Subjects will return to the clinic at Weeks 4 and 8 for study assessments. Efficacy will be assessed on the OA index knee (and contralateral knee in bilateral knee injection subjects) using a numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) ; the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS ), which includes subscales for pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living, sports and recreation, and quality of life (QOL) ; a joint replacement questionnaire ; a subject satisfaction questionnaire ; an investigator satisfaction questionnaire ; and rescue medication use. P ain with walking will also be collected and assessed for the contralateral knee. For subjects with bilateral knee injections, the contralateral knee will be assessed using the same scales as the index knee, and the effect of bilateral knee injections will be combined as a composite score to examine the overall benefit. The index knee in these subjects is the one with worse pain with walking. Where both knees have equal pain with walking, then the knee on the subject’s dominant side will be designated the index knee. Safety will be assessed by injection site assessment s (erythema and edema), assessment of procedure pain, AEs, physical examination findings, vital sign measurements, 12-l ead electrocardiograms (ECG s), clinical laboratory test results , and sensory testing. 7.2 Discussion of Study Design This open label study, CNTX-4975i- OA-303, is an 8-w eek study to e valuate the efficacy and safety of a single IA injection (per knee, as applicable) of CNTX-4975-05 in subjects with chronic, moderate- to-severe OA knee pain. Procedural pain associated with IA injection of CNTX-4975-05 will be controlled primarily through adjunct controlled joint cooling and secondarily by pre-medication with IA lidocaine . The planned safety and tolerability and efficacy assessments are standard and appropriate. 7.3 Study Site(s) The study will take place at no more than 45 concurrent sites in the US, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom . Each site is anticipated to screen a sufficient number of subjects to be able to enroll approximately 18 subjects. A study site with a n acceptable recruitment rate and acceptable quality metrics may be allowed to recruit more subjects if other sites have low enrollment."

Thus, male and female subjects wi ll be included in the study. A screening log of potential study candidates and/or an enrollment log of enrolled subjects must be maintained at each study site. 8.2 Study Entry Criteria 8.2.1 Inclusion Criteria A subject will be eligible for study participation if the subject meets all of the following criteria: 1. Male or female subjects between 40 and 95 years of age (inclusive). 2. Confirmation of OA of the knee: radiography of both knees using standard standing films (scored by the investigator) or using the fixed flexion method, taken during the S creening Visit (prior radiographs of the knees of sufficient quality that have been taken within 2 years of the S creening Visit may be used for K-L grading). The index knee must show evidence of chronic OA with a K-L grade of 1, 2, 3 or 4. Subjects who were screen failures for the US CNTX-4975i- OA-301 or CNTX-4975i- OA-304 trials may be cons idered for this trial if the K-L grade of the index knee is 1 -4, inclusive. 3. Confirmation of OA of the index knee: American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria (ACR confirmation of bilateral knee OA for subjects who will have bilateral knee in jections of CNTX-4975-05). 4. For subjects for monoarticular knee injection, the index knee must have moderate to severe pain (≥5 and ≤9) at screening associated with OA, which must be stable for a minimum of 6 months prior to Screening, as assessed by the investigator. These subjects may have: a) unilateral or bilateral OA, with the index knee having moderate to severe pain, and the contralateral knee having none to mild pain, OR b) unilateral or bilateral OA, with the index knee having moderate to severe pain and the other knee having had a PJR or TJR within 5 years of the Screening Visit. The knee with the PJR/TJR is not to be injected with CNTX -4975-05. For subjects for bilateral knee injection, the index knee must have moderate to severe pain (≥5 and ≤9) at scre ening associated with OA, and greater pain in the index knee than in the contralateral knee. Their pain must be stable for a minimum of 6 months prior to Screening, as assessed by the investigator. The index knee in these subjects is the one with the worst pain with walking. Where both knees have equal pain with walking, then the knee on the subject’s dominant side will be designated the index knee. For qualifying knee pain with walking, subjects will use an NPRS (0 -10; 0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain) to rate their knee pain with walking (both knees, except knees with PJR/TJR). The PJR/TJR pain should be rated using the NPRS scale, but will not be a qualifying pain score. 5. Body mass index ≤45 kg/m 2."

Subjects must have failed 2 or more prior therapies. Fail ure is deemed to be inadequate relief in the opinion of the investigator. A therapy may be deemed to have been inadequate because of one or more of the following: a) unacceptable AEs; b) initial failure to achieve clinically adequate pain relief; c) initial pain relief that was not maintained; and/ or d) medical condition resulting in contraindication to the standard of care appropriate to the severity of the index knee OA pain. “Therapies” include, but are not limited to, the following: NSAIDs (including topical), opioids, duloxetine, other systemic therapy, IA corticosteroids, IA viscosupplements, physical therapy, bracing, and orthotics. 7. Females not of childbearing potential, defined as post- menopausal for at least 1 year, or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), or practicing one of the following medically acceptable methods of birth control throughout the study period: • Hormonal methods such as oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives for a m inimum of 1 full cycle (based on the subject’s usual menstrual cycle period) before CNTX -4975- 05 administration • Total abstinence from sexual intercourse since the last menses before CNTX -4975-05 administration • Intrauterine device • Double barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, with spermicidal jellies or cream). 8. Able to speak, read, and understand the language of the study used for the informed consent. 9. Willing and able to: a) understand the study requirements b) abide by the study restrictions and requirements c) complete the study procedures d) be compliant and independently (i.e., without assistance) record responses on the efficacy scales during clinic visits e) independently communicate meaningfully with the study personnel 10. Signed informed consent form (ICF) approved by the institutional review board (IRB) /independent ethics committee (IEC) . 11. Subjects may come into the study with a single analgesic of their choice for their OA knee pain. The current pain medication must be identified as that taken only for pain in the knee OA or pain in the PJR/TJR, and not for another pain indication. The subjects will complete a daily paper diary of their background knee analgesic medications during the screening period and throughout the trial. Other analgesics may be taken for occasional pain but should not be"

Every reasonable attempt should be made by the investigator to keep subjects in the study. However, subjects must be withdrawn from the study if they withdraw consent to participate. Investigators must attempt to contact subjects who fail to attend scheduled visits by telephone or other means to exclude the possibility of an AE being the cause of withdrawal. Should this be the cause, the AE must be documented, reported, and followed as described in Section 11.2. The sponsor reserves the right to request the withdrawal of a subject due to protocol deviations or other reasons. The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study at any time for lack of therapeutic effect that is intolerable or otherwise unacceptable to the subject, for intolerable or unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness, noncompliance with study procedures, administrative reasons, or in the investigator’s opinion, to protect the subject’s best interest. If a subject is withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal and the date of discontinuation will be recorded on the appropriate page of the electronic case report form ( eCRF). Whenever possible and reasonable, the evaluations that were to be conducted at the completion of the study should be performed at the time of premature discontinuation. 8.4 Subject Replacement Criteria Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. If a substantial number of subjects are withdrawn from the study, the sponsor will evaluate the need for developing replacement criteria. Enrolled subjects withdrawn from the study may not reenter. The subject number for a withdrawn subject will not b e reassigned to another subject."

(prescription or OTC). The current pain medication is to be taken only for OA knee pain, not for another pain indication (such as knee pain in the knee with a PJR/TJR ). This medication will be considered the subject’s “background” medication; for subjects having both knees injected with CNTX-4975, background medications are those used to treat either knee. From screening through the end of the study, s ubject s are not to change to a different background pain medication .

A ny change in dose, change in dose frequency, or discontinuation of background medication should be entered into the paper diary and the eCRF . Subjects may take another analgesic as rescue medication for pain of the index knee as needed . The rescue medication is not allowed to be in the same drug class as the ongoing background medication. For example, subjects will not be allowed to take tramadol as a rescue medication if they are already taking an opioid, or an NSAID as rescue if they are already taking an NSAID. Data on the type of rescue and background medication, and the daily dose , will be reported daily by the subjects using a paper diary . Additional rescue medication details will be collected at study visits and follow-up telephone calls in the source documents and eCRF. Subjects should not take rescue medication for knee osteoarthritis pain, or for other pain, within 24 hours prior to a clinic visit. Other analgesics may be taken for occasional pain, but should not be taken within 24 hours of a clinic visit; these are to be recorded as concomitant medications, not as rescue or background medication for knee osteoarthritis. 9.12.2 Prohibited Therapies The following therapies are prohibited both prior to and during the study: • Injection of corticosteroids in the index knee from 90 days prior to Screening through study comple tion. • Current use of opioids for any condition other than for OA of the injected knees or PJR/TJR knees (maximum dose of 15 mg of hydrocodone [or equivalent] per day as background medication allowed at entry). • Regular use of anticoagulant blood thinners (except low -dose aspirin, Dabigatran 150 mg qd, Enoxaparin 40 mg qd, Rivaroxaban 10 mg qd, or Apixaban 2.5 mg bid, which are allowed). • Use of an investigational medication within 30 days or 5 pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Screening or while participating in the study. • Physical /occupational/chiropractic therapy for the lower extremities or acupuncture for the lower extremities within 15 days of Screening , or need for such therapy during the course of the study. • Joint replacement surgery of the index knee at any time, or open surgery of the index knee in the past 24 months prior to Screening , or prior arthroscopic surgery of the index knee within 6 months of Screening. For subjects with bilateral knee OA who will receive an injection into both knees, j oint replacement surgery of both knees at any time, or open surgery of the index knee in the past 24 months , is excluded. • Surgery, or other invasive procedures, or IA injections (other than CNTX-4975-05) while participating in the study. • Subjects should not take a hot bath or shower, or expose the injected knee (s) to external heat, within 12 hours after the injection."

The KOOS has been validated for several orthopedic interventions such as anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, menisce ctomy , and total knee replacement. In addition, the instrument has been used to evaluate physical therapy, nutritional supplementation, and glucosamine supplementation. The effect size is generally largest for the subscale QOL followed by the subscale Pain. The KOOS is a valid, reliable , and responsive self-administered instrument that can be used for short -term and long -term follow -up of several types of knee injury, including OA. 10.3.1.3 Joint Replacement Questionnaire The investigator will judge the likelihood of the need for joint replacement surgery, based on KOOS subscales and subject satisfaction outcomes. The subject will judge the likelihood of the desire for joint replacement surgery, based on their personal response to treatment with CNTX-4975-05. 10.3.1.4 Subjec t Satisfaction Questionnaire Subjects will be asked to rate their overall satisfaction with the treatment procedure. S ubjects with a PJR/TJR will also compare their satisfaction with their PJR/TJR versus their CNTX -4975-05 treatment. These will be rated us ing the following 7 -point scale: 1 – Completely dissatisfied 2 – Mostly dissatisfied 3 – Somewhat dissatisfied 4 – Neither satisfied or dissatisfied 5 – Somewhat satisfied 6 – Mostly satisfied 7 – Completely satisfied Subjects will also be asked whether they would undergo the study treatment again. 10.3.1.5 Investigator Satisfaction Questionnaire The investigator will rate his or her satisfaction with the subject’s study treatment.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (includin g a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the product, whether or not related to the product. Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is an increase in the frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the disease or condition (worsening of a pre-existing condition is considered an AE). Events occurring in subjects treated with placebo or active comparator or during treatment- free periods of the study are also considered AEs. 11.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Event An expected AE is one for which the nature or severity is consistent with the known AE profile of the product. For an investigational product, the known information is contained in the IB. For a marketed product, the known information is contained in the current package insert for the product. An unexpected adverse event (UAE) is one for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the current IB. For example, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vascular accidents. Furthermore, reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already documented adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. Examples would be (a) acute renal failure as an expected adverse reaction with a subsequent new occurrence of interstitial nephritis (interstitial nephritis would be unexpected) and (b) hepatitis with a first occurrence of fulminant hepatitis (fulminant hepatitis would be unexpected). 11.1.3 Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose • results in death • is life-threatening NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. • requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization NOTE: Inpatient hospitalization is defined as 24 hours in a hospital or an overnight stay. An elective hospital admission to treat a condition present before exposure to the test drug, or a hospital admission for a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not qualify the condition"

Further, an overnight stay in the hospital that is only due to transport ation, organization, or accommodation problems and without medical background does not need to be considered an SAE. • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • is a congenital anomaly NOTE: A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to the IP during pregnancy is an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that has received an IP is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the IP(s) interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. • is an important medical event NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 11.1.4 Significant Adverse Events Other significant AEs are defined as marked hematological and other labora tory abnormalities (other than those meeting the definition of serious) and any events that led to an intervention, including withdrawal of IP, dose reduction, or significant additional concomitant therapy. 11.1.5 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events An AE is define d as treatment emergent if the first onset or worsening is after the first administration of IP. 11.2 Management of Adverse Events Adverse events will be collected from the time of signing the ICF through the Week 8/ET Visit. 11.2.1 Adverse Event of Special Interest : Severe Allergic Reaction – Anaphylaxis/ Anaphylactoid Reaction Only study sites with crash carts or equivalent and ACLS -certified personnel immediately available are permitted to treat subjects with study drug. A case of laryngospasm was observed during a hip replacement operation after capsaicin was instilled into the surgical wound , requiring the subject to be intubated during the procedure. A case of severe allergic reaction was seen immediately after CNTX -4975- 05 was injected into the knee of a subjec t in study CNTX-4975i- OA-303, with the subject complaining of dyspnea and tachycardia. Epinephrine 0.5 mg and IM solumedrol were given, and the subject recovered in minutes, with no subsequent adverse events. Anaphylactic Reaction An anaphylactic reaction is a rapid onset serious allergic reaction that has a variety of symptoms and outcomes, which can include death. An anaphylactic reaction typically has symptoms and signs starting over minutes to hours. Anaphylaxis causes more than one of the following: l ow"

Anaphylactoid reaction These reactions produce the same clinical signs and symptoms anaphylactic reactions, but are not IgE mediated, but instead occur through a direct non- immune -mediated release of mediators from basophils and/or mast cells or can manifest from direct complement activation. All subjects must be monitored for at least 30 minutes (or longer, as required by the protocol) afte r study drug injection to ensure that they do not have a hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis. Vital signs (VS) are to be done pre- injection and 5 minutes after the injection, standing and sitting, and then vital signs must now be taken at 15 and 30 minutes (sitting only) after injection of study drug Any subject that meets the criteria for anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions, as described in the paper by Sampson et al. (2006) 13 (see Appendix C) following the first/prior injection is prohibited from being re -treated with study drug. Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled: 1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips- tongue -uvula), AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING : a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end- organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips -tongue- uvula) b. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours) : a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP ∗ b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person's baseline Source: Sampson et al. (2006) Abbreviations: PEF, Peak expiratory flow; BP, blood pressure. ∗ Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as less than 70 mmHg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mmHg + [2 × age]) from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mmHg from 11 to 17 years."

All anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events (e.g. rash, dyspnea, gastrointestinal symptoms) must be recorded with the time that the events occurred and resolved , and treatments (e.g. epinephrine) should be recorded with their time of administration. 11.2.2 Collecti on The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE described previously. At each visit, the subject will be allowed time to spontaneously report any issues since the last vis it or evaluation. The investigator will then monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using nonleading questions, such as • “How are you feeling?” • “Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?” • “Have you taken any new medications since your last vi sit?” Any clinically relevant observations made during the visit will also be considered AEs . 11.2.3 Evaluation 11.2.3.1 Severity of Adverse Events The clinical severity of an AE will be classified as Mild Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing disc omfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. Severe Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. It is important to distinguish betw een severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classification of intensity , whereas an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as described in Section 11.1.3. 11.2.3.2 Seriousnes s The investigator i s to evaluate whether the AE meets serious criteria , as described in Section 11.1.3. 11.2.3.3 Action(s) Taken Action(s) taken may consist of Dose increased An indication that a medication schedule was modified by addition; either by changing the frequency, strength or amount."

Dose reduced An indication that a medication schedule was modified by subtraction, either by changing the frequency, strength or amount. Drug interrupted An indication that a medication schedule was modified by temporarily terminating a prescribed regimen of medication. Drug withdrawn An indication that a medication schedule was modified through termination of a prescribed regimen of medication. Not applicable Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context. Unknown Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused. 11.2.3.4 Outcome at the Time of Last Observation • The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as • Recovered/resolved • Recovered/resolved with sequelae • Recovering/resolving • Not recovered/not resolved • Fatal* • Unknown *Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than one AE is possibly related to the subject’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE. Although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained death should be reported as SAEs. 11.2.3.5 Adverse Event Relationship to Investigational Product The investigator must make an assessment of each AE’s relationship to the IP. The categories for classifying the investigator’s opinion of the relationship are listed below. Not related An AE with sufficient evidence to accept that there is no causal relationship to IP administration (e .g., no temporal relationship to drug administration, because the drug was administered after onset of event; investigation shows that the drug was not administered; another cause was proven). Unlikely related An AE, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to IP administration that makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, events or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. Possibly related An AE with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the IP, but which could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or events. Information on drug with drawal may be lacking or unclear."

The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) is clinica lly reasonable. 11.2.4 Documentation All AEs occurring within the period of observation for the study must be documented in the eCRF with the following in formation, where appropriate. ( The period of observation for the study is described in Section 11.2 .) • AE name or term • When the AE first occurred (start date and time) • When the AE stopped (stop date and time or an indication of “ongoing”) • Severity of the AE • Seriousness (hospitalization, death, etc.) • Actions taken • Outcome • Investigator opinion regarding the AE relationship to the IP(s) 11.2.5 Treatment of Adverse Events Adverse events that occur during the study will be treated, if necessary, by established standards of care. The decision about whether the subject may continue in the study will be made by the sponsor after consultation with the investigator and/or medical monitor. If AEs occur in a subject that are not tolerable, the investigator must decide whether to stop the subject’s involvement in the study and/or treat the subject . Special procedures may be recommended for the specific IP, such as the collection of a serum sample for determining blood concentrations of IP , specific tapering procedures, or treat ment regimens, as appropriate. 11.2.6 Follow- up Any AE will be followed to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can be explained by another known cause(s) (i .e., concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates that f urther evaluation is not warranted. Potentially related AEs that are ongoing at the Week 8 clinic visit will be followed until they are stable, resolved, or no longer clinically significant, in the opinion of the investigator, or until 4 weeks after the study is completed. All findings relevant to the final outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject’s medical record and recorded on the eCRF page."

Women should be instructed to contact the investigator or study staff immediately if pregnancy occurs or is sus pected. Pregnancy testing will be conducted prior to administration of CNTX-4975-05 on every woman of childbearing potential. A woman who is found to be pregnant at the Screening Visit will be excluded from the study and considered to be a S creening failure. A woman who becomes pregnant within 2 days of treatment with CNTX -4975-05 will be immediately discontinued from study participation. The investigator must report the pregnancy as if it were an SAE within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy, to Pharmacovigilance using the Pregnancy Data Collection Form via the same fax number and/or email address as for SAE reporting. The investigator should contact the designated individual(s) who receive SAE notification and record information related to the pregnancy on an SAE and AE form (entering the event temporarily as non-serious on both forms) provided by the sponsor or its designee. Early Termination Visit assessments are required as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy. The investigator is also responsible for following the pregnancy until delivery or termination. These findings must be reported on the SAE and AE form and forwarded to the designated individual(s). The event meets the SAE criterion only if it results in a spontaneous abortion or a congenital anomaly. 11.3.2 Overdose The maximal dose of CNTX-4975-05 should not be exceeded during the study."

Membership in the analysis populations will be determined prior to database lock. 13.4 Statistical Analyses This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses. A statistical analysis plan that describes the details of the analyses to be conducted will be written prior to database lock. Unless otherwise indicated, all testing of statistical significance will be two -sided, and a difference resulting in a p value of ≤0.05 will be considered statistically significant. To control for the overall type I error rate, hierarchical testing based on fixed sequence procedure will be used. If statistical significance is declared for the primary analysis, formal hypothesis testing will be done for the secondary endpoints until a non- significant result is reached. All other p values from secondary and exploratory endpoints , after a non -significant p value is reached , will be considered nominal. For analyses involving study site, if the number of subjects per site is small, sites may be pooled for analysis, or omitted from statistical models. The final determination will be made prior to database lock. Summary statistics will be provided for the variables described below. For continuous variables, these statistics will typically include the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, these statistics will typically include the number and percentage of subjects in each category. 13.4.1 Study Subjects and Demographics 13.4.1.1 Disposition and Withdrawals The numbers of subjects treated , completing, and withdra wing, along with reasons for withdrawal, will be tabulated overall, by subject type, and by injection procedure. The number of subjects in each analysis population will be reported. 13.4.1.2 Protocol Deviations Protocol deviations will be identified and summarized or listed as appropriate. 13.4.1.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics These analyses will be conducted for all analysis populations. Demographic variables will include age, sex/gender, height, and weight. Information on race and ethnicity will be collected for any eventual analysis of differences in response to CNTX-4975-05, in accordance with local regulatory requirements.

Injection procedure details and CNTX-4975-05 batch or lot number(s) will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF/electronic data capture (EDC) system and summarized or listed as appropriate. 13.4.3 Efficacy Analyses Efficacy variables will be summarized and analyzed using the ITT population, unless otherwise specified. 13.4.3.1 Primary Analysis The primary analysis will compare each experimental treatment regimen to the Breg Cooling Control Group using an equally -weighted, co mbined score calculated from the following 3 measures: 1) pain 30 minutes after CNTX -4975- 05 injection ( using the 0 -4 scale of none, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe) , 2) SS with the treatment regimen; and 3) IS with the treatment regimen , all assessed on the index knee. Ratios of the mean values of test/control will have 95% confidence intervals constructed for each treatment regimen versus the Breg Cooling Control Group. For a treatment regimen to be considered clinically acceptable, it must be no more than 30% worse than the Breg Cooling Control Group and the lower limit o f the 95% confidence interval for the treatment regimen must be greater than 0.7. This analysis will be performed on the ITT population. For analysis, satisfaction scores ( SS and IS) and 30 minute pain after CNTX -4975- 05 injection will be transformed to equivalent scales, and 30 minute pain after CNTX -4975- 05 injection will be reverse- scored so that higher scores represent lower pain, in order to have the 3 components on the same scale before they are combined by summing the 3 scores for a composite score. A sensitivity analysis will be performed that creates a composite score using the original scales (with the pain scores still reverse- scored to ensure the direction of the effect remains the same), using the ITT population. All other continuous secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoint s will be summarized using descriptive statistics by subject type, experimental treatment regimen, and week/visit, as appropriate, and analyzed using a mixed -model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis or by analysis of covariance, as appropriate. Categorical endpoints will be compared between treatments using Pearson’s chi- square or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the safety population. 13.4.3.2 Secondary and Exploratory Analyses Secondary and exploratory analyses will include analysis of the combined score by subject type, OMERACT -OARSI responders, KOOS subscale (including AUCs ), and SS."

An anaphylactic reaction typically has symptoms and signs starting over minutes to hours. Anaphylaxis causes more than one of the following: low blood pressure, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, an itchy rash, throat or tongue swelling, and vomiting . Anaphylactoid reaction These reactions produce the same clinical signs and symptoms anaphyla ctic reactions, but are not IgE mediated, but instead occur through a direct non- immune -mediated release of mediators from basophils and/or mast cells or can manifest from direct complement activation.

In July 2005, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and Food Allergy andAnaphylaxis Network convened a second meeting on anaphylaxis, which included representatives from 16 different organizations or government bodies, including representativesfrom North America, Europe, and Australia, to continue working toward a universally accepted deﬁnition of anaphylaxis, establish clinical criteria that would accuratelyidentify cases of anaphylaxis with high precision, furtherreview the evidence on the most appropriate managementof anaphylaxis, and outline the research needs in this area.(J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;117:391-7.) Key words: Anaphylaxis, IgE mediated hypersensitivity, anaphylac toid, epinephrine Even though anaphylaxis was ﬁrst described around 100 years ago and is one of the most alarming disorders encountered in medicine, there is no universal agreement on its deﬁnition or criteria for diagnosis. Furthermore, this lack of speciﬁc criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis hasgreatly hampered research into the epidemiology, patho physiology, and management of this disorder; led to confusion on the part of ﬁrst responders, emergencypersonnel, primary care physicians, and patients; and resulted in a failure to diagnose and treat anaphylaxis in a consistent manner. 1-3 In an attempt to resolve these problems, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) convened a meeting in April 2004 to address thesedeﬁciencies. 4This 2 day symposium brought together experts and representatives from 13 professional, governmental, and lay organizations to address the issue ofdeﬁning and managing anaphylaxis.

Clinical criteria were proposed that emphasized the need for heightened suspicion of anaphylaxis in patients with a previous history of allergic reactions to a speciﬁc allergen and a known exposure, as well as in patients in whom there is no known history of allergic reactions. Recently, the Joint Task Force of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and theAmerican College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunologypublished an updated practice parameter on the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis. 5In this report the Task Force deﬁned anaphylaxis as ‘‘as a condition caused by an IgE mediated reaction’’ and noted that such reactions ‘‘are often life threatening and almost always unantici pated.’’ The purpose of the practice parameter was toprovide ‘‘the practicing physician with an evidence basedapproach to the diagnosis and management of anaphy lactic reactions.’’ In July 2005, the NIAID and FAAN convened a second meeting, which included representatives from the previous organizations and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the Aus tralasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy,and the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, to begin the process of facilitating an international agree ment. The purpose of this second NIAID/FAAN Symposium was to continue working toward a universally accepted deﬁnition of anaphylaxis, establish clinical crit eria that would accurately identify cases of anaphylaxiswith high precision, further review the evidence on themost appropriate management of anaphylaxis, and outline the research needs in this area. DEFINITION OF ANAPHYLAXIS AND CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially fatal, systemic allergic reaction that occurs suddenly after contact with an allergy causing substance. Participants at the symposium agreed that a brief, broad deﬁnition of anaphylaxis that reﬂected its course and potential severity would be most useful to both the medical and lay community andrecommended the following: ‘‘Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death.’’ To identify individuals experiencing such a reaction, criteria proposed at the ﬁrst symposium were revised, 4as outlined in Table I . Participants at the second symposium agreed that the diagnostic criteria must provide theemergency responder or treating physician with a rela tively simple and rapid means to make the diagnosis ofanaphylaxis. It was acknowledged that no criteria will provide 100% sensitivity and speciﬁcity, but it was be lieved that the criteria proposed are likely to capturemore than 95% of cases of anaphylaxis. Because the ma jority of anaphylactic reactions include skin symptoms, 5-10 which are noted in more than 80% of cases when care fully assessed, it was judged that at least 80% of anaphy lactic reactions should be identiﬁed by criterion 1, even when the allergic status of the patient and potential causeof the reaction might be unknown. However, cutaneoussymptoms might be absent in up to 20% of anaphylactic reactions in children with food allergy or insect sting al lergy. 11-13Consequently, in patients with a known allergic history and possible exposure, criterion 2 would provide ample evidence that an anaphylactic reaction was occur ring. Gastrointestinal symptoms were included as a pertinent target response because they have been associated with severe outcomes in various anaphylactic reactions. 9 Finally, criterion 3 should identify the rare patients who experience an acute hypotensive episode after exposureto a known allergen, as described by Pumphrey and Stanworth. 14Although participants believed that these cri teria should accurately identify anaphylactic reactions in more than 95% of cases, it was agreed that these criteria need to be subjected to a prospective multicenter clinical survey to establish their utility and determine whetherthere is need for further reﬁnement. MANAGEMENT OF ANAPHYLAXIS As with the treatment of any critically ill patient, the treatment of anaphylaxis begins with a rapid assessmentand maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation. When a patient fulﬁlls any of the 3 criteria of anaphylaxis outlined above, the patient should receive epinephrineimmediately because epinephrine is the treatment of choice in anaphylaxis. There undoubtedly will be patients who present with symptoms not yet fulﬁllingthe criteria of anaphylaxis yet in whom it would beappropriate to initiate therapy with epinephrine, such as a patient with a history of near fatal anaphylaxis to peanut who ingested peanut and within minutes is experiencingurticaria and generalized ﬂushing. Subsequent interven tions are determined on the basis of the clinical course and response to epinephrine. In general, participants at theSecond NIAID/FAAN Anaphylaxis Symposium support the therapeutic approach outlined in recently published guidelines. 5A summary of these guidelines is provided below, along with a more detailed discussion of the recommended route of parenteral epinephrine, positioning during treatment of anaphylaxis, and suggested observa tion periods after treatment of an anaphylactic episode. Epinephrine Epinephrine is the treatment of choice for anaphylaxis.5 Aqueous epinephrine, 0.01 mg/kg (maximum dose,J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL FEBRUARY 2006392 Sampson et al Food allergy, dermatologic diseases, and anaphylaxis"
95,page_95,"0.5 mg) administered intramuscularly every 5 to 15 minutes as necessary, is the recommended dosage for controllingsymptoms and maintaining blood pressure. 15,16The 5 minute interval between injections can be liberalized to permit more frequent injections if deemed necessary by the clinician. Intramuscular versus subcutaneous epinephrine. As t u d y in children not experiencing anaphylaxis demonstratedmore rapid absorption and higher plasma epinephrine levelswhen epinephrine was administered intramuscularly in the anterior lateral thigh with an autoinjector when compared with values after subcutaneous administration. 17Similarly, in adults not experiencing anaphylaxis, peak plasma epinephrine concentrations were attained more quickly and were higher after intramuscular epinephrine was injected into the thigh than after epinephrine was injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the upper arm (deltoid). 18 Similar results were obtained with both an ampule of epinephrine or a spring loaded (eg, EpiPen [Dey, Napa,Calif]) automatic epinephrine device. 17,18Epinephrine in jected intramuscularly into the deltoid or subcutaneouslyover the deltoid did not result in a signiﬁcant increase ofplasma epinephrine levels over endogenous epinephrine levels. It should be noted that studies of the route of injection have not been performed in patients experiencing anaphylaxis. On the basis of this evidence, the participants of theNIAID/FAAN Symposium concluded that intramuscular administration of injectable epinephrine in the anterior lat eral thigh is preferred over subcutaneous injection. However, as noted below, intravenous epinephrine might be preferred in some cases if an intravenous line is in place (eg, during surgery). Intravenous epinephrine. Intravenous epinephrine is an option for patients with severe hypotension or cardiacarrest unresponsive to intramuscular doses of epinephrineand ﬂuid resuscitation. Although there is no preciselyestablished dosage or regimen for intravenous epinephrine in anaphylaxis, 5 to 10 mg intravenous bolus (0.2 mg/kg) doses for hypotension and 0.1 to 0.5 mg administered intravenously in the presence of cardiovascular collapsehave been suggested. 19A recent single center trial de scribed successful initial management with intravenousepinephrine infusions for anaphylaxis with hypotension,suggesting that this might be a viable strategy. 10,20 Detailed procedures for the preparation and administration of epinephrine infusions have been published. 5It is important to recognize the potential for lethal arrhythmias when administering intravenous epinephrine, and there fore continuous cardiac monitoring is recommended.Continuous low dose epinephrine infusions might repre sent the safest and most effective form of intravenous de livery because the dose can be titrated to the desired effectand can avoid the potential for accidental administration oflarge boluses of epinephrine. Oxygen and adrenergic agonists High ﬂow oxygen (through a nonrebreather mask or endotracheal tube) should be administered to patients ex periencing respiratory symptoms or hypoxemia. Those who are hemodynamically unstable might beneﬁt from oxygenas well. Inhaled b 2agonists, such as albuterol, might be useful for bronchospasm refractory to epinephrine.5 Positioning of the patient Patients in anaphylactic shock (ie, those with anaphy laxis and signs of critical organ hypoperfusion) should beplaced in a recumbent position with the lower extremities elevated unless precluded by shortness of breath or vomiting. These recommendations are based on evidencethat passive leg raise can increase stroke volume and cardiac output by shifting ﬂuid centrally in patients in shock. 21Furthermore, observations of victims of fatal anaphylactic shock suggest that postural changes, such as moving to a more upright position or being prevented from taking a supine posture, might have contributed tothe fatal outcome. 22 Fluid resuscitation Patients who remain hypotensive despite epinephrine should have aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation. Large volumesTABLE I. Clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulﬁlled: 1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or ﬂushing, swollen lips tongue uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWINGa. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Involvement of the skin mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch ﬂush, swollen lips tongue uvula) b. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age speciﬁc) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP * b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline PEF, Peak expiratory ﬂow; BP, blood pressure. *Low systolic blood pressure for children is deﬁned as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg 1[23age]) from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 117, NUMBER 2Sampson et al 393 Food allergy, dermatologic diseases, and anaphylaxis"
96,page_96,"of crystalloid might be needed in the ﬁrst 5 to 10 minutes; in severe reactions with hypotension, up to 35% of the blood volume might extravasate in the ﬁrst 10 minutes,and vasodilatation can cause pooling, with even more reduction in the effective blood volume and thus distrib utive shock. 23The volume given must be tailored to the clinical situation; persistent hypotension requires a more aggressive approach with multiple ﬂuid boluses (10 20 mL/kg under pressure), including colloid, as well as crystalloid, whereas a largely respiratory reaction or one thatresponds promptly to initial treatment requires less aggres sive ﬂuid management. Vasopressors Potent vasopressors, such as noradrenaline, vasopres sin, or metaraminol, might be required to overcome vasodilatation if epinephrine and ﬂuid resuscitation havefailed to maintain a systolic blood pressure of greater than90 mm Hg. 20Recent case reports and animal studies have demonstrated that vasopressin is useful when treatinghemorrhagic and septic shock. The effect of vasopressinon systemic anaphylaxis has not been investigated, except in clinical case reports. Vasopressin increases blood pres sure because of vasoconstriction through the V1 receptor. 24 H1- and H 2-antihistamines Antihistamines (H 1and H 2antagonists) are slower in onset of action than epinephrine, have little effect on blood pressure, and should be considered a second line treatment for anaphylaxis. Antihistamines are useful for the symptomatic treatment of urticaria angioedema and pru ritus. Diphenhydramine, administered intravenously orintramuscularly (or orally for mild symptoms), can begiven at 25 to 50 mg for adults and 1 mg/kg (up to 50 mg) for children. Treatment with a combination of H 1 and H2antagonists has been reported to be more effective in attenuating the cutaneous manifestations of anaphylaxis than treatment with H 1antagonists alone.25,26Ranitidine and cimetidine have been most studied, but no controlled studies have demonstrated superiority of one H 2antagonist over another. Corticosteroids The effectiveness of corticosteroids in anaphylaxis has never been determined in placebo controlled trials. However, their usefulness in other allergic diseases hasled to their incorporation into anaphylaxis management.Because the onset of action is slow, steroids are not useful in the acute management stage. It has been suggested thattheir use might prevent a protracted or biphasic reaction, although there is no evidence to prove this. 11,27If given, the dosing of intravenous corticosteroids should be equiv alent to 1.0 to 2.0 mg/kg per dose of methylprednisolone every 6 hours. Oral administration of prednisone, 1.0 mg/kg, up to 50 mg might be sufﬁcient for milder attacks. Glucagon for persistent hypotension in patients taking b-blockers Although there are no epidemiologic studies that dem onstrate increased frequency of anaphylaxis in patients receiving bblockers, there are multiple reported cases of increased severity or treatment refractory anaphylaxis inthese patients. 28Theoretically, there are multiple mecha nisms by which bblockade could blunt the response to epinephrine. If administration of epinephrine in thesepatients is ineffective, administration of glucagon can be attempted. Glucagon is thought to reverse refractory hypo tension and bronchospasm by activating adenylate cyclaseindependent of the breceptor; however, the occurrence and importance of this mechanism of action in anaphylaxis is unproved. The recommended dosage for glucagonis 1 to 5 mg (20 30 mg/kg [maximum dose, 1 mg] in children) administered intravenously over 5 minutes and followed by an infusion (5 15 mg/min) titrated to clinical response. Airway protection must be ensured because glucagon frequently causes emesis. Observation After the treatment of an anaphylactic reaction, an observation period should be considered for all patientsbecause the reaction might recur as the effect of epineph rine wears off (intramuscular epinephrine results in in creased serum levels for an hour or more) and because ofthe risk of a biphasic reaction. The occurrence of biphasic reactions has been established in the literature and appears to occur in 1% to 20% of anaphylactic reactions (asdepicted in Table II ). 8,11,27,29-34In a study evaluating patients with fatal or near fatal food reactions, approxi mately 20% of patients experienced a biphasic reaction, indicating that biphasic reactions might be more likelyin patients who present initially with severe symptoms. 11 The reported time intervals between the initial reactionTABLE II.

97,page_97,"and the onset of the second phase ranged from 1 to 72 hours.11,27,30-34Unfortunately, no reliable clinical predic tors have been identiﬁed to enable the identiﬁcation of patients at increased risk of a biphasic reaction, although some studies have suggested that patients requiring higherdoses of epinephrine to control initial symptoms or de layed administration of epinephrine might be associated with increased risk of a biphasic reaction. 11,15,33,34 Generally, the same organ systems are involved in the initial and secondary reaction. However, in the study by Smit et al,83 patients with initially stable vital signs returned with abnormal vital signs (2 with hypotensionand 1 with dyspnea and decreased oxygen saturation). On the basis of the evidence to date, the participants attending the NIAID/FAAN Symposium recommendedthat observation periods be individualized on the basis of the severity of the initial reaction, reliability of the patient, and access to care. A reasonable length of timeto consider observing the postanaphylactic patient is 4 to 6 hours in most patients, with prolonged observation times or hospital admission for patients with severe or refractorysymptoms. More caution should be used in patients withreactive airway disease because most fatalities associated with anaphylaxis occur in these patients. Outpatient follow-up and management Patients who have experienced anaphylaxis from ex posures that might be encountered in nonmedical settings should carry self injectable epinephrine for use if anaphy laxis develops.5,11As noted above, there has been no uni versally accepted deﬁnition of anaphylaxis. Therefore the clinical criteria suggested above might be helpful in deter mining who should be prescribed self injectable epineph rine. Until there are universally accepted criteria for thediagnosis of anaphylaxis, the indications for the prescription of self injectable epinephrine will continue to be problematic. Currently, there is a consensus that patients experiencing respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms afterexposure to a known allergen in the community should receive self injectable epinephrine. Beyond this consen sus, it is unclear who should be given a prescription forself injectable epinephrine. However, limiting prescrip tions of self injectable epinephrine to this criteria in patients with peanut and other nut allergy, for example,would fail to cover up to 80% of patients experiencing a fatal anaphylactic reaction. 35Patients who are prescribed self injectable epinephrine should also have an emergency action plan detailing its use and the follow up management. The complexities of prescribing self injectable epinephrine and providing an accompanying emergency action plan have been described recently by Sicherer andSimons, 36and the ethical dilemmas have been discussed by Hu et al.37 Before discharge from an emergency facility, all patients experiencing an anaphylactic reaction should receive information about how to avoid the precipitating allergen (if known). Other issues to consider includealerting patients about national organizations providingimportant information and educational materials (eg, theFood Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, www.foodallergy. org), as well as being advised to obtain prompt follow up with an allergist and notify their primary care physician. At present, these 3 steps (ie, self injectable epinephrine prescription, patient education, and follow up evaluation)are infrequently performed in North American emergency departments. 38,39Because emergency departments are the treatment setting for most anaphylaxis visits,1this repre sents an important and as yet untapped opportunity toimprove patient care. RESEARCH NEEDS The investigation of anaphylaxis has been impeded by the lack of universally accepted diagnostic criteria andthe absence of reliable laboratory biomarkers to conﬁrm the clinical impression. This in turn has thwarted effortsto ascertain the incidence and outcome of anaphylaxis in various populations, to determine the most effective forms of therapy, to identify patients at risk for life threateninganaphylaxis, and to elucidate the basic immunologic andpathogenic mechanisms responsible for the variable course of anaphylaxis in different individuals. A multi center prospective study of the diagnostic criteria proposed herein is needed to determine whether they allow the clinician and investigator to identify accurately pa tients with anaphylaxis regardless of cause. Assuming thatthese criteria prove to be adequately sensitive and speciﬁc for diagnosing anaphylaxis, studies determining the inci dence, cause, clinical features, natural course, and outcome of anaphylaxis are needed to provide the clinician with evidence based features of this disorder that will enable more effective prevention and therapeutic interventions. Clinical trials can be facilitated by the formationof an anaphylaxis consortium. It was believed that the measurement of certain mast cell derived mediators, such as histamine and tryptase,would provide conﬁrmatory evidence of an anaphylactic reaction. However, in a series of 97 patients presenting to an emergency department and given diagnoses of anaphylaxis, only 42% were found to have increased plasma histamine levels, and 21% were determined to have increased plasma tryptase levels. 26One small study dem onstrated that serial estimations of plasma tryptase levelsmight improve sensitivity (36% to 73%). 40Sensitive and speciﬁc biomarkers of anaphylaxis and evolving anaphylaxis are needed that will establish the presence of thedisorder when sufﬁcient historical information is not available or symptoms are atypical. New proteomic ap proaches, metabolomic approaches, or both might proveuseful in identifying relevant biomarkers. Biomarker assays could be useful to conﬁrm the diagnosis when in doubt, which can have important follow up implications.If available at the bedside, they could even assist in the identiﬁcation of patients at risk of persistent or delayed phase reactions. However, given the emergency and fulminant nature of this disease, such approaches are unlikelyto be useful for guiding immediate resuscitativeJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 117, NUMBER 2Sampson et al 395 Food allergy, dermatologic diseases, and anaphylaxis"
98,page_98,"interventions. Laboratory trials can be facilitated by the formation of an anaphylaxis registry with close collaboration between different centers and across specialties. As outlined in the previous symposium, 4most anaphy lactic reactions are due to IgE mediated hypersensitivityreactions resulting from cross linking of allergen speciﬁc IgE molecules on the surface of tissue mast cells and pos sibly basophils. However, this mechanism alone does notexplain the severity of the allergic manifestations, the var iability in target organ responses among individuals or within the same individual, the differences in thresholddoses of allergen necessary to provoke anaphylactic responses, the variable responses to therapy, the induction of biphasic or protracted anaphylactic reactions, or the eventual outcome of the reaction. A recent study suggested that the diversity of IgE allergenic epitope recog nition might play a role in the severity of allergic responses, 41but this represents a fraction of the potential variables occurring between the time an allergen enters the body and the end result of an anaphylactic reaction. For example, it might be informative to perform genomicand functional studies of polymorphisms or gain of function mutations in various mediator, cytokine, and chemo kine receptors; the Kit receptor; elements of intracellular signaling pathways; or other factors that might inﬂuenceeither the activation or function of the effector cells of anaphylaxis or the responses of the structural cells in the target organs affected in this disorder. In addition, investigation is required into the patho physiologic mechanisms and appropriate treatment ofreactions fulﬁlling the diagnostic criteria listed foranaphylaxis but that do not involve an IgE mediated mechanism, commonly referred to as anaphylactoid or pseudoallergic reactions . Furthermore, studies have sug gested a role for the nervous system in eliciting the full symptom complex of anaphylaxis, 42and this is an area that warrants further investigation. Well characterized animal models would clearly facilitate efforts to understandthe basic pathophysiology occurring during anaphylaxis; to determine the interactions between various cell types; to elucidate effects of mediators, cytokines, and chemokines released during an anaphylactic response; and to delineate better therapeutic strategies. Recently, animal models that appear reﬂective of anaphylaxis in humansubjects have been established in mice, 43dogs,44and pigs,45but better models are needed. During the NIAID/FAAN Symposium and in the recently published practice parameter on anaphylaxis,5 therapeutic strategies for the management of anaphylaxis were suggested largely on the basis of ‘‘clinical experi ence.’’ In fact, there is a major need to evaluate the mostappropriate therapeutic measures and medications for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Although virtually all au thorities agree that epinephrine is the drug of choice forthe treatment of acute anaphylaxis, there are limited data on the appropriate dose, timing, route, or frequency of administration. H 1a n dH 2antihistamines, corticosteroids, or both are commonly used in the treatment of anaphy laxis, but there are virtually no data demonstrating theirfunctional role or effectiveness. Prospective controlledtrials to establish the appropriate dosing of these medications and the role of other therapeutic interventions, such as the optimal type and rate of ﬂuid replacement, and the use of vasopressors, glucagon, nebulized albuterol orepinephrine, leukotriene inhibitors, and cytokine antago nists (eg, anti TNF) also are warranted. Ideally, therapeutic measures could be studied in appropriate animal models before initiating clinical trials. Before any clinical studies, clinically useful severity scoring and outcome measure ment tools need to be validated. There is also a need for outcomes research in well characterized patients. Little information is available on the beneﬁts and risks of providing epinephrine auto injectors, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and writtenmedical instructions to patients with food and insect venom allergy and their caregivers (eg, parents and school, day care, and restaurant personnel) and ﬁrst line emergency personnel. Studies of long term sequelae, adher ence to follow up referral, subsequent reactions, and quality of life in patients experiencing anaphylactic reactions also are lacking. As outcome data are becomingavailable, evaluation of the most effective means of disseminating information about the prevention and management of anaphylaxis to patients, primary carephysicians, ﬁrst responders, and emergency department personnel should help alleviate the tremendous disparities in therapeutic approaches seen in the United States andaround the world. A number of studies from around the world suggest that anaphylactic reactions commonly occur both inside andout of the hospital environment. 46,47In light of the general increase in IgE dependent allergic disorders in the developed world over the past several decades, there is an urgentneed to understand better the basic immunology and pathophysiology of anaphylaxis and to optimize therapy on the basis of well controlled clinical trials. In addition, the characterization of clinical features and discovery of biomarkers that would identify patients at risk for anaphylaxis or for biphasic or prolonged severe reactions would greatly enhance the care of these patients, decrease patient andfamily anxieties, and reduce the risk of unfavorable out comes. The universal acceptance of speciﬁc clinical crite ria to identify anaphylaxis, as proposed here, will facilitateand expedite research in this critical area. REFERENCES 1.
