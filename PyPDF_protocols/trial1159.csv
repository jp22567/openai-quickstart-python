PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS This Phase 3 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of dap rodustat (GSK1278863) compared to recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) in the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in subjects who are planning to start or who have recently started dialysis. This study will also provide information on daprodustat dosing initiation and titration in subjects initiating dialysis. Primary Objective/Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary objective of the study is to compare daprodustat to rhEPO for hemoglobin (Hgb) efficacy (non -inferiority). The primary efficacy endpoint will be the mean change in Hgb between baseline and the evaluation period (EP, mean over Weeks 28-52). Overall Design • This is a randomized, open-label (sponsor blind), active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study in sub jects with anemia associated with CKD who are not regularly using erythropoiesis- stimulating agents (ESAs) and who are initiating dialysis. • This study will comprise three study periods: a screening period (2 weeks*), a 52-week active treatment period, an d a follow-up period (4- 6 weeks). * Screening period can be extended by an additional 4 weeks for ultrasound examination, IV iron supplementation and/or vitamin B12 treatment as needed. • Subjects will be stratified by dialysis type (hemodialysis [HD], or peritoneal dialysis [PD]) and by whether their dialysis start is planned or unplanned (urgent). • Following stratification, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive daprodustat or rhEPO (darbepoetin alfa); all randomized treatments (Section 6.1) will be supplied by GSK. • Although prior regular ESA use is prohibited, limited ESA use is allowed around the time of dialysis initiation only. • To ensure consistency of treatment across the study there are protocol- mandated algorithms for dose adjustments of daprodustat and rhEPO, iron management, and rescue. Type and Number of Subjects • The study will enroll the following types of subjects with anemia associated with CKD: Planned initiation of dialysis: Subjects who are planning to start chronic dialy sis (HD or PD) within the next 6 weeks (from the day of screening)."

STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design • This is a randomized, open-label (sponsor blind), active-controlled, parallel-group, multi- center study in subjects with anemia associated with CKD who are not regularly using routine erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) users and who are initiating dialysis. • The study will comprise three study periods: a screening period (2 weeks*), a 52- week active treatment period, and a follow-up period (4- 6 weeks) (Figure 1). Weeks 28 -52 are defined as the efficacy evaluation period (EP) for the p rima ry efficacy com parison. * Screening period can be extended by an additional 4 weeks for ultrasound examination, IV iron supplementation and/or vitamin B12 treatment as needed. • A central randomization approach will be used to protect the trial from potential for selection bias due to the open- label design. All subjects will be treated to achieve and maintain an Hgb within a range of 10- 11 g/dL. • Limited ESA use is allowed around the time of dialysis initiation only (see Section 5.2 for definition of “limited use”). • The treatment period consists of:"
13,page_13,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 14 o The stabilization period , defined as the period from Day 1 to Week 28 during which randomized treatment will be dose titrated to achieve the appropriate Hgb target. o The evaluation period (EP) , defined as the period from the end of the stabilization period (Week 28) to Week 52 (titrations may also occur during this treatment period), to assess safety and efficacy. • Subjects will be stratified by dialysis type (hemodialysis [HD] or pe ritoneal dialysis [PD]) and by whether their dialysis start is planned or unplanned (urgent). • Following stratification, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive daprodustat or rhEPO (darbepoetin alfa); all randomized treatments (Section 6.1) will be supplied by GSK. • To ensure consistency of treatment across the study there are protocol- mandated algorithms for dose adjustments of daprodustat and rhEPO (Section 6.2) , iron management (Section 6.10) and anemia rescue therapy (Section 6.11) • An overview of the study design is provided in Figure 1. Figure 1 Study Schematic 4.2. Type and Number of Subjects The study will enroll the following types of subjects with anemia associated with CKD: • Planned: Subjects who are planning to start dialysis (HD or PD) within the nex t 6 weeks (from the day of screening). • Unplanned (urgent): For Subjects who have started chronic dialysis in an urgent manner, meaning they started HD with a temporary vascular access with no previous planning for chronic dialysis or have started PD with recent (< 2 weeks) PD catheter insertion and/or who have not been seen by a kidney specialist (nephrologist) or other specialist with expertise in dialysis care within previous 4 months prior to screening."
14,page_14,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 15 This study will randomize approximately 300 subjects, or 150 subjects per treatment group. The study will be conducted globally. 4.3. Design Rationale This study includes a screening period where iron supplementation is permitted, so that subjects who are not iron replete can meet iron status entry criteria prior to randomization. The study will include subjects who are planning to start dialysis imminently, have already recently started dialysis in a planned manner, and those who start dialysis urgently. This broad range of subjects will provide data on the effects of daprodustat in subjects starting dialysis as well as data on whether there are differences between planned and unplanned (urgent) starts. Although subjects will be rhEPO non- users, because it is routine medical practice to begin treatment with rhEPO around the time of dialysis initiation if subjects have anemia (Hgb <11 g/dL), the protocol will allow limited rhEPO use during the four weeks before or after starting dialysis (Section 5.2). The stabi lization period from Day 1 to Week 28 allows subjects to have their randomized treatment dose titrated to achieve the Hgb target range. This period of time provides the opportunity for subjects to be titrated to their optimal dose of randomized treatment prior to the efficacy EP ( Weeks 28 to 52). Some subjects may still need dose titration during the EP. The selection of the rhEPO control (darbepoetin alfa) is based on feasibility and clinical practice in the majority of participating countries. The stu dy is open-label (sponsor blind) because it would be complex to double- blind due to the differing number of dose steps and different modes of administration (oral vs. injection) between randomized treatments 4.4. Dose Justification Starting doses, dose steps, and elements of the dose adjustment scheme are provided in Section 6.2 and Appendix 3. 4.4.1. Daprodustat Daprodustat starting doses are assigned based on Hgb at study entry, and were selected such that the target Hgb concentration would be reached after approximately one red blood cell lifespan of treatment (up to 90 days, pharmacodynamic steady- state). However, due to the between-subject variability in Hgb response to a given dose of daprodustat and the relatively narrow Hgb target range, individual dose adjustments of daprodustat are expected during the first few months of treatment. If an individual dose adjustment is made, subjects will increase or decrease the daprodustat d ose through a series of dose steps, one dose step at a time. The highest dose of daprodustat in the dose adjustment scheme is 24 mg once daily."

Screening Failures Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not subsequently randomized. In this study, subjects can become a screen failure at any time from the screening visit to the Day 1 visit prior to randomization. Documentation of a minimum set of information on screen failure subjects must be collected from subjects that fail screening, including demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and serious adverse events (S ection 7.4.3.4)."
19,page_19,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 20 Subjects that fail screening are eligible to be rescreened once as soon as the investigator assesses they may meet study entry criteria. If subjects are rescreened, they must sign a new informed consent form. 5.4. Subject Retention • Subjects will be educated on the importance of remaining in the study and attending scheduled study visits. • Investigators should make every effort to keep subjects in the trial. • Should a subject fail to attend the clin ic for a required study visit, the site should attempt to contact the subject and re -schedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site should also counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule. In cases where the su bject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the subject. 5.5. Permanent Discontinuation of Randomized Treatment Every effort should be made to keep subjects in the study including those who permanently stop randomized treatment. A subject may permanently discontinue randomized treatment at any time at his/her own request, or at the discretion of the investigator for safety, or compliance reasons. A subject must permanently discontinue randomized treatment for the pre-specified reasons below: • Kidney transplant • Reaching criterion to receive rescue (Section 6.11) • Becomes pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the study • Liver chemistry abnormalities exceeding the threshold criteria (Section 7.4.12) • Diagnosis of cancer (new or recurrent), with the exception of localized dermal squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma • Need for more than 14 days use of a prohibited medication ( Section 6.9.2) In all cases, the reason for randomized treatment discontinuation and the date of the last dose will be recorded in the subject’s e lectronic case report form (eCRF) and the subject will continue in the study as described in Section 5.5.1. Subjects may be re-approached about restarting randomized treatment in certain circumstances if the Spo nsor and the investigator agree. 5.5.1. Procedures for Subject Follow -up Subjects who permanently discontinue randomized treatment will be asked to attend an Early Treatment Discontinuation visit and will be expected to attend in -clinic study visits"
20,page_20,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 21 through to Follow -up according to the study visit schedule, unless consent is actively withdrawn. Complete details are provided in Table 7 in Section 7.1. • Early Treatment Discontinu ation visit: This visit should occur within 2 weeks of the last dose of randomized treatment. • Remaining in -clinic visits*: o Day 1 through Week 52: Study visits every 12 weeks ± 2 weeks post Early Treatment Discontinuation visit. o Follow- up: Study visit 4 weeks after Week 52. *Phone visit acceptable in exceptional circumstances. • In all cases, reasons for Early Treatment Discontinuation and the date of last dose will be recorded. • If a subject does not agree to continue attending in-clinic or phone visits, other follow-up options to collect study outcomes and vital status should be pursued according to local laws and regulations. If one of these alternate methods to collect study outcomes and vital status is acceptable to the subject, then the subject will be considered to have remained in the study and not to have withdrawn consent. 5.6. Withdrawal from Study Every effort should be made to keep subjects in the study. For subjects that choose to withdraw consent or are lost to follow up, the reason for not compl eting the study will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. If a subject withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any clinical samples taken, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 5.6.1. Withdrawal of Consent for Contac t Specific wording is included in the informed consent form which permits subjects to discontinue randomized treatment and study procedures, but states an expectation that follow up information will always be required. Subject will agree to this at the time of consenting. Withdrawal of consent from the study is expected to be a rare occurrence. If a subject withdraws consent from the study, the Investigator will review the following contact options with the subject: • In-clinic and phone visits • Follow-up via medical records review and/or other treating physician • Follow-up via family member or other third party contact"
21,page_21,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 22 If all of these options are refused, then no further study visits or study- related telephone contact will be conducted and the subject will be considered to have withdrawn consent. The principal investigator will be required to document that all alternative options have been reviewed with the subject. For these subjects, information regarding study outcomes or vital status will continue to be col lected from available sources including those in the public domain based on accepted local laws and regulations. Where permitted, a third party may be used to obtain information. 5.6.2. Subjects Deemed Lost to Follow -up • Investigators should make every effort to contact subjects who are deemed lost to follow-up and who have not withdrawn consent to follow-up contact. • As permitted by local regulations, a third party may be used to locate alternative subject contact information that will be provided to the investi gator. All attempts to contact subjects will be documented in the subject’s eCRF and source notes and a final status contact will be recorded in the eCRF. 5.7. Subject and Study Completion A completed subject is one who has completed all periods of the study through the End of Treatment visit with the following exception: subjects who die while on study are also considered as having completed the study."
22,page_22,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 23 6. RANDOMIZED TREATMENT 6.1. Investigational Product and Other Randomized Treatment The term ‘randomized treatment ’ is used throughout the protocol to describe any product (i.e., daprodustat or darbepoetin alfa during the treatment period) received by the subject as per the protocol design. Randomized treatment will be provided by GSK. During the treatment period, iron therapy (supplied locally) will be administered as per the iron management criteria (Section 6.10). Daprodustat will be supplied as film coated tablets for oral administration containing 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 mg of daprodustat. Doses of 12, 16, and 24 mg of daprodustat will be provided using multiples of these tablet strengths. The doses, tablet size, and description are provided in ( Table 1 ). Table 1 Description of Daprodustat Tablets Tablet size Dose Description 7.0 mm daprodustat 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, 7.0 mm round, compound radius, white film coated tablets 9.0 mm daprodustat 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, 9.0 mm round, compound radius, white film coated tablets Subjects will take daprodustat tablet(s) daily with water, and these tablets can be taken without regard to food. GSK will supply rhEPO (darbepoetin alfa) for the control group as prefilled syringes (PFS) for SC/IV injection. If the supply to the site is interrupted due to unexpected circumstances (e.g., natural disaster), local standard of care for anemia management may be considered during that time-period, without the need to withdraw the subject from the study or to permanently discontinue randomized treatment. Darbepoetin alfa d oses from 20 µg to 400 µg will be administered using the strengths in Table 2. See also Appendix 3 , Section 12.3.1 for darbepoetin alfa dose steps and dosi ng frequency. Additional details to deliver the total dose are also captured in the SRM. Table 2 Description of Darbepoetin Alfa PFS PFS Strengths PFS Volume 20 µg* 0.5 mL 30 µg* 0.3 mL 40 µg 0.4 mL 60 µg 0.3 mL 80 µg* 0.4 mL 100 µg 0.5 mL 150 µg 0.3 mL * Not available in all countries."
23,page_23,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 24 6.2. Randomized Treatment Starting Dose, Dose Steps, and Dose Adjustments 6.2.1. Daprodustat Dosing Information Daprodustat Star ting Dose The starting dose of daprodustat will be assigned based on the HemoCue Hgb concentration at randomization (Day 1) ( Table 3). Table 3 Daprodustat Starting Dose (All Subjects) HemoCu e Hgb (g/dL) at Randomization (Day 1) Daprodustat starting dose (mg, once daily) ≥8 to <9 4 ≥9 to ≤10 2 >10 1 Daprodustat Dose Steps The available dose steps of daprodustat are outlined below. Dose adjustments will result in the daprodustat dose bei ng increased or decreased by one dose step at a time (see Appendix 3, Section 12.3.2 for details). Those receiving the highest dose of daprodustat who require a dose increa se will maintain the same dose, while those receiving the lowest dose of daprodustat that require a dose decrease will have doses withheld. 6.2.2. rhEPO Dosing Information Darbepoetin alfa Starting Dose For subjects starting HD or PD, the SC/IV darbepoetin alf a dose will be 0.75-1.0 µg/kg rounded to the nearest available dose. Detailed information is provided in Table 4. Table 4 Darbepoetin Alfa Starting Dose Weight Darbepoetin Alfa Starting Dose <60 kg 40 µg every 4 weeks ≥ 60 kg to <90 kg 60 µg every 4 weeks ≥90 kg to < 120 kg 40 µg every 2 weeks ≥ 120 kg 60 µg every 2 weeks"
24,page_24,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 25 Darbepoetin alfa Dose Steps Dose adjustments will be made programmatically by the Interactive Response Technology ( IRT) system. Dose -steps and frequency of administration of darbepoetin alfa are pre-defined in this study (Appendix 3, Section 12.3.1) . The SC or IV darbepoetin alfa dose adjustment increases and decreases are generally within 20% and 33% range, with a few increases of 50% based on available dose strengths. Additional information about the delivery of the respective rhEPO doses is provided in the SRM. Those receiving the highest dose of rhEPO who require a dose increase will maintain the same dose, while those receiving the lowest dose of rhEPO that require a dose decrease will have doses withheld as per the randomized treatment (daprodustat and darbepoetin alfa) dose adjustment algorithm in Appendix 3. 6.2.3. Daprodustat and rhEPO Dose Adjustment Algorithm Dose adjustments will be made programmatically by the IRT system to maintain Hgb concentrations within the range of 10-11 g/dL based on the Hgb value measured every 2 to 4 weeks by the HemoCue value disclosed to the IRT system by the investigator. The protocol-specified randomized treatment (daprodustat or rhEPO) dose adjustment algorithm is provided in Appendix 3, Section 12.3.2. In order to mitigate subjects remaining below the Hgb target range for an extended period of time, adjustments to the algorithm may be implemented by the Sponsor as outlined in Appendix 3 based on the review of aggregate blinded instream Hgb data. 6.3. Blinding This is an open-label study; however, the sponsor is blinded to randomized assignment. A detailed Blinding Plan will describe the procedures that will be implemented in order to minimize the extent to which this blind may be compromised. 6.4. Packaging and Product Labeling Daprodustat tablets are packed in white, opaque high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child -resistant closures. The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. Randomized treatment will have the dose strength on the label. 6.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability No special preparation of randomized treatment is required. Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive randomized treatment and only authorized site staff may supply randomized treatment. All randomized treatments must be stored in a secure environmentally controlled and monitored (manual or automated)"
25,page_25,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 26 area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for randomized treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e. receipt, reconciliation and final disposition records). Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused randomized treatment are provided in the SRM. Under normal conditions of handling and administration, randomiz ed treatment is not expected to pose significant safety risks to site staff. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the investigator, where t his is required by local laws, or is available upon request from GSK. 6.6. Compliance with Randomized Treatment Administration Randomized subjects who administer randomized treatment (daprodustat or rhEPO) at home will be instructed to return all unused randomi zed treatment at each clinic visit. A record of the number of daprodustat tablets or rhEPO doses dispensed to and taken by each subject will be maintained and reconciled with randomized treatment and compliance records. Randomized treatment start and stop dates and dosing details, including dates for randomized treatment interruptions and/or dose increases or reductions, will be recorded in the eCRF. At Week 2 and for unscheduled visits, compliance checking will not be performed if the dose of randomized t reatment is not changed. Subjects randomized to rhEPO, who have randomized treatment administered in the clinic, will have the details of each administered rhEPO dose maintained and reconciled with randomized treatment and compliance records. Randomized t reatment start and stop dates and dosing details, including dates for randomized treatment interruptions and/or dose increases/reductions, will be recorded in the eCRF. 6.6.1. Randomized Treatment Extended Interruption Every effort must be made to continue random ized treatment and to complete study visits, where able; however, sites should contact their PPD study team member if a subject cannot return to the research site on a temporary basis for any one of the following situations: • Subjects who are hospitalized for any duration. • Subjects who cannot return to the site for a period >5 weeks. In exceptional circumstances, standard of care for anemia management during this time period may be considered based on consultation with the PPD medical monitor. If non-study ESAs are administered, doses should be recorded on the Prior/Concomitant Medications – ESA eCRF page."
26,page_26,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 27 6.7. Treatment of Randomized Treatment Overdose There is no specific antidote for overdose with daprodustat. The expected manifestations of daprodustat overdosage include signs and symptoms associated with an excessive and/or rapid increase in Hgb concentration. Daprodustat is highly protein bound, thus clearance of daprodustat by HD or PD is very low so dialysis is not an effective method to enhance the elimination of daprodustat. Daprodustat metabolites are, in part, cleared via hemodialysis. In the event of a suspected overdose, it is recommended that the appropriate supportive clinical care be instituted, as dictated by the subject’s clinical status. Ad ditionally, subjects should be monitored closely for cardiovascular (CV) events, increased heart rate and hematologic abnormalities. Consult the approved product label for information on overdose for rhEPOs. 6.8. Treatment after the End of the Study Subjects wi ll not receive any additional treatment from GSK after completion of the study. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to post- study care of the subject’s medical condition. 6.9. Concomitant Medications Concomitant medic ations, including over-the-counter medications and supplements, taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF. Start/stop dates and route of administration will be recorded for general concomitant medications. Additional details (e.g., changes in dose, reason for change, reason for addition and termination) will be recorded for certain medications at each visit (i.e., iron and anti- hypertensive medications). 6.9.1. Permitted Medications Unless specified as a prohibited medication in Section 6.9.2, all concomitant medications should be considered permitted provided they are not contraindicated for the individual subject concerned. Co-administration of daprodustat with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (i.e., clopidogrel, teriflunomide, deferasirox) should be performed with caution. 6.9.2. Prohibited Medications Use of any of the following prescription drugs from screening until 7 days after the last dose of randomized treatment is prohibited and will constitute a protocol violation. • Strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (e.g.,gemfibrozil) • Strong inducers of CYP2C8 ( e.g., rifampin/rifampicin)"
27,page_27,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 28 Except for study randomized treatment, no other investigational agents or devices are permitted from study entry through completion of the study. 6.10. Iron Management Criteria Subjects must remain iron replete throughout the study. The investigator will follow the iron management criteria from randomization (Day 1) through the end of the study treatment period for subjects receiving randomized treatment. Iron therapy will be administered if ferritin is ≤100 ng/mL and/or TSAT is ≤20%. The investigator should choose the route of administration and dose of iron based on the subject’s iron status and local clinical practice. All iron (excluding multivitamins) must be stopped and cannot be administered if: • Ferritin >800 ng/mL and TSAT >20%, or • TSAT >40% Investigators should be guided by local/regional guidelines and may stop administration of iron at a lower ferritin or TSAT level as long as subjects are maintained at a ferritin >100 ng/mL and TSAT >20%. The Steering Committee (Section 10.8.3) will monitor blinded subject iron data in an ongoing fashion to ensure compliance. 6.11. Anemia Rescue Therapy A rescue algorithm is provided to minimize subjects having an inadequate response to the treatment for their anemia for an extended period of time and to enable consistency in the application of rescue therapy across the study. Details are provided in Table 5. This rescue algori thm does not apply to subjects with a low Hgb as a result of an acute or sub-acute event with an identifiable cause (e.g., GI bleed, blood loss due to surgery or vascular access). In these cases, treatment should be directed to the specific cause AND randomized treatment will be continued. If a subject is transfused as part of the treatment, then the randomized treatment will be maintained at the current dose (unless Hgb is ≥12 g/dL which requires a dose hold)."
28,page_28,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 29 Table 5 Rescue Algorithm for Anemia Management Evaluate Subject for Rescue if: HemoCue Hgb remains <9 g/dL (at a scheduled visit, Week 4 onwards ) despite three1 consecutive dose increases above the starting dose or post -rescue2 (where HemoCue Hgb<9 g/dL prior to each dose increase) OR HemoCue Hgb is <7.5 g/dL despite a dose increase at the prior study visit. Step 1: Initial Intervention While continuing randomized treatment (increase dose if HemoCue Hgb <7.5 g/dL; otherwise maintain current dose), intervene with one or more of the following as dictated by clinical comorbidities: - Single course of IV iron up to 1000 mg (in addition to the iron management criteria) - Transfusion of up to two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) if clinically indicated - Allow additional 4 weeks on randomized treatment (NOTE: this is a required choice; can be combined with either or both of the above) Step 2: Rescue Check HemoCue Hgb 4 weeks ±1 week from last study visit; earlier checks of Hgb may be obtained to advise further interventio n as clinically indicated. Randomized treatment should be permanently discontinued and the subject should be rescued according to local clinical practice if either, - HemoCue Hgb remains <9 g/dL despite initial intervention based on the average of two Hemo Cue Hgb values 3 OR - More than two units of PRBC were needed for transfusion (and was not related to acute bleeding). 1. Two consecutive dose increases if starting/post -rescue dose is daprodustat 12 mg or darbepoetin alfa 200 µg over 4 weeks; one dose increase if starting/post -rescue dose is daprodustat 16 mg or darbepoetin alfa 300 µg over 4 weeks; and no prior dose increase if starting/post -rescue dose is daprodustat 24 mg or darbepoetin alfa 400 µg over 4 weeks (top dose). 2. For subjects who previously are evaluated for rescue and who are able to continue in the trial, “post -rescue” dose is the dose of randomized treatment that a subject is receiving at the study visit after initial intervention. 3. Repeat HemoCue Hgb at the same study visit to confirm Hgb (using the same sample); take average of 2 values. 6.12. Subjects Changing Dialysis Modality Subjects changing dialysis modality should not be withdrawn from the study, but should continue on the same randomized treatment (daprodustat or darbepoetin alfa). 7. STUDY ASS ESSMENTS AND PROCEDU RES Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immediate safety concerns. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Time and Events Table, are essential and required for study conduct. Time and Events Tables are provided for subjects receiving randomized treatment ( Table 6) and for subjects who permanently discontinue randomized treatment ( Table 7). Because Hgb levels become more variable with increased time between dialysis sessions,"
29,page_29,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 30 the designated study visit should occur during the dialysis session with the shortest interval from the previous session. Designated study visits for subjects in the screening period or study treatment period who have not yet initiated dialysis can occur on any day of the week. Designated study visits for subjects on dialysis should be scheduled as follows from the screening assessment to the end of the study: • For subjects on 3X/week HD: The designated study visit must not occur on the first dialysis session of the week . For example, if on a Monday- Wednesday - Friday schedule, the study visit should be on Wednesday or Friday. • For subjects on 2X/week HD: The visit should occur during the session that is closest to the previous HD session. For example, if a subject receives dialysis on a Monday and Thursday, the study visit should be on the Thursday (2 days from the previous dialysis session) rather than the Monday (3 days from the previous dialysis session). • For subjects on PD: study visits can occur on any day of the week. Details regarding study -specific equipment are provided in Appendix 7. Post-randomization visits should be referenced back to the Randomization visit (Day 1). The visit window for those on randomized treatment for the Week 2 and Week 4 visits is ±3 days. The visit window specified for those on randomized treatment from Week 6 onwards is ±1 week. However, to ensure continuity of randomized treatment, study visits should be no more than 5 weeks apart. In exceptional circumstances, minor changes to visit structure may be permitted after consultation with the PPD/GSK Medical Monitor. Study assessments should preferably be done at di alysis centers, however, in some circumstances assessments can be performed at the research site. Supplementary study conduct information is provided in the SRM. The SRM provides administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact subje ct safety."

Demography and medical history will be assessed at the initial screening visit. Randomization requires an Hgb leve l within the specified range (Section 5.1) and levels of serum ferritin or TSAT as outlined in Section 5.2. Full details of screening and baseline (Day 1) assessments are provided in the Time and Events Table (Table 6)."
34,page_34,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 35 7.3. Efficacy Planned time points for all Hgb efficacy assessments are listed in the Time and Events Table (Table 6). GSK will supply a point-of- care Hgb analyzer (i.e., HemoCue) to each site for rapid measurement of Hgb. Blood samples (not fingersticks) for measurement of Hgb via HemoCue, and also by the central laboratory will be collected as specified in the Time and Events Table (Table 6). 7.4. Safety Safety endpoints will include monitoring of deaths, AEs, SAEs, other CV events, AEs of special interest, AEs leading to discontinuation of randomized treatment, and laboratory parameters, blood pressure and heart rate (HR). Planne d time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Time and Events Table (Table 6). Unscheduled visits will occur as medically necessary. Detailed procedures for obtaining each assessment are provided in the SRM. 7.4.1. Events Referred to the Clinical Event Committee (CEC) Investigators should refer any event suspected to be one of the events below to the CEC. The CEC will review and adjudicate the following clinical events . See CEC Site Manual for full scope of reporting requir ements. • All-cause mortality (CV and non- CV mortality) • Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) • Non-fatal stroke • Hospitalization for heart failure • Thromboembolic events (vascular access thrombosis, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary emboli sm) Events referred to the CEC will be subjected to blinded adjudication using pre- specified diagnostic criteria. When the investigator-reported event and the CEC assessment of the event differ, the CEC’s decision will be considered final. The detailed descriptions of the endpoint definitions used for adjudication are contained within the CEC Charter (available on request). Source documentation required to support the adjudication of the events is described in the CEC Site Manual."
35,page_35,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 36 7.4.2. Other CV Events GSK has i dentified other CV events of interest for all clinical studies. Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following categories of events: • Arrhythmias • Pulmonary hypertension* • Valvulopathy • Revascularization (* Pulmonary hypertension is also an AE of special interest for the current study, see Section 7.4.4 for details.) 7.4.3. Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) The definitions of an AE and SAE can be found in Appendix 8. The investigator or their designees are responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. 7.4.3.1. Time period and Frequency for collecting AE and SAE information • Any SAE assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protocol- mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the time subject consents to participate in the study up to an d including any follow- up contact. • AEs will be collected from the start of randomized treatment until the Follow -up visit, at the timepoints specified in the Time and Events Table (Table 6). • Medical occurrences that begin prior t o the start of randomized treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF. • All SAEs will be recorded and reported to PPD within 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 8. • Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the randomized treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify PPD. NOTE: The method of recording, evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs plus procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to PPD are provided in Appendix 8."
36,page_36,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 37 7.4.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open- ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include: • “How are you feeling?” • “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?” • “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last visit/contact?” 7.4.3.3. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non- serious AEs of special interest (as defined in Section 7.4.4) will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 5.6.2) . Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 8. 7.4.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to PPD of SAEs related to randomized treatment is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a product under clinical investigation are met. GSK has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation. GSK will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Board (IRB )/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and investigators. Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and GSK policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from GSK will file it with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 7.4.4. Adverse Events of Special Interest The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting any event that may represent the AEs of special interest listed below (using preferred terms): • Thrombosis and/or tissue ischemia secondary to excessive erythropoiesis"
37,page_37,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 38 • Death, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, , thromboembolic events, thrombosis of vascular access • Cardiomyopathy • Pulmonary artery hypertension • Cancer -related mortality and tumor progression and recurr ence • Esophageal and gastric erosions • Proliferative retinopathy, macular edema, choroidal neovascularization • Exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis The results of any investigation should be recorded on the AE page and in the relevant AE of special intere st page of the subjects’ eCRFs. 7.4.5. Possible Suicidality Related Adverse Events If during the study there is an occurrence of an AE or SAE which in the investigator’s opinion, is possibly related to suicidality, the Possible Suicidality Related Adverse Events (PSRAE) eCRF form should be completed (in addition to the AE and SAE pages, as appropriate). This event may include, but is not limited to, one that involves suicidal ideation, a preparatory act toward imminent suicidal behavior, a suicide attempt, or a completed suicide. The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an event is possibly related to suicidality. 7.4.6. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female subjects will be collected after the start of dosing and until 7 days after the last dose. • If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform PPD within 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 9. 7.4.7. Height and Weight Height and weight will be measured as specified in the Time and Events Table (Table 6 ). Weight will be measured in clinic with the subject wearing indoor daytime clothing with no shoes. For HD subjects, this will be measured pre and post dialysis when possible, or at study visits between dialysis sessions. For PD subjects these assessments will be done at study visits, as per standard of care. Estimated dry (target) weight will be calculated at each study vis it as specified in the Time and Events Table (Table 6)."
38,page_38,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 39 7.4.8. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Measurement of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) will be taken at the time points specified in the Time and Events Table (Table 6). • One measurement each of SBP, DBP and HR will be taken, except at Day 1, Week 52, and the Early Treatment Discontinuation visit (if applicable), when SBP, DBP and HR will be measured in triplicate. • For HD subjects, m easurements will be taken pre-and post dialysis with the subject in a semi -supine or seated position in the dialysis chair after at least a 5 - minute rest period . • For PD subjects, this assessment will be done at study visits, as per standard of care. SBP, DBP, and HR will be performed before collection of blood samples for laboratory testing, where applicable. 7.4.9. Electrocardiogram (ECG) ECG measurements will be taken at the time points specified in Table 6 and mus t be recorded pre-dialysis . Full 12-lead ECGs will be recorded with the subject in a supine position. Heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT (uncorrected) interval will be measured. QTcB will be calculated (machine -read or manually). For the Day 1 ECG , two additional ECGs are required if the initial ECG indicates prolonged QTc using the automated or manually calculated QTcB value. The average QTcB value of all three ECGs will be used to determine eligibility (Section 5.2 for detail). Additional details are provided in the SRM. ECG data will be read locally by a physician with experience in reading and interpreting ECGs. The over- read of the Day 1 ECG is required to confirm eligibility . Additional details are provided in the SRM. All ECGs will be performed before measurement of SBP, DBP, HR (in-center HD only) and before collection of blood samples for laboratory testing. 7.4.10. Ultrasound An ultrasound of the kidneys and adrenal glands will be performed prior to randomization (Day 1). It is understood that the adrenal glands will not always be able to be visualized. Non-visualization of the adrenals is NOT a reason to exclude subjects from randomization. Further details are provided in the SRM. A documented ultrasound of the kidneys within the 6 months prior to screening may be used to assess entry criteria (Section 5.2), provided the size and cyst category has been"
39,page_39,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 40 reported. If a more sensitive imaging study (e.g. , MRI, CT) has been performed within this timeframe and a report is available, this may be used in place of the ultrasound . 7.4.11. Clinical Laboratory Assessments All protocol required laboratory assessments, as defined in Table 8, must be conducted in accordance with the Laboratory Manual, and Protocol Time and Events Schedule ( Table 6). Laboratory assessments will be done pre-dialysis for HD subjects and at the study visits for PD subjects, as per standard of care. Laboratory requisition forms must be completed and samples must be clearly labeled with the subject number, protocol number, site/center number, and visit date. Details for the preparation and shipment of samples will be provided by the laboratory and are detailed in the SRM. Reference ranges for all safety parameters will be provided to the site by the laboratory responsible for the assessments. If additional non- protocol specified laboratory assessments are performed at the institu tion’s local laboratory and result in a change in subject management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g., SAE or AE or dose modification) the results must be recorded in the subject’s source notes. Refer to the SRM for appr opriate processing and handling of samples. All study -required laboratory assessments will be performed by a central laboratory with the exception of HemoCue Hgb which will be performed at the clinical site. The results of each HemoCue Hgb must be entered into the subject’s eCRF."

Randomized Treatment Restart If a subject meets liver chemistry stopping criteria, do not restart randomized treatment unless there is a clear underlying cause for the liver stopping event other than drug- induced liver injury and: • GSK Medical Governance approval is granted in writing • Ethics and/or IRB approval is obtained, if required, and • Separate consent for treatment restart is signed by the subject The full liver safety drug restart guideline is provided in Appendix 6. 7.5. Pharmacokinetics (PK) PK sampling will be performed in all in -center HD subjects randomized to the daprodustat arm. Blood samples will be collected at the Week 4, Week 8 or Week 12 visit (i.e., PK is collected at one visit only, based on convenience for the subject/site). Samples will be collected at the following times relative to dosing of randomized treatment: • Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h post dose. On the day of the scheduled PK visit: • The subject is to be instructed not to take their dose at home before the visit, but to take the dose in the clinic after the pre -dose sample is collected. • The dose taken in the clinic should be from the same bottle(s) the subject has been using prior to the PK visit, not from any newly dispensed bottle(s) at the PK visit. [Note: a subject placed on a dose hold at the previous visit should not have PK samples taken; PK colle ction should be delayed until the visit after the subject has restarted study treatment.] • Record the date and actual time of the dose taken in the clinic and three doses prior to the visit, and the date and actual time of all PK samples collected. Samples may be collected within ± 20 min of the planned collected time. • Based on the time of dosing, samples may be obtained before, during, or after any dialysis procedure. The start and stop time of the dialysis procedure will also be recorded at this visit. Plasma PK analysis will be performed under the control of GSK PTS-DMPK/Scinovo, the details of which will be included in the SRM. Concentrations of parent daprodustat"

Sampl es for genetic analysis will be taken at the time points specified in the Time and Events Table (Table 6). 7.7. Patient Reported Outcomes The patient -reported effect of daprodustat and rhEPO on symptoms, health- related quality of life (HR-QoL), and health status (e.g. utility) will be assessed. Symptoms will be assessed using a symptoms questionnaire which is specific to anemia of CKD (CKD - AQ). Overall symptom severity will be assessed using the patient global impression of severity ( PGI-S) and overall symptom change using the patient global impression of change (PGI -C). Quality of life will be measured via SF -36, and health status via the EQ - 5D-5L and EQ -5D-VAS. In addition, healthcare resource utilization will be assessed including out- patient visits . All questionnaires used in this study have been translated and culturally adapted use in local country languages and will be administered electronically only. Specific instructions on how the subject is to complete the scales and the pr ocess for data entry is provided in the SRM. Details on patient reported outcomes are provided in the study reference manual. The CKD -AQ, PGI -S, PGI -C, HR -QoL, and Health Status questionnaires should be completed by subjects at a clinic visit, in the orde r specified: PGI -S, PGI -C, CKD- AQ, SF-36, EQ -5D 5L, and EQ -VAS. Subjects who are unable to or require assistance to read must not complete the questionnaires. If there are other exceptional circumstances whereby the Patient Reported Outcomes assessments c annot be conducted, the completion of these assessments will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case- by-case basis. 7.7.1. Chronic Kidney Disease - Anemia Questionnaire (CKD -AQ) A novel symptom questionnaire – CKD- AQ has been developed to collect concepts of interest for the anemia of CKD population over the past 24 hours. Unlike the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Anemia (FACT -AN) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT -Fatigue) which have not demonstrated content validity specific for the anemia of CKD population, the novel CKD -AQ instrument was developed to verify and ensure that concepts specific for anemia of CKD were captured and measured. It will measure both the frequency and/or severity in anemia of CKD concepts such as weakness, energy, tiredness, shortness of breath, exertion, chest pain, memory, concentration, standing, sleep and distress over the past seven days."
44,page_44,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 45 7.7.2. Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C) The Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI- S) is a 1 -item questionnaire designed to assess patient’s impression of disease severity of their anemia of CKD. It is measured on a 5-point disease severity scale (absent, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe) d uring the past 24 hours. The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI- C) is a 1 -item questionnaire designed to assess a subject’s impression of symptom change of their anemia of CKD. It is measured on a 7- point Likert - type response scale (very much improved, moderately improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, moderately worse, or very much worse) since they first started the study. 7.7.3. Health Related Quality of Life (SF -36) The SF -36 acute version is a general health status questionnaire designed to elucidate the subject’s perception of their health on several domains, including physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health, and general health. The questionnaire contains 36 questions within these domains that ask the subject to recall how they felt during the past seven days. 7.7.4. Health Status (EQ -5D-5L & EQ -VAS) EQ-5D-5L consists of two concepts – the EQ -5D- 5L descriptive system and the EQ - VAS. The EQ-5D- 5L is a self -reported descriptive system of health -related quality of life states consisting of five dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (n o problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ -5D dimension. Self-reported health status captured by EQ -5D-5L relates to the subject’s situation at the time of completion. The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self- rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labeled ‘ the best health you can imagine ’ and ‘ the worst health you can imagine ’. This information is used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by individual subjects. 7.7.5. Psychometric Analyses of the CKD Anemia Symptoms Questionnaire (CKD -AQ) In order establish and evaluate the measurement properties of the CKD -AQ, a n interim cut of blinded observations of the first 50 subjects who completed the week 28 vis it will be taken. In order to establish content validity, the data cut will require a comparison to the following variables: PGI -C, PGI-S, Hgb, SF-36, demographic & baseline clinical characteristics. All data will be abstracted from screening until week 28. The interim data cut will be used to conduct confirmatory factor analysis in order to establish a scoring algorithm for potential instrument domains and to evaluate the reliability, validity and responsiveness of the instrument without regard to tre atment group. A full description of the data cut, variables of interest and analyses to establish"

Storage Biomarkers Bloo d (serum and plasma) samples will be collected as outlined in the Time and Events Table (Table 6) for potential future analysis of CV risk and iron metabolism. 8. DATA MANAGEMENT • For this study, subject data will be entered into eCRF s, transmitted electronically and combined with data provided from other sources in a validated data system. • Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable GSK standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data, e.g., removing errors and inconsistencies in the data. • Adverse events and concomitant medications terms will be coded using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) and an internal validated medication dictionary, GSKDrug, respectively. • eCRFs (including queries and audit trails) will be retained by GSK, and copies will be sent to the investigator to maintain as the investigator copy. S ubject initials will not be collected or transmitted to GSK according to GSK policy. 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND D ATA ANALYSES 9.1. Primary Hypotheses The primary Hgb efficacy objective will assess the estimand defined as the comparative treatment effect in mean Hgb change between baseline and EP (i.e., Weeks 28 to 52 inclusive) in all randomized subjects; defined as those who remain in follow-up throughout the period of stabilization and have at least one Hgb assessment during the EP (i.e., Weeks 28 to 52) regardless of adherence to study treatment. The analysis will test whether daprodustat is non- inferior to rhEPO according to the following statistical hypotheses: • Null: The difference in mean change in Hgb between baseline and EP, between treatment arms (daprodustat -rhEPO), is less than or equal to - 0.75 g/dL. • Alternative: The difference in mean change in Hgb between baseline and EP, between treatment arms (daprodustat -rhEPO), is greater than - 0.75 g/dL The non- inferiority margin is pre -defined as -0.75 g/dL; selected to be consistent across all clinical trials in the daprodustat Phase 3 clinical dev elopment program in subjects with anemia of chronic kidney disease, and determined based upon a combination of clinical judgment, statistical reasoning and regulatory guidance for designing non- inferiority trials."
46,page_46,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 47 Statistical significance of non -inferiority will be assessed at the one-sided 2.5% level. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including randomization stratification factors, baseline hemoglobin and treatment will be used to obtain a point estimate and the two- sided 95% CI for the treatment difference (daprodustat -rhEPO) and generate the p -value for the non-inferiority test. The non- inferiority p -value will show strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Non- inferiority will be established if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference is greater than -0.75 g/dL. 9.2. Sample Size Considerations 9.2.1. Sample Size Assumptions The size of this study has been determined to be sufficient to meet the ICH E1 guideline for subject exposure, number and duration and to provide at least 90% power to test the primary non- inferiority hypothesis with a two -sided 95% CI. Approximately 300 subjects are planned to be randomized (150 per arm) to receive daprodustat or rhEPO, to provide at least 100 subjects exposed to daprodustat for one year. Subjects will be treated to achieve and maintain Hgb between 10 and 11 g/dL. The expected difference in mean Hgb change from baseline and the EP, between arms, is 0 g/dL and the anticipated between subject standard deviation (SD) is 1.5 g/dL, based on historical rhEPO trials and daprodustat clinical trial experience to date. With a pre - specified non- inferiority margin of -0.75 g/dL, a two- sample T -test and assuming that up to approximately 30% of subjects will permanently stop randomized treatment bef ore Week 28 (start of EP), 300 randomized subjects will provide >90% power to test the primary hypothesis. With 300 randomized subjects, it is anticipated that the difference in mean Hgb change from baseline between arms will be estimated with a precision of 0.408 g/dL (half width of the two -sided 95% CI) and the largest (most negative) difference between arms that would meet the statistical criterion for non -inferiority would be - 0.342 g/dL. 9.2.2. Sample Size Sensitivity The following table illustrates the impa ct on power for the primary efficacy analysis based on alternative assumptions for the between subject SD and the percentage of non-evaluable subjects. Between subject Hgb SD (g/dL) % non -evaluable (number of subjects per arm) 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% (n=12 0) (n=113) (n=105) (n=98) (n=90) 1 >99% >99% >99% >99% >99% 1.25 >99% >99% >99% 99% 98% 1.5 97% 96% 95% 94% 92% 1.75 91% 89% 87% 85% 82% 2 82% 80% 77% 74% 71%"
47,page_47,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 48 9.2.3. Sample Size Re -estimation or Adjustment No sample size re- estimation is planned for this study. 9.3. Data Analysis Considerations 9.3.1. Analysis Populations The primary population for Hgb efficacy analyses will be the All Randomized (ITT) Population. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized. In order to assess the sensitivity of the primary efficacy analysis, an analysis will be performed in a Per-Protocol (PP) Population defined as all ITT subjects who are not major protocol violators. Details will be defined in the RAP and subjects analyzed according to the treatment received. For analyses of time to event endpoints such as all -cause mortality, Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) and hospitalizations, the All Randomized (ITT) Population will also be used. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized. The primary population for safety (Safety Population) will consist of all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of randomized treatment. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment received. Additional populations may be defined in the RAP. 9.4. Key Elements of Analysis Plan 9.4.1. Primary Analyses Mean change in Hgb between baseline and EP (Weeks 28 -52): The primary efficacy estimand is to compare the effect of treatment for the evaluation of mean change from baseline in Hgb during a 24- week evaluation period (Weeks 28 to 52 inclusive) in all ITT subjects with at least one Hgb during the EP. The analysis will use an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. For each subject, the baseline Hgb will be the value obtained on Day 1, prior to taking randomized treatment, and Hgb during EP will be determined by calculating the mean of all available Hgb values between Weeks 28 to 52 inclusive regardless of adherence to randomized treatment. The ANCOVA model will include ra ndomization stratification factors, baseline hemoglobin, and treatment. It will provide a point estimate and two -sided 95% CI for the treatment effect, together with the one-sided non- inferiority test p -value. Non- inferiority will be established if the lower limit of the two -sided 95% CI is greater than the margin of -0.75 g/dL. There will be no imputation for missing data but imputation will be explored via sensitivity analyses Sensitivity and Supplementary Analyses : Sensitivity analyses for the primar y estimand will include a multiple imputation -based “tipping point” analysis where assumptions are adjusted until non- inferiority is lost by imputing data for subjects who did not fully complete the EP. A further supplementary analysis will evaluate effica cy in those subjects who adhere to randomized treatment, defined as ITT subjects with at least one"
48,page_48,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 49 on-treatment Hgb during the EP (this approach corresponds to evaluating an efficacy estimand). A similar “tipping point” analysis as that described above for the primary analysis will be performed for this “on-drug” analysis. In addition, a supplementary per - protocol analysis will estimate the treatment effect in subjects who strongly adhere to the protocol, and sensitivity analyses to explore a shorter EP (Weeks 28 to 36) will be performed for the primary effectiveness estimand and “on-drug” efficacy estimand. Full details of all sensitivity and supplementary analyses will be provided in the RAP. 9.4.2. Secondary Analyses 9.4.2.1. Principal Secondary Efficacy Analyses Conditional on the primary endpoint achieving non- inferiority at the one-sided 2.5% level, statistical testing will progress to the principal secondary endpoint with a focus on superiority using a one-sided 2.5% significance level. For the average monthl y IV iron dose up to Week 52 endpoint: IV iron use for all subjects will be recorded in the eCRF and the average monthly IV iron dose up to week 52 while on treatment will be calculated. An ANCOVA model will be used to compare the difference in this averag e monthly IV iron dose per subject between arms, including factors for baseline dose, treatment and the randomization stratification factors. Additional secondary/exploratory endpoints are listed in Appendix 2. All a nalyses of secondary endpoints are of exploratory nature, summary statistical and nominal one-sided -p values will be used to describe the results and for any treatment comparisons. 9.4.2.2. Safety Analyses Safety data, including all AEs (i.e., non-serious, serious and AEs of special interest), laboratory data, vital signs, concomitant medications and meeting protocol defined stopping criteria (e.g., liver chemistry) will be descriptively summarized by treatment arm. Reasons for stopping randomized treatment and for early study withdrawal will also be summarized by treatment group and time to stopping treatment or study will be presented graphically and assessed. Full details of all safety data reporting will be described in the RAP. 9.4.3. Multiplicity Strategy The primary endpoint will be tested first for non- inferiority, using the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval. Conditional on achieving statistical significance (i.e. passing the primary gate by establishing non -inferiority) the single principal seco ndary endpoint will be tested for superiority using a one-sided 2.5% significance level. This two-step hierarchical strategy will preserve the study -wise Type I error rate at a one-sided 2.5% level. The additional secondary/exploratory endpoints as listed in Appendix 2, if tested, will not be adjusted for multiplicity. A nominal one-sided 2.5% significance level will be applied per test."
49,page_49,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 50 9.4.4. Covariates and Subgroups of Interest The primary and principal secondary endpoint will be evaluated for a set of pre- specified subgroups to support the proposed indication. Subgroup analyses are aimed to assess for consistency with the overall result, they may have low power if the subgroup is small. Statistical models will be adjuste d for the covariates used in the original analysis, baseline, subgroup, treatment and treatment by subgroup interaction. Point estimates and two-sided 95% CIs will be estimated (presented on Forest Plots) and the subgroup by treatment interaction p -value calculated. Subgroup analyses will not be adjusted for multiplicity. Further subgroups/covariates may be defined in the RAP. Category Subgroups Age <65 years, ≥65 years - <75, ≥75 years Gender Female, Male Race group American Indian or Alaskan Nat ive, Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, Mixed Race Ethnicity Hispanic, non -Hispanic Region US, EU, RoW (repeat using US, Non -US) Dialysis type HD, PD (repeat using HD, HDF/HF, PD) Dialysis status Planned, unplanned (ur gent) start Baseline Hgb <9, 9 to <10, 10 to 11, >11 g/dL BMI <30, ≥30 Weight < 75kg, ≥75kg Baseline hsCRP ≤3 mg/L, >3 mg/L Additional exploratory subgroups may be defined in the RAP. 9.4.4.1. Exploratory Cardiovascular Safety Analysis This study is not designed or sufficiently powered for formal statistical analyses to assess cardiovascular safety. With fewer than 80 first MACE (defined as all -cause mortality, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke) expected to occur during the trial, incidence rates and two-sided 95% CIs will be computed for the following mortality and CV composite or component endpoints: 1) MACE; 2) MACE or a thromboembolic event (vascular access thrombosis, a symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or a symptomatic pulmonary embolism); 3) MACE or hospitalization for heart failure; 4) all cause mortality; 5) CV mortality; 6) MI (fatal and non -fatal); 7) stroke (fatal and non- fatal); 8) CV mortality or non-fatal MI; 9) all cause hospitalization. 9.4.5. Interim Analysis The IDMC will periodically receive unblinded safety reports containing clinical endpoints (whether adjudicated or pending adjudication) and SAEs, from an independent Statistical Data Analysis Center (SDAC) while Phase 3 studies with daprodustat are ongoing. The IDMC may recommend stopping this study for safety at any time ."
50,page_50,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 51 There is no formal intent to evalu ate interim data from this study for the purposes of stopping early for Hgb efficacy or futility. Further details will be specified in the IDMC charter and RAP. 9.4.6. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses The ‘PK Population' is defined as subjects for whom a PK sample was obtained and analyzed. This will be the population used for all the PK displays. The following plasma PK parameters will be determined for daprodustat and metabolites: Ctau (pre -dose) and Cmax. Plasma daprodustat and metabolites concentra tion data will be listed and summarized by planned collection time and daprodustat dose administered at PK visit. PK parameter data will be listed and summarized by daprodustat dose administered at PK visit, and dose- normalized (per mg) PK parameter data will be summarized. All PK data will be stored in the Archives, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, R&D. The following exploratory graphics will be created. Based on these, and the efficacy and safety results from other Phase 3 studies, post-hoc exploratory exposure- response/safety modelling may be conducted, including exploratory graphics with metabolites. Further details will be provided in the RAP. • Scatter plots of daprodustat PK parameters (C tau and C max) dose normalized to 1 mg vs. percent time in range during EP. • Scatter plots of average daprodustat dose during EP vs. percent time in range during EP. • Scatter plots of daprodustat PK parameters (C tau and C max) dose normalized to average dose during EP vs. percent time in range during EP. • Scatter plots of daprodustat PK parameters (C tau and C max) dose normalized to 1 mg vs. change from baseline of Hgb during EP. • Scatter plots of average daprodustat dose during EP vs. change from baseline of Hgb during EP. • Scatter plots of daprodustat PK parameters (C tau and C max) dose normalized to average dose during EP vs. change from baseline of Hgb during EP. • Boxplots of daprodustat PK parameters dose normalized to 1 mg by subjects with or without MACE or a combined safety endpoint of MACE + thromboembolic event + hospi talization for heart failure"

Analysis of Patient Reported Outcomes Measures Analysis to compare the patient reported effects of daprodustat and rhEPO on symptoms, severity, HR -QoL, and health status, as discussed in Section 7.7, will be described in the RAP. I n order to establish and evaluate the measurement properties of the CKD- QA, an interim cut of blinded observations of at least 50 subjects who completed the Week 28 visit will be taken. The data cut will require the following variables through Week 28 : PGI-C, PGI-S, Hgb, SF- 36, demographic and baseline clinical characteristics. The interim data cut will be used to conduct confirmatory factor analysis in order to establish a scoring algorithm for potential instrument domains and to evaluate the reliabilit y, validity and responsiveness of the instrument without regard to treatment group. A full description of the data cut, variables of interest and analyses to establish the scoring and to evaluate the measurement properties of the CKD -QA will be specified a priori within a separate psychometric analysis plan. 10.

Cancer -related mortality and tumor progression and recurrence In clinical trials, use of rhEPO and its analogs in patients with cancer has been associated with increased risk of cancer related morbidity and mortality.

There have been no histopathologic findings suggestive of PAH in pre- clinical safety studies with daprodustat up to 13- weeks duration in dogs, up to 2- years in rat s and mice, and up to 39- weeks in monkeys. Acute hypoxic challenge (rats): Daprodustat produced increases in peak right ventricular pressure (PRVP) during acute hypoxia that were slightly higher than the vehicle control group. However, these hypoxia- induced PRVP changes were within the range of PRVP changes noted among un-treated rats. Results from a clinical study of acute hypoxic challenge in healthy volunteers demonstrated that short -term (5 days) therapy with daprodustat 5mg or 100mg had no clinically significant effect on transthoracic echocardiographic (ECHO) estimate s of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PA SP) under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. ECHO assessments performed in Phase 2b studies (24 weeks treatment duration) did not identify any clinically meaningful changes in PA SP in subjects not on dialysis for daprodustat. In hemodialysis subjects, mean absolute change from baseline in PAS P was similar for both treatment groups; however, there was a numeric imbalance (daprodustat Total: 8 [7%]; Control 0) in subjects reaching the PA SP PCI (>20 mmHg increase from baseline). Regarding this imbalance, there were a number of confounding factors in the study, most notably a 4.5:1 randomization scheme and inconsistency in timing of ECHOs relative to dialysis day. Additionally, 2 of 3 subjects with resolution of PA SP on safety follow -up ECHOs had confounding conditions that could contribute to resolution other than discontinuation of study drug; and there was no dose relationship for subjects meeting the PA SP PCI cri terion.

Following review of clinical data received to date, this has not been identified as a safety concern for daprodustat. Cardiomyopathy Published data suggest that cardiac effects of HIF stabilization are likely a function of the mechanism, extent, and duration of the effects, and can range from protective to detrimental depending upon the specific model and experimental conditions utilized. With lifetime exposure to daprodustat in a 2- year rat oral carcinogenicity study, an exacerbation of rat spontaneous, progressive cardiomyopathy (PCM)(focal myofiber degeneration/necrosis with inflammatory infiltrates) was observed at doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and above, although total incidence and severity distribution within any daprodustat -group were within historical control ranges. This is consistent with an equivocal threshold for exacerbation of spontaneous, progressive cardiomyopathy at 0.8 mg/kg/day which is also the threshold dose for observing increased Hct values in individual rats . Cardiomyopathy has not been associated with naturally occurring mutation in man which results in increased HIF stabilization. ECHO assessments performed in phase 2b studies (24 weeks treatment duration) did not identify any clinically meaningful changes in LVEF with daprodustat.

No abnormalities were seen in non- clinical studies conducted to date for daprodustat. Following review of clinical data received to date, this has not been identified as a safety concern for daprodustat. • Unblinded monitoring of safety data by an IDMC in-stream throughout the study. Drug -drug interactions Daprodustat is a substrate of CYP2C8 : Co-administration of daprodustat with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (gemfibrozil) increased the Cmax and AUC of daprodustat, 4- and 19- fold, respectively, while co- administration of a weak inhibitor (trimethoprim) increased the Cmax and AUC of daprodustat by 1.3- and 1.5- fold, respectively. Population PK analysis from completed Phase 2 studies suggests that co- administration of daprodustat with a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor (clopidogrel), leads to a ~ 2- fold increase in AUC, with no clinically -significant increase in the measured Hgb response. Although CYP2C8 induction studies were not performed, co- administration of daprodustat with an inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin/rifampicin) may decrease the exposure of daprodustat. Even though co- administration of daprodustat with strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C8 is prohibited, inadvertent co- administration may occur. Due to the known time delay in enhancing erythropoiesis by daprodustat, co-administration with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors for up to 14 days is not anticipated to lead to immediate marked increases in hemoglobin levels. Therefore, there is adequate time to change to alternate therapy that does not inhibit CYP2C8. Additionally, as the time for maximum induction of CYP2C8 occurs after approximately 10- 14 days of dosing with rifampin (Brodie, 2013 and Ohnhaus , 1989), daprodustat systemic exposure will decrease over time which will result in a lag period before an effect on Hgb is recognized and is of clinical concern. • Co-administration of daprodustat with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) and inducers (e.g., rifampin/rifampicin) is not permitted as outlined in Section 6.9.2 . • Co-administration of daprodustat with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (i.e., clopidogrel, teriflunomide, deferasirox) should be performed with caution. If one of these medications is started, stopped or the dose is changed, Hgb should be monitored every 4 weeks for 12 weeks as outlined in Section 6.9.1 . • Specific guidance on the management of potential drug- drug interactions and concomitant medications is provided in Section 6.9.. • Hgb will be closely monitored throughout the dosing period as outlined in the Time and Events Table (Table 6) •Specific guidance for dose adjustment, dose interruption, or discontinuation of daprodustat based on achieved Hgb is provided in Section 6.2.1 and Appendix 3. •Unblinded monitoring of safety data by an IDMC in- stream throughout the study."

Contracept ive subdermal implant. 2. Intrauterine device or intrauterine system. 3. Combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive [ Trussell , 2011] 4. Injectable progestogen [Trussell , 2011] 5. Contraceptive vaginal ring [ Trussell , 2011] 6. Percutaneous contraceptive patches [Trussell , 2011] 7. Male partner sterilization prior to the female subject's entry into the stu dy, and this male is the sole partner for that subject [Trussell , 2011]. The documentation on male sterility can come from the site personnel’s: review of subject’s medical records, medical examination and/or semen analysis, or medical history interview provided by her or her partner. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. The list does not apply to FRP with same sex partners or for subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. • Non-reproductive potential defined as either: 1. Pre-menopausal with one of the following: (i) documented tubal ligation; (ii) documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; (iii) hysterectomy; or (iv) documented bilateral oophorectomy, or; 2.

Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Stopping Events Not Related to randomize d Treatment Restart refers to resuming randomized treatment following liver stopping events in which there is a clear underlying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g. biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis). F urthermore, there should be no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hypersensitivity, and the randomized treatment should not be associated with HLA markers of liver injury. Approval by GSK for randomized treatment restart can be considered where: • Investigator requests consideration for randomized treatment restart if liver chemistries have a clear underlying cause (e.g., biliary obstruction, hypotension and liver chemistries have improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and ALT <3xULN). • Restart risk f actors (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia, or hypersensitivity, alcoholic hepatitis, possible randomized treatment-induced liver injury) or randomized treatment has an HLA genetic marker associated with liver injury (e.g. lapatinib, abacavir, amoxicillin/clav ulanate) are reviewed and excluded. • Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board approval of randomized treatment restart must be obtained, as required. • If restart of randomized treatment is approved by GSK Medical Governance in writing, the subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of randomized treatment administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death. • The subject must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the randomized treatment restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart. • Randomized treatment must be administered at the dose specified by GSK. • Subjects approved by GSK Medical Governance for restarting randomized treatment must return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries have been demonstrated and then laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol. • If after randomized treatment re -start, subject meets protocol- defined liver chemistry stopping criteria, follow usual stopping criteria instructions."

Definition of Adverse Events Adverse Event Definition: • An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. • NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Events meeting AE definition include: • Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or ur inalysis) or other safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator. • Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. • New conditions detected or diagnosed after randomized treatment administration even though it may have been present prior to the s tart of the study. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either randomized treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae). • ""Lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT meeting definition of an AE include: • Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. • The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition."
84,page_84,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 85 • Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. • Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). • Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 12.8.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Events If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease, etc). Serious Adverse Eve nt (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death b. Is life -threatening NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of th e event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization NOTE: • In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out- patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization ar e AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. • Hospitalization for elective tre atment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d. Results in disability/incapacity NOTE: • The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. • This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday"

Other situations: • Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. • Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse g. Is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function defined as: • ALT ≥ 3xULN and total bilirubin* ≥ 2xULN (>35% direct), or • ALT ≥ 3xULN and INR** > 1.5. * Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If fractionation is unavailable and ALT ≥ 3xULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN, then the event is still to be reported as an SAE. ** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply to subjects receiving anticoagulants. If INR measurement is obtained, the value is to be recorded on the SAE form. 12.8.3. Recording of AEs and SAEs AEs and SAE Recording: • When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. • The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in the CRF • It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to PPD in lieu of completion of the PPD/GSK, AE/SAE CRF page. • There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by PPD. In this instance, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be blinded on the copies of the medi cal records prior to submission of to PPD. • The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis will be"
86,page_86,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 87 documented as the AE/SAE and not the individua l signs/symptoms. • Subject -completed Patient Reported Outcomes questionnaires and the collection of AE data are independent components of the study. 12.8.4. Evaluating AEs and SAEs Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and will assign it to one of the following categories: • Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. • Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities • Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. - an AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a category utilized for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. • An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre-defined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE. Assessment of Causality • The investigator is obligated to as sess the relationship between randomized treatment and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. • A ""reasonable possibility"" is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. • The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. • Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the randomized treatm ent will be considered and investigated. • The investigator will also consult the Investigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment. • For each AE/SAE the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. • There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to PPD. However, it is very impor tant that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the initial transmission of the SAE data to PPD."
87,page_87,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 88 • The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE data collection tool accordingly. • The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs • The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurement s and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested by PPD to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. • The investigator is obligated to assist. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or consultation with other health care professionals. • If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a copy of any post-mortem findings, including histopathology. • New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. • The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within the designated reporting time frames. 12.8.5. Reporting of SAEs to PPD SAE reporting to PPD via electron ic data collection tool • Primary mechanism for reporting SAEs to PPD will be the electronic data collection tool • If the electronic system is unavailable for greater than 24 hours, the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool and fax it to the Medic al Monitor Site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available. • The investigator will be required to confirm review of the SAE causality by ticking the ‘reviewed’ box at the bottom of the eCRF page within 72 hours of submission of the SAE. • After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool (e.g., InForm system) will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data • If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study subject or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off-line, the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or to the Medical Monitor by telephone. • Contac ts for SAE receipt will be provided in a separate document."

The investigator will collect follow up information on mother and infant, which wi ll be forwarded to PPD. Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. • Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure. • While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. • A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. • Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy which is considered reasonably related to the randomized treatment by the investigator, will be reported to PPD as described in Section 12.8.5. W hile the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

89,page_89,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 90 12.10. Appendix 10: Genetic Research Genetics – Background Naturally occurring genetic variation may contribute to inter -individual variability in response to medicines, as well as an individual's risk of developing specific diseases. Genetic factors associated with disease characteristics may also be associated with response to therapy, and could help to explain some clinical study outcomes. For example, genetic variants associated with age- related macular degeneration (AMD) are reported to account for much of the risk for the condition [ Gorin , 2012] with certain variants reported to influence treatment response [Chen , 2012]. Thus, knowledge of the genetic etiology of disease may better inform understanding of disease and the development of medicines. Additionally, genetic variability may impact the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination), or pharmacodynamics (relationship between concentration and pharmacologic effects or the time course of pharmacologic effects) of a specific medicine and/or clinical outcomes (efficacy and/or safety) observed in a clinical study. Genetic Research Objectives and Analyses The objectives of the genetic research are to investigate the relationship between genetic variants and: • Response to medicine, including any treatment regimens under investigation in this study or any concomitant medicines; • Anemia associated with CKD susceptibility, severity, and progression and related conditions Genetic data may be generated while the study is underway or following completion of the study. Genetic evaluations may include focused candidate gene approaches and/or examination of a large number of genetic variants throughout the genome (whole genome analyses ). Genetic analyses will utilize data collected in the study and will be limited to understanding the objectives highlighted above. Analyses may be performed using data from multiple clinical studies to investigate these research objectives. Appropriate d escriptive and/or statistical analysis methods will be used. A detailed description of any planned analyses will be documented in a Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP) prior to initiation of the analysis. Planned analyses and results of genetic investigation s will be reported either as part of the clinical RAP and study report, or in a separate genetics RAP and report, as appropriate. Study Population Any subject who is enrolled in the study can participate in genetic research. Any subject who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from the genetic research."
90,page_90,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 91 Study Assessments and Procedures A key component of successful genetic research is the collection of samples during clinical studies. Collection of samples, even when no a priori hypothesis has been identified, may enable future genetic analyses to be conducted to help understand variability in disease and medicine response. • A 6 ml blood sample will be taken for Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. A blood sample is collect ed at the baseline visit, after the subject has been randomized and provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for collection and shipping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory manual. The DNA from the blood sample may undergo quality control analyses to confirm the integrity of the sample. If there are concerns regarding the quality of the sample, then the sample may be destroyed. The blood sample is taken on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to a n inability to utilize the original sample. The genetic sample is labelled (or “coded”) with the same study specific number used to label other samples and data in the study. This number can be traced or linked back to the subject by the investigator o r site staff. Coded samples do not carry personal identifiers (such as name or social security number). Samples will be stored securely and may be kept for up to 15 years after the last subject completes the study, or GSK may destroy the samples sooner. GSK or those working with GSK (for example, other researchers) will only use samples collected from the study for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed consent form. Samples may be used as part of the development of a companion diagnostic to support the GSK medicinal product. Subjects can request their sample to be destroyed at any time. Informed Consent Subjects who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study. Informed consent for genetic research must be obtained prior to any blood being taken. Subject Withdrawal from Study If a subject who has consented to participate in genetic research withdraws from the clinical study for any reason other than being lost to follow-up, the subject will be given a choice of one of the following options concerning the genetic sample, if already collected: • Continue to participate in the genetic research in which case the genetic DNA sample is retained • Discontinue participation in the genetic research and destroy the genetic DNA sample"
91,page_91,"2015N234534_01 CONFIDENTIAL 201410 92 If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for any reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction within the timeframe specified by GSK and maintain the documentation in the site study records. Genotype data may be generated during the study or after completion of the study and may be analyzed during the study or stored for future analysis. • If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research and genotype data has not been analyzed, it will not be analyzed or used for future research. • Genetic data that has been analyzed at the time of withdrawn consent will continue to be stored and used, as appropriate. Screen and Baseline Failures If a sa mple for genetic research has been collected and it is determined that the subject does not meet the entry criteria for participation in the study, then the investigator should instruct the subject that their genetic sample will be destroyed. No forms are required to complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent and sample reconciliation process. In this instance a sample destruction form will not be available to include in the site files. Provision of Study Results and Confidentiali ty of Subject’s Genetic Data GSK may summarize the genetic research results in the clinical study report, or separately and may publish the results in scientific journals. GSK may share genetic research data with other scientists to further scientific understanding in alignment with the informed consent. GSK does not inform the subject, family members, insurers, or employers of individual genotyping results that are not known to be relevant to the subject’s medical care at the time of the study, unless required by law. This is due to the fact that the information generated from genetic studies is generally preliminary in nature, and therefore the significance and scientific validity of the results are undetermined. Further, data generated in a research lab oratory may not meet regulatory requirements for inclusion in clinical care. References Chen H, Yu KD, Xu GZ.

List of Specific Changes Section 1. P rotocol Synopsis, type and Number of Subjects, updated time period of start of chronic dialysis (HD or PD) to within the 6 weeks from the day of screening to be consistent with extended screening period. Revised Text: The study will enroll the following types of subjects with anemia associated with CKD: Planned initiation of dialysis: Subjects who are planning to start chronic dialy sis (HD or PD) within the next 2 -4 weeks 6 weeks (from the day of screening). Section 1. Protocol Synopsis, type and number of subjects, changed the number of subjects that need to be screened. Revised Text: Approximately 600 subjects are expected to be screened in order to randomize approximately 300 subjects, or 150 subjects per treatment group This study will randomize ap proximately 300 subjects, or 150 subjects per treatment group Section 4.2 Type and Number of Subjects, updated the time period of planning to start dialysis from the day of screening to be consistent with the extended screening period, when appropraite .

Revised Text: Based on an assumed screen failure rate of 50%, approximately 600 subjects are expected to be screened in order to randomize approximately 300 subjects, or 150 subjects per treatment group. This study will randomize approximately 300 subjects, or 150 subjects per treatment group. Section 4.5.2. Benefit Assessment. Clarified wording around other ESAs. Revised Text: Daprodustat may present several important advantages over rhEPO and other ESAs its analogs . Treatment of anemia of CKD wit h rhEPO is associated with increased CV risk which is postulated to be related to the associated supra- physiological increases in EPO exposure with rhEPO [Szczech, 2008]; therefore, daprodustat has the potential to raise Hgb without the same CV risk associated with rhEPO and its analogs.

In order to mitigate subjects remaining below the Hgb target range for an extended period of time, adjustments to the algorithm may be implement ed by the Sponsor as outlined in Appendix 3 based on the review of aggregate blinded instream Hgb data. Section 6.6.1. Randomized Treatment Extended Interruption; new section. Added direction regarding randomized treatment and study continuation for subjects who will be away from the research site for an extended period of time. Revised Text: 6.6.1.

Added supplementary analyses information. Revised Text: It will provide a point estimate and two -sided 95% CI for the treatment effect, together with the one -sided non- inferiority test p -value. Sensitivity and Supplementary Analyses: Sensitivity analyses for the primary estimand will include a multiple imputation -based “tipping point” analysis where assumptions are adjusted until non- inferiority is lost by imputing data for subjects who did not fully complete the EP. A further supplementary analysis will evaluate efficacy in those subjects who adhere to randomized treatment, defined as ITT subjects with at least one on-treatment Hgb during the EP (this approach corresponds to evaluating an efficacy estimand). A similar “tipping point” analysis as that described above for the primary analysis will be performed for this “on -drug” analysis. In addition, a supplementa ry per- protocol sensitivity analysis will estimate the treatment effect in subjects who strongly adhere to the protocol, and sensitivity analyses to explore a shorter EP (Weeks 28 to 36) will be performed for the primary effectiveness estimand and “on -drug” efficacy estimand.

ECHO assessments performed in Phase 2b studies (24 weeks treatment duration) did not identify any clinically meaningful changes in s PASP in subjects not on dialysis for daprodustat. In hemodialysis subjects, mean absolute change from baseline in sPASP was similar for both treatment groups; however, there was a numeric imbalance (daprodustat Total: 8 [7%]; Control 0) in subjects reaching the s PASP PCI ( >20 mmHg increase from baseline). Regarding this imbalance, there were a number of confounding factors in the study, most notably a 4.5:1 randomization scheme and inconsistency in timing of ECHOs relative to dialysis day.

Cardiomyopathy Published data suggest that cardiac effects of HIF stabilization are likely a function of the mechanism, extent, and duration of the effects, and can range from protective to detrimental depending upon the specific mod el and experimental conditions utilized. Small increases in cardiac troponin in 6 month rat study with daprodustat were consistent with the background finding of spontaneous rodent cardiomyopathy. There were no elevations observed in cardiac troponin in 9 month monkey study with daprodustat. With lifetime exposure to daprodustat in a 2 -year rat oral carcinogenicity study, an exacerbation of rat spontaneous, progressive cardiomyopathy (PCM)(focal myofiber degeneration/necrosis with inflammatory infiltrates) was observed at doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and above, although total incidence and severity distribution within any daprodustat -group were within historical control ranges.

Use of BCRP inhibitors (mostly weak) was found to result in a small change in metabolite exposure (20% increase in AUC). Daprodust at is an inhibitor of OATP1B1/1B3 in vitro, with IC 50 values of 6 µM and 11 µM, respectively. A clinical drug interaction study between 25mg daprodustat with either a CYP2C8 substrate or an OATP1B1/1B3 substrate showed that there is no PK interaction at th is dose of daprodustat. Although CYP2C8 induction studies were not performed, co - administration of daprodustat with an inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin/rifampicin) may decrease the exposure of daprodustat. Even though co -administration of daprodustat with strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C8 is prohibited, inadvertent co-administration may occur. Due to the known time delay in enhancing erythropoiesis by daprodustat, co -administration with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors for up to 14 days is not anticipated to lead to immediate marked increases in hemoglobin levels. Therefore, there is adequate time to change to alternate therapy that does not inhibit CYP2C8. Additionally, as the time for maximum induction of CYP2C8 occurs after approximately 10 -14 days of do sing with rifampin (Brodie, 2013 and Ohnhaus, 1989), daprodustat Table (Table 6) •Specific guidance for dose adjustment, dose interruption, or discontinuation of daprodustat based on achieved Hgb is provided in Section 6.2.1 and Appendix 3. •Unblinded monitoring of safety data by an IDMC in -stream throughout the study."
