For each subject, the study foot (i.e. the foot that will be treated wi th study treatment during the study) will be evaluated for all efficacy analyses, regardless of the presence of HAV in the contralateral foot. For subjects presenting with bilateral HAV at Screening, the investigator will determine which foot is of greater severity based on his/her clinical judgment following clinical evaluation of the degree of pain (including assessment of NPRS score for each foot during Screening), degree of disability and clinical evaluation of the degree of angular deviation of the hal lux, as well as meeting all other study entry criteria. In these subjects, the foot with the greatest severity of HAV, based on clinical evaluation by the investigator (and meeting all other study entry criteria), will be selected for treatment with DB stu dy treatment in this study. Following completion of the DB period (i.e. completion of Cycle 1), subjects who meet retreatment criteria will be eligible to participate in the OL period. All retreatment -eligible subjects will receive OL treatment with Dyspo rt 300 U at the first retreatment cycle (Cycle 2) in the HAV study foot selected during the DB period. At the second retreatment cycle (Cycle 3), subjects will be treated with either Dysport 300 U or 500 U in the HAV study foot based on investigator judgme nt and following clinical evaluation at the time of retreatment. The decision to increase the dose at the beginning of Cycle 3 will be based on 1) evaluation of safety and tolerability (review related AEs and consideration of any significant changes in the study foot) and 2) severity of pain (considering NPRS score) and disability (considering mFFI Disability subscale score) experienced by the subject at the time of evaluation. The muscles to be injected and procedures for injection are identical to those targeted in the DB period. As in the DB period, each treatment cycle in the OL period (Cycles 2 and 3) will be separated by at least 12 weeks. After Cycle 1 of the DB period, subjects who do not meet the retreatment criteria will be evaluated by the invest igator at the next scheduled study visit (every 28 days) to determine eligibility to receive retreatment with Dysport in the OL period. Subjects who do not meet the retreatment criteria by Week 24 will not be eligible for retreatment in the OL period. As s uch, the maximum duration of participation in the study for a given subject will be 36 weeks. Subjects will be considered to have completed the study after they complete all of the assessments required for the Week 36 visit. The study will be considered co mplete after the last subject has completed their last follow -up visit. Number of subjects planned : A total of 165 subjects are planned to be enrolled in the study. Subjects enrolled during the DB period will roll over into the OL period. Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion : Inclusion criteria: Subjects must meet all inclusion criteria at Screening and Baseline and none of the exclusion criteria to be considered for enrolment in the study. (1) Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedure (2) Male or female, aged 18 years or older (3) Clinical diagnosis of HAV as determined by the investigator based on evidence of lateral deviation of either great toe (left or right), as well as assessment of NPRS scores for each foot (in bi lateral subjects). (4) Subjects must present with a score of ≥4 on the NPRS in the study foot at Baseline (5) Subjects must present with a score of >27 on the mFFI Pain subscale in the study foot at Baseline"

Test product, dose, mode of administration : A blinded kit will be used in this study to maintain the blinding of the study during the DB period. Each blinded kit will contain two vials regardless of treatment assignment. The two vials in each kit will contain either a Dysport 300 U vial + a placebo vi al, a Dysport 500 U vial + a placebo vial or two placebo vials, based on treatment assignment. Investigators will be blinded to which vial contains Dysport and which vial contains placebo. The blinded active study treatment, Dysport, will be provided as a white, lyophilised powder in vials containing 300 U or 500 U of BTX -A-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA). Before each administration, the powder in each vial in the blinded kit will be reconstituted at the investigational site with 1.0 mL of 0.9% sterile (preservative free) sodium chloride for injection. The contents of each vial will be combined for a total volume of 2.0 mL (150 U/mL for Dysport 300 U and 250 U/mL for Dysport 500 U). Investigators will inject 0.5 mL of the reconstituted solution c ontaining study treatment into each of four specified muscles of the foot (2.0 mL total volume) under guidance with a peripheral electrical stimulator. Subjects assigned to receive 300 U of Dysport will be treated with 75 U of Dysport per muscle (300 U dos e divided equally among each of four specified muscles of the foot). Subjects assigned to receive 500 U of Dysport will be treated with 125 U of Dysport per muscle (500 U dose divided equally among each of four specified muscles of the foot). To administer the study treatment, a peripheral electrical stimulator (with or without complementary techniques for identifying target muscles) will be used to locate the muscles in the foot.

The placebo study treatment (administered only during the DB period) will be provided as a white, lyophilis ed powder and will be indistinguishable from the active product. Placebo will contain only the excipients of Dysport. There will be two matching placebo vials: one matching the 500 U Dysport vial and one matching the 300 U Dysport vial. A blinded kit will be used in this study to maintain the blinding of the study. The procedures for reconstitution of blinded placebo study treatment will be identical to that described above for the active study treatment. Before each administration, the powder from the vial s will be reconstituted at the investigational site with 0.9% sterile (preservative free) sodium chloride for injection, to a total volume of 2.0 mL. The total treatment volume will be divided equally across the four specified muscles of the foot (i.e. 0.5 mL per injection site). To administer the study treatment, a peripheral electrical stimulator (with or without complementary techniques for identifying target muscles) will be used to locate the muscles in the foot.

Although HAV affects approximately 23% of adults worldwide [1], very few effective treatments exist to treat this condition. The morphological changes observed in HAV patients present clinically as lateral deviation s of hallux which can be measured directly using the hallux valgus (HV) angle and intermetatarsal angle (Figure 1). Figure 1 Hallux Abductus Angle Adapted from: Coughlin and Jones [ 2] Clinical evaluation of HAV includes establishment of th e functional status of the patient including pain and the degree of disability [3] in addition to the morphological changes observed in the foot. W hile HAV is typically managed initially by orthotic applications such as splints, inserts or braces used to correct foot biomechanics, the efficacy of these interventions is widely considered to be largely ineffective with substantial evidence suggesting t hat these devices are no more effective than no treatment at all [4]. The standard of care for HAV patients is limited to surgical intervention in which the deformed bone and/or soft tissue is removed to ameliorate the deformity. However, recovery time and required physical therapy following surgery are significant and the procedure is associated with post -surgical pain of significant duration [5]. Moreover, a proportion of patients fail to derive long -term benefit with surgical interventions and experience recurrence of HAV [ 6]. Development of HAV is associated with extrinsic factors (high heeled or constricting shoes, excessive weight bearing) as well as intrinsic factors, including genet ics, age, and a number of morphological and muscular podiatric abnormalities (e.g. pes planus) [6]. There is strong evidence to suggest that the st ructural abnormalities and subsequent mechanical dysfunction that result in the development of HAV are related to progressive changes in the muscles of the affected foot. For example, muscle imbalance of the abductor and adductor hallucis muscles have been shown to be apparent in HAV patients, with the abductor hallucis muscle showing decreased activity compared with the adductor hallucis muscle in these patients [ 7]. This imbalance allows the adductor hallucis muscle to gain mechanical advantage thereby pulling the hallux laterally forcing the first metatarsal head to drift medially off of the sesamoid apparatus, causing the proximal phalanx to move into a valgus position as it is tethered at its"
18,page_18,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 19/136 base to the sesamoids, the deep transverse ligament (via the plantar plate), and the adductor hallucis tendon [6; 8]. The extensor and flexor hallucis longus tendons appear to bowstring laterally [9], increasing the valgus displacement and occasionally acting as dorsiflexors of the proximal phalanx. As the metatarsal head sits on the medial sesamoid as a result of lateral displacement of the hallux, erosion of the cartilage and the crista have been o bserved. Functionally, these structural changes cause the bursa overlying the medial eminence to thicken because of the pressure effect of footwear on a prominent medial eminence, leading to significant and chronic pain and severe mobility limitations. Given the considerable involvement of these specific musculoskeletal abnormalities of the foot in the development and progression of HAV, it is reasonable to consider the utility of targeted local injections of botulinumtoxinA for the treatment of HAV, give n the demonstrated ability of these toxins to reduce localized hypertonia in injected muscles. Intramuscular botulinumtoxinA injections reduce muscle hypertonicity by blocking the release of presynaptic acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Botulinu mtoxinA injections have been proven useful in treating muscle imbalance, muscle spasms and in providing significant pain reduction in patients with foot disorders such as plantar fasciitis [8; 10; 11]. Moreover, there is direct evidence to suggest that injection of botulinumtoxinA into specific muscles of the foot results in clinically meaningful changes in hallux valgus angle, foot pain and functional mobility [ 8; 10]. In a double blind, randomised, placebo -controlled study of botulinumtoxinA, Wu, et al. injected botulinumtoxinA divided across the oblique and transverse heads of the adductor hallucis, the flexor hallucis brevis, and the extensor hallucis longus muscles in patients with a diagnosis of HAV. The primary outcome mea sures in this study were subscales on pain and disability in the Taiwan Chinese version of the Foot Function Index (FFI). The results of this study showed robust improvements in pain (p<0.001) and disability (p<0.05) in the group treated with botulinumtoxi nA compared with those treated with normal saline (placebo). An immediate reduction in pain intensity was noted in the botulinumtoxinA group, reaching a plateau in the second month and persisting for up to six months post injection. [ 10]. Reduction in foot pain following treatment with botulinumtoxinA as demonstrated in these studies is of particular relevance in HAV. Several studies have demonstrat ed that foot pain is the primary outcome measure used to define efficacy in HAV (i.e. following surgical correction) [ 11] and the use of the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for foot pain is a reliable and widely used instrument for this purpose [ 13; 14; 15]. Hallux abducto valgus remains a highly prevalent and debilitating foot abnormality for which the standard of care, surgical correction, is associated with a significant recovery time, considerable patient burden and elevated risk. Long -term outcomes for this treatment also suggest recurrence is common. Given the underlying in volvement of selected foot muscles in the development of HAV, targeted injections Dysport in the foot has the potential to be a safe and effective intervention for the treatment of HAV. The clinical efficacy observed in HAV patients following treatment wit h botulinumtoxinA in prior studies, strongly suggests that this treatment would be an important addition to the current treatment armamentarium. 1.2 Study Rationale Intramuscular botulinumtoxinA injections reduce muscle hypertonicity by blocking the release of presynaptic acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. BotulinumtoxinA injections have been proved useful in treating muscle imbalance, muscle spasms and in providing significant pain reduction in patients with foot disorders such as plantar fasciitis. There is also evidence showing that botulinumtoxinA injection was effective for the treatment of pain and disability associated with HAV. Several studies have compared HAV subjects with their normal counterparts and found pathologic and electromyographic e vidence of HAV -related muscle degeneration [6; 16; 17]."

Muscle imbalance of the abductor and adductor hallucis muscles has been demonstrated in HAV patients. When the adductor hallucis is dysfunctional, the action of the abductor hallucis is exaggerated and pulls the ph alanx into pronation. The muscles that coordinate the movement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint consist of the oblique and transverse head of the adductor hallucis, extensor hallucis brevis, and flexor hallucis brevis. In patients with HAV, early ons et of stance phase activities was found in these four muscles. Hoffmeyer et al. examined the relationship between muscle pathology and HAV and found not only enlarged mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions but also myogenic and neurogenic alterations in patients with HAV [18]. An ultrasonic evaluation of the abductor hallucis muscle in patients with HAV also suggested that morphological changes may occur early in the development of the deformity. These findings suggest that a treatment strategy focused on intervention in HAV -related muscle groups may provide pain and disability relief, and may even suppress the progression of HAV. Therefore, the efficacy and tolerability of Dysport injections for the treatment of HAV in adult subjects will be evaluated in the present study. 1.3 Name and Description of Investigational Medicinal Product The investigational medicinal product being evaluated is Clostrid ium botulinum toxin type A haemagglutinin complex (BTX -A-HAC), (United States generic name, abobotulinumtoxinA) hereafter referred to as Dysport. Dysport is a protein complex derived from Clostridium BTX -A consisting of the neurotoxin and other proteins. D ysport is supplied as a white lyophilised powder, for reconstitution. The selection of Dysport doses to be evaluated in the present study (300 U and 500 U) are based on the demonstrated safety and efficacy of these doses in reducing hypertonia in muscles of similar size and volume to those planned for evaluation in this stud y (see Section 3.1) in the context of adult upper and lower limb spasticity with no unacceptable safety findings observed. A more detailed descript ion of the product is given in Section 3.4. 1.4 Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies In nonclinical studies, in vivo experiments demonstrate t he efficacy of low doses of botulinum toxin (BTX) in various cholinergic pathways. Pharmacokinetic and distribution studies performed with BTX -A have demonstrated that the majority of the toxin remained localised at the injection site, supporting the local effect of the toxin as the principal location of action. The results of the single - or repeat dose toxicity studies in animal models demonstrated that BTX-A administered in striated muscle possesses no potential for producing toxicity unrelated to its pha rmacological activity or specific target organ. The effects on injected muscles (decrease in muscle and myofibre size) were related to the pharmacological activity of BTX -A, and were consistent with the results of the pharmacodynamic Rat Muscle Force Test. Intramuscular administration of Dysport in healthy juvenile rats did not alter male or female rat fertility with toxicological profiles in juvenile animals observed to be similar to adults. No clinical studies have been conducted with Dysport for the trea tment of adults with HAV. However, Dysport has been in clinical use since 1990 and is now licensed in more than 80 countries worldwide for various therapeutic indications including: blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, upper and lower limb spasticity in adults , cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis), paediatric leg spasticity associated with cerebral palsy, and axillary hyperhidrosis. Studies conducted in these indications have shown Dysport to provide greater improvement in symptoms of these conditions comp ared with placebo, as well as demonstrating an acceptable safety profile. Further details may be found in the investigator’s brochure (IB)."
20,page_20,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 21/136 1.5 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects Dysport has proved to be an effective treatment for a numbe r of therapeutic indications, and to have an acceptable benefit -risk ratio. The posology and safety of Dysport has been established in numerous clinical studies and over 20 years of postmarketing experience. The majority of treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAEs) reported for Dysport are mild to moderate in intensity and of limited duration. This safety profile is thought to be related to the pharmacology of the toxin, which may potentially result in excess paralysis of the injected and adjacent muscles i n some patients. Dysport is generally well -tolerated, although temporary paralysis of non-targeted muscle groups may occur. AEs resulting from a possible remote spread of the toxin from its site of injection have been very rarely reported (including excess ive muscle weakness, dysphagia, and aspiration pneumonia). Local spread of the toxin from the injection site has also been reported and therefore the safety profile is dependent on the site of injection. The profile of adverse reactions reported during po stmarketing use reflects the pharmacology of the product and AEs seen during clinical studies. There have been occasional reports of hypersensitivity. In order to minimize the risk of serious reactions representing remote distribution of the effect of tox in, the guidance provided in the IB and/or in this protocol must be strictly followed. Additional information regarding risks and benefits to human subjects may be found in the IB. 1.6 Selection of Investigational Medicinal Products and Dosages The safety and efficacy of Dysport is already well established in various indications including adult upper and lower limb spasticity, and cervical dystonia. The doses to be evaluated in this study (i.e. Dysport 300 U and 500 U) were selected based on the demonstrated sa fety and efficacy of these doses in reducing hypertonia in muscles of similar size and volume in the context of adult upper and lower limb spasticity including, but not limited to, the flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, flexor digitorum profu ndus, flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor carpi radialis, flexor hallucis brevis and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles. In previous studies, each of these muscles were injected with 100 U to 200 U of Dysport in Studies Y-55-52120-140, Y-55-52120-142, Y-52-52120-145 and Y -52-52120-148, with no unacceptable safety findings observed. A more detailed description of administration procedures is given in Section 6.1. 1.7 Compliance Statement The study will be conducted in compliance with independent ethics committees/institutional review boards (IECs/IRBs), informed consent regulations, the Declaration of H elsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines. Any episode of noncompliance will be documented. In addition, the study will adhere to all local regulatory requirements. Before initiating a study, the i nvestigator/institution should have written and dated approval/favourable opinion from the IEC/IRB for the study protocol/amendment(s), written informed consent form, any consent form updates, subject emergency study contact cards, subject recruitment proc edures (e.g. advertisements), any written information to be provided to subjects and a statement from the IEC/IRB that they comply with GCP requirements. The IEC/IRB approval must identify the protocol version as well as the documents reviewed. 1.8 Population to Be Studied The study will enrol adult male and female subjects aged 18 years or older suffering from clinically significant HAV who have not undergone surgery for their condition."

The evaluation of efficac y (DB) and effectiveness (OL) will be based solely on the foot selected for treatment at Screening (i.e. study foot) meeting the study entry criteria. For each subject, the study foot (i.e. the foot that will be treated with study treatment during the stud y) will be evaluated for all efficacy analyses regardless of the presence of HAV in the contralateral foot. For subjects presenting with bilateral HAV at Screening, the investigator will determine which foot is of greater severity based on the clinical jud gment of the investigator following clinical evaluation of the degree of pain (including assessment of the NPRS scores for each foot during Screening), degree of disability and angular deviation of the hallux, and meeting all other study entry criteria. In these subjects, the foot with the greatest severity of HAV will be selected for treatment with DB study treatment in this study. During the DB period, study visits will proceed at the following intervals following study treatment administration and asses sments on Day 1: • Week 1 (Day 8) (clinic visit) • Week 4 (Day 29 (clinic visit) • Week 8 (Day 57) (clinic visit) • Week 12 (Day 85) (clinic visit*) • Additional visits every 4 weeks (*Note: Subjects will be evaluated for retreatment with Dysport 300 U in an OL fashion). 3.1.2 Open-label Period (Cycles 2 to 3): Following completion of all protocol -specified procedures for the DB period (i.e. completion of Cycle 1), subjects who meet retreatment criteria (see Section 3.1.2.1) will be treated during the OL period with Dysport (300 U) in the HAV study foot determined in the DB period. The muscles to be injected and procedures for injection are identical to those targ eted in the DB period. During the OL period, subjects may be treated with up to two additional cycles of Dysport with intervals of at least 12 weeks between each treatment cycle (see Figure 3). All retreatment - eligible subjects will receive OL treatment with Dysport 300 U at the first retreatment cycle (Cycle 2) in the HAV study foot determined in the DB period. At the second retr eatment cycle (Cycle 3), subjects will be treated in the HAV study foot with either Dysport 300 U or 500 U based on investigator judgment following clinical evaluation of the subject at the time of retreatment. The decision to increase the dose at the begi nning of Cycle 3 will be based on 1) evaluation of safety and tolerability (review related AEs and consideration of any significant changes in the study foot) and 2) severity of pain (considering NPRS score) and disability (considering mFFI Disability subs cale score) experienced by the subject at the time of evaluation. During the OL period, each treatment cycle (Cycles 2 and 3) will include the following study visits after the retreatment injection with Dysport at the beginning of each treatment cycle: • Week 1 (Day 8) (clinic visit) • Week 4 (Day 29) (clinic visit) • Week 8 (Day 57 (clinic visit) • Week 12 (Day 85) (clinic visit) • Additional visits every 4 weeks"

Subjects a nd investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the study. The sponsor’s randomisation manager who is a statistician independent from the study will prepare: • A list of randomisation numbers (List A). It will be produced in blocks, on a balanced ratio (1 placebo: 1 Dysport 300 U: 1 Dysport 500 U) and will be stratified by unilateral and bilateral HAV. • A list of treatment numbers/treatment which will be dispatched to the sites (list B). It will be produced in blocks, on a balanced ratio (1 placebo: 1 Dysport 300 U: 1 Dysport 500 U). The randomisation, as well as the treatment number(s) assignation at drug dispensation, will be managed by an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). After eligibility is confirmed, at baseline, subjects will be assigned to a randomisation number and to the associated treatment arm, in sequential order within each centre and within each level of strata. Subjects meeting the randomisation criteria will be assigned to a randomisation number, and will be allocated t o the associated treatment arm, by IRT. A treatment number will be also allocated by IRT each time drug is dispensed during the DB and OL cycles. The IRT will also manage all the logistical aspects of treatments (e.g.: drug supplies, replacement of lost, damaged, quarantined, expiring and expired kits). This service provides investigators, site co -ordinators and project team members with a 24 -hour per day, 7 -day per week service (additional details may be found in the IRT reference manual provided to each s ite). In case of medical or technical randomisation or dispensation queries, a 24-hour helpline is available – see supporting information in the investigator site file. Recruitment will stop once 165 evaluable subjects have been randomised. Randomised sub jects who terminate their study participation for any reason before administration of the first dose of randomised study drug will retain their randomisation and treatment numbers (i.e. these numbers will not be reused). The next subject will be given another randomisation number and another treatment number, even if he/she should receive the same treatment. Subjects who leave the study early will not be replaced. The sponsor’s randomisation manager will keep the master lists. A copy of the list of treatment numbers (list B) will be confidentially supplied to the CMC Supply Chain (Beaufour Ipsen Industrie SAS, rue d’Ethe Virton, 28100 Dreux, France) and to the Contr act Research Organisation (CRO) in charge of IRT. Similarly, a copy of the list of randomisation numbers (list A) will be also confidentially supplied to the CRO in charge of IRT. The master list(s) and the copy(ies) supplied to the CMC Supply Chain and CRO in charge of IRT will be kept confidential in a secure location. Access to the randomisation lists must be restricted until authorisation is given to release them for final analysis. 3.4 Maintenance of Randomisation and Blinding In an emergency situation, wh ich requires the identification of the study treatment group, the investigator may break the treatment code immediately, or as quickly as possible, if he/she finds it is in the best interest of the trial subject. The investigators have direct and immediate access to break the treatment code through the IRT. At the earliest opportunity, the investigator is"
27,page_27,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 28/136 requested to inform the blinded monitor in charge of his/her centre that the blind has been broken for an emergency. In addition, a set of hard copy seale d code break envelopes will be held by Global Patient Safety at Ipsen, in case of IRT failure (this set will be prepared by the Ipsen Randomisation manager). If code-break was performed using the IRT, the investigator must store the email notification revealing unblinded treatment in a sealed envelope. The investigator will then sign, date and provide the reason for the code break on the emergency code break form and on the sealed envelope. The date and reason for identifying the treatment group will be rec orded in the eCRF. 3.5 Study Treatments and Dosage The term IMP refers to both active drugs and placebo. The study treatment, Dysport, will be provided as a white, lyophilised powder in vials containing 300 U or 500 U of BTX -A-HAC (abobotulinumtoxinA). Before each administration, the powder from the Dysport vial (300 U or 500 U) will be reconstituted at the investigational site with 0.9% sterile (preservative free) sodium chloride for injection, to a total volume of 2.0 mL. Investigators will inject 0.5 mL of the reconstituted vial from a syringe into each of the four muscles in the study foot (i.e. the oblique head of the adductor hallucis muscle; the transverse head of the adductor hallucis muscle; flexor hallucis brevis muscle; and the extensor hallucis brev is muscle). Subjects assigned to receive 300 U of Dysport will be treated with 75 U of Dysport per muscle (300 U dose divided equally among the four described muscle muscles). Subjects assigned to receive 500 U of Dysport will be treated with 125 U of Dysp ort per muscle (500 U dose divided equally among the described four muscles). A more detailed description of administration procedures is given in Section 6.2. The reference therapy in this study is a matching placebo for the DB period. Placebo will be provided as a white, lyophilised powder in vials containing only excipients of BTX -A-HAC and undistinguishable from the active BTX -A-HAC product. Reco nstitution and administration of the placebo will be as described for the active BTX -A-HAC product. A more detailed description of administration procedures is given in Section 6.2. The study treatment will be packaged and released by Beaufour Ipsen Industrie and delivered to the investigational sites or interim storage facilities. A sufficient quantity of study treatment will be supplied as well as an acknowledgement of receipt form. The sponsor’s representative will receive; a Certificate of Analysis for which batch of IMP has been used under their study, and a Certificate of Compliance which reflects the product release statement and will provide them to sites according to local requirement. The core label texts for all packaging units will be translated or adjusted, to follow applicable regulatory requirements (e.g. Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines (Volume 4 Annex 13)), national laws in for ce and in accordance with the local regulations. The investigator, or designee, will only dispense IMPs to subjects included in this study. Each subject will only be given the IMP with his/her treatment number. The dispensing for each subject will be docu mented in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 3.6 Study Duration The duration of the study per subject will be up to 39 weeks. This study will consist of a screening period (up to 3 weeks), a DB single -dosing period (Cycle 1) followed by a repeated dose OL period where subjects can receive up to two additional cycles of Dysport (Cycles 2 and 3) depending on retreatment eligibility (36 weeks). Each subject will receive up to three administrations (i.e. cycles) of study treatment with a 12 -week follow up peri od after each treatment in the DB and OL periods."
28,page_28,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 29/136 The study will be considered to have started when the first subject has been screened/provided signed informed consent. The study will be considered complete after the last subject has completed 36 weeks in the study. 3.7 Stopping Rules and Discontinuation Criteria There are no formal rules for early termination of this study. During the conduct of the study, SAEs will be reviewed (see Section 8.1.5) as they are reported from the study centre to identify safety concerns. A specific site can be discontinued or the entire study may be terminated at any time if the sponsor judges it necessary for any reason. In that case, all scheduled procedures and assessments for subjects who are still in the study will be performed. Possible reasons for the closure of a study site may include: • failure of the investigator staff to comply with the protocol or with the GCP g uidelines; • New and significant safety concerns; • inadequate subject recruitment. A subject may discontinue participation in the study at any time for any reason (e.g. lack of efficacy, withdrawal of consent, AE). The investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a subject from the study at any time for any reason (e.g. protocol violation or deviation as defined in Section 13.1.2, noncompliance with the pro tocol conditions, AE or if the investigator feels it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue in the study). All cases of discontinuation will be discussed between the investigator and the sponsor. 3.8 Source Data Recorded on the Case Report For m Data will be collected in the eCRF in compliance with FDA 21 CFR Part 11. As required by GCP, the sponsor assigned monitor will verify, by direct reference to the source documents, that the data required by the protocol are accurately reported on the eCR F. The source documents must, as a minimum, contain a statement that the subject is included in a clinical study, the date that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study, the identity of the study, diagnosis and eligibility criteri a, visit dates (with subject status), IMP administration, and any AEs and associated concomitant medication. As required by ICH GCP Section 6.4.9, if some items are recorded directly on the eCRF and are considered as source data, the identification of thes e data must be documented and agreed between the investigator and the sponsor. Definition for source data and source documents are given below: • Source Data : All original records and certified copies of original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. Source data are contained in source documents (original records or certified copies). • Source Documents : Original documents, data and records (e.g. hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medicotechnical departments involved in the clinical study). The subject must have consented to their medical records b eing viewed by the sponsor’s authorised personnel, and by local, and possibly foreign, CAs. This information is included in the informed consent."

31,page_31,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 32/136 (23) Subject is currently participating or has participated in a clinical study within the last 90 days or has participated in more than two clinical studies within the past year. This includes studies using marketed compounds or devices. (24) Subject is an investigational st udy site staff member or the relative of an investigational study site staff member. (25) Treatment with any preparation of botulinum toxin within 4 months prior to Screening for any condition, with the exception of glabellar lines or other aesthetic face appli cations of toxin. Subjects who have previously received an injection with botulinum toxin in the foot are not eligible to participate in the study. (26) Any concomitant therapy usage that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the evaluation of s afety or efficacy of the investigational medicinal product, and/or confound the study results. (27) Subject has planned or ongoing use of opioids; use of antipsychotics or antidepressants that are not stable for at least 30 days prior to Screening; use of antic holinergic therapies that are not stable for at least 6 weeks prior to randomisation; or requires continuous treatment with any medication restricted by this protocol.

Subjects are pe rmitted restart anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications one day after injection of study treatment (or longer at the discretion of the investigator). (31) Any condition or situation which, in the investigator's opinion, puts the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere with the subject's participation in the study 4.3 Rationale for Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria The selection of the specific subject population defined by the inclusion/exclusion criteria above was based on the kno wn aetiology and course of HAV in adult patients seeking treatment for this condition. The typical clinical presentation for HAV primarily includes clinically significant pain, mobility dysfunction and angular deviation of the hallux. As such, the entry criteria have been specifically chosen to allow for generalizability of this clinical study population to the larger adult HAV population. For the purposes of ensuring that variability is minimised and potential confounding factors are eliminated, the entry criteria include several provisions restricting subjects who have pre -existing medical conditions or are reliant upon treatments which will not be permitted in the study. 4.4 Subject Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures 4.4.1 Withdrawal from the Study In accordance w ith the Declaration of Helsinki (in accordance with the applicable country’s acceptance), each subject is free to withdraw from the study at any time. The investigator also has the right to withdraw a subject from the study in the event of concurrent illne ss, AEs, or other reasons concerning the health or wellbeing of the subject, or in the case of lack of cooperation. In addition, a subject may be withdrawn from the study as described in Sections 3.7, 5.2.3, 6.3, 8.1.6 and 8.1.8."
32,page_32,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 33/136 If a subject decides to withdraw from the study after administration of IMP, or should the investigator decide to withdraw the subject, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations up to the time of withdrawal as thoroughly as possible. A complete final evaluation at the time of the subject’s withdrawal should be made (see Sections 5.2.3) and an explanation given of why the subject is withdrawing or being withdrawn from the study. The reason for and date of withdrawal from the study must be recorded on the eCRF. If a subject withdraws consent, every attempt will be made to determine the reason. If the reason for withdrawal is an AE or a clinically significant laboratory test abnormality, monitoring will continue until the event has resolved or stabilised, until the subject is referred to the care of a local health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the I MP or study procedure is made. The specific AE or test result(s) must be recorded on the eCRF. All evaluations should be performed, according to the protocol, on the last day the subject receives IMP, or as soon as possible thereafter. 4.4.2 Withdrawal from Stud y Treatment Discontinuation of the study treatment does not represent withdrawal from the study. However, a subject may permanently discontinue study treatment at any time. If a subject discontinues from the study treatment, the subject will continue to be followed up for efficacy and safety evaluations. Criteria for permanent discontinuation of study treatment include: • The subject requests to discontinue study treatment • The subject has a medical condition or personal circumstance which in the opinion of th e investigator and/or Sponsor would place the participant at unnecessary risk from continued administration of study treatment. • The participant has a confirmed positive urine pregnancy test • Chronic failure to comply with dosing, evaluations, or other requirements of the study, despite documentation at the study site of repeated efforts to reinforce compliance. Discontinuation from the study treatment is permanent. Once a subject is discontinued, he/she will not be allowed to restart study treatment."

Additional details for study visits are provided below as appropriate. 5.2.1 Screening and Enrolment A signed and dated informed consent form will be obtained before screening procedures during the DB period occur. After informed consent is obtained, subjects who are screened will be allocated a subject number. All screened subjects must be identifiable throughout the study. The investigator will maintain a list of subject numbers and names to enable re cords to be found at a later date if required. If the initial foot evaluated for study entry fails to meet the entry criteria, bilateral HAV subjects are allowed to be rescreened only once for entry in the study using the contralateral foot. Following con firmation of eligibility for the study, subjects will be given a randomisation/treatment allocation number and allocated to one of the dosing groups specified in Section 6.1. Each investigator will also maintain a record of all subjects screened into the study (i.e. who signed the informed consent form). Records up to the time of premature termination should be completed. In the event that the subjec t was not receiving IMP, the primary reason will be recorded. 5.2.2 Additional Follow -up Visits (Double -blind and Open -label Periods) Additional follow -up visits will be performed every 4 weeks after Visit 6 during the DB period, and after Visits 11 and 16 duri ng the OL period to determine eligibility for retreatment. 5.2.3 End of Study or Early Withdrawal Visit Subjects who participate in the study in compliance with the protocol for at 36 weeks (DB and OL periods) will be considered to have completed the study. For subjects who complete the study, or for those who withdraw prematurely from the study, final evaluations will be performed on the last day the subject receives the study treatment, or as soon as possible afterwards. Subjects with ongoing AEs or clinicall y significant laboratory test abnormalities (as determined by the investigator) will be monitored as described in Section 8.1.4 and Section 8.1.2.4, respectively."

To prevent theft or diversion, the IMP will be stored in a securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet or enclosure appropriate for the study treatment. Any actual or suspected theft or diversion must be reported i mmediately. 6.1.2 Investigational Medicinal Product Preparation The investigator, or an approved representative (e.g. pharmacist), will ensure that all IMP is reconstituted and dispensed by qualified staff members. Detailed instructions for the preparation befor e administration of study medication (Dysport and matching Placebo) will be provided in the study IMP Handling manual or similar documentation 6.1.3 Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability All IMP and any other study related material is to be accounted for on the IMP accountability log provided by the sponsor. It is essential that all used and unused supplies are retained for verification (by the sponsor or sponsor’s representative). The investigator should ensure adequate records are maintained in the I MP accountability log. All used and unused IMP and any other related material is to be destructed at the investigational sites and/or at the Interim Storage facility according to local procedures, regulations and laws. 6.2 Study Drugs Administered At Screening during the DB period, subjects will be allocated a subject number. Following confirmation of eligibility for the study, subjects will be allocated to treatment with Dysport 300 U, Dysport 500 U or placebo during the DB period. A blinded kit will be used i n this study to maintain the blinding of the study during the DB period. Each blinded kit will contain two vials regardless of treatment assignment: one vial 300 U or placebo and one vial 500 U or placebo. The two vials in each kit will contain either a Dysport 300 U vial + a placebo vial, a Dysport 500 U vial + a placebo vial or two placebo vials, based on treatment assignment. Investigators will be blinded to which vial contains Dysport and which vial contains placebo. Before each administration, the powd er in each vial in the blinded kit will be reconstituted at the investigational site with 1.0 mL of 0.9% sterile (preservative free) sodium chloride for injection. The contents of each vial will be combined for a total volume of 2.0 mL (150 U/mL for Dyspor t 300 U and 250 U/mL for Dysport 500 U). Investigators will inject 0.5 mL of the reconstituted solution (2.0 mL total volume) containing study treatment into each of the four targeted muscles. Subjects assigned to receive 300 U of Dysport will be treated w ith 75 U of Dysport per muscle (300 U dose divided equally among, 1) the oblique head of the adductor hallucis muscle; 2) the transverse head of the adductor hallucis muscle; 3) flexor hallucis brevis muscle; and 4) the extensor hallucis brevis muscle musc les); subjects assigned to receive 500 U of Dysport will be treated with 125 U of Dysport per muscle (500 U dose divided equally among the described four muscles); subjects treated with placebo will receive four injections of reconstituted product containi ng only the excipients described in Dysport, without the addition of toxin (see Section 6.2.2). During the OL period, subjects will receive treatment with Dysport 300 U or 500 U. At the first retreatment cycle (Cycle 2) during the OL period, subjects will receive Dysport 300 U in the"

Dose and generic name or tradename will be indicated. The following concomitant medications are not permitted during this study: • Botulinum toxin for administration into any site of the body other than Dysport for HAV, with the exception of glabellar li nes or other aesthetic face applications of toxin. • Any investigational new drug or device or off label use of any drug. • Aminoglycoside antibiotics or other drugs that interfere with neuromuscular transmission. • Opioids • Any medication not specifically permit ted by the protocol which has antinociceptive (pain relieving) properties. This includes any and all narcotic pain relievers, as well as pregabalin and gabapentin. • Subjects who require treatment with antipsychotic (e.g. D2 antagonists) or antidepressant (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) medications will need to demonstrate evidence of stable dose regimen in the 30 days prior to Screening and will maintain that dose for the duration of the study. The following concomitant medications are permitted during this study but they must be monitored closely and every effort should be made to keep their dose and dose regimen constant throughout the course of the study. • Concomitant use of anticholinergic d rugs (which may potentiate systemic anticholinergic effect) is permitted if the dosage has been stable for 6 weeks prior to study treatment and is expected to remain at this stable dose throughout the study. • Concomitant use of over -the-counter medications for the symptomatic treatment of minor ailments (e.g. common cold). Specifically, these include non -steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen), anti -pyretic agents (e.g. acetaminophen), antihistamines (e.g. loratadine) and expectoran ts (e.g. guaifenesin). • After consultation with prescribing physician, anticoagulant medications must be stopped 3 days prior to administration of study treatment. These medications can be restarted one day after administration of study treatment and can be stopped for a longer period if deemed necessary in the opinion of the investigator, and in compliance with standard medical practice and the manufactures’ discontinuation recommendations for the medication. Anticoagulant medications permitted during the s tudy include, but are not limited to: o warfarin and other coumadin derivatives o acetylsalicylic acid (including low -dose aspirin) o clopidogrel/ticlopidine If medically indicated, lower molecular weight heparins are permitted providing the last dose was within 24 hours prior to administration of study treatment, and may be restarted one day following administration of study treatment. • Topical or oral anaesthe sia for pain management of the injection site. 6.4 Lifestyle Restrictions/Recommendations Besides restrictions already presented in the exclusion criteria, subjects should not use an orthotic device or 'over -the-counter shoe -insert' which could influence the f unctioning of the hallux of the study foot in any way during the study. This includes toe -spacers or any other"
43,page_43,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 44/136 device intended for this purpose. Over -the-counter shoe inserts will be permitted during the study only for subjects who have used these for at l east 30 days prior to screening. 6.5 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance The study treatment will be administered at the investigational site; therefore, compliance is not likely to be an issue. 6.6 Priority Order on Study Procedures The following priori ty order should be followed in case study procedures are scheduled at the same time point: 1. NPRS* 2. mFFI* 3. PGI-I and PGI -S (pain and disability) 4. SF-36 5. Weight-bearing radiographs *These assessments are assessed at home after baseline. 7 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY For the timing of assessments in this study, refer to the schedule in Table 3 and Table 4. 7.1 Methods and Timing of Assessing, Recording, and Analysing Efficacy Data Methods for assessing efficacy data is described below. Timing of efficacy assessments are discussed in Section 5. Procedures for recording efficacy data are discussed in Section 15.1, and methods of analyses are discussed in Section 11.4.3. For all assessments related to pain, the subject is to be instructed by the inves tigator to report severity specifically for his/her study foot when completing the questionnaires using the e -diary. The Sponsor will provide a device (to complete the e -diary questionnaires) in the clinical trial if requested by subjects or in situations in which the subject is not willing or able to use their own device. The device will be returned to the site at the completion of the subjects' participation in the trial. Also, it is critical that investigators and site staff instruct and remind subjects to complete home -based self-assessments (eg, NPRS, mFFI) in the evening. 7.1.1 Numeric Pain Rating Scale The NPRS is a widely used and validated unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. Subjects will be asked to rate the intensity of their foot pain during physical activity (e.g. walking, standing or running) based on an 11 -point scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 equals “no pain” and 10 equals “worst possible pain”. They will be asked to rate their daily pain intensity by responding directly to the following question: ""Please rate the average intensity of the pain in your treated foot while performing physical activities (e.g. standing, walking or running) over the past 24 hours"". Daily pain intensities will be recorded by the subject using an elect ronic diary for 7 consecutive days prior to the study visits as outlined in Section 5.1. The electronic diary should be completed by the subject at the same time each day, preferably in the evening . The subject should be instructed by the investigator to focus on his/her study foot when completing the questionnaire. This instruction is critical in subjects with bilateral disease."
44,page_44,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 45/136 7.1.2 Modified Foot Function Index The FFI was developed to assess foot -related pain, disability and activity limitations, and later revised to include foot -related health and quality of life [19; 20; 21]. A modified version of the FFI specific to this study is provided in Appendix 1 . It is a self -administered specific patient - reported outcome measure of foot pain plus evoked foot pain, and the impact of foot pathologies on disability and activity limitations. The mFFI consists of a total of 21 items grouped into three subscales: pain (seven questions), disability (nine questions), and activity limitati on (five questions). The mFFI items are rated using numeric rating scales ranging from 0 to 10 and cover a period of the ‘past’ 24 hours. The poles are labelled “no pain” and “worst pain imaginable” (pain), “no difficulty” and “so difficult unable to do” ( disability), and “none of the time” and “all of the time” (limitations). For each item, the subject is asked to record the number value which best corresponds to the effect of the foot complaints. To obtain a subscale score, the item scores for a given sub scale (i.e. pain, disability or activity limitation subscales) are totalled and divided by the maximum total possible and then multiplied by 100. Each subscale score, as well as the total score, will range from 0 to 100. If a patient did not perform the ta sk listed in the question, they will be instructed to mark the item as not applicable (N/A). Daily pain intensities, disability and activity limitations will be recorded by the subject using an electronic diary for 7 consecutive days prior to the study vis its as outlined in Section 5.1. The electronic diary should be completed by the subject at the same time each day, preferably in the evening . The subject should be instructed by the investigator to focus on his/her study foot when completing the questionnaire. This instruction is critical in subjects with bilateral disease. In addition, all subjects should be educated on the proper use of the “not a pplicable” option. For example, subjects that do not stand on their tiptoes in the course of their daily lives should mark “not applicable” for that particular item. However, if the subject does not stand on his or her tiptoes due to their disease, then he or she should choose the option “so difficult unable to do”. 7.1.3 Intermetatarsal Angle, Hallux Valgus Angle and Sesamoid Position Intermetatarsal angle, HV angle and tibial sesamoid position will be measured directly on weight-bearing anteriorposterior radiographs, in which the X -ray beam is angled 15° towards the heel centered on the second tarsometatarsal joint with a source to image -receptor distance of 100 cm. Radiographic measurements will be conducted by following the General Acquisition Guidelines document provided to sites by the Sponsor to ensure accurate reproducibility of image acquisition across sites. Images should be taken by the same radiology technician. Angle measurements will be performed by a blinded central reader. 7.1.4 36-Item Short Form H ealth Survey The SF-36 is a 36 -item questionnaire which measures the extent to which physical health impacts an individual's functional ability and perceived well -being in mental, social and physical aspects of life. The SF -36 has eight individual subscale s divided across physical and psychological domains: physical function, role physical, bodily pain, global health, vitality, social function, role emotional and mental health. Scores on these subscales can be combined to form two higher -order summary score s, the Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary. The Physical Component Summary is calculated by positively weighting the four subscales in the physical domain (physical function, role physical, bodily pain and global health) and the remaini ng psychological domain subscales negatively. In contrast, the Mental Component Summary is calculated by positively weighting the four mental domain subscales (mental health, vitality, social function and role emotional), and negatively weighting the four physical domain subscales."

The PGI -I will be asse ssed by the subject answering the following question: “Compared to your foot pain prior to the study treatment initiation, your foot pain while performing physical activities (e.g. standing, walking or running) now is: +3=very much improved; +2=much improv ed; +1=minimally improved; 0=no change; -1=minimally worse; -2=much worse; -3=very much worse”). Also, an additional question will be included in the PGI -I assessment which will ask patients the following: ""If you experienced a change, was this change mean ingful to you? (Yes/No)"" The PGI-I of foot pain will be recorded by the subject using an electronic diary during the study visits at site as outlined in Section 5.1. The subject should be instructed by the investigator to focus on his/her study foot when completing the questionnaire. This instruction is critical in subjects with bilateral disease. 7.1.6 Patient Global Impression of Severity of Foot Pain An assessment of PGI -S of foot pain will be conducted by the subject using a 4 -point Likert scale (from 0: no pain to 3: severe pain). The PGI -S will be assessed by the subject by answering the following question: “How severe was your foot pain while perform ing physical activities (e.g. standing, walking or running) over the past week?” (0=no pain; 1=mild pain; 2=moderate pain; 3=severe pain). The PGI-S of foot pain will be recorded by the subject using an electronic diary during the study visits on site as o utlined in Section 5.1. The subject should be instructed by the investigator to focus on his/her study foot when completing the questionnaire. This instruction is critical in subjects with bilateral disease. 7.1.7 Patient Global Impression of Improvement of Disability An assessment of PGI -I of the subject's disability will be conducted by the subject using a 7-point Likert scale (from -3: very much worse t o +3: very much improved). The PGI -I will be assessed by the subject answering the following question: “Compared to your disability prior to the study treatment initiation, your disability while performing physical activities (e.g. standing, walking or run ning) now is: +3=very much improved; +2=much improved; +1=minimally improved; 0=no change from baseline; -1=minimally worse; -2=much worse; - 3=very much worse”). In addition, an additional question will be included in the PGI -I assessment which will ask pa tients the following: ""If you experienced a change, was this change meaningful to you? (Yes/No)"" The PGI-I of disability will be recorded by the subject using an electronic diary during the study visits on site as outlined in Section 5.1. 7.1.8 Patient Global Impression of Severity of Disability An assessment of PGI -S of disability will be conducted by the subject using a 4 -point Likert scale (from 0: no disability to 3: severe disability). The PGI -S will be assessed by the subject by answering the following question: “How severe was your disability while performing physical activities (e.g. standing, walking or running) over the past week?” (0=no disability; 1=mild dis ability; 2=moderate disability; 3=severe disability). The PGI-S of disability will be recorded by the subject using an electronic diary during the study visits on site outlined in Section 5.1."

Information will be elicited by direct, nonleading questioning or by spontaneous reports. Further details for AE reporting can be found in Section 8.1.2. The investigator will be responsible for a clinical safety assessment of the study participants during the whole participation of the subjects in the study, from informed consent up to discharge from the study, and for the setup of a discharge pl an if needed. The sponsor medical monitor and the global patient safety physician will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study. 8.1.1 Definition of an Adverse Event An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g. nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g. tachycardia, e nlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g. laboratory findings, electrocardiogram). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run in or washout periods, even if no IMP has been administered. This definition includes events occurring from the time of the subject giving informed consent until the end of the study (as defined in Section 3.6). 8.1.2 Categorisation of Adverse Events 8.1.2.1 Intensity Classification Adverse events will be classified as mild, moderate or severe according to the following criteria: • Mild: symptoms do not alter the subject’s normal functioning • Moderate : symptoms produce some degree of impairment to function, but are not hazardous, uncomfortable or embarrassing to the subject • Severe: symptoms definitely hazardous to wellbeing, significant impairment of function or incapacitation. 8.1.2.2 Causality Classification The relationship of an AE to IMP administration will be classified according to the following: • Related: reports including good reasons and sufficient information (e.g. plausible time sequence, dose response relationship, pharmacology, positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge) to assume a causal relationship with IMP administration in the sense that it is plausible, conceivable or likely. • Not related : reports including good reasons and sufficient information (e.g. implausible time sequence and/or attributable to concurrent disease or other drugs) to rule out a causal relationship with IMP administration. 8.1.2.3 Assessment of Expectedness The reference document for assessing expectedness of AEs/event in this study will be the current Dysport Therapeutics IB. 8.1.2.4 Laborator y Test Abnormalities Abnormalities in laboratory test values should only be reported as AEs if any of the following apply:"
47,page_47,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 48/136 • They result in a change in IMP schedule of administration (change in dosage, delay in administration, IMP discontinuation), • They require intervention or a diagnosis evaluation to assess the risk to the subject, • They are considered as clinically significant by the investigator. 8.1.2.5 Abnormal Physical Examination Findings Clinically significant changes, in the judgement of the investigator, in physical examination findings (abnormalities) will be recorded as AEs. 8.1.2.6 Other Investigation Abnormal Findings Abnormal test findings as judged by the investigator as clinically significant that result in a change in study drug dosage or administration s chedule, or in discontinuation of the study drug, or require intervention or diagnostic evaluation to assess the risk to the subject, should be recorded as AEs. 8.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) for Dysport are AEs that suggest a possible remote spread of effect of the toxin or events suggestive of hypersensitivity like reactions. The effects of Dysport and all BTX products may spread away from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with remote spre ad of BTX effects. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. The events of remote spread of toxin maybe severe and affects swallowing and breathing, can be life threatening, and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is increased in subjects who have underlying conditions (e.g. disorders of the neuromuscular junction) that would predispose them to these symptoms. Dysport is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to any BTX preparation or to any of the components in the formulation. A list of preferred terms of AESIs will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). All AEs will be monitored by the sponsor to determine if they meet the criteria of AESIs. These AESIs will be further analysed t o determine if there is a plausible possibility that they represent remote spread of toxin or hypersensitivity like reactions. In order to perform the analysis, variables including alternative aetiology (medical history, concomitant medication, or diagnosis which could account for the symptoms), location of Dysport administration, and temporal relationship to Dysport administration will be considered by the sponsor. 8.1.4 Recording and Follow up of Adverse Events At each visit, the subject should be asked a nonle ading question such as: “How have you felt since starting the new treatment/the last assessment?” All observed or volunteered AEs, regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to IMP, will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the eCRF. Events involving drug reactions, accidents, illnesses with onset during the treatment phase of the study, or exacerbations of pre - existing illnesses should be recorded. Any AEs already recorded and designated as ‘continuing’ should be reviewed at each subsequent assessment. For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a SAE requiring immediate notification to the sponsor or its de signated representative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the investigator to determine the causality of the AE (i.e. IMP or other illness). The investigator is required to assess causality and record that assessment on the eCRF. F ollow up of the AE, after the date of IMP discontinuation, is required if the AE or its sequelae persist. Follow up is required until the event or its sequelae resolve or"

Any AE considered related to IMP admi nistration that the investigator becomes aware of after completion of the end of study/early discontinuation visit must be reported to the sponsor and will be recorded in the clinical database. 8.1.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs (as defined below ) regardless of treatment group or suspected relationship to IMP must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event) using the e -mail address specified at the beginning of this protocol. If the immediate report is submitted by telephone, this must be followed by detailed written reports using the SAE report form. A SAE is any AE that: (1) Results in death, (2) Is life threatening, that is any event that places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurr ed. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death, (3) Results in in -patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, excluding admission for social or administrative reasons (see further) , (4) Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, where disability is a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions, (5) Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received the IMP, (6) Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalisation when, based upon appropriate medical judgement, may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of th e outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospitalisation, or the deve lopment of drug dependency or drug abuse. In addition to the above criteria, any additional AE that the sponsor or an investigator considers serious should be immediately reported to the sponsor and included in the corporate SAEs database system. • Hospitalisation is defined as any in -patient admission (even if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long -term in-patients, in -patient admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care in -patient unit. • Prolongation of hospitalisation is defined as any extension of an in -patient hospitalisation beyond the stay anticipated/required in relation to the original reason for the initial admission, as determined by the investigator or treating physician . For protocol-specified hospitalisation in clinical studies, prolongation is defined as any extension beyond the length of stay described in the protocol. Prolongation in the absence of a precipitating, treatment emergent, clinical AE (i.e. not associated with the development of a new AE or worsen ing of a pre -existing condition) may meet criteria"

Hospitalisation for a preplanned or elective treatment/surgical procedure should not be reported as an SAE unless there are complications or sequelae which meet the criteria for seriousness described above. Any SAE must be reported immediately (within 24 hours), using the e -mail address specified at the beginning of this protocol, independent of the circumstances or suspected cause, if it occurs or comes to the attention of the investigator at any time during the study period. Any AE/SAE with a suspected causal relationship to IMP administration occurring at any other time after completion of the study must be promptly reported. The following information is the minimum that must be provided to the sponsor within 24 hours for each SAE: • Study number • Centre number • Subject number • AE • Investigator's name and contact details The additional information included in the SAE form must be provided to the sponsor or representative as soon as it is available. The investigator should always provide an assessment of causality for each event reported to the sponsor. Upon receipt of the initial report, the sponsor will ask for the investigator's causality assessment if it was not provided with the initial report. The investigator should report a diagno sis or a syndrome rather than individual signs or symptoms. The investigator should also try to separate a primary AE considered as the foremost untoward medical occurrence from secondary AEs which occurred as complications. 8.1.6 Pregnancy Pregnancy itself is n ot regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IMP has interfered with a contraceptive method. If pregnancy occurs during the study, the outcome of the pregnancy will then need to be collected post study and it may be necessary to discontinue administration of the IMP. Information regarding pregnancies must be collected on the AE page of the eCRF. The sponsor will request further information from the investigator as to the course and outcome of the pregnancy using the Standard Pregnancy Outcome Report Form. The investigator must instruct all female subjects to inform them immediately should they become pregnant during the study. The investigator should counsel the subject, discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effec ts on the foetus. Monitoring of the subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy, which may involve follow up after the subject’s involvement in the study has ended. Pregnancies with a conception date during the study period (or within 12 week s of the subject being dosed with IMP, if early discontinuation) must also be reported to the investigator for onward reporting to the sponsor."
50,page_50,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 51/136 8.1.7 Deaths All AEs resulting in death either during the study period or within 12 weeks (84 days) after the last dose of IMP, must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. The convention for recording death is as follows: • Adverse event term: lead cause of death (e.g. multiple organ failure, pneumonia, myocardial infarction), • Outcome: fatal. The only exception is if the cause of death is unknown (i.e. sudden or unexplained death), in which case the AE term may be “death” or “sudden death”. 8.1.8 Discontinuation/Withdrawal due to Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events Discontinuation /withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from discontinuation/withdrawal due to insufficient response to the IMP (see Section 4.4). If the IM P is discontinued due to a SAE, it must be reported immediately to the sponsor’s designated representative (see Section 8.1.5). In all cases, the i nvestigator must ensure the subject receives appropriate medical follow up (see Section 8.1.4). 8.1.9 Reporting to Competent Authorities/IECs/IRBs/Other Investigators The sponsor will ensure that processes are in place for submission of reports of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) occurring during the study to the Competent Authorities (CA), IECs and other investigators concerned b y the IMP. Reporting will be done in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. For study centres in the USA, Investigational New Drug Application Safety Reports will be submitted directly to the investigators. It is the investigators’ responsibi lity to notify their IRB in a timely manner. 8.2 Clinical Laboratory Tests Blood and urine samples will be collected during the DB and OL periods as described in the study procedures and assessments in Table 3 and Table 4 for the evaluation of haematology and serum chemistry and urine examination. The total volume of b lood drawn for all evaluations throughout this study is approximately 54 mL for each subject. The investigator will review the safety laboratory test results, document the review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring or observed during the study in the AE section of the eCRF (see Section 8.1.2.4 for abnormal laboratory tests that should be recorded as AEs). 8.2.1 Haematology Blood samples will be collected in a potassium ethylenediamine tetra -acetic acid tube to assess the following variables: red blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin con centration, white blood cell count with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) and platelet count. 8.2.2 Blood Biochemistry Blood samples will be collected in an activator gel tube to assess the following parameters:"

Any subject becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. All pregnancies that occur during the study are to be reported as described in Section 8.1.6. 8.2.4 Drug of Abuse Testing Urine drug screen testing for opiates, cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines will be performed as specified in Table 3 and Table 4 at the study site , and at any time at the discretion of the investigator. 8.2.5 Immunogenicity Blood samples will be collected for the detection of antibodies to BTX-A (6 mL samples per timepoint). Each sample will be left to stand for 30 minutes at room temperature and the tubes should be centrifuged at approximately 1300 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The serum will be removed and transferred into three aliquots in clean plastic tubes (approximately 0.5 mL, 0.5 mL, 3 mL, respectively). This sample process has to be made in the most sterile possible conditions. The resulting serum will be stored at -20°C or below. Each tube should be labelled with the sample identific ation, study number, site number, subject number and initials, and visit number (when applicable). Serum samples will be sent to the central laboratory for storage up to analysis by the bioanalytical CRO. Batch shipping to the bioanalytical CRO will be arr anged by the central laboratory at appropriate interval. All samples will be tested initially for the presence of binding antibodies using a validated immunoassay. Samples found positive for the presence of binding antibodies will be analysed for the prese nce of neutralising antibodies using a functional assay. Additional aliquots (i.e. back-up samples) will be archived at the central laboratory. Archived samples will be destroyed at the end of the study. Full details regarding required the processing, labe lling and shipment processes for these samples are provided in the Study Manual. The determination of antibodies against BTX -A will be evaluated using a validated method: • RS16-077-IP: Validation of the ECLA method for the detection of binding antibodies to Dysport in human serum samples by KYMOS PHARMA SERVICES, S.L. • RS15-574-IP: Validation of a Cell Based Assay (CBA) for the detection of neutralising antibodies to BoNT/A in human serum samples by KYMOS PHARMA SERVICES, S.L. 8.3 Physical Examination Physical examinations, including body weight, will be conducted as outlined in Table 3 and Table 4 and height will be measured at Baseline."

Any physical examination findings (abnormalities ) persisting at the end of the study will be followed by the investigator until resolution or until reaching a clinically stable endpoint. 8.4 Examination of the Study Foot A complete physical examination of the study foot will be conducted as outlined in Table 3 and Table 4 for the DB and OL periods. The examination wi ll include evaluation of the a) dermatologic, b) neurologic and c) musculoskeletal condition of the study foot. For dermatologic and musculoskeletal foot examinations, the Investigator will record whether a given abnormality or deformity is present. For ne urological examinations, the Investigator will record whether the specified neurological parameters are ""normal"" or ""abnormal"" based on clinical presentation. Any findings that were not present at Baseline based on examination of the study will be recorded as AEs. As for all AEs reported during the study, the investigator should use his/her medical judgment to determine if treatment of the study foot is required based on an abnormal finding, and/or if the subject should be withdrawn from the study due to a n abnormal finding in the study foot. Details for each of the study foot examination parameters required during the study are provided in the sections below. 8.4.1 Dermatologic Examination The dermatologic examination will consist of a global inspection of the study foot and injection sites for injection site irritations, ulcerations, bleeding, discolorations, calluses, wounds, fissures, lesions, macerations, nail dystrophy, hyperpigmentation, erythema, oedema or paronychia. Inspection of the toes should include a search for fungal, ingrown or elongated nails, as well as areas between the toes for the presence of deeper lesions. The investigator will evaluate and record whether these or other dermatological conditions are present in the study foot and will record new findings as AEs that were not present at Baseline resulting from the dermatologic examination. 8.4.2 Neurologic Examination The neurological examination will consist of the evaluation of protective sensation using the Ipswich Touch Test [22], as subjects who develop neuropathies with loss of sensation at are increased risk for unrecognized injury. The subject will be instructed to close their eyes whi le the investigator lightly rests his/her finger on each of the subject’s first, third and fifth toes of the study foot for 1 to 2 seconds. Subjects will be instructed to respond “yes” when they feel the investigator’s touch. The investigator will evaluate and record whether the neurological condition of the study foot is “normal” or “abnormal” based on their medical judgment regarding the degree of loss of sensation in the study foot and will record new findings as AEs that were not present at Baseline res ulting from the neurological examination. 8.4.3 Musculoskeletal Examination The musculoskeletal examination will include a visual inspection of the study foot, as well as direct evaluation via palpation, range of motion (ie, dorsiflexion, plantar flexion), motor strength and muscle tone to identify the presence of abnormalities or foot deformities (except for HAV). The investigator will specifically look for the presence of bony prominences, asymmetry, wasting, fasciculations or the presence of foot deformities ( except for HAV) including but not limited to hammer toe, claw toe, Charcot’s neuroarthropathy, pes planus, cavus planus, Morton’s neuroma, or hallux limitus.

The SAP may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary e ndpoint and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. Statistical evaluation will be performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS)® (version 9.1 or higher) 11.1 Analyses Populations The following populations will be used during statist ical analyses: • Screened population : All subjects screened (i.e. who signed the informed consent). • Safety population : All subjects who received at least one dose of IMP administration (including only partial administration). • Intention -to-treat (ITT) populat ion: All randomised subjects (i.e. who were randomly allocated to a treatment group by IRT). • Per protocol (PP) population : All subjects in the ITT population for whom no major protocol deviations (which may interfere with efficacy evaluation) occurred unti l Week 8 of the DB period. • Open-label (OL) population : All randomised subjects who received at least one dose of Dysport (including only partial administration) during the OL period. • Active Treatment population : All randomised subjects who received at leas t one dose of Dysport (including only partial administration) during the DB or OL period 11.1.1 Populations Analysed The primary analysis based on the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed on the ITT population. In addition, PP analysis will be performed as confirmatory. Secondary analyses based on secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed on the ITT population (for the DB period) and on the Active Treatment population (for analysis by active treatment cycle). The analyses of safety data will be performed based on the safety population. 11.1.2 Reasons for Exclusion from the Analyses Any major protocol deviation (see Section 13.1.2 for definition ) will be described and its impact on inclusion in PP population for any subject will be specified. The final list of protocol deviations impacting the PP population will be reviewed prior to database lock, before any unblinding of treatment groups. The li st may be updated, up to the point of database lock . 11.2 Sample Size Determination Several lines of evidence have established that a reduction of approximately 2 points or 10% to 30% on the NPRS represents a clinically important difference for evaluations of p ain intensity in numerous musculoskeletal disorders [ 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28], as well as specifically in HAV patients f ollowing treatment [13; 29]. Several int erventional studies have demonstrated treatment -placebo differences in the NPRS ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 points in HAV patients [13; 30]. Based on these findings, a difference of 1.5 points between Dysport and Placebo is anticipated in the change from baseline in the mean daily NPRS score averaged for the 7 consecutive days prior to the Week 8 DB visit. A sample size of 165 subjects (55 subjects per treatment group) is required to demonstrate the superiority of each of the two Dysport doses (300 U and 500 U) over placebo. This calculation is based on the following assumptions:"
57,page_57,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 58/136 • a mean difference of 1.5 points observed between the Dysport and placebo groups in the mean daily NPRS score averaged for the 7 consecutive days prior to the Week 8 visit in the DB period; • a common standard deviation of 2.5, • a treatment group ratio of 1:1:1, • a Hochberg procedure is implemented to control the family -wise Type 1 error rate at one - sided 2.5% level for comparisons of two Dysport doses versus placebo, • a minimal power of 80%, corresponding for a comparison b ased on power using a Type I error rate from a one -sided test at 1.25% level. An interim analysis will be conducted after the first 110 randomi sed subjects have been followed up for at least 12 weeks. To account for this interim analysis, the overall type I error for each comparison is controlled at the one -sided 0.025 level using O’Brien Fleming spending per Lan-DeMets spending function specification. Treatment comparison with an O’Brien Fleming spending corresponds to a nominal one -sided alpha of 0.0062 at the interim and 0.0231 at the final analysis. To implement the Hochberg procedure, decision rules are the following: • At interim look: Compare larger p -value to 0.0062 • if <larger of 2 p -values> <0.0062 then stop and declare evidence of effect for each arm, • If not, compare <smaller of 2 p -values> to 0.0062/2. If <smaller of 2 p -values> <0.0062/2, then conclude evidence of effect for arm with the smallest p -value • At final look (if outcome of interim analysis is to continue): Compare larger p -value to 0.023 1 • if <larger of 2 p -values> <0.0231 then stop and declare evidence of effect for each arm • If not, compare <smaller of 2 p -values> to 0.0231/2. If <smaller of 2 p -values> <0.0231/2, then conclude evidence of effect for arm with the smallest p -value The non-binding futility boundary is set to declare futility if the one -sided p-value for a comparison is above 0.30. Considering the Hochberg adjustment for two experimental arms, this interim analysis plan results in a minimal power of at least 80 % to detect a treatment effect of 1.5 units in a Dysport arm. Details regarding operational aspects of the interim analysis are described in an Interim Analysis Charter."
58,page_58,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 59/136 11.3 Significance Testing and Estimations The primary efficacy hypotheses are as follow: • H0: there is no difference between treatment with Dysport 300 U and Dysport 500 U versus treatment with Placebo with respect to the change from baseline in the mean daily NPRS score averaged for the 7 consecutive days prior the DB Week 8 visit. • H1: There is a difference between treatment with Dysport 300 U or Dysport 500 U and treatment with Placebo with respect to the change from baseline in the mean daily NPRS score averaged for the 7 consecutive days prior the DB Week 8 visit. For the primary efficacy analy sis, a Hochberg procedure will be applied to control the global type I error at one-sided 2.5% significance level. For other efficacy analyses, all statistical tests will be performed one -sided with a type I error rate set at 2.5%. For safety analyses , no formal statistical analyses will be carried out; only descriptive statistics will be provided. 11.4 Statistical/Analytical Methods Statistical analyses will be performed by an external CRO, managed by the sponsor’s biometry department. 11.4.1 Demographic and Other Bas eline Characteristics In order to assess balance of treatment groups, descriptive summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, maximum) or frequency counts of demographic and baseline data (medical history, concomitant disease, et c.) will be presented by treatment group and overall. 11.4.2 Subject Disposition and Withdrawals The numbers and percentages of subjects enrolled and included in each analysis populations will be tabulated by centre. The reasons for subject exclusions from each o f the populations will also be tabulated. In addition, the numbers of subjects who discontinued and completed at each of the study periods (DB and OL period) will be tabulated. Primary reasons for discontinuation of study treatment will be tabulated. 11.4.3 Efficacy Evaluation 11.4.3.1 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in foot pain as measured by the daily NPRS score averaged over the 7 consecutive days prior to the Week 8 DB visit. Baseline is defined as th e daily NPRS score averaged over the 7 consecutive days prior to the baseline visit. The NPRS score data collected over the 7 consecutive days prior to a visit will be retrieved using an electronic diary (see Section 7.1.1). The estimate of the treatment effect will be the difference in mean change from baseline in the daily NPRS score averaged over the 7 consecutive days prior to the Week 8 DB visit between each Dysport dose group and the placebo group. The primary estimand will be based on ""treatment policy"" strategy, which is the estimate of the treatment effect regardless of whether the subject has an intercurrent event during the study. Potential intercurrent events are the following: (1) Use of prohibited pain medication, (2) Surgery for HAV. No treatment switch or interruption is possible as the primary efficacy endpoint is evaluated following a single injection of study treatment. Intercurrent event (1) is unlikely to occur, as the evaluation period for the primary efficacy endpoint is up to Week 8 (short period)."
59,page_59,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 60/136 Intercurrent event (2) is also unlikely to occur. All subjects with this level of pain severity and angular displacement are considered sur gical candidates theoretically. However, the upper limit on HV angle (30 degrees) will likely limit the need for a “rescue” surgery. Subjects are expected to continue follow -up assessments regardless of these two intercurrent events. NPRS scores will be us ed as observed. A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) on change from baseline in foot pain as measured by the daily NPRS score averaged over the 7 consecutive days prior to each scheduled assessment timepoint of the DB period (up to Week 12) will be used to evaluate the estimand and compare treatment groups. This model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment group, visit, treatment -group- by-visit interaction, the stratification parameter as fixed categorical covariates and the baseline value as fixed continuous covariate. The treatment group factor will have three levels (Dysport 300 U, Dysport 500 U and placebo), the factor visit th ree levels (Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12) and the stratification parameter two levels (unilateral and bilateral HAV). Average scores will be calculated if there is at least 5 -day e-diary completed. No missing baseline is expected as NPRS assessment is part of the inclusion criteria. Subjects will have reminders to complete the electronic diary, and site staff will be alerted if they miss a day. Therefore, the risk of having missing days is minimized. However, if subjects have no post - baseline efficacy assess ment, Week 8 score will be imputed (imputation method will be described in the SAP). Other missing data will be considered missing at random (MAR). Sensitivity analysis Two sensitivity analyses will be performed to investigate the robustness of the pri mary efficacy analysis.

Subject withdrawal before Week 8 of the DB period due to lack of efficacy NPRS score imputed as the mean of placebo value at Week 8 Subject withdrawal before Week 8 of the DB period due to other reason Multiple imputation based on subject with similar characteristics in the same treatment group Subjects not withdrawn before Week 8 of the DB period with a missing NPRS at Week 8 Multiple imputation based on subject with similar characteristic s within the same treatment group DB=double blind; e -diary=electronic diary; NPRS=numeric pain rating scale Then, a tipping point analysis will be performed (analysis will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan). Supplementary analyses Supplementary analyses will be performed in order to complement the primary estimand. The primary efficacy analysis will be first re -run on the PP population. In addition, two other estimands will be considered: • Proportion of responders in the NPRS pain sc ore at Week 8 DB. A responder is defined as a subject with at least a 20% decrease from baseline (30%, 40% and 50% cut -off will also be considered). • The mean change in the area under the curve of the daily NPRS score averaged over the 7 consecutive days pr ior to each visit up to Week 8 of the DB period."

66,page_66,"IPSEN GROUP D-FR-52120-237 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL: FINAL: 03 JULY 2019 PAGE 67/136 13 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 13.1 Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations 13.1.1 Protocol Amendments No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written approval or favourable opinion of a written amendment by the IEC/IRB, except when necessary to eliminate immediate safety concerns to the subjects or when the change involves only logistics or administration. The principal investigator and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment. 13.1.2 Protocol Devi ations and Exceptions All protocol deviations will be identified and recorded by the sponsor or sponsor’s representative. A major protocol deviation is any significant divergence from the protocol, i.e. nonadherence on the part of the subject, the investig ator, or the sponsor to protocol specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective evaluation criteria, and/or GCP guidelines. Generally, a protocol deviation qualifies as major if: (1) The deviation has harmed or posed a significant or substantive risk of harm to the research subject (2) The deviation compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study (3) The deviation is a wilful or knowing breach of human subject protecti on regulations, policies, or procedures on the part of the investigator(s) (4) The deviation involves a serious or continuing noncompliance with any applicable human subject protection regulations, policies, or procedures (5) The deviation is inconsistent with Ips en’s research, medical, and ethical principles. See also Section 11.1.2 for details on the impact of major protocol deviations on the inclusion of subjects in each analysis population. A minor protocol deviation is any significant divergence from the protocol that does not impact the study results. As a matter of policy, the sponsor will not grant exceptions to protocol specific entry criteria to allow subjects to enter a study. If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular subject, prior approval from the sponsor and the responsible IRB/IEC, in accordance with the St andard Operating Procedure (SOP), is required before the subject will be allowed to enter the study. If investigative centre personnel learn that a subject who did not meet protocol eligibility criteria was entered in a study (a protocol violation), they m ust immediately inform the sponsor. Such subjects will be discontinued from the study, except in an exceptional instance following review and written approval by the sponsor and the responsible IRB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP. 13.2 Information to Study Personnel To ensure accurate, complete and reliable data, the sponsor or its representatives will provide instructional material to the study sites, as appropriate. A study initiation visit will be conducted prior to screening start to instruct the invest igators and study coordinators. This session will give instruction on the protocol, the completion of the eCRF and all study procedures. The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study to all staff members involved in the study or in any element of subject management, both before starting any study procedures and during the course of the study (e.g. when new staff become involved). The investigator must assure that all study staff members are qualified by education, experience, and tr aining to perform their specific responsibilities. These study staff members must be listed on the study"

This list must be updated throughout the study, as necessary. The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study staff, including the investigator, and for ensuring their compliance with the protocol. Additional information will be made available during the study when new staff be come involved in the study and as otherwise agreed upon with either the investigator or the study monitor. 13.3 Study Monitoring The investigator is responsible for the validity of all data collected at the site. The sponsor is responsible for monitoring these data to verify that the rights and wellbeing of subjects are protected, that study data are accurate (complete and verifiable to source data) and that the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and regulatory requirements. Sponsor assigned monitors will conduct regular site visits. The investigator will allow direct access to all relevant files (for all subjects) and clinical study supplies (dispensing and storage areas) for the purpose of verifying entries made in the eCRF, and assist with the monitor’s activities, if requested. Adequate time and space for monitoring visits should be made available by the investigator. The site must complete the eCRFs on an ongoing basis to allow regular review by the study monitor, both remotely by the int ernet and during site visits. The CRO study monitor will use functions of the electronic data capture system to address any queries raised while reviewing the data entered by the study site personnel in a timely manner. Whenever a subject name is revealed on a document required by the sponsor (e.g. laboratory print outs) the name must be blacked out permanently by the site personnel, leaving the initials visible, and annotated with the subject number as identification. 13.4 Investigator’s Regulatory Obligations All clinical work under this protocol will be conducted according to GCP rules. This includes that the study may be audited at any time by a quality assurance personnel designated by the sponsor, or by regulatory bodies. The investigator must adhere to the GCP principles in addition to any applicable local regulations. If requested, the investigator will provide the sponsor, applicable regulatory agencies, and applicable EC with direct access to any original source documents. The investigator(s) should demo nstrate due diligence in recruitment and screening of potential study subjects. The enrolment rate should be sufficient to complete the study as agreed with the sponsor. The sponsor should be notified of any projected delays, which may impact the completio n of the study. 13.5 Audit and Inspection Authorised personnel from external CAs and the sponsor’s authorised Quality Assurance personnel may carry out inspections and audits (see Section 12). 13.6 Data Quality Assurance Monitored eCRFs shared between the investigational site and Data Management CRO will be reviewed (Data Review) for completeness, consistency, legibility and protocol compliance. Reasons should be given on the relevant eCRF for any missing data and other protocol deviations. Any electronic queries and items not adequately explained will require additional electronic manual queries to be raised to the investigator by the monitor for clarification /correction. The investigator must ensure that queries are dealt with promptly. All data changes and clarifications can be viewed in the audit trail function of the eCRF."

In addition, this study will adhere to all local regulatory requirements. Before initiating a study, the investigator/institution should have written and dated approval/favourable opinion from the IEC/IRB for the study protocol/amendment(s), written informed c onsent form, any consent form updates, subject emergency study contact cards, subject recruitment procedures (e.g. advertisements), any written information to be provided to subjects and a statement from the IEC/IRB that they comply with GCP requirements. The IEC/IRB approval must identify the protocol version as well as the documents reviewed. After IEC/IRB approval, changes will require a formal amendment. Once the study has started, amendments should be made only in exceptional circumstances. Changes tha t do not affect subject safety or data integrity are classified as administrative changes and generally do not require ethical approval. If ethically relevant aspects are concerned, the IEC/IRB must be informed and, if necessary, approval sought prior to i mplementation. Ethical approval on administrative changes will be obtained if required by local/site IEC/IRB. 14.2 Informed Consent for Participation in the Study Prior to study entry, the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will explain the nature, purpose, benefits and risks of participation in the study to each subject, subject’s legally acceptable representative or impartial witness. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to the subject entering the study (before initiation of any study -related procedure and administration of the IMP). Sufficient time will be allowed to discuss any questions raised by the subject. The sponsor will provide a sample informed consent form. The final version -controlled form must be agreed to by the sponsor, and the IEC/IRB and must contain all elements included in the sample form, in language readily understood by the subject. Each subject’s original consent form, personally signed and dated by the subject or by the subject’s legally acceptable representative, and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion, will be retained by the investigator. The investigator will supply subjects with a copy of their signed informed consent.

In this instance approval should always be given by the IEC/IRB. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure tha t all subjects subsequently entered into the study and those currently in the study sign the amended form. This is documented in the same way as previously described. Subjects who have completed the study should be informed of any new information that may impact on their welfare/wellbeing. The investigator should, with the consent of the subject, inform the subject’s primary physician about their participation in the clinical study. 14.3 Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Boards As required by local regulations, the sponsor’s Regulatory Affairs group will ensure all legal regulatory aspects are covered, and obtain approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies, prior to study initiation in regions where an approval is requir ed."

The EC(s) will review all submission documen ts as required, and a written favourable opinion for the conduct of the study should be made available to the investigator before initiating the study. This document must be dated and clearly identify the version number(s) and date(s) of the documents subm itted/reviewed and should include a statement from the EC that they comply with GCP requirements. The study may begin at the investigative site(s) only after receiving this dated and signed documentation of the EC approval or favourable opinion. During the study, any update to the following documents will be sent to the EC either for information, or for review and approval, depending on how substantial the modifications are: (1) IB; (2) reports of SAEs; (3) all protocol amendments and revised informed conse nt(s), if any. At the end of the study, the EC will be notified about the study completion. 14.4 Confidentiality Regarding Study Subjects The investigator must assure that the privacy of the subjects, including their personal identity and all personal medical i nformation, will be maintained at all times. In CRFs and other documents or image material submitted to the sponsor, subjects will be identified not by their names, but by an identification code (e.g. initials and identification number). Personal medical i nformation may be reviewed for the purpose of verifying data recorded on the eCRF. This review may be conducted by the study monitor, properly authorised persons on behalf of the sponsor, the quality assurance unit, or regulatory authorities. Personal medi cal information will always be treated as confidential."

The investigator must record all data relating to protocol procedures, IMP administration, laboratory data, safety data and efficacy ratings on the eCRFs provided for the study. The investigator, by completing t he signature log, may formally designate authority to complete, to appropriately qualified staff having certified user access to the eCRF. The investigator must, as a minimum, provide an electronic signature (e -signature) to each case report book to attest to the accuracy and completeness of all the data. If any changes are made to the eCRF, after a form has been locked and electronically signed, the investigator will be required to perform an additional e -signature authorising agreement with any new inform ation or changes to the eCRF. All corrections on the eCRF will be automatically tracked and a reason for change is always required. In the eCRF, the audit trail function will allow the changes made to be viewed on each item entered. 15.2 Data Management Electronic data capture will be utilised for collecting subject data. Each site is required to have a computer and internet connection available for site entry of clinical data. All entries in the eCRF will be done under the electronic signature of the person per forming the action. This electronic signature consists of an individual and confidential username and password combination. It is declared to be the legally binding equivalent of the handwritten signature. Only sponsor authorised users will have access to the eCRF as appropriate to their study responsibilities. Users must have successfully undergone software application training prior to entering data into the eCRF. Data management will be conducted by a CRO directed by the sponsor’s Biometry department. All data management procedures will be completed in accordance with the sponsor and the contracted CRO SOPs. Prior to data being received in -house at the assigned CRO, they will be monitored at the investigator site, (for further details please see Section 13.3 Monitoring Procedures). The eCRF and other data documentation removed from the investigator site(s) will be tracked by the CRO and the monitor. The sponsor will ensure that an appropriate eCRF is developed to capture the data accurately, and suitable queries are raised to resolve any missing or inconsistent data. The investigator will receive their data, from the clinical study, in an electronic format (PDF files) which will be an exact copy of the eCRF, and will include the full audit trail, for archiving purposes and future reference. Any queries generated during the data management process will also be tracked by the contracted Biometry CRO. It is the central study monitor's responsibility to ensure that all queries are resolved by the relevant parties. The sponsor will also ensure th at SAE data collected in the eCRF are consistent with information provided to the sponsor’s pharmacovigilance department (and vice versa). The coding of an AE, medical history, surgical procedures and concomitant medication terms will be performed by the contracted CRO, directed by the sponsor’s Biometry department, and reviewed and approved by the sponsor. Concomitant medications will be coded using WHODRUG and AEs/medical history terms will be coded using MedDRA. Only data from enrolled subjects will be reported in the eCRFs and collected in the sponsor’s database."

Study documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or planned marketing applications in an ICH region (that is at least 15 years) or at l east 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the product. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. The investigator should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. The final archiving arrangements will be confirmed by the monitor when closing out the site. The sponsor will inform the investigator, in writing, as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If the principal investigator relocates or retires, or otherwise withdraws his/her responsibility for maintenance and retention of study documents, the sponsor must be notified (preferably in writing) so that adequate provision can be made for their future maintenance and retention."
