The planned enrollment is approximately 36 subjects . Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 :1 ratio to receive daily SC doses of 0.1 mg/kg RA101495, 0.3 mg/kg RA101495, or matching placebo. Randomization will be stratified based on the screening Quantitative M yasthenia Gravis (QMG) Score (≤ 17 versus ≥ 18). Design of RA101495-02.201 Study The Main Portion of the study includes a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks and a 12- week Treatment P eriod . During the Treatment P eriod, subjects will return to the clinic weekly for the first 2 visits (Day 8 and Day 15) after the Day 1 visit, followed by visits at Week 4 (Day 29), Week 8 (Day 57) , and Week 12 (Day 84) to evaluate safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy . Additional assessments will include quality of life (QOL) questionnaires, biomarker samples, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and optional pharmacogenomi cs. Safety assessments will include physical exam inations , vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests, advers e events (AEs), and immunogenicity .

Following in -clinic education and training, all subjects will self -inject daily SC doses of blinded study drug, according to randomized treatment allocation , for the subsequent 12 weeks . An injection device will be provided for use during the study. Subjects are expected to remain on stable doses of standard of care (SOC) therapy for gMG throughout the study, including pyridostigmine, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs. If, in the opinion of the investigator, escalation of gMG therapy (i.e., ‘rescue therapy’) becomes necessary due to deterioration of a subject’s clinical status, the subject may receive immunoglobulin or plasma exchange treatment. The safety of subjects will be monitored in a blinded manner on an ongoing basis. If an unblinded data review should become necessary to ensure subject safety, a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will convene and evaluate study data as appropriate. The risk of Neisseria meningitidis infection will be closel y monitored during the study. All subjects who have not been previously vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis prior to study entry must be vaccinated with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine and, where available, meningococcal serotype B vaccine at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug at the Day 1 visit. A booster vaccination should also be administered as clinically indicated , according to the local SOC . During the Treatment P eriod, to mitigate the risk of infection, subjects will be counseled and reminded of the early signs and symptoms of Neisseria meningitidis infecti on. A patient safety card detailing the signs and symptoms of infection, with instructions to seek immediate medical attention , will be provided to each subject. At the conclusion of the Treatment Period in the Main Portion of the study, all subjects will have the option to receive RA101495 in the Extension Portion of the study provided they meet the Extension Portion selection criteria . Subjects assigned to a RA101495 treatment arm during the Main Portion of the study will continue to receive the same dose of study drug during the Extension Portion. Subjects assigned to the pl acebo arm during the Main Portion of the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily SC doses of 0.1 mg/kg RA101495 or 0.3 mg/kg RA101495. V isits during the first 12 weeks of the Extension Portion will be identical to Main Portion of the study for all subjects to ensure appropriate monitoring of subjects transitioning from placebo to active treatment and to maintain blinding of treatment assignment . The study will remain double -blinded during the Extension Portion until after the data from the Main Portion of the study have been cleaned, locked, and unblinded. Following implementation of the present Amendment ( v.3.0), and upon appropriate reconsent, all subjects ongoing in the Extension Portion will receive the 0.3 mg/kg dose that has been selected for the pivotal Phase 3 study ( See Section 5.5.3 f or details ). If a subject discontinues study drug treatment prior to the Day 84 v isit for any reason, he/she will not be eligible for the Extension Portion. Subjects who undergo rescue treatment and continue receiving study drug are eligible for participation in the Extension Portion. For subjects who do not participate in the Extension Portion , a safety follow -up telephone call will be performed at 40 days af ter the last dose of study drug, to collect information on any ongoing AEs or new serious adverse events (SAEs) since the last study visit.

The primary efficacy analysis will be the comparison of the 0.3 mg/kg RA101495 dose group versus placebo based on the ANCOVA model at a 1 -sided 0.10 significance level. The secondary efficacy endpoints, Week 12 change from baseline in MG -ADL, MG -QOL15r , and MG Composite, will be analyzed by an ANCOVA model similar to the primary endpoint analysis, with treatment as a factor and the corresponding baseline value as a covariate. Each of the active doses will be compared to the placebo group based on the ANCOVA model at the 1-sided 0.10 level. For the ‘ Subjects with ≥ 3-point reduction in QMG score at Week 12’ and ‘Subjects requiring rescue therapy over the 12 -week Treatment Period’ secondary efficacy endpoints, the rate of subject s meeting the endpoint for each of the active treatment groups will be compared to the placeb o group using a Fisher’s exact test at the 1 -sided 0.10 level. Pharmacokinetics : Drug exposure will be evaluated using PK parameters derived from non - compartmental methods. All calculations for the final analysis will be based on actual sampling times . Individual PK parameters will be presented in listings and summarized using descriptive statistics. Pharmacodynamics : Pharmacodynamic endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Determination of Sample Size : For the primary efficacy endpoi nt, change from baseline to Week 12 (Day 84) in QMG score, assuming a difference in treatment group means of 4.5, an SD of 5 .0, and 12 subjects per group, the study has approximately 81% power to detect a difference between an active and placebo treatment group based on a 1-sided t- test with a 0.10 type I error rate.

Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for additional information on the chemistry, toxicology, phar macology, and safety of RA101495. 5.1 OVERVIEW OF GENERALIZED MYASTHENIA GRAVIS Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare complement -mediated autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies targeting proteins that are critical for the normal trans mission of electrical signals from nerves to muscles . The prevalence of MG in the United States is estimated at approximately 36,000 to 60,000 cases [Howard , 2016]. In approximately 15% of patients with MG, symptoms are confined to the ocular muscles . The remaining patients have MG that affects multiple muscle groups throughout the body, which is defined as ‘generalized’ myasthenia gravis (gMG) [ Gilhus , 2016]. Patients with gMG present with muscle weakness that characteristically becomes more severe with repeated use and recovers with rest . Muscle weakness can be localized to specific muscles, but often progresses to more diffuse muscle weakness [ Gilhus , 2015; Gilhus , 2016]. gMG symptoms can become life- threatening when muscle weakness involves the diaphragm and intercostal muscles in the chest wall that are responsible for breathing . The most dangerous complication of gMG, known as myasthenic crisis, requires hospitalization, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Approximately 15% to 20% of patients with gMG will experience a myasthenic crisis within 2 years of diagnosis [Ramizuddin, 2014]. The most common target of autoantibodies in gMG is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR ), located at the neuromuscular junction, the point at which a motor neuron transmits chemical signals to a skeletal muscle fiber . Current therapies for gMG focus on either augmenting the AChR signal or nonspecifically suppressing the auto immune response. First-line therapy for symptomatic gMG is treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine, which is the only approved therapy for MG. Although usually adequate for control of mild ocular symptoms, pyridostigmine monotherapy is usually insufficient for the treatment of generalized weakness, and dosing of this therapy may be limited by cholinergic side effects. Therefore, in patients who re main symptomatic despite pyridostigmine therapy, corticosteroids with or without systemic immunosuppressives are indicated [ Sanders , 2016]. Immunosuppressives used in gMG include azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenylate mofetil, methotrexate, tacrolimus, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. To date, efficacy data for these agents are sparse and no steroidal or immunosuppressive therapy has been approved for the treatment of gM G. Moreover, all of these agents are associated with well -documented long- term toxicities . Surgical removal of the thymus may be recommended in patients with nonthymomatous gMG and moderate to severe symptoms in an effort to reduce the production of AChR autoantibodies [ Wolfe , 2016]. Intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin and plasma exchange are restricted to short- term use in patients with myasthenic crisis or life -threatening signs REDACTED COPY This document cannot be used to support any marketing authorization application and any extensions or variations thereof."

There is, therefore, a substantial unmet medical need for novel therapies to treat patients with gMG. 5.2 ROLE OF COMPLEMENT IN GENERALIZED MYASTHENIA GRAVIS There is substantial evidence that supports the role of terminal complement cascade in the pathogenesis of AChR autoantibody- positive gMG . Results from animal models of experimental autoimmune MG have demonstrated that immune complex formation at the neuromuscular junction triggers activation of the classical complement pathway, resulting in local activation of C3 and deposition of the membrane attack complex (MAC) at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in loss of signal transduction and eventual muscle weakness [Kusner , 2012]. In addition, i nhibition of C5 has been recently validated as a target for the treatment of refractory gMG based on clinical s tudies with the C5-blocking antibody, e culizumab . Eculizumab is currently approved for use in 2 other complement -driven rare diseases, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) . In a Phase 2, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial, e culizumab was tested in 14 AChR autoantibody- positive patients with refractory gMG, who had a quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score ≥ 12 and previously failed treatment with at least 2 immunosuppressant therapies (ISTs) [ Howard , 2013]. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either eculizumab or placebo. Patients on e culizumab received 600 mg per week for 4 weeks , followed by 900 mg every other week by IV infusion, for a total of 16 we eks of treatment . After a 5 -week washout period, patients were crossed over to the opposite arm of the study. Patients who received placebo for the first 16 weeks of the study were treated with eculizumab and vice versa. The primary endpoints were safety and efficacy, as measured by the percentage of patients who achieved a ≥ 3-point reduction in QMG score . The impact of C5 inhibition by e culizumab in QMG score occurred rapidly (within 1 week of initiating treatment) and favored eculizumab compared with placebo across all study visits (p = 0.0144). Following the initial 16 -week treatment period, 6 out of 7 patients on eculizumab achieved a ≥ 3-point improvement in QMG score, compared with 4 out of 7 patients in the placebo arm . Of th ose patients who responded to eculizumab, 4 achieved an 8 -point reduction in QMG score compared with only 1 in the placebo arm. A Phase 3 trial was also recently completed that enrolled 125 AChR autoantibody- positive patients with a Myasthenia Gravis -Activities of Daily Living (MG -ADL) score ≥ 6, who had previously failed 2 ISTs or had failed 1 IST and required chronic plasma exchange or IV immunoglobulin therapy [ Alex ion, 2017]. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo or eculizumab for a 26 -week treatment period , followed by an extens ion study. Patients receiving e culizumab were treated with 900 mg per week for 4 weeks followed by 1200 mg every other week by IV infusion. Eculizumab treatment was not associated with a statistically significant benefit relative to placebo in the primary endpoint of change from baseline in MG- ADL (p = 0.0698) in this study [Alexion, 2016]. However , statistically significant results were observed in 18 of 22 prespecified analyses, including the secondary endpoint of change from baseline in QMG score (p = 0.0129).

RA101495 binds to C5 with high affinity and prevents its cleavage by the C5 convertase into both cleavage products C5a and C5b ( Figure 1). Inhibition of C5 cleavage therefore prevents the downstream assembly and activity of the MAC , which has been detected in the post- junctional membrane of the neuromuscular junction of patients with gMG . Distinct from eculizumab, RA101495 binds to the portion of C5 that corresponds to the C5b domain. In binding to this region of C5, should any C5b be formed, RA101495 will also block binding to C6, which further prevents the subsequ ent assembly of the MAC (C5b -9). Using surface plasmon resonance and analysis of a high-resolution co- crystal structure, RA101495 has been shown to bind to a specific site on C5 and to exhibit a strong and rapid association with C5, coupled with a slow dis sociation rate. Thus, RA101495 inhibits MAC formation by a dual mechanism : 1. Prevention of downstream complement activation by allosterically inhibiting C5 cleavage 2. Direct inhibition of the first step in MAC assembly, C5b -C6-binding.

The right panel of Figure 2 shows the inhibition by RA101495 of C5b formation (as measured by C5b -9 or MAC deposition on a complement activating surface ) upon activation of the classical and alternative complement pathways .

S tudy RA101495-1001 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple dose (MD) study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of RA101495. The first part of the RA101495-1001 study (SAD) evaluated a single dose of RA101495 versus placebo at 4 dose levels (0. 05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0 .4 mg/kg) in separate cohorts. Twenty -two subjects were enrolled ; 14 subjects received RA101495 (0.05 mg/kg in 2 subjects; 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg in 4 subjects each) and 8 subjects received placebo (2 subjects per each dose level ). The second part of the study (MD) evaluated 7 daily doses of RA101495 versus placebo at a single dose level (0.2 mg/kg). A total of 6 subjects were enrolled; 4 subjects received RA101495 and 2 subjects received placebo. The results of this study showed that RA101495 had highly predictable, dose-dependent PK after single - and multiple -dose SC injections over the dose range investigated . RA101495 demonstrated robust ex vivo hemolysis suppression and complement inhibition with daily SC dosing compared with placebo treatment (Figure 3).

Administration of RA101495 in this study was also associated with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported . The most common adverse events ( AEs) in subjects who received single doses of RA101495, regardless of causality, were injection site erythema (3 subjects, 0.4 mg/kg), upper respiratory tract infection ( 1 subject, 0.05 mg/kg; 2 subjects, 0.4 mg/kg) , and headache (2 subjects, 0.4 mg/kg) . The most common AEs in subjects who received multiple doses of 0.2 mg/kg RA101495, regardless of causality, were injection site erythema (3 subjects) and headache (2 subjects). A complete overview of results from the RA101495-1001 study is provided in the RA101495 IB . 5.5 R ATIONALE FOR THE CURRENT STUDY Current therapies for gMG focus on either augmenting the AChR signal or nonspecifically suppressing the autoimmune response, and none of these treatments target the injury to the post- synaptic muscle endplate caused by complement attack . Inhibition of terminal complement activity with RA101495 may block complement-mediated damage to the motor endplate, thereby preserving responsiveness to signaling and potentially reversing or preventing muscle weakness. The current study wil l evaluate the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment with 2 different doses of RA101495 (0.1 mg/kg daily and 0.3 mg/kg daily ) compared with placebo, as well as the long- term effects of administration of RA101495, in subjects with gMG. 5.5.1 R ATIONALE FOR BLINDING AND PLACEBO CONTROL The primary objective of this study is the evaluation of efficacy based on functional assessment of weakness measured by the QMG score , as well as additional clinical endpoints. Such clinical assessments are prone to placebo effects and may be influenced by knowledge of treatment assignment by the clinical evaluator and/or subject. Moreover, the evaluation of potential adverse effects may also be influenced by knowledge of treatment assignment.

Subjects entering the study will have stable disease and will be allowed to continue their standard of care (SOC) therapy, including escalation of treatment as medically necessary (see Section 10.1.3.1 Rescue Therapy) . Therefore, subjects receiving placebo will not be subject to increased risk due to withholding of medically necessary interventions. In addition, the placebo study drug contains subst ances that are known to be well -tolerated ( ) and are delivered in a small volume < 1 mL ; therefore, placebo administration by daily SC injection over the 12- week study period is expected to be well -tolerated. Consequently, administration of a placebo in Study RA101495-02.201 is not anticipated to cause undue burden or risk for study subjects. Following the completion of the 12- week Treatment Period in the Main Portion of the study, all subjects will have the option to receive RA101495 in the E xtension Portion of the study. Therefore, subjects originally randomized to placebo will eventually have the opportunity to receive active study drug. The study will remain double-blinded during the Extension Portion until after the data from the Main Portion of the study have been cleaned, locked, and unblinded. Following implementation of the present Amendment (v.3.0), and upon appropriate reconsent, all subjects ongoing in the Extension Portion will receive the 0.3 mg/kg dose that has been selected for the pivotal Phase 3 st udy (See Section 5.5.3 for details). 5.5.2 D OSE SELECTION AND PRESENTATION Study drug will be provided in prefilled syringes for self-injection using weight bracketed dosing (i.e., subjects will be provided prefilled syringes containing fixed amounts of RA101495 based on their weight, and each fixed amount will cover a range of subject weights). This weight-bracketed dosing strategy will result in the potential for a range of doses to be received at each dose level (see Section 9.1.3). The doses to be used in this Phase 2 study were selected based on the following: • Preliminary data from ongoing Phase 2 studies in adult subjects with PNH indicates that daily dosing of RA101495 at both 0.1mg/kg and 0.3mg/kg is well- tolerated. • The predicted steady state C max and AUC (0-24) achieved at both doses are expected to be within the range of those achieved in the Phase 1 RA101495 study in healthy volunteers and/or in Phase 2 studies in subjects with PNH. • Based on pharmacodynamic data from the ongoing Phase 2 studies in PNH, both doses have been shown to achieve rapid and sustained inhibition of complement activity. • Additional information on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and experience in other clinical trials is available in the Investigators’ Brochure . 5.5.3 DOSE SELECTION FOR OPEN LABEL PORTION After analysis of the results of the Main Portion of this Phase 2 Study, the dose of 0.3 mg/kg daily was selected for the Open Label Extension Portion based on its superior REDACTED COPY This document cannot be used to support any marketing authorization application and any extensions or variations thereof."

In the Main Portion of the Phase 2 Study RA101495-02.201, the magnitude and speed of improvement on the primary (QMG) and key secondary (MG-ADL) endpoints were greater with the 0.3 mg/kg dose than the 0.1 mg/kg dose, and both active doses were superior to placebo. The superior efficacy of the 0.3 mg/kg dose was further demonstra ted by the complete freedom from the need for rescue therapy with IVIG or PLEX in the 0.3mg/kg arm, as compared with a 7% rescue rate in the 0.1 mg/kg arm, and a 20% rescue rate in the placebo arm. A higher proportion of subjects achieved MSE (Vissing 2018), defined as an MG-ADL of 0 or 1, in the 0.3mg/kg arm (35.7%) as compared with the 0.1 mg/kg arm (26.7%) and placebo (13.3%). The dose response seen in the clinical outcome measures is consistent with the known pharmacodynamic effect of zilucoplan that resulted, as expected, in rapid, sustained and complete (97%) inhibition of the terminal complement pathway in all gMG subjects receiving the 0.3 mg/kg dose while the 0.1 mg/kg group achieved only submaximal (88%) inhibition of the terminal complement pathwa y. The once daily dosing interval will be retained because pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that longer dosing intervals cannot achieve adequate exposures and fail to maintain the depth of complement inhibition needed for maximum therapeutic benefit. For example, once every other day dosing is estimated to reduce the zilucoplan trough concentration by approximately 50%, resulting in inadequate pharmacodynamic effect. The same weight brackets for the 0.3 mg/kg dose will continue to be used in the Open Label Extension Portion. Study drug will continue to be provided in prefilled syringes for self-injection using weight bracketed dosing (i.e., subjects will be provided prefilled syringes containing fixed amounts of zilucoplan based on their weight, and ea ch fixed amount will cover a range of subject weights). This weight- bracketed dosing strategy will result in the potential for a range of doses to be received at each dose level (see Section 9.1.3). 6 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 6.1 O BJECTIVES The objectives of the study are: • To assess the safety and tolerability of RA101495 in subjects with gMG • To assess preliminary efficacy of RA101495 in subjects with gMG 6.2 ENDPOINTS 6.2.1 SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY ENDPOINTS Safety assessments wil l include evaluation s of AEs and SAEs , clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), vital signs, and physical examinations.

The planned enrollment is approximately 36 subjects. Subjec ts will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive daily SC doses of 0.1 mg/kg RA101495, 0.3 mg/kg RA101495, or matching placebo . Randomization will be stratified based on the screening QMG Score (≤ 17 versus ≥ 18). The Main Portion of the study includes a Screening P eriod of up to 4 weeks and a 12- week Treatment Period (Figure 4). During the Treatment P eriod, subjects will return to the clinic weekly fo r the first 2 visits (Day 8 and Day 15) after the Day 1 visit, followed by visits at Week 4 (Day 29), Week 8 (Day 57), and Week 12 (Day 84) to evaluate safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy . Additional assessments will include quality of life (QOL ) questionnaires, biomarker samples, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and optional pharmacogenomics. Safety assessments will include physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, AEs, and immunogenicity . Randomized subjects will receive 0.1 mg/kg RA101495, 0.3 mg/kg RA101495, or matching placebo administered SC at the Day 1 visit. Following in -clinic education and training, all subjects will self -inject daily SC doses of blinded study drug, according to randomiz ed treatment allocation , for the subsequent 12 weeks . An injection device will be provided for use during the study. Subjects are expected to remain on stable doses of SOC therapy for gMG throughout the study, including pyridostigmine, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs. If, in the opinion of the investigator, escalation of gMG therapy (i.e., ‘rescue therapy’) becomes necessary due to deterioration of a subject’s clinical status, the subject may receive immunoglobulin or plasma exchange treatment. The safety of subjects will be monitored in a blinded manner on an ongoing basis. If an unblinded data review should become necessary to ensure subject safety, a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will convene and evaluate study data as appropriate (see Section 11.3.2.1). The risk of Neisseria meningitidis infection will be closely monitored during the study. All subjects who have not been previously vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis prior to study entry must be vaccinated with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine and, where available, meningococcal serotype B vaccine at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug at the Day 1 visit. A booster vaccination should al so be administered as clinically indicated, according to the local SOC . During the T reatment Period, to mitigate the risk of infection, subjects will be counseled and reminded of the early signs and symptoms of Neisseria meningitidis infection . A patient safety card detailing the signs and symptoms of infection, with instructions to seek immediate medical attention, will be provided to each subject.

Subjects assigned to a RA10 1495 treatment arm during the Main Portion of the study will continue to receive the same dose of study drug during the Extension Portion. Subjects assigned to the placebo arm during the Main Portion of the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to recei ve daily SC doses of 0.1 mg/kg RA101495 or 0.3 mg/kg RA101495. V isits during the first 12 weeks of the Extension Portion will be identical to Main Portion of the study for all subjects to ensure appropriate monitoring of subjects transitioning from placebo to active treatment and to maintain blinding of treatment assignment. The study will remain double-blinded during the Extension Portion until after the data from the Main Portion of the study have been cleaned, locked, and unblinded. Following implementation of the present Amendment (v.3.0), and upon appropriate reconsent, all subjects ongoing in the Extension Portion will receive the 0.3 mg/kg dose that has been selected for the pivotal Phase 3 study (See Section 5.5.3 for details). If a subject discontinues study drug treatment prior to the Day 84 visit for any reason, he/she will not be eligible for the Extension Portion. Subjects who undergo rescue treatment and continue receiving study drug are eligible for participation in the Ex tension Portion. For subjects who do not participate in the Extension Portion, a safety follow -up telephone call will be performed at 40 days after the last dose of study drug, to collect information on any ongoing AEs or new serious adverse events (SAEs) since the last study visit.

On days when rescue therapy is concurrently administered, study drug dosing should be held until after administration of rescue therapy and PK/PD sampling. 9.1.3 D OSE PRESENTATION Doses of RA101495 will be determined by a target dose and weight, accomplished using a fixed dose by weight brackets . These brackets are grouped by body weight category such that each subject will receive the no less than the t arget minimum dose to avoid sub-therapeutic dosing. For the 0.1 mg/kg dose, subjects will receive, at a minimum, a fixed dose of 0.1 mg/kg (range : 0.10 to 0.14 mg/kg). For the 0.3 mg/kg dose, subjects will receive a minimum dose of 0.3 mg/kg (range: 0.30 to 0.42 mg/kg). Table 2 summarizes the dose presentations for RA101495 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg doses . Subjects who present with a higher body weight ( ≥ 109 kg) will be accommodated on a case- by-case basis, in consultation with the medical monitor.

The following demographic data will be collected : date of birth, gender, ethnicity, and race. The Screenin g assessment will also include disease history with documentation of the diagnosis of gMG by MGFA criteria (Class II -IVa), serology for AChR autoantibodies, and QMG score (see Section 10.3.1 for additional instructions). 10.1.2 H EIGHT AND WEIGHT Height ( cm) will be collected at the Screening visit only. Weight (kg) will be measured at the study visits indicated in Table 1 and Table 2. 10.1.3 PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS All prescriptions and over-the-counter medications taken during the 30 days prior to baseline (i.e., Day 1) through the last study visit will be documented. NOTE: A complete history of medications taken for the treatment of gMG will be collected. Concomitant medication s include any prescription or over-the- counter medication that is ongoing on Day 1 or that is initiated following the first dose of study drug on Day 1. Medications, including over the counter therapeutics, natural products, and vitamins, should not be changed during the Screening or Treatment Periods, unless medically necessary. All concomitant medications necessary for the health and well- being of a subject will be permitted . Subjects are expected to remain on stable doses of SOC therapy for gMG throughout the Main Portion of the study and through the Day E84 visit of the Extension Portion, including pyridostigmine, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive drugs. If after that period the investigator determines that dose reduction of SOC therapy for gMG may be a reasonable course of action, dose reduction should be initiated after a study visit, and the new dosing regimen should be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the next study visit. Dose of standard of care treatment should not be increased during the study. Instead, rescue therapy as described in 10.1.3.1 should be administered. Medications will be recorded on the subject ’s source documents and entered on the appropriate eCRF . Any changes to concomitant medications will be recorded in the eCRF.

If, in the opinion of the investigator, escalation of gMG therapy (i.e., ‘rescue therapy’) becomes necessary due to deterioration of a subject’s clinical status, the subject may receive immunoglobulin or plasma exchange treatment. If such rescue therapy becomes necessary, the choice of immunoglobulin vs. plasma exchange, as wel l as the frequency and duration of such therapy, will be determined by the investigator. Escalation of doses of pyridostigmine, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs for rescue is not permitted. The Sponsor should be notified immediately upon determi nation that rescue therapy is necessary in any given subject. A Rescue Therapy Visit should be performed prior to initiation of rescue therapy (see Table 1 and Table 2 for a list of applicable study procedures ). Unblinding of treatment assignment prior to initiation of rescue therapy will not be allowed, unless critical for reason s of subject safety. The subject will continue their blinded tr eatment and retain all study -specified assessments while undergoing rescue therapy and through the end of the study if the investigator, in consultation with the medical monitor, considers this course of action in the best interest of the subject. However, for the purpose of the primary efficacy analyses, the last observation prior to initiation of rescue therapy will be used as the final assessment (see Section 12 for details ). Details on the rescue therapy , as well as reasons for initiation of rescue therapy , will be collected. 10.2 S AFETY ASSESSMENTS 10.2.1 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A full physical examination will be performed on all subjects at the Screening visit and will include the following assessments: • General inspection • Examination of the injection site and draining nodes • Head/ears/eyes/nose/throat examination • Mucosal examination • Cardiac examination • Auscultat ion of lungs • Abdominal examination (liver, spleen, and lower abdomen) • Musculoskeletal assessment • Neurological assessment Any abnormalities found will be recorded in the eCRF.

The QMG is a standardized and validated quantitative strength scoring system that was developed specifically for MG and has been used previously in clinical trials. Higher scores are repres entative of more severe impairment. Recent data suggest that improvements in the QMG score of 2 to 3 points may be considered clinically meaningful, depending upon disease severity [ Barohn, 1998; Katzberg , 2014]. QMG evaluators must be adequately trained prior to conducting any QMG score asses sments. The QMG assessment will be performed at Screening to assess subject eligibility and at each study visit according to the Time and Events Table s (Table 1 and Table 2). The QMG assessment should be performed at approximately the same time of day (preferably in the morning ) and administere d by the same well -trained evaluator (e.g., neurologist, physical therapist, or other study staff) at each visit throughout the REDACTED COPY This document cannot be used to support any marketing authorization application and any extensions or variations thereof."

If a subject is receiving a cholinesterase inhibitor , the dose must be withheld for at least 10 hours prior to the QMG test. Detailed instructions regarding the administration of the QMG test will be provided to sites. 10.3.2 OTHER EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS Efficacy assessments will also include an evaluation of the MG -ADL, MG -QOL15r , and MG Composite assessments. The MG -ADL is a brief 8 -item survey designed to evaluate MG symptom severity . Higher scores are associated with more severe symptoms of MG . The MG -ADL has been shown to correlate with other validated MG outcome measures (e.g., MG -QOL15r), and a 2-point improvement in MG- ADL score is considered clinically meaning ful [Wolfe , 1999; Muppidi , 2011] . The MG -QOL15r is a 15 -item survey that was designed to assess quality of life in patients with MG . Higher scores indicate more severe impact of the disease on aspects of the patient’s life [Burns , 2010; Burns , 2016]. The MG Composite is a 10 -item scale that has been used to measure the clinical status of patients with MG, both in the practice setting and in clinical trials, in order to evaluate treatment response. Higher scores in the MG Composite indicate more severe impairment due to the disease. A 3 -point change in this instrument is considered clinically meaningful [ Benatar , 2012; Sadjadi , 2012]. Detailed instructions regarding the administration of these assessments will be prov ided to sites. 10.4 P HARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS During the Main Portion of the study, blood samples for PK analysis will be collected from all subjects at the following time points: Day 1 Day 84 During Rescue Therapy * At sites where rescue therapy is administered locally At sites where rescue therapy is NOT administered locally predose (within 1 hour before first dose of study drug) predose (any time prior to Day 84 study drug administration) Within 1 hour before administration of rescue therapy Prior to administration of the first course of rescue therapy 1 hour postdose (± 30 minutes) 1 hour postdose (± 30 minutes) For PLEX only: PK will be measured in the exchanged plasma After administration of the last course of rescue therapy 3 hours postdose (± 30 minutes) Within 1 hour after administration of rescue therapy 6 hours postdose (± 90 minutes ) * See Appendix 1 for details on PK/PD sampling during Rescue Therapy REDACTED COPY This document cannot be used to support any marketing authorization application and any extensions or variations thereof."

At all other study visits, biomarker samples will be collected prior to the administration of study drug ( Table 1 and Table 2). Detailed instructions regarding sample collection, processing, and shipping will be provided to sites . The analysis of biomarkers pertaining to the pathophysiology of MG [e.g., complement fixation, complement function, complement pathway proteins, autoantibody characterization (titer and immunoglobulin class) , and inflammatory markers] may provide further ins ight in to the clinical efficacy and safety of RA101495 in subject s with gMG . Complement protein levels and complement activity will be tested to evaluate response to RA101495 and to understand subject characteristics related to variatio ns in response to drug. Markers of inflammation may be tested to assess correlation with complement function and clinical response to RA101495. A list of analytes will be created through review of the literature, ongoing clinical studies, and ongoing exploratory work and may be finalized after completion of the study. During the Extension Portion of the study, if a subject undergoes a thymectomy, lymphadenectomy , or other surgical excision in which a biopsy was obtained, a section of the biopsy may be sent for exploratory immunohist ochemical and biomarker analysis provided the subject has given their consent. Processing and preservation of the tissue should be discussed with the Sponsor prior to the intervention if possible.

Examples of such events include intensive treatment i n an emergency room or at home for bronchospasm, hyperkalemia, or convulsions that do not result in a formal hospitalization . Elective hospitalizations that were scheduled prior to study participation (i.e., signing of the ICF) are not considered to be SAEs and should not be reported. 11.1.3 STOPPING RULES For all ≥ Grade 3 AEs that are considered related to study drug (except for hepatic and pancreatic AEs described in Section 11.1.3.1 and Section 11.1.3.2, respectively) , study drug should be permanently discontinued. 11.1.3.1 MONITORING OF LIVER FUNCTION TESTS All subjects will be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic or biliary dysfunction . LFT parameters [alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ), ALT, AST, gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT ), and bilirubin] will be evaluated as part of the chemistry laboratory assessments performed at each study visit, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2 (see also Table 4 for a list of chemistry analytes) . The following guideline s should be followed for all subjects during study participation: • Subjects with isolated ALT or AST elevation > 2 × ULN with no other explanation for the elevation(s ): contact the medical monitor to review the case details and determine whether or not the subject should continue study treatment. The subject should be monitored until the elevated enzymes return to ≤ 2 × UL N. • Subjects with isolated total bilirubin elevation > 2 × ULN with no other explanation for the elevation(s) : contact the medical monitor to review the case details and determine whether or not the subject should continue study treatment. The subject should be monitored until the total bilirubin returns to ≤ 2 × ULN. • Subjects with isolated ALT or AST elevations > 3 × ULN concurrently with total bilirubin elevation > 2 × ULN and a normal ALP with no other explanation for the elevation : study drug should be permanently discontinued. The medical monitor should be contacted as soon as possible to review the case. The subject should be monitored until the elevated enzymes return to Grade 1 [ National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Version 4.03] or lower, and the total bilirubin is ≤ 2 × ULN . 11.1.3.2 M ONITORING OF PANCREATIC ENZYME S Subjects will be monitored during the study for symptoms of pancreatitis or cholecystitis.

The medical monitor should be contacted to discuss any skin or oral lesions, regardless of causality, to determine whether the subject should interrupt or discontinue study treatment. Study drug must be permanently discontinued in the event of any moderate or severe skin or oral lesions considered related to study drug (e.g., mucous membrane inflammation, oral ulceration, blistering, abrasions, and dermatitis). 11.1.3.4 I NFECTI ON All subjects will be monitored at every study visit for signs and symptoms of Neisseria meningitidis infection. To reduce the risk of infection, all subjects must have documentation of prior Neisseria meningitidis vaccination (and booster, if appropria te) prior to study entry. All subjects who have not been previously vaccinated will be vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug on Day 1 and should have a booster vaccination as indicated by SOC . During the Treatment Period, to mitigate the risk of infection, subjects will be counseled and reminded of the early signs and symptoms of Neisseria meningitidis infection. A patient safety card detailing the signs and symptoms of infection, with instructions to seek immediate medical attention, will be provided to each subject. Any subject receiving antibiotics for suspected Neisseria meningitidis infection should interrupt study drug administration until Neisseria meningitidis infection can be ruled out. If Neisseria meningitidis infection is confirmed the subject should permanently discontinue study drug. 11.1.4 M ONITORING OF INJECTION SITE REACTIONS The investigator should assess the injection site (included as part of the physical examination) at each scheduled visit for: • Pain, tenderness, erythema, and induration severity ( Table 5 ) o Erythema and induration: record the maximum linear diameter • Blisters, ulceration, necrosis : record the maximum linear diameter and severity • Lymphadenopathy REDACTED COPY This document cannot be used to support any marketing authorization application and any extensions or variations thereof."

For any reported AE not described in the NCI CTCAE, the following guidelines must be considered for severity evaluation: Adverse Event Severity Mild Symptom(s) barely noticeable to subject or does not make subject uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s). Moderate Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; performance of daily activity is influenced; subjec t is able to continue in study; treatment for symptom(s) may be needed. Severe Symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or significant impact on subject ’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of treatment with study treatment; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject hospitalized. 11.2.2 CAUSALITY The causal relationship of the AE to study drug will be assessed by both the investigator and the Sponsor. The assessment of causal relationship to study drug should be evidence- based, and not based on the premise that all AEs are causally related to study drug until proven otherwise.

Lack of efficacy of study drug, in isolation, leading to unmasking of underlying symptoms and signs of disease, should not be considered evidence of relatedness. The causal relationship of each AE is assessed using a binary system , with all AEs classified as either ‘related’ or ‘ not related’. Related : There is ‘reasonable pos sibility ’ that the study drug caused the AE. The AE follows a reasonable temporal association from the time of study drug administration . There is supportive evidence to suggest a possible causal relationship, irrespective of the degree of certainty, between the observed AE and the study drug. There is no alternative more likely explanation for the AE. Lack of study drug efficacy is not considered, by itself, to be evidence of relatedness . Not Related : Lack of a reasonable temporal or causal association from the administration of the study drug and the occurrence of the AE. There is evidence of an alternative explanation that is more likely the cause of the AE. 11.3 R ECORDING , REPORTING , AND MONITORING 11.3.1 RECORDING AND REPORTING The investigator must make every e ffort to properly evaluate all information relevant to the reported AE in such a way that a diagnosis can be confidently made and reported. For examp le, it is preferable to report ‘pneumonia’ as the AE rather than its symptoms ( e.g., ‘rales’ or ‘fever’) as separate AEs. When recording and/or reporting AEs or SAEs, the following elements must be included: • The fulfilled criteria for seriousness as presented in Section 11.1.2 • The severity of the event as defined in Section 11.2.1 • The relationship of the event to study treatment as defined in Section 11.2.2 Actions taken in relation to the AE will be recorded as drug discontinued, drug interrupted, concomitant medication, other action ( e.g., diagnostic testing), or no action. Any medic ation given to treat the AE will be recorded separately in the concomitant medication list of the eCRF. The outcome of the AE will be recorded as date ended, ongoing, or resulting in death with date of death. 11.3.1.1 ADVERSE EVENT S Pre-existing conditions that are detected prior to administration of the first dose of study drug will be recor ded as part of the medical history . For all subject s, the AE reporting period will start with the first administration of study drug on Day 1 and will end with the last study visit (i.e., End of Study Visit, Day 84 visit, or Final Study Visit), after which no new non-serious AEs are to be reported .

This Safety Follow -up C all will only be required for subjects who choose not to participate in the Extension Portion of the study. All AEs will be recorded in the eCRF . The investigator will assess and record any AE in detail including the date and time of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date or ongoing), relationship of the AE to study drug, and action(s) taken . All AEs shoul d be reported separately ( i.e., 1 record per event). Reporting of AEs is event- based ( i.e., an ongoing event will not be closed until resolved or at the end of study). For the AE description, a diagnosis is preferred over symptoms. If no diagnosis can be m ade, each symptom will be reported as a separate AE . Abbreviations should be avoided. Descriptive words should be used for ongoing conditions as applicable (e.g., ). AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA; Version 18.0 or higher) after the eCRFs have been monitored and signed by the investigator. 11.3.1.2 S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S Any SAE experienced by the subject from signing the ICF through to 40 days after the last dose of study drug, regardless of severity or causality, must be recorded on the e CRF and SAE f orms.

All identified causes of death, including an assessment of the possible relationship of each to study treatment, must be reported as SAEs as outlined in Section 11.3.1.2. Any autopsy or other postmortem findings (including a coroner’s report) should be provided if available. 11.3.1.4 ABNORMAL LABORATORY VALUES All central laboratory data generated during the study will be included in standard Statistical Analysis System (SAS) datasets . Throughout this study, subjects will have samples sent to local laboratories and to the central laboratory . Only t he values from the central laboratory will be captured in the database and used for the safety analysis . Investigators may report AEs based upon local laboratory values, if clinically relevant. In this event, the actual value and the normal range for the local laboratory should be recorded on the AE eCRF. 11.3.2 S AFETY MONITORING All AEs should be monitored by the investigator until resolution or stabilization . 11.3.2.1 SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE The safety of study subjects will be monitored throughout the study on an ongoing basis. Given the double blind, placebo-controlled design of Study RA101495.02.201, this standard safety data review will be performed while blinded to treatment assignment. If an unblinded data review should become necessary to ensure subject safety, a separate SMC will convene and evaluate study data as appropriate. To ensure the scientific integrity of the study, members of the SMC will not be directly involved in management of the study. 11.3.2.2 P OST-STUDY EVENTS Any SAE that was continuing at the time of subject discontinuation or study completion should be monitored by the investigator until resolution or stabilization. SAEs that occur within 40 days after the subject discontinues from or completes the study should be reported using the same procedures outlined in Section 11.3.1.2. These SAEs should be recorded in the e CRF . Sites will call subjects 40 days after their last dose of study drug to gather information on ongoing AEs and report any new SAEs since the last study visit (see Section 11.3.1.2 for SAE reporting instructions). This Safety Follow -up Call will only be required for subjects who do not participate in the Extension Portion. 11.3.3 EMERGENCY UNBLINDING DURING THE BLINDED PORTION The study drug treatment assignment may be unblinded only in emergency situations when knowledge of the treatment assignment is considered absolutely necessary for REDACTED COPY This document cannot be used to support any marketing authorization application and any extensions or variations thereof."

The investigator will have unrestricted and immediate access to unblind the treatment code in the IXRS . The instructions for unblinding a subject in the IXRS can be found in the IXRS User Guide . In the event unblinding is necessary, the invest igator is strongly encouraged, but not required, to contact the appropriate medical monitor to discuss the situation and the subject’s medical status prior to unblinding. When a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, a comprehensive source note must be completed by the unblinding investigator that includes the date and time and the reason(s) the subject’s treatment code was unblinded. In the event the investigator chooses to discuss the unblinding with the medical monitor, the source note must also include a record of the discussion. It is mandatory that all personnel who are involved in the unblinding and who have access to the unblinded treatment assignment information maintain the confidentiality of the information by not divulging the treatment as signment. Following emergency unblinding, the subject’s further participation in the study should be discussed with the medical monitor. 11.4 S PECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 11.4.1 PREGNANCY Subject s and their partners should avoid pregnancy throughout the course of the study. Pregnancy in a study subject or partner must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the study site be coming aware of the pregnancy. Subject s with a positive pregnancy test before study drug dosing must not be dosed. Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject or partner and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected. Pregnancy in a study subject or partner is no t, in itself, considered an AE . However, the medical outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or c ongenital anomaly is considered an SAE and must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event . The procedure of elective abortion should not be reported as an AE . 11.4.2 O THER Certain safety events, called ‘Special Situations ’, that occur in association with study drug(s) may require reporting . These Special Situations include, but are not limited to, the following: • Overdose of the medicinal product, where ‘overdose’ is defined as a subject receiving more than 1.5 times the intended dose for any given SC injection • Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product • Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product REDACTED COPY This document cannot be used to support any marketing authorization application and any extensions or variations thereof."
