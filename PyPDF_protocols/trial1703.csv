In this document, the term investigator refers to the individual responsible for the overall conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. 3.1 Background information 3.1.1 Type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism. The pathogenesis is not fully understood but seems to be heterogeneous, involving environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors leading to chronic hyperglycaemia caused by peripheral tissue insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion due to abnormal β-cell function and abnormal glucose metabolism in the liver4. Optimal glycaemic control is the treatment goal in subjects with T2D in order to prevent long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia 5-8. While an increasing number of agents to treat diabetes exist, data collected from 2007 −2010 demonstrate that close to 50% of all patients treated for their T2D do not achieve the recommended blood glucose target of an HbA 1c<7% and are thus at increased risk of T2D-related complications9. 3.1.2 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) GLP-1 is an incretin hormone with a glucose-dependent stimulatory effect on insulin and inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets10, 11. Subjects with T2D have a decreased incretin effect12-14, but can respond to the blood glucose lowering effect of GLP-1 when administered at supraphysiological levels15. In addition, supraphysiological levels of GLP-1 reduce body weight by lowering energy intake by inducing feelings of satiety and fullness and lowering feelings of hunger. GLP-1 is also a neuropeptide produced in the brain and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation 16-18. These mechanisms of action make glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) an attractive pharmacological treatment for T2D 19-21.CONFIDENTIAL"

It is structurally similar to liraglutide (Victoza®), an once-daily GLP-1 RA developed by Novo Nordisk and approved worldwide for the treatment of T2D. The extended half-life of the semaglutide molecule is primarily obtained due to increased albumin binding, which is facilitated by a large fatty acid derived chemical moiety attached to the lysine in position 26. The specific modifications in the molecule are22: 1) a modification in position 8 (alanine to 2-aminoisobutyric acid) of the peptide backbone to increase stability against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), and a change in position 34 from a lysine to an arginine to limit the options for acylation to the one remaining lysine in the sequence; 2) a large hydrophilic spacer between the lysine in position 26 and the gamma glutamate whereto the fatty acid is attached; 3) a C18 fatty di- acid with a terminal acidic group 22, 23. The spacer and the fatty acid both contribute to increased albumin binding, which slows the degradation of semaglutide in plasma and results in decreased renal clearance prolonging the half-life of semaglutide to around 1 week, making it suitable for once-weekly s.c. administration. 3.1.4 Nonclinical data - semaglutide The nonclinical programme for semaglutide was designed according to the ICH M324guideline to support the clinical development. The standard nonclinical data package required to support phase 3 clinical trials has been completed. In addition, 2-year carcinogenicity studies and a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study have been completed. Semaglutide is generally well tolerated with expected GLP-1 effects on food intake and body weight being dose limiting in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Two potential safety issues have been identified and are detailed below. Thyroid C-cell tumours in rodents Thyroid C-cell neoplasia was seen in mice and rat 2-year carcinogenicity studies. Proliferative C-cell changes in rodents are a known effect following GLP-1 receptor activation by GLP-1 RA. The finding in rodents is caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. As the GLP-1 receptor is not expressed in the normal human thyroid the risk of GLP-1 receptor mediated C-cell changes in humans is considered to be low 25. C-cell neoplasia corresponds to medullary thyroid carcinoma in humans, which has not been reported in the completed phase 3a clinical trials. Embryo−foetal development toxicity In rats, semaglutide adversely affected embryo-foetal development, causing foetal mortality, reduced growth, and skeletal and visceral malformations. More specifically, the embryo −foetal CONFIDENTIAL"

However, this mechanism is not likely to be of relevance to humans due to the fact that in primates, the yolk sac does not invert to fully enclose the embryo. So it does not come in direct contact with the uterine wall to form a placenta as it does in rodents. In rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys, pregnancy losses and foetal abnormalities were observed at exposures below (rabbit) or 3–5 fold above (monkey) the maximum recommended human dose. These observations might be either incidental or related to the reduced maternal body weight, but a direct effect of semaglutide for subcutaneous administration could not be excluded. A comprehensive review of results from the nonclinical studies can be found in the current edition of semaglutide for subcutaneous administration (NN9535) investigator’s brochure (IB)26, or any updates hereof. 3.1.5 Clinical data – semaglutide More than 4,500 subjects have been exposed to once-weekly s.c. semaglutide in the 16 clinical pharmacology trials, the phase 2 trial and the 8 phase 3a trials completed so far (please see the current edition of the IB for s.c. administration of semaglutide (NN9535), or any updates thereto for details26). Clinical pharmacology trials were conducted in healthy subjects, in subjects with T2D, in subjects with obesity and in subjects with renal- and hepatic impairment. Semaglutide phase 3a programme evaluated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in a broad T2D population and covered the continuum of T2D care. The programme evaluated mono- and combination therapy with anti- diabetic therapies and compared semaglutide with the most important comparators at the time of initiating the phase 3a programme. In addition, the phase 3a programme included a long-term (104- week) cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial in a T2D population at high risk of CV events. Pharmacokinetics The results from the completed clinical pharmacology trials confirm that semaglutide has pharmacokinetic properties compatible with once-weekly administration, with a median time to maximum concentration (tmax) of 1 −3 days post dosing and a t½ of around 1 week. Overall, the pharmacokinetics properties of semaglutide appear comparable between healthy subjects, subjects with T2D and subjects with renal failure. Results from drug-drug-interaction studies with warfarin, metformin, atorvastatin and digoxin indicate that no dose adjustment of the co-administered drugs is warranted when administered together with semaglutide. In addition, semaglutide does not decrease the exposure of oral contraceptives and hence, is not anticipated to decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.CONFIDENTIAL"

The weight loss observed with semaglutide was primarily from fat tissue and was considered to be explained by lowered appetite, both in the fasting and postprandial state, and lowered energy intake. In addition, semaglutide improved control of eating and reduced food cravings. Similar to other GLP-1 RA, semaglutide caused a minor delay of early postprandial gastric emptying. Both as monotherapy and as combination therapy, semaglutide significantly reduced glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c)and body weight in all phase 3a trials when compared with the trial-specific comparator, including the active comparators sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin glargine. In the 5 global phase 3a trials (3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627), reductions in HbA 1cand body weight of up to 1.85%-point and 6.42 kg, respectively, were obtained with semaglutide 1.0 mg. Significantly more subjects with semaglutide versus comparators reached the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)-defined treatment target of an HbA 1c <7% and ≤6.5%, respectively, and weight loss responses of ≥5% and ≥10%. The superior and clinically relevant beneficial effects of semaglutide on glycaemic control as estimated by HbA 1c were substantiated by improvements in secondary glycaemia-related supportive endpoints27-30. Safety Data from the 6 global phase 3a clinical trials (3623, 3624, 3625, 3626, 3627, 3744) showed that the safety and tolerability of semaglutide at doses up to 1.0 mg per week and administered for up to 56 weeks of treatment were consistent with other GLP-1 RAs. The most frequent AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation were nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. The escalation regimen utilized was associated with good tolerability and low numbers of discontinuation due to AEs. Hypoglycaemia occurred infrequently in subjects receiving semaglutide and the events were mainly non-severe. No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were observed when semaglutide was used as monotherapy. Hypoglycaemic episodes have most frequently been observed when semaglutide is combined with sulphonylurea (SU) or insulin. In line with findings for other GLP-1 RAs, an increase in pulse rate and serum levels of lipase and amylase has also been observed in subjects exposed to semaglutide. As with all protein based pharmaceuticals, subjects treated with semaglutide may develop immunogenic and allergic reactions. However, only few subjects administered semaglutide experienced allergic reactions and injection site reactions. These have mainly been mild and transient of nature; however, more generalised reactions may occur. The effect of semaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke) versus placebo was evaluated in a T2D population at high risk for CV events, in the CV outcomes trial, SUSTAIN 6 (NN9535-3744)31.

Moreover, semaglutide significantly reduced the risk of MACEs by 26% vs placebo32. The overall safety profile of semaglutide in the SUSTAIN 6 trial was consistent with previous semaglutide clinical trials. However, in this trial, there was a higher frequency of confirmed events of diabetic retinopathy complications in semaglutide-treated subjects compared with placebo. Further details will soon be available in the semaglutide s.c. (NN9535) IB edition 12. 3.1.6 Liraglutide The selected active comparator in this trial is liraglutide, an injectable once-daily human GLP-1 RA developed by Novo Nordisk and approved for the treatment of T2D in the European Union, US and Japan under the brand name Victoza ®. Victoza® was first approved for marketing in the EU on 30 Jun 2009. Up until 30 Jun 2016, Victoza® has been approved in 106 countries and launched in 81 countries worldwide, including the major countries/regions Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, EU, Japan, Mexico and the U.S. In the EU, Victoza® is indicated for the treatment of adults with T2D to achieve glycaemic control in combination with oral glucose-lowering medicinal products and/or basal insulin when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control. For further details, please see the current EU summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Victoza ®33. For an assessment of benefits and risks of the trial (see Section 18.1). 3.2 Rationale for the trial The current available treatment modalities for T2D are still not satisfactory, as a large proportion of patients do not reach their HbA 1ctreatment targets. Furthermore, there is a segment of patients, who either has difficulties adhering to once-daily treatments, or has a wish for more convenient treatment regimens such as once-weekly treatments. Liraglutide and semaglutide are both human GLP-1 RAs with a prolonged half-life compared to native GLP-1, making them suitable for once-daily and once-weekly s.c. injections, respectively. Based on the phase 3a results, semaglutide is expected to be marketed with two treatment doses (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg). Dose-dependent reductions in both HbA 1cand body weight were observed in these trials with significantly more patient reaching treatment targets of HbA 1c< 7% and ≤6.5% with semaglutide 1.0 mg compared with semaglutide 0.5 mg. Hence, 1.0 mg is expected to be the most frequently used dose when semaglutide is marketed. For liraglutide (Victoza®)), 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg are approved treatment doses for treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, in most European countries CONFIDENTIAL"

The treatment period will be 30 weeks to ensure adequate time to compare the full effect of both treatments on glycaemic control and body weight. The reason for designing the trial as an open- label trial is to enable comparison of patient satisfaction with once-weekly versus once-daily administration and to limit the number of injections in participating subjects. The follow-up period is 5 weeks to allow for wash-out of semaglutide. 5.3 Treatment of subjects Treatment of subjects is summarised schematically in Table 5–1 . Semaglutide will be administered once-weekly and liraglutide once-daily, both as s.c. injections. After randomisation, all subjects will follow a fixed dose escalation for semaglutide and liraglutide. The maintenance dose of 1.0 mg for semaglutide will be reached after an 8-week escalation period. This period will consist of 4 doses (4 weeks) of 0.25 mg, followed by 4 doses (4 weeks) of 0.5 mg, while the period of maintenance will be 22 weeks. Thus, a total treatment duration of 30 weeks. The maintenance daily dose of 1.2 mg for liraglutide will be reached after 1 week of 0.6 mg daily dosing. In case of unacceptable gastrointestinal AEs, escalation from 0.6 mg to 1.2 mg of liraglutide can be extended over 2 weeks at the discretion of the investigator. CONFIDENTIAL"

Should not exceed the maximum approved dose in the individual country 5.4 Injection site Semaglutide and liraglutide are administered s.c. by injections in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm, any time of the day and irrespective of meals. Injections should not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. For semaglutide, injections should be administered once weekly on the same weekday. For liraglutide, injections should be administered daily and the time of injection is recommended to be consistent from one day to another. 5.5 Missed dose Semaglutide If a semaglutide dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as noticed, provided the time to the next scheduled dose is at least 2 days (48 hours). If a dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days (48 hours) away, the subject should not administer the missed dose but rather wait for the next scheduled dose. A missed dose should not affect the scheduled dosing day of the week. Liraglutide If a liraglutide dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as noticed; however, if it is more than 12 hours since subject should have taken liraglutide, the missed dose should be skipped, and next dose should be taken as usual the following day. 5.6 Treatment after discontinuation of trial product When discontinuing trial products, either at the scheduled end of treatment visit (V9) or if trial product is discontinued prematurely, the subject should be switched to a suitable marketed product at the discretion of the investigator. The long half-life of semaglutide must be taken into consideration when selecting anti-diabetic treatment after discontinuation of trial product. 5.7 Rationale for treatment Semaglutide has been developed for s.c. administration. A three dose level escalation of semaglutide (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg), has been chosen based on data from the phase 2 dose-finding trial (NN9535-1821)22. This regimen has shown a good benefit-risk profile across the phase 3a programme26. Liraglutide is approved for the treatment of T2D in doses of 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg. As the 1.2 mg daily dose is currently used as part of standard-of-care in most European countries, a two dose level escalation from 0.6 mg to 1.2 mg daily is needed34 35.CONFIDENTIAL"

If any of the FPG values (including protocol scheduled fasting SMPG) exceed the limits outlined below and no intercurrent cause of the hyperglycaemia can be identified, the subject must be called in for a confirmatory FPG (at central laboratory): !FPG > 13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dl) from week 8 (V5) to end of week 15 (up until V7) !FPG > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dl) from week 16 (V7) to end of treatment If the confirmatory FPG also exceeds the value described above, the subject should be offered rescue medication (i.e. intensification of anti-diabetic background medication and/or initiation of new anti-diabetic medication) It is important for trial integrity that only subjects actually needing treatment intensification (as defined above) are started on rescue medication. These subjects should continue to follow the protocol-specified visit schedule. Rescue medication should be prescribed at the investigator’s discretion as add-on to the randomised treatment and according to ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes guidelines37, 38(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). Please note, that for subjects randomised to liraglutide, the dose of 1.2 mg must not be exceeded and if rescue medication is needed in these subjects, another anti-diabetic agent must be added or the dose of existing background therapy increased, at the investigator's discretion. The long half-life of semaglutide must be taken into consideration when prescribing rescue medication. Considerations regarding rescue medication should be documented in the medical records and rescue medication and any changes hereto should be captured on the concomitant medication form in the electronic case report form (eCRF) (see Section 8.2.4 ). Rescue medication is considered to be NIMP and will not be provided by Novo Nordisk. 6.5 Criteria for premature discontinuation of trial product All efforts should be made to keep the subject on trial product.CONFIDENTIAL"

If so, all efforts must be made to ensure the subjects attend and complete all scheduled visit procedures. Subjects should stay in the trial irrespective of lack of adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule or missing assessments. Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial will be considered as withdrawn from the trial (see Section 6.6). The subject must be prematurely discontinued from trial product, if one of the following applies: 1. Included in the trial in violation of the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria 2. Safety concern related to trial product or unacceptable intolerability at the discretion of the investigator. 3. Pregnancy. 4. Intention of becoming pregnant. 5. Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial of an approved or non-approved. investigational medicinal product. 6. Calcitonin ≥100 ng/L (see Appendix A ). The primary reason for premature discontinuation of trial product must be specified in the eCRF. If a criterion for premature discontinuation of trial product is met, trial product should not be re- initiated but subjects should continue with the protocol-specified visit schedule. See Section 8.1.4 for procedures to be performed for subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely. 6.6 Withdrawal from trial The subject may withdraw consent at will at any time. The subject’s request to withdraw from the trial must always be respected. Only subjects who withdraw consent should be considered as withdrawn from trial. See Section 8.1.5 for procedures to be performed for subjects withdrawing consent. 6.7 Subject replacement Subjects who discontinue trial product prematurely will not be replaced. 6.8 Rationale for trial population The trial population will include subjects treated with stable doses of 1 −3 OAD(s) (see Section 5.3.2 ) for at least 90 days prior to screening.

Primary Completion Date is the last assessment of the primary endpoint, and is for this protocol LSFV + 32 weeks corresponding to V9. If the last subject is withdrawn/dropout early the Primary Completion Date is the date when the last subject would have completed V9. The Primary Completion Date determines the deadline for results disclosure at Clinicaltrials.gov according to FDAAA. 8 Methods and assessments 8.1 Visit procedures Timing of assessments and procedures are specified in the flow chart (see Section 2). This section includes a description of these assessments and procedures. Informed consent must be obtained before any trial related activity (see Section 18.3). 8.1.1 Investigator site log The investigator must keep a subject screening log, a subject identification code list and a subject enrolment log. Only subjects who have signed the informed consent form should be included on the logs. The subject screening log and subject enrolment log may be combined in one log. In addition, the investigator must keep a log of staff and a delegation of task(s) list at the trial site. Investigator must sign the log of staff and the delegation of task(s) at the trial site prior to the delegation of tasks. 8.1.2 Screening, visit 1 At screening, subjects will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a trial and giving contact address(es) and telephone number(s) of relevant trial site staff. Subjects should be instructed to return the card to the investigator at the last trial visit or to destroy the card after the last visit. Each subject will be assigned a unique 6-digit subject number which will remain the same throughout the trial. Screening failures: For screening failures the screening failure form in the electronic case report form (eCRF) must be completed with the reason for not continuing in the trial. Serious adverse events (SAEs) from screening failures must be transcribed by the investigator into the eCRF. Follow-up on SAEs must be carried out according to Section 12.CONFIDENTIAL"

Re-screening is NOT allowed if the subject has failed one of the inclusion or exclusion criteria; this includes re-sampling if the subject has failed one of the inclusion or exclusion criteria related to laboratory parameters. 8.1.3 Fasting visits The subjects should attend site visits in a fasting state (see Section 2). Fasting is defined as having consumed only water within the last 6 hours prior to the visit. If the subject does not attend the visit in a fasting state, the subject should be asked to attend a re- scheduled visit within the visit window to have the fasting assessments performed. Glucose lowering agents and trial product should not be taken until after blood sampling has been performed but other prescribed medication should be taken according to prescription. 8.1.4 Premature discontinuation of trial product If a subject prematurely discontinues trial product, the investigator must undertake procedures described for V9A as soon as possible (preferably the same day), which are similar to those at V9. Phone contact 10A should be scheduled at least 5 weeks after the last date on trial product. If premature discontinuation of trial product is decided during a scheduled visit, the visit will be converted into a V9A and trial procedures must be performed accordingly. Subjects should continue with the originally scheduled site contacts after P10A and up to and including P10. If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after P10A. However, all attempts should be made to ensure that V9 is performed as a site visit and includes all planned assessments. In summary, subjects should stay in the trial irrespective of lack of adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule, missing assessments or premature trial product discontinuation for any reason. Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial should be considered as withdrawn from the trial (for withdrawal procedures see Section 8.1.5 ). The primary reason for premature discontinuation of trial product must be specified in the end-of- treatment form in the eCRF, and final drug accountability must be performed. A treatment discontinuation session must be made in the IWRS at V9A (see Section 10).CONFIDENTIAL"

If a subject has already prematurely discontinued from trial product and previously attended V9A and P10A, no further visits should be attended. For withdrawn subjects the end-of-trial form and end-of-treatment form must be completed, including the primary reason for premature discontinuation of trial product, and final drug accountability must be performed even if the subject is not able to come to the trial site. A premature treatment discontinuation session must be made in the IWRS, if not already done due to prior discontinuation from trial product. The case book must be signed. Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing consent, the investigator must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject’s rights. 8.1.6 Investigator assessment Review of diaries, patient reported outcomes questionnaire (PROs), laboratory reports, ECGs, eye and physical examinations must be documented with the dated signature of the investigator or delegated trial staff, either on the front page of the documents and/or in subject's medical record. The signed documents must be retained at the trial site as source documentation. For physical examinations, ECGs, and fundus photography/dilated fundoscopythe evaluations must follow the categories: !Normal !Abnormal oWas the result clinically significant (No/Yes) In case of abnormal clinical significant findings found as a result of screening procedures conducted at visit 1 or assessments revealing baseline conditions at visit 2, the investigator or delegate must state a comment in the subject’s medical record and record this in the concomitant illness form in the eCRF. At subsequent visits, any clinically significant changes or new clinically significant findings must be reported as an AE according to Section 12. Investigator or trial site staff must review the diary and the PROs to ensure that AEs, including overall change in health and concomitant medication, are reported. If clarification of entries or discrepancies in the diary or the PROs is needed, the subject must be questioned and a conclusion made in the subject’s medical record.

The investigator must document any attempt to obtain external medical information by noting the date(s) when information was requested and who has been contacted. 8.2.4 Concomitant medication A concomitant medication is any medication, other than the trial products, which is taken during the trial, including the screening and follow-up periods. Changes in concomitant medication, including anti-diabetic treatment, must be recorded at each visit as they occur. The eCRF should be updated accordingly. GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues must not be pre-prescribed as add-on to the randomised treatment. The information collected for each concomitant medication includes: !Trade name or generic name !Primary indication, start date (only start year is applicable if more than one year) and stop date or continuation !Total daily dose (only applicable for anti-diabetic medication) If a change is due to an AE, then this must be reported according to Section 12.

Body weight should be measured in kilogram (kg), with one decimal, without shoes and only wearing light clothing. BMI = body weight (kg)/(height (m) x height (m)) [kg/m2 = lb/in2x 703] and will be calculated in the eCRF every time the weight is measured. 8.3.2 Waist circumference The waist circumference is defined as the minimal abdominal circumference located midway between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest and will be measured using a non-stretchable measuring tape. The measurement of waist circumference should be performed and recorded in the eCRF to the nearest ½ cm using the same measuring tape throughout the trial. The waist circumference should be measured in a standing position with an empty bladder and wearing light clothing with accessible waist. The subject should be standing with arms down their side and feet together. The tape should touch the skin but not compress soft tissue. The subject should be asked to breathe normally and the measurement should be taken when the subject is breathing out gently. 8.3.3 Blood pressure and pulse rate Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate (beats per minute) should be measured in a sitting position after the subject has been resting for at least 5 minutes and by using standard clinical practice at the trial site.

The BG meters use test strips calibrated to plasma values. Therefore, all measurements performed with capillary blood are automatically calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose values, which will be shown on the display. Only the BG meter provided by Novo Nordisk must be used for the measurements required. Subjects should be instructed in how to record the results of the SMPGs in the diaries. The record of each SMPG should include date, time and value. All data from the diary must be transcribed into the eCRF during or following the contact. Occasional review by the investigator of the values stored in the memory of the BG meter and correct reporting of these in the diary is advised in order to ensure adequacy of the data reported in the trial database. 8.3.5 7-point self-measured plasma glucose profile The subject will be asked to perform a 7-point SMPG profile, preferably within one week prior to site visit according to the flow chart, on days where the subject does not anticipate unusual strenuous exercise.

It is allowed to perform the baseline ECG between the screening visit and the randomisation visit. The results must be available prior to randomisation. An ECG performed for any reason unrelated to this trial within 7 days prior to the screening visit is acceptable provided no clinical symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease have occurred in the meantime. If the ECG was performed as a part of routine clinical practice on/before the date when the subject has signed the informed consent, it must be documented in the medical records that the reason for performing the procedure is not related to this trial. 8.4.3 Eye examination Fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy will be performed as per flow chart (see Section 2) by the investigator or according to local practise. Fundoscopy requires pharmacological dilation of both pupils. Results of the fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy will be interpreted by the investigator (see Section 8.1.6 ). Relevant findings as a result of the screening procedure must be recorded as concomitant illness/medical history or as diabetes history/diabetes complication in accordance with Section 8.2.3 . If the fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy has been performed within 90 days prior to randomisation, the procedure does not need to be repeated, unless worsening of visual function since the last examination. If the subject did not have fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed within 90 days prior to randomisation, such examination must be performed by the investigator or other qualified health care professional according to local practice. The results must be available prior to randomisation. If the applicable fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy was performed before the subject signed the informed consent form, it must be documented in the medical records that the reason for performing the examination was not related to this trial. In addition, fundus photography/dilated fundoscopy must be performed at V9 or 5 weeks prior to this. Results should be available at V9. In the case of premature discontinuation, fundus photography/dilated fundoscopy must be performed both at V9A and at V9.

All information must be transc ribed into the eCRF (hypoglycaemic episode form) throughout the trial. For Novo Nordisk classification of hypoglycaemia, see Section 17.5.2.2 .Upon onset of a hypoglycaemic episode the subject is recommended to measure plasma glucose every 15 minutes until the SMPG value is >3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved in accordance to current guidelines44. A SMPG value ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or hypoglycaemic sympto ms should be recorded in the diary in the hypoglycaemic episode form by the subject. Repeated SMPG measurements and/or symptoms, will by default be considered as one hypoglycaemic episode until a succeeding SMPG value is >3.9 mmol/dL (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved.

Low SMPG values for non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes not having a hypoglycaemic episode form completed within 7 days since the SMPG measurement should be reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form with as much information as possible. Novo Nordisk will not query for additional data except for the start date, SMPG value and whether the subject was able to self- treat due to decreased validity of such data45, 46. The subject must be re-trained in how to report hypoglycaemic episodes if th e investigator identifies low SMPG values not reported as hypoglycaemic episodes. If the hypoglycaemic episode fulfils the criteria for an SAE then an AE form and a safety information form must also be filled in (see Section 12). 8.5 Laboratory assessments The laboratory assessments will be performed by a central laboratory. The central laboratory may utilise sub-contractors. Descriptions of assay methods, laboratory supplies and procedures for collecting, handling, storage and shipping of samples, will be described in the laboratory manual provided by the central laboratory. Subjects will be asked to attend the site visits fasting for samples, except for screening samples (see Sections 2and8.1.3 ). Laboratory samples not drawn on the day of the actual visit should preferably be drawn on another day within the visit window stated in the flow chart. Laboratory results will be sent by the central laboratory to the investigator on an on-going basis and the investigator must review all laboratory results for signs of concomitant illness and AEs and report these according to this protocol according to Section 8.2.3 and Section 12. The laboratory provides results to the trial sites in the units preferred by the trial sites while the results that are transferred to the trial database will be in SI units. The laboratory equipment may provide analyses not requested in the protocol but produced automatically in connection with the requested analyses according to specifications in the laboratory standard operating procedures. Such data will not be transferred to the trial database, but abnormal values will be reported to the investigator. Only laboratory samples specified in the protocol must be sent to the central laboratory for analysis. All laboratory samples will be destroyed at latest at the completion of the clinical trial report or according to local regulations.CONFIDENTIAL"

An AE includes: !A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. !A clinical laboratory adverse event: a clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. The following should not be reported as AEs: !Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product (pre-existing conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). !Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. !Non-serious hypoglycaemia is an AE, but is reported on a hypogl ycaemic episode form instead of on an AE form (see Section 8.4.5 ). The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE: !Severity –Mild – no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Moderate – marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Severe – considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities; unacceptable. !Causality Relationship between an AE and the relevant trial product(s): –Probable - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. –Possible - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. –Unlikely - The event is most likely related to aetiology other than the trial product. !Final outcome –Recovered/resolved - The subject has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial-related activity after the subject signed the informed consent. –Recovering/resolving - The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event.

If a sequela meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. –Not recovered/not resolved - The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. –Fatal - This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. –Unknown - This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. 12.1.2 Serious adverse event A SAE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: !Death. !A life-threateningaexperience. !In-patient hospitalisationbor prolongation of existing hospitalisation. !A persistent or significant disability or incapacityc. !A congenital anomaly or birth defect. !Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threateningaor require hospitalisationbmay be considered an SAE when - based on appropriate medical judgement - they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAEd. a.The term “life threatening” in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. b.The term “hospitalisation” is used when a subject: – Is admitted to a hospital or in-patient, irrespective of the duration of physical stay, or – Stays at the hospital for treatment or observation for more than 24 hours Medical judgement must always be exercised, and when in doubt, the hospital contact should be regarded as a hospitalisation. Hospitalisations for administrative, trial related and social purposes do not constitute AEs and should therefore not be reported as AEs or SAEs.

The events must be recorded in the applicable eCRF forms in a timely manner, see timelines below and Figure 12–1 . During each contact with the trial site staff, the subject must be asked about AEs and technical complaints, for example by asking: “Have you experienced any problems since the last contact?” All AEs, observed by the investigator or subject, must be reported by the investigator and evaluated. All AEs must be recorded by the investigator on an AE form. The investigator should report the diagnosis, if available. If no diagnosis is available, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs using separate AE forms. For SAEs, a safety information form (SIF) must be completed in addition to the AE form. If several symptoms or diagnoses occur as part of the same clinical picture, one safety information form can be used to describe all the SAEs.

Further guidance can be obtained from the instructions in the CRF. The investigator must ensure that all information is consistent with the source documentation. By electronically signing the case book in the eCRF, the investigator confirms that the information in the eCRF and related forms is complete and correct. 13.1 Corrections to case report forms Corrections to the eCRF data may be made by the investigator or the investigator’s delegated staff. An audit trail will be maintained in the eCRF application containing as a minimum: the old and the new data, identification of the person entering the data, date and time of the entry and reason for the correction. If corrections are made by the investigator’s delegated staff after the date the investigator has signed the case book, the case book must be signed and dated again by the investigator. Corrections to the data in the paper CRFs may only be made by drawing a straight line through the incorrect data and then writing the correct entry next to the data that was crossed out. Each correction must be initialled, dated and explained (if necessary) by the investigator or the investigator’s authorized staff. If corrections are made by the investigator’s delegated staff after the date of the investigator’s signature on the affirmation statement, the affirmation statement must be signed and dated again by the investigator. 13.2 Case report form flow The investigator must ensure that data is recorded in the eCRF as soon as possible, preferably within 5 days after the visit. Once data has been entered, it will be available to Novo Nordisk for data verification and validation purposes. The investigator must ensure that data is recorded as soon as possible after the visit and the phone contact. At the end of the trial the investigator must ensure that all remaining data have been entered into then eCRF no later than 3 days after LPLV at the site in order to ensure the planned lock of the database.

The first monitoring visit will be performed as soon as possible after FSFV at the trial site and no later than 4 weeks after. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the eCRFs, the trial site's recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site to the protocol and GCP, but will not exceed 12 weeks until LSLV at the trial site. The monitor must be given direct access to all source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition the relevant trial site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (e.g. by telephone). All data must be verifiable in source documentation other than the eCRF. For all data recorded the source document must be defined in a source document agreement at each trial site. There must only be one source defined at any time for any data element. Source data generated by the trial site can be corrected by another person than the person entering the source data if accepted by local regulations; any correction must be explained, signed and dated by the person making the correction. The original of the completed diaries and/or PROs must not be removed from the trial site, unless they form part of the CRF/eCRF and a copy is kept at the site. The monitor will ensure that the eCRFs are completed and that paper CRFs are collected. The following data will be source data verified for screening failures : !Date for obtaining informed consent !Reason for screening failure Monitors will review the subject’s medical records and other source data (e.g. the diaries and PROs) to ensure consistency and/or identify omissions compared to the eCRF. If discrepancies are found, the investigator must be questioned about these. A follow-up letter (paper or electronic) will be sent to the investigator following each monitoring visit. This should address any action to be taken.CONFIDENTIAL"

Appropriate measures, including encryption of data files containing person identifiable data, will be used to ensure confidentiality of subject data, when they are transmitted over open networks. Data from central laboratories will be transferred electronically. In cases where data is transferred via non-secure electronic networks, data will be encrypted during transfer. The subject and any biological material obtained from the subject will be identified by subject number and trial ID. Appropriate measures such as encryption or leaving out certain identifiers will be enforced to protect the identity of subjects in all presentations and publications as required by local, regional and national requirements. 16 Computerised systems Novo Nordisk will capture and process clinical data using computerised systems that are described in Novo Nordisk Standard Operating Procedures and IT architecture documentation. The use and control of these systems are documented. Investigators working on the trial may use their own electronic systems to capture source data. 17 Statistical considerations 17.1 General considerations No interim analyses or other analyses of un-blinded data will be performed before the database is locked. If necessary, a statistical analysis plan may be written in addition to the protocol, including a more technical and detailed elaboration of the statistical analyses. The statistical analysis plan will be finalised before database lock. Results from a statistical analysis will be presented by the estimated treatment contrasts at week 30 with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals and p-values corresponding to two-sided tests of no difference if not otherwise specified. The comparison presented from a statistical analysis will be semaglutide 1.0 mg versus liraglutide 1.2 mg. If no statistical analysis is specified, data will be presented using relevant summary statistics.CONFIDENTIAL"

Accordingly, only data collected prior to discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication will be used to draw inference. This will avoid confounding from rescue medication. 17.1.2 Missing data considerations at week 30 The overall rate of missing data at week 30 is expected to be not more than 10% based on the rate of subjects with measurements of the primary and the confirmatory secondary endpoints in the s.c. semaglutide phase 3a clinical development programme. The frequency and reasons of missing data is expected to be similar in the semaglutide and the liraglutide groups. When estimating the primary estimand, the combined rate of missing data and, subjects discontinuing treatment prematurely or initiating rescue medication on top of trial product, is expected to be maximum 20%. This is based on the results from the s.c. semaglutide phase 3a clinical development programme. Based on these data, premature treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal adverse events is expected to be low. Other possible reasons for premature discontinuing treatment are assumed to be unrelated to treatment and to therefore occur at similar rates between the two treatment groups. Thus, overall, the frequency of missing data or data not used at week 30 in the primary analysis is expected to be similar between the treatment groups. To document the extent and reason(s) for missing data, descriptive summaries and graphical representation of extent, reason(s) for and pattern of missing data for the primary and secondary endpoints will be presented by treatment group. 17.1.3 Confirmatory hypotheses The mean treatment difference is defined as μ = (semaglutide minus liraglutide). Three confirmatory hypotheses are to be tested: 1. HbA 1c non-inferiority of semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. liraglutide 1.2 mg with a non-inferiority margin of 0.3CONFIDENTIAL"

HbA 1c superiority of semaglutide 1.0 mg vs.liraglutide 1.2 mg !H0: μ ≥0.0%-point against Ha: μ < 0.0%-point The non-inferiority margin of 0.3 is chosen based on the diabetes guideline48, 49. The effect of liraglutide was investigated in various trials including the LEAD programme that included a series of six randomised controlled phase 3 trials. In these trials, a substantial and sustained reduction in HbA1c was obtained with liraglutide treatment across the continuum of care in patients with type 2 diabetes50. Based on the Lead 1 & Lead 4 studies, Liraglutide 1.2 mg showed HbA1c treatment difference to placebo of -1.3%51and -0.9%52respectively. Hence, based on these trials, and considering the LEAD programme results collectively that assures the effect of liraglutide, the chosen non-inferiority margin of 0.3 provides assurance that semaglutide has an effect greater than 0 with a clinically relevant size.With regards to the constancy assumption, controlled clinical trials have consistently established that liraglutide is an effective anti-diabetic drug. Therefore, lack of trial sensitivity with liraglutide as comparator is not anticipated to be an issue in this trial. 17.1.4 Multiplicity and criteria for confirming hypotheses The Type-I error rate for testing the three confirmatory hypotheses related to the HbA1c and body weight endpoints will be preserved in the strong sense at an overall alpha ( α) level of 2.5% using the closed testing procedure described in Bretz et al. The overall α-level of 2.5% is initially allocated to the HbA1c non-inferiority test. For this hypothesis, and in general, if a hypothesis is confirmed the local α-level (α-local) will be reallocated according to the weight and the direction of the edges going from the confirmed hypothesis to the next hypotheses as specified in Figure 17–1 .

Since some of these tests are positively correlated, the assumption of independence is viewed as conservative. With the above assumptions, allocating 288 subjects to each of the semaglutide and liraglutide groups (576 subjects in total) provides at least 90% power to reject all three confirmatory hypotheses and thus confirm HbA 1c superiority and body weight superiority of semaglutide vs. liraglutide across efficacy and in-trial assumptions.

The in-trial observation period starts at randomisation (as registered in IWRS) and ends at the date of: !The last direct subject-site contact, which is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after planned last dose of trial product at a follow-up visit (phone visit) !Withdrawal for subjects who withdraw their informed consent !The last subject-investigator contact as defined by the investigator for subjects who are lost to follow-up !Death for subjects who dies before any of the above For subjects not randomised but exposed to trial product the in-trial period starts at the date of first dose of trial product. On-treatment: This observation period represents the time period where subjects are considered exposed to trial product. The observation period is a sub-set of the in-trial observation period. It starts at the date of first dose of trial product. Two slightly different end dates will be needed to cover all assessments appropriately according to th e flow chart. For AEs including hypoglycaemic episodes, the observation period ends at the first date of any of the following: !The follow-up visit (P10) !The premature discontinuation follow-up visit (P10A) !The last date on trial product + 42 days !The end-date for the in-trial observation period The follow-up visit is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after the last date on trial product corresponding to approximately five half-lives of s.c. semaglutide. The visit window for the follow- up visit is + 7 days, which is the reason for the 42 days specified in the bullet above. Hence, for AEs including hypoglycaemic episodes, this period reflects the period in which subjects are exposed. For efficacy and other safety assessments (laboratory assessments, physical examination and vital signs) the observation period ends at the last date on trial product with a visit window of + 7 days. This ascertainment window corresponds to the dosing interval and will be used to avoid attenuation of a potential treatment effect on endpoints for which the effect is reversible shortly after treatment CONFIDENTIAL"

Hence, for those assessments this period reflects the period in which subjects are treated. On-treatment without rescue medication: This observation period is a sub-set of the on-treatment observation period, where subjects are considered treated with trial product, but have not initiated rescue medication. Specifically, the period starts at the date of first dose of trial product and ends at the first date of any of the following: !The last dose of trial product with a visit window of +7 days !Initiation of rescue medication The ’on-treatment without rescue medication’ observation period will be the primary observation period for efficacy evaluations. The in-trial observation period will be considered supportive for efficacy evaluation. Safety will be evaluated based on the in-trial and the on-treatment observation periods unless otherwise specified. Data points collected outside an observation period will be treated as missing in the analysis. Baseline data will always be included in an observation period. Before data are locked for statistical analysis, a review of all data will take place. Any decision to exclude either a subject or single observations from the statistical analysis is the joint responsibility of the members of the Novo Nordisk study group. Exclusion of data from analyses will be used restrictively and normally no data should be excluded from the FAS. The subjects or observations to be excluded, and the reasons for their exclusion will be documented and signed by those responsible before database lock. The subjects and observations excluded from analysis sets, and the reason for this, will be described in the clinical trial report. 17.3.2 Data transformations A number of the continuous parameters will be log-transformed prior to statistical analysis. The output tables and figures will show the results of the analysis back-transformed to the original scale, implying that log-treatment-differences are reported as treatment ratios. Confidence intervals for the treatment ratios will be calculated as exponentiated upper and lower limits for log-treatment difference confidence intervals. The standard errors of the back-transformed mean and ratio to baseline estimates are also provided; these SEs are calculated using the delta-method (first order Taylor approximation), whereby the SE on the original scale is calculated as the product of the SE on log-scale and the exponentiated estimate of the mean (geometric mean).

Missing data will be imputed using the same approach as described for the primary analysis of the primary estimand. However the imputation will be done within the same group defined not only by the randomised treatment (semaglutide/ liraglutide) but also by the status of treatment completion (still on randomised treatment at week 30 yes/no) (4 groups in total). It is hereby assumed that the likely values of what the missing data would have been if available are best described by information from subjects who at week 30 are similar in terms of randomised treatment and treatment completion status.

The sections below describe the risks and precautions associated with semaglutide and liraglutide. These are based on findings in nonclinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs including liraglutide. For each of these risks and precautions, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported AEs in clinical trials with semaglutide and liraglutide have been gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, constipation, dyspepsia, gastritis, gastro oesophageal reflux disease, eructation and flatulence). Clinical trials have indicated that a low starting dose and gradual dose escalation mitigates the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Consequently, a low starting dose and dose escalation steps have been implemented in the trial. Gallstones Events of gallstones (cholelithiasis) have been reported from clinical trials both with semaglutide and with liraglitide. These events may lead to hospitalisation and removal of the gallbladder. If cholelithiasis is suspected appropriate clinical follow-up should be initiated at the investigator’s discretion.CONFIDENTIAL"

The risk of h ypoglycaemia can be lowered by reducing the dose of SU or insulin when initiating treatment with semaglutide/liraglutide. Allergic reactions and injection site reaction As in the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, treatment with semaglutide or liraglutide may evoke allergic reactions. These may include localized injection site reactions or generalized reactions, including urticaria, rash, and pruritus as well as anaphylactic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, subjects will be instructed to contact the site staff as soon as possible for further guidance if suspicion of a hypersensitivity reaction to the trial product occurs. Acute renal impairment In subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs, gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may lead to significant dehydration and secondary renal impairment and acute renal failure. Subjects with gastrointestinal AEs are recommended to drink plenty of fluids to avoid volume depletion. Also, serum creatinine and other markers of kidney function will be monitored throughout the trial. SGLT-2 inhibitors, a background medication in this trial, have also been associated with volume depletion. It is recommended to monitor renal function and for signs and symptoms of fluid loss during therapy. Severe dehydration may be a risk factor for ketoacidosis. Impaired renal function may increase the risk of metformin associated lactic acidosis when GLP-1 RAs are co-administered with metformin. As a precaution, serum creatinine will be measured regularly. In subjects treated with metformin who experience prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, the investigator should monitor serum creatinine, and if clinically indicated, withhold metformin until resolution of renal dysfunction. The use of the background medication should be in accordance with the current, approved labels. Medullary thyroid cancer The human relevance of the proliferative C-cell changes found in rodents treated with GLP-1 RAs is unknown, but data suggest that rodents are more sensitive to the mode of action of GLP-1 RAs for induction of C-cell tumours. However, as a precaution, subjects with a family or personal history of multiple endocrine neoplasticity 2 or Medullary thyroid cancer will not be enrolled in the trial. During the trial, calcitonin will be measured on V2, V7 and V9, and the guidance for investigators on further evaluation and action on elevated calcitonin concentrations is included in Appendix A .

Several studies have, however, documented long-term beneficial effects of intensive glycaemic treatment in reducing retinopathy progression59 60even in intensively treated patients who experienced early worsening61. In a 2-year cardiovascular outcomes trial with semaglutide, results showed an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo, albeit the proportion of subjects with an EAC-confirmed event of diabetic retinopathy complications was low (semaglutide: 3%; placebo: 1.8%). As a precaution in this trial, all subjects are required to have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed before enrolment into the trial; moreover, subjects with proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment will be excluded. As part of good diabetes management the investigator is encouraged to ensure adequate monitoring and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in subjects enrolled into the trial 62. Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs, including semaglutide and liraglutide. As a precaution, subjects with a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. Also, subjects will be informed about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and serum levels of lipase and amylase will be monitored throughout the trial. Pancreatic cancer While patients with T2D have an increased risk of certain types of cancer such as pancreatic cancer there is currently no support from nonclinical studies or clinical trials or post marketing data that GLP-1-based therapies increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1 RAs by EMA. Other risks Patients treated with semaglutide or liraglutide may also experience increased heart rate, increase lipase and amylase, fatigue, decreased appetite, headache, upper respiratory tract infections , malaise and cholecystitis. 18.1.2 Other safety considerations Teratogenicity (embryo-foetal development toxicity) Please see Section 3.1.4 for information on embryo −foetal development toxicity.

There are also strict glycaemic rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial (see Section 6.4). If rescue medication is required, it should be in accordance with ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes37, 38(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care according to the principles outlined in Diabetes Care 2017 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes62. Further details with regards to safety of trial product are described in the current edition of the IB for semaglutide (NN9535) 26or any updates thereto. Safety information on liraglutide can be found in the current SmPC for Victoza®33 18.1.3 Benefits In this trial, subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 manner to either semaglutide s.c 1.0 mg once-weekly or liraglutide s.c 1.2 mg once-daily as add-on to their current background medication with 1−3 OADs (metformin, SU, SGLT-2 inhibitors). Subjects will therefore be treated with a regimen anticipated to be better than the treatment they receive at the time of entry into the trial. Based on the results of the phase 3a trials, semaglutide is expected to provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight in subjects with T2D. Similarly, treatment with liraglutide is expected to provide significant improvements in glycaemic control. In addition, it is expected that all subjects will benefit from participation through close contact with the study site, with close follow-up of their T2D and a careful medical examination, all of which will most likely result in an intensified management of their T2D. All subjects in this trial will receive trial products and auxiliary supplies free of charge. 18.1.4 Risk and benefit conclusion The safety profile for semaglutide generated from the clinical and nonclinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of semaglutide in accordance with the planned clinical trial. The phase 3a results indicate that semaglutide will provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight.

The investigator and/or Novo Nordisk must also promptly inform the regulatory authorities and IECs and provide a detailed written explanation. If, after the termination of the trial, the benefit-risk analysis changes, the new evaluation must be provided to the IECs in case it has an impact on the planned follow-up of subjects who have participated in the trial. If it has an impact, the actions needed to inform and protect the subjects should be described. 19 Protocol compliance 19.1 Protocol deviations Deviations from the protocol should be avoided. If deviations do occur, the investigator must inform the monitor and the implications of the deviation must be reviewed and discussed. Deviations must be documented and explained in a protocol deviation by stating the reason, date, and the action(s) taken. Some deviations, for which corrections are not possible, can be acknowledged and confirmed via edit checks in the eCRF. Documentation on protocol deviations must be kept in the investigator trial master file and sponsor trial master file. 19.2 Prevention of missing data The importance of subject retention will be addressed by Novo Nordisk in the training and communication with the trial sites.

Close surveillance of subject retention will be performed throughout the trial by Novo Nordisk with focus on reasons for premature discontinuation of trial product or withdrawal of consent to secure early mitigations in collaboration with the trial sites. The investigator will make every effort to ensure that all assessments are performed and data is collected. Novo Nordisk will monitor protocol deviations on an on-going basis throughout the trial followed by appropriate actions (e.g. re-training of site staff). 20 Audits and inspections Any aspect of the clinical trial may be subject to audits conducted by Novo Nordisk or inspections from domestic or foreign regulatory authorities or from IECs. Audits and inspections may take place during or after the trial. The investigator and the site staff as well as Novo Nordisk staff have an obligation to cooperate and assist in audits and inspections. This includes giving auditors and inspectors direct access to all source documents and other documents at the trial site relevant to the clinical trial. This includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are relevant to the evaluation of the trial. 21 Critical documents Before a trial site is allowed to start screening subjects, written notification from Novo Nordisk must be received and the following documents must be available to Novo Nordisk: !Regulatory approval and/or acknowledgement of notification as required !Approval/favourable opinion from IECs clearly identifying the documents reviewed as follows: protocol, any protocol amendments, subject information/informed consent form, any other written information to be provided to the subject and subject recruitment materials !List of IEC members and/or constitution (or a general assurance number/statement of compliance) !Curricula vitae of investigator and sub-investigator(s) (current, dated and signed - must include documented GCP training or a certificate) !Signed receipt of IB and SmPC or similar labelling !Signed and dated Agreement on Protocol !Signed and dated Agreement on Protocol Amendment, if applicable !Contract, signed by the investigator and/or appropriate parties on behalf of the investigator’s site and Novo Nordisk !Source document agreementCONFIDENTIAL"

By signing the protocol agreement, each investigator also agrees to allow Novo Nordisk to make investigator’s name and information about site name and address publically available if this is required by national or international regulations. 22 Responsibilities The investigator is accountable for the conduct of the trial at his/her site and must ensure adequate supervision of the conduct of the trial at the trial site. If any tasks are delegated, the investigator must maintain a log of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she has delegated specified trial- related duties. The investigator must ensure that there is adequate and documented training for all staff participating in the conduct of the trial. It is the investigator’s responsibility to supervise the conduct of the trial and to protect the rights, safety, and well-being of the subjects. A qualified physician, who is an investigator or a sub-investigator for the trial, must be responsible for all trial-related medical decisions. The investigator will follow instructions from Novo Nordisk when processing data.The investigator is responsible for filing essential documents (i.e. those documents which individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced) in the investigator trial master file. The documents including the subject identification code list must be kept in a secure locked facility, so no unauthorized persons can get access to the data. The investigator will take all necessary technical and organisational safety measures to prevent accidental or wrongful destruction, loss or deterioration of data. The investigator will prevent any unauthorised access to data or any other processing of data against applicable law.

Novo Nordisk reserves the right to defer the release of data until specified milestones are reached, for example when the clinical trial report is available. This includes the right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such information may influence the results of the entire trial. At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by the investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or communication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property. In all cases the trial results will be reported in an objective, accurate, balanced and complete manner, with a discussion of the strengths and limitations. All authors will be given the relevant statistical tables, figures, and reports needed to evaluate the planned publication. In the event of any disagreement on the content of any publication, both the investigators’ and Novo Nordisk opinions will be fairly and sufficiently represented in the publication. Where required by the journal, the investigator from each trial site will be named in an acknowledgement or in the supplementary material, as specified by the journal. Novo Nordisk maintains the right to be informed of plans by any investigator to publish and to review any scientific paper, presentation, communication or other information concerning the investigation described in this protocol. Any such communication must be submitted in writing to Novo Nordisk before submission for comments. Comments will be given within four weeks from receipt of the planned communication. 23.1.1 Authorship Authorship of publications should be in accordance with the Uniform Requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 63(sometimes referred to as the Vancouver Criteria).

It is a Novo Nordisk policy that such individual reports do not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscript of the trial. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to prior review of such publications. Further to allow for the primary manuscript to be published as the first, Novo Nordisk asks for deferment of publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. As Novo Nordisk wants to live up to the industry publication policy, submission of a primary publication will take place no later than 18 months after trial completion. 23.2 Investigator access to data and review of results As owner of the trial database, Novo Nordisk has the discretion to determine who will have access to the database. Individual investigators will have their own research subjects' data, and will be provided with the randomisation code after results are available. 24 Retention of clinical trial documentation Subject’s medical records must be kept for the maximum period permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice. The investigator must agree to archive the documentation (this includes both electronic and paper- based records) pertaining to the trial in an archive after completion or discontinuation of the trial if not otherwise notified. The investigator should not destroy any documents without prior permission from Novo Nordisk. If the investigator cannot archive the documents at the trial site, Novo Nordisk can refer the investigator to an independent archive provider that has a system in place to allow only the investigator to access the files. The investigator must be able to access his/her trial documents without involving Novo Nordisk in any way. Site-specific CRFs and other subject data (in an electronic readable format or as paper copies or prints) will be provided to the investigator before access is revoked to the systems supplied by Novo Nordisk. These data must be retained by the trial site. If the provided data (e.g. the CD-ROM) is not readable during the entire storage period, the investigator can request a new copy. A copy of all data will be stored by Novo Nordisk.CONFIDENTIAL"

The files from the trial site/institution must be retained for 15 years after end of trial or longer if required by local regulations or Novo Nordisk. In any case trial files cannot be destroyed until the trial site/institution is notified by Novo Nordisk. The deletion process must ensure confidentiality of data and must be done in accordance with local regulatory requirements. 25 Independent Ethics Committees and regulatory authorities Written approval or favourable opinion must be obtained from IEC prior to commencement of the trial. During the trial, the investigator or Novo Nordisk, as applicable, must promptly report the following to the IEC, in accordance with local requirements: updates to Investigator’s Brochure, unexpected SAEs where a causal relationship cannot be ruled out, protocol amendments according to local requirements, deviations to the protocol implemented to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects, new information that may affect adversely the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the trial (including new benefit-risk analysis in case it will have an impact on the planned follow-up of the subjects), annually written summaries of the trial status, and other documents as required by the local IEC. The investigator must ensure submission of the clinical trial report synopsis to the IEC.Protocol amendments must not be implemented before approval or favourable opinion according to local regulations, unless necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects. The investigator must maintain an accurate and complete record of all submissions made to the IEC. The records must be filed in the investigator trial master file and copies must be sent to Novo Nordisk. Regulatory Authorities: Regulatory authorities will receive the clinical trial application, protocol amendments, reports on SAEs, and the clinical trial report according to national requirements.CONFIDENTIAL"

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C-cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical interpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (greater than 100 ng/L) as likely indicative of C-cell neoplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !smoking !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical conditions and in different patient populations (i.e. with various co-morbidities) is poorly understood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells.CONFIDENTIAL"

Background: These values were found in 9 (0.15%) of a population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1.

Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound examination !fine needle aspiration of any nodules >1 cm !potentially, surgery with neck dissection In case a subject is diagnosed with MTC, it is common clinical practice to explore the family history of MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and perform a genetic test for RET proto- oncogene mutation. 2.2 Calcitonin ≥50 and <100 ng/L Action: The subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. The subject should remain in the trial and continuation on trial product should be based on the evaluation done by the thyroid specialist. Background: These values were found in 8 (0.14%) of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1. Two of these subjects were diagnosed with MTC and two were diagnosed with C-cell hyperplasia, resulting in a positive predictive value of a C-cell anomaly of 50%. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound examination !if available, and if there are no contraindications, a pentagastrin stimulation test should be done. For subjects with positive pentagastrin stimulation test, surgery should be considered. !if pentagastrin stimulation test is not available, thyroid ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy may add important clinical information about the need for surgery. 2.3 Calcitonin ≥10 and <50 ng/L Action: The subject can continue in the trial on trial product.

The predictive value of a C-cell anomaly for this calcitonin level was 8.3%. However, the likelihood of having a medullary carcinoma >1 cm with calcitonin in this range is extremely low. For calcitonin values between 10-20 ng/L Costante et al. 1identified 216 (3.7%) patients. One patient out of the 216 had a subsequent basal (unstimulated) calcitonin value of 33 ng/L, and had C- cell hyperplasia at surgery. Two other studies used a cut-off of calcitonin > 10 ng/L to screen for C- cell disease, but they do not provide sufficient information on patients with basal CT >10 and <20 ng/L to allow conclusions2, 3.CONFIDENTIAL"

If suspicion of a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the subjects should be instructed to contact the site staff as soon as possible for further guidance. To assist in the diagnostic evaluation it is recommended to draw a blood sample for measurement of tryptase (total and/or mature tryptase, local assessment) within 3 hours of onset of the hypersensitivity reaction, and if this is achieved, a tryptase sample should also be drawn 2 weeks after the event. Furthermore, a blood sample for assessment of anti-semaglutide IgE antibodies should be drawn after 2 weeks and sent to central laboratory.

The onset of the pain may be swift, reaching maximum intensity within 30 min, is frequently unbearable, and characteristically persists for more than 24 hours without relief2. The pain is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination usually reveals severe upper abdominal tenderness at times associated with guarding. In general, both amylase and lipase are elevated during the course of acute pancreatitis. The serum lipase may remain elevated slightly longer than amylase. The level of the serum amylase and/or lipase does not correlate with the severity of acute pancreatitis2. In general, serum lipase is thought to be more sensitive and specific than serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis, the trial product should promptly be interrupted (no treatment discontinuation call should be made in IWRS before diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed). Appropriate additional examinations should be performed, including measurement of amylase and lipase. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features3:CONFIDENTIAL"

In the Smpc, it is stated th at liraglutide can be used in combination with other oral anti-diabetic drugs ( OADs) and /or basal insulin if these drugs, associated to diet and physical activity, are not sufficient to guarantee an adequate glycaemic control. Subjects in this trial are required to be treated with stable doses of pre-defined anti-diabetic medications and should therefore have exhausted the option of diet and physical exercise only. However, to ensure that diet and exercise has been attempted before pharmacological therapy is initiated and that lifestyle modification is recommended as adjunct therapy to all subjects with type 2 diabetes, the following will be added to Sections 6.8 and 18.1.2 of the trial protocol.
