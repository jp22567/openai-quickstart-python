Prior receipt of antiangiogenic treatment, including but not limited to bevacizumab, is optional. If used, it can be in the first line or recurrent setting. Rationale for change: Bevacizumab has recently been approved by FDA for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Despite being an available treatment option in US, feasibility data show that nearly half of the recurrent ovarian cancer patients particularly in earlier lines of treatment do not receive bevacizumab. Therefore, to enable recruitment, prior receipt of antiangiogenic treatment is now changed from mandatory to optional. Section 3.1 Inclusion criterion #9 Old text9.

The steering committee‚Äôs remit is to provide an agreed strategic direction for the study. 1.5.2 Data Monitoring Committee In this Phase IIb study, a Data Monitoring Co mmit tee was not considered necessary as it is an open label study and the safety profiles of ol aparib and cediranib as monotherapies and in combination, have previously been established. Rationale for change:This section has been added, per AstraZeneca new Protocol Template. This was previously covered in Section 6.8 Study governance and ove rsight ‚Äì which has been removed. The Section has been expanded to include further details on the structure and functioning of the steering committee. Section 3.1 Inclusion criteria #4 Old Text 4. Recurrent platinum-resistant disease, defined as radiological evidence of disease recurrence within 6 months of the last receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with platinum-refractory disease are not eligible. New text 4. Recurrent platinum-resistant disease, defined as disease progression within 6 months of the last receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy. !Patients with platinum refractory disease defined as disease progression during the last receipt of platinum-based therapy, are not eligible !Patients with primary platinum resistant/refractory disease defined as progression during or within 6 months of completing first-line platinum- based chemotherapy are not eligible. Rationale for the change: To allow clinical judgement by the investigator as per standard clinical practice without changing the definition of platinum resistant disease, the stipulation for radiological evidence of disease progression is removed. Previous criteria required radiological evidence of platinum-resistant disease which was dependent on when the CT scan was taken rather than on investigator‚Äôs clinical judgement of when disease progression occurred within the 6-months of the last receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy. The GCIG criteria for platinum resistant ovarian cancer does not stipulate the requirement for radiological evidence of disease progression with 6 months of completing platinum-based chemotherapy (Friedlander M et al 2011, Int J Gynecol Canc er 2011: 21: 771-775).

Prior receipt of antiangiogenic treatment including but not limited to bevacizumab in the first line or recurrent setting Clarification:Text revised to clarify that prior antiangiogen ic treatment is not limited to bevacizumab only.Section 3.1 Inclusion Criteria #9 Old Text9. At least three prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer. Only one prior non-platinum treatment is allowed. Hormonal therapies used as single agents (ie, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors) will not count towards this line limit. New Text 9. At least three prior lines of chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer are required. !Up to two prior non-platinum chemotherapy regimens are allowed but not required. !Hormonal therapy (such as tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors), bevacizumab (or other angiogenesis inhibitor), or other immunotherapy used as a single agent will not count as a line of chemotherapy. Rationale for the change: The allowance of only one prior non-platinum regimen aimed to select patients who start study treatment as soon as platinum resistant relapse is diagnosed. However, in the heavily pre-treated setting of at least 3 prior lines of chemotherapy, it becomes too restrictive.  RI"

New text The following 6 PRO-CTCAE AEs will be collected in the study: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, and dizziness. In addition to these items from the PRO-CTCAE item bank, the following additional item will be asked together with the PRO-CTCAE items: ""In the last 7 days, how much did LOOSE OR WATERY STOOLS (DIARRHEA) INTERFERE with your usual or daily activities?"" Rationale for the change Data collection has been amended to include an additional question to a pre-existing question on Diarrhea in the instrument PRO-CTCAE, and to the ERT logpad. The rationale for this is that the item ‚ÄòDiarrhea‚Äô was earlier assessed only on one dimension ‚Äòfrequency‚Äô. The addition of the new question will allow the assessment on two dimensions (frequency and interference). Although interference is not a standard NCI PRO-CTCAE item for diarrhoea, NCI accepts that individual sponsors can add dimensions to those in the item bank. Diarrhoea is a very common AE for cediranib and assessing the impact of the adverse event on patient well-being is clinically relevant. Furthermore, diarrhoea is reported as a very common event for olaparib, therefore assessing the impact of the combination on frequency and interference is important. Section 6.4 Reporting of serious adverse events Administrative change The following text has been added to replace Section 6.9 which was removed to align the protocol with the new protocol template: The AstraZeneca representative will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or staff at the center needs information or advice about the study conduct.

If less than 4 of the 20 patients have responded, the study may be stopped for fut ility. If 4 or more patients have responded the study will continue to the primary analysis. Assuming the study passes the fut ility assessment, the d ata cut-off for the primary analysis of ORR (confirmed CRs + PRs only) will take place 8 months after the last patient has received her first dose of IP, to allow opportunity for all patients to complete at least 4 RECIST follow- up assessments and estimate duration of response (DoR). The primary analysis for the clinical study report (CSR) will be based on the confirmed ORR by ICR using RECIST 1.1 criteria and supported by Investigator assessment of ORR and by other efficacy endpoints (DoR, disease control rate [DCR] and progression free survival [PFS], time to treatment discontinuation or death [TDT]), patient reported outcomes (PROs), and safety and tolerability data. For the primary analysis of ORR by ICR the mean and median of the posterior distribution of ORR will be presented, along with the standard deviation and a 95% credible interval around the mean (based on the highest posterior density [ Lee 1997]).

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study 1.1.1 Epithelial ovarian cancer Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy and the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death in women with the estimated annual incidence of just over 200,000 individuals and approximately 125,000 deaths ( American Cancer Society 2015; Siegel et al 2015 ). Most patients with EOC present with advanced disease at diagnosis ( Cannistra 2004 ; Parmar et al 2003 ). The combination of a platinum drug with a taxane is the standard of care first-line treatment after primary cytoreductive surgery ( du Bois et al 2003 , McGuire et al 1996 ). Response to the first-line treatment is achieved in more than 70% of patients whose tumors are optimally or sub-optimally cytoreduced ( Ozols et al 2003 ; Kang et al 2006 ). However, of those who respond, 55% to 75% will relapse within 2 years of completing treatment ( Edwards et al 2015 ). A patient‚Äôs response to first-line platinum-based therapy is indicative of their response to second and subsequent lines of platinum-based treatment, with the length of the platinum-free interval (PFI) and the extent of relapse (site and number of tumors) being particularly prognostic of response. However, most patients will develop resistance to platinum-based therapy over time, with decreasing length of PFI with increasing rounds of treatment. Platinum-resistant ovarian cancer [defined as disease recurring within 6 months (182 days) after the last receipt of platinum based chemotherapy, Stuart et al 2011 ] has a particularly poor prognosis, with a low response rate (RR) to subsequent chemotherapy (< 15%), median progression free survival (PFS) of 3 to 4 months and overall survival (OS) of approximately 12 months ( Davis et al 2014 ). Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), paclitaxel, topotecan and gemcitabine, the most commonly used agents in the setting of ‚Äòplatinum resistance‚Äô (Luvero et al 2014), show RRs ranging from 10% to 15% and duration of response (DoR) of typically <6 months ( Markman et al 2000 ; Matsuo et al 2010 ). Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative therapies for patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer, given the poor response to traditional cytotoxic agents. Two potential therapeutic targets are DNA damage repair and angiogenesis pathways. 1.1.2 Cediranib Cediranib is a potent, oral once daily small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)- signalling and angiogenesis that targets all 3 VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1,-2,-3) and has additional act ivity against stem cell factor receptor (c-kit)- dependent tumor growth.  RI"

Single agent cediranib has shown an objective response rate (ORR) of 17% and a median PFS of 5.2 months in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer, treated in 2 ndor 3rdline setting ( Matulonis et al 2009 ); another study in platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients treated in 2ndline setting, showed an ORR of 0% (0/35 patients) and a median PFS of 3.7 months ( Hirte et al 2015 ). Results are presented in Table 4 . 1.1.2.2 Activity of cediranib in combination with chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients The ICON6 study, led by the Medical Res earch Council, was a Phase III randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed (PSR) ovarian cancer who had received one prior chemotherap y regimen. The ICON6 study recruited 456 women who were randomized 2:3:3 to three parallel treatment arms: in arm A (reference) platinum-based chemotherapy plus placebo; in arm B (concurrent), platinum-based chemotherapy plus cediranib 20 mg, followed by placebo during the maintenance phase; in arm C (concurrent plus maintenance) platinum-based chemotherapy plus cediranib 20 mg followed by single agent cediranib 20 mg during the maintenance phase. Six cycles of chemotherapy were planned, but patients unable to complete 6 cycles and who were responding to treatment could begin maintenance treatment after at least four cycles were completed. Results are summarized in Table 1 : Table 1 ICON6 Summary of Results Treatment arm Arm A (chemotherapy plus placebo followed by placebo in maintenance) N= 118Arm B (concurrent cediranib and chemotherapy followed by placebo in maintenance) N = 174Arm C (concurrent cediranib and chemotherapy followed by maintenance cediranib) N = 164 Number of progression events (%)113 (96%) 156 (90%) 141 (86%) Median PFS in months (95% CI)8¬∑7 (7¬∑7, 9¬∑4) 9¬∑9 (9¬∑4, 10¬∑5). 11¬∑0 (10¬∑4, 11¬∑7) Abbreviations: CI confidence interval; N number of subjects; PFS progression free survival The primary efficacy analysis compared PFS between arm C and arm A; the result showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 0¬∑56, (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0¬∑44‚Äì0¬∑72, p<0.0001).

OS data at 52% maturity showed median OS of 26.3 months in arm C and 21 months in arm A (HR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.55-1.07, p=0.11). Diarrhea, neutropenia, hypertension, and vo ice changes were significantly more common, during chemotherapy with cediranib, and diarrhea, hypothyroidism and voice changes were more common during maintenance. Further details including pre-clinical data and efficacy and safety information are provided in the cediranib (AZD2171) Investigator Brochure (IB). 1.1.3 Olaparib Olaparib (AZD2281, KU-0059436, Lynparza‚Ñ¢) is a potent polyadenosine 5‚Äô diphosphoribose [poly (ADP ribose)] polymerization (PARP) inhibitor (PARPi; PARP-1, -2 and -3) which is now approved by FDA as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline breast cancer su sceptibility gene ( BRCA ) mutated (as detected by an FDA-approved test) advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. FDA approval for olaparib was based on data from Study D8180C000042 (Study 42); a Phase II non-comparative study in gBRCAm advanced tumors, including ovarian cancer using olaparib capsule formulation, 400 mg bd ( Table 2 ).

Study 42 data were supported by data from Study D8180C000019 (Study 19); a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, place bo controlled multicenter study using olaparib capsule formulation, 400 mg bd. In Study 19, 265 patients with PSR ovarian cancer in response to platinum based chemotherapy were randomized to olaparib 400 mg bd or placebo in a maintenance setting. The primary analysis demonstrated that maintenance treatment with olaparib led to a significant PFS improvement vs placebo [HR 0.35 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.49]; p<0.00001; Ledermann et al 2012 ).

A confirmatory study for Study 19, the SOLO2 study is currently ongoing and data are expected to be reported by the end of 2016. SOLO2 is a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multicenter study using olaparib tab let formulation, 300 mg bd. Unlike Study 19, which r ecruited patients with PSR ovarian cancer, regardless of their BRCA mutation status, patients in SOLO2 were required to have a documented BRCA mutation. Further details including pre-clinical data and efficacy and safety information are provided in the olaparib (AZD2281) IB. 1.1.4 Activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib 1.1.4.1 Nonclinical experience with the combination of cediranib and olaparib To determine whether cediranib has potential to combine with olaparib, the combination treatment was tested in an ovarian patient derived tumor explant model. Tumors were implanted sub-cutaneously, then selected and randomized once they were 0.2 cm 3. Tumor bearing animals were treated with either monotherapy cediranib at 3 mg/kg on a 5 day on 2 day off schedule, olaparib at 100 mg/kg daily, or a combination of cediranib and olaparib. Treatment with both cediranib and olaparib as monotherapies reduced tumor growth, however the combination of the 2 agents resulted in increased anti-tumor activity with tumors not progressing through therapy for the duration of the study.

However, combining cediranib and olaparib have potential to synergize by increasing the anti-angiogenic effect of cediranib, or preventing the tumor cell from adapting to the anti-angiogenic treatment. Alternatively, cediranib may lower the expression of DNA da mage response genes and induce a synthetic ‚ÄúDNA damage response (DDR) phenotype‚Äù thereby increasing sensitivity to PARPi. Cediranib treatment results in a change in va sculature permeability and a reduction in vessels (refer to the cediranib IB for more information). This in turn may induce tumor hypoxia, nutrient and metabolic stress in the tumor cell compartment, specifically, the hypoxia mediated micro-environmental stress has potential to induce both acute DNA damage and suppression of DNA repair pathways with downregulation of homologous recombination genes such as BRCA1 and RAD51 and mismatch repair genes ( Bindra et al 2005 ; Bindra et al 2007; Bristow and Hill 2008 ). This increases the rate of background DNA damage. An increase in metabolic stress as caused by hypoxia would also restrict the potential to generate nucleotides and co-factors to drive DNA repair. Subsequently the combination with olaparib would impair the ability of the tumor cell to tolerate this increase in background DNA damage. Other mechanisms may also contribute to the combination effect. BRCA1 can influence the hypoxia response ( Kang et al 2006 ) and hence may prevent cells adapting to the reduction in oxygen. Furthermore, VEGFR3 inhibition can sens itize ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapy via downregulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 ( Lim et al 2014 ). Other studies have demonstrated that PARP inhibition can result in some anti-angiogenic activity, with PARPi and PARP knockouts showing reduced vascularization in a matrigel plug assay in vivo (Tentori et al 2007 ). 1.1.4.2 Rationale for treatment with cediranib after prior exposure to bevacizumab While bevacizumab targets VEGF-A driven act ivation of VEGFR-1 and -2, evidence is emerging that patients either naturally possess alternative VEGF-VEGFR angiogenesis pathways/features not targeted by bevacizumab and/or acquire reactive resistance to bevacizumab following inhibition of VEGF-A. VEGF-C and/or VEGF-D mediated activation of VEGFR-2 has now emerged as a potential resistance mechanism following inhibition of VEGF-A by bevacizumab ( Van der Bilt et al 2012 ). Recent data show that VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR-3 are elevated in serum and ascites fluid isolated from ovarian cancer patients. VEGF-C is described as a prognostic marker in ovarian cancer, with patients presenting with high serum VEGF-C ( Cheng et al 2013 ) or high tumor expression ( Nishida et al 2004 ) associated with a worse prognosis. Similar data are described for the related ligand VEGF-D, which also activates VEGFR-3 ( Yokoyama et al 2003a ; Yokoyama et al 2003b ). The selectivity and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of cediranib, which targets all 3 VEGFRs (VEGFR-1, -2, -3) activated by different ligands (VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D) has the potential to achieve consistent and comprehensive suppression of the VEGF axis for the treatment of ovarian cancer in patients with natural or acquired resistance to bevacizumab.  RI"

Among the 18 evaluable ovarian patients, an overall ORR of 44% to the cediranib/olaparib combination was observed in this Phase I population, which included both gBRCAm patients and patients who did not carry a deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA mutation ( Liu et al 2013 ). Two dose limiting toxicities (1 Grade 4 neutropenia ‚â•4 days; 1 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia) occurred at the highest dose level (cediranib 30 mg daily; olaparib 400 mg bd). The RP2D established in this study was cediranib 30 mg od plus olaparib capsules 200 mg bd. In total, 6 platinum-resistant ovarian cancer p atients were treated across all dose levels investigated; the patients comprised of 3 patients who harbored gBRCAm mutations (1 patient with each of the following responses: confirmed partial response [PR], unconfirmed PR and stable disease [SD] x 8 months) and 3 patients who did not carry deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA mutations, or patients whose muta tion status was of unknown significance; amongst these patients, 2 had confirmed PRs and 1 patient had SD [<6 months, by CA-125 only]). The ORR was 50%, with a clinical benefit rate of 67%. The median PFS was 7.5 months, with a range of 3.3 to 20.4 months. Phase I study cediranib plus olaparib tablets A Phase I study was subsequently conducted to establish the RP2D of cediranib plus olaparib tablets combination; the study enrolled 24 patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Ten (42%) out of the 24 patients were known to carry a gBRCA mutation; 13 patients were non- carriers and 1 patient had unknown BRCA status (Liu et al 2013). Among 22 evaluable patients, an overall response rate of 27% was observed. Two of the responders were BRCA mutation non-carriers and 4 had platinum resistant disease. The most common toxicities included hypertension, diarrhea and fatigue. The RP2D established for the combination were cediranib 30 mg od plus olaparib tablet 200 mg bd or cediranib 20 mg od plus olaparib tablet 300 mg bd. Phase II study A Phase II study comparing the activity of cediranib and olaparib (capsule formulation) combination with olaparib alone in recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer is ongoing (NCT01116648, Liu et al 2014 ). In the full analysis set (FAS), there were 2 CRs and 20 PRs in patients who received olaparib monotherapy (48% ORR) and 5 CRs and 30 PRs in patients who received the combination of cediranib and olaparib (80% ORR, p = 0.002). The combination of cediranib and olaparib significantly extended both PFS and ORR compared with olaparib alone, with a median PFS of 9.2 months for olaparib alone and 16.7 months for cediranib/olaparib (HR 0.402, 95% CI 0.217, 0.741, p = 0.0036).

In patients who were not gBRCAm or had a VUS, there was a marked increase in PFS from 5.8 months with olaparib monotherapy to 16.6 months with cediran ib/olaparib therapy (HR 0.323, 95% CI 0.139, 0.746; p = 0.008) and an increase in ORR from 32% to 76% (p = 0.006). The majority of patients in both arms had received 1 or 2 previous lines of treatment (76% of patients on olaparib monotherapy vs. 82% of patients on cediranib/olaparib arm); it is unclear if the observed difference in ORR and PFS based on gBRCAm status could in part be attributable to the degree of prior therapy. Overall, the cediranib/olaparib combination demonstrated a significant clinical benefit over olaparib alone, as measured both by PFS a nd ORR. The increased clinical benefit of the cediranib/olaparib combination over olaparib mo notherapy was greater in women with tumors that were not gBRCAm or who had a VUS status compared with women who harbored gBRCA1/2 mutations. Toxicities were consistent with expected class-related toxicities of these drugs, with most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities attributed to each of the IPs including fatigue (27% cediranib/olaparib vs. 11% olaparib), diarrhea (23% vs. 0%), and hypertension (41% vs. 0%). There were 2 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) Grade 4 events, both in the cediranib/olaparib arm: 1 event of Grade 4 hypertension in a patient who was not fully compliant with blood pressure (BP) monitoring and 1 event of Grade 4 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

Single agent cediranib has shown an ORR of 17% and a median PFS of 5.2 months in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer, treated in 2ndor 3rdline setting ( Matulonis et al 2009 ); another study in platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients treated in 2ndline setting, showed an ORR of 0% (0/35 patients) and a median PFS of 3.7 months ( Hirte et al 2015 ). A Phase I trial of the combination of cediranib and olaparib in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer showed that cediranib 30 mg od in combination with olaparib tablet 200 mg bd is a tolerable regimen with preliminary evidence of activity in platinum resistant disease with an ORR of 29% (4/14 patients) including both BRCA mutation carriers and non-carriers RI"

Given the limited activity of single agent olaparib or cediranib in platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients who do not carry a deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA mutation, and the synergistic effect of the combination observed both non-clinically and clinically, it is considered appropriate to evaluate only the combination of olaparib/cediranib using an open-label, single arm design in this patient population of high unmet need for whom there are currently no therapies available other than palliative therapies. The study thus has the limitation that the current design would not allow an assessment of the contribution components within this study. However, in parallel, a Phase II/III study (NRG-GY005) is investigating in a randomized setting the activity of single agent olaparib and cediranib versus the combination of cediranib plus olaparib and versus standard of care non-platinum based chemotherapy in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer who have received no more than 2 prior chemotherapies and may or may not carry gBRCA mutation. Both studies will use the previously established and recommended Phase II dose for the combination of cediranib (30 mg, oral, once daily) plus olaparib tablet 200 mg oral twice daily (Liu et al 2014 ). 1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment Ovarian cancer remains a leading cause of death from gynecological cancers in the United States ( American Cancer Society 2015 ) and is the fifth most common cause of cancer mortality in women ( Siegel et al 2015). Recurrent platinum resistant high grade serous ovarian cancer accounts for most EOC deaths ( Vaughan et al 2011 ). Effective targeted agents are needed that can improve prognosis with an acceptable toxicity profile without adversely impacting quality of life. The outlook for patients who de velop platinum resistant disease is poor, with a low RR to subsequent chemotherapy (<15%), median PFS of 3 to 4 months and OS of approximately 12 months ( Davis et al 2014 ). Bevacizumab has recently been approved by the FDA, based on the results of AURELIA trial, in combination with investigator‚Äôs choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [PLD] or topotecan) for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary pe ritoneal cancer who received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. In the 287 p atients with responses evaluable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), the ORR was 11.8% versus 27.3% for chemotherapy and bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, respectively (p =0.001; Pujade-Lauraine et al 2014 ). Olaparib is approved by the FDA as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious ger mline BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with ‚â•3 prior lines of chemotherapy and are either platinum sensitive or platinum resistant. RI"

Moreover, efficacy rapidly declines in patients with platinum resistant disease with subsequent lines of therapy and, as per National Comprehensive Cancer network (NCCN) guidelines ( NCCN guidelines ), palliation should be considered after failure of 2 lines of treatment. Available data demonstrate that the combination of cediranib/olaparib has the po tential to provide clinical benefit in this group of patients, with toxicities being consistent w ith expected class-related toxicities of these drugs (Section 1.1.4.3 ). Patients who have progressed on prior anti-angiogenic therapy (eg, bevacizumab) have been reported to have an increase in alternate VEGF ligands suggesting that a more comprehensive inhibition of VEGF signaling as offered by cediranib may be appropriate at that point ( Lieu et al 2013 ). Therefore, there remains an unmet medical need for effective treatment options with an alternative anti-angiogenic treatment for patients at their relapse on bevacizumab. On balance, therefore the benefit/risk for the combination of cediranib plus olaparib in heavily pre-treated patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients who do not carry a deleterious or susp ected deleterious gBRCA mutation, for whom only palliative therapies are available, is considered favorable. The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP), applicable regulatory requirements and the AstraZeneca policy on Bioethics and Human Biological Samples. 1.4 Study Design This is an open label, Phase IIb, single arm, multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of cediranib and olap arib in platinum resistant relapsed high grade serous, high grade endometroid or clear cell ova rian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy for advanced ovarian cancer and who have no evidence of deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA mutation(s) as defined by a local test conducted in an appropriately accredited laboratory (eg, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA]-certified) that includes comprehensive DNA sequencing and large rearrangement analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 . Prior antiangiogenic treatment such as bevacizumab, either in a first line or a recurrent setting is optional. To be eligible to enter the study, all patients should have measurab le disease (as assessed by the Investigator), defined as at least 1 lesion that can be accurately assessed at baseline by computed tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is suitable for repeated assessment per RECIST 1.1. All patients will have RECIST 1.1 tumour assessments at screening (within 28 days prior to the start of study treatment) and every 8 weeks (¬±1 week) after start of treatment until objective radiological disease progression or withdrawal of consent. Objective radiological response on treatment (complete res ponse [CR] or PR) will need to be confirmed RI"

Patients will receive the combination of: ! Cediranib tablets 30 mg oral once daily ! Olaparib tablets 200 mg oral twice daily Patients should continue to receive IPs until objective radiological disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. The study originally planned to recruit 100 patients over approximately 12 months. Due to slower than projected recruitment, the study now plans to recruit approxima tely 60 patients. An interim fut ility analysis w ill be undertaken once the first 20 evaluable patients (ie, with measurable disease [by Investigator assessment] and have received at least 1 dose of IP) have been followed for at least 4 months. If fewer than 4 radiological tumor responses are observed at this point, the trial may be considered futile and enrollment stopped. Enrollment will continue whilst the fut ility analysis is being conducted. The primary analysis of the study will be based on measurement of ORR in the evaluable for response (EFR) analysis set (CR+PR; confirmed responses only) by Independent Central review (ICR) using RECIST 1.1. The primary analysis will also report analyses of DoR and disease control rate (DCR) by ICR in the EFR an alysis set. Other variables analyzed at the primary analysis (ORR, DoR, DCR based on investigator assessment; PFS, overall survival [OS], time to treatment discontinuation or death [TDT], patient-reported outcome [PRO] variables and safety variables) will be summarized using the FAS. The data cut-off for the primary analysis will take place 8 months after the last patient has received her first dose of IP and is the final analysis for the study. This primary data cut-off will be followed by clinical database lock. Patients continuing to receive clinical benefit without meeting any discontinuation criteria during the study, will complete a FPV which will occur at their last scheduled visit prior to the primary data cut-off. Beyond the FPV, patients may continue to receive cediranib and/or olaparib if they are deriving clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator, and not fulfilling any discontinuation criteria (see Section 4.5). All patients will be required to provide an archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample from the primary or preferably recurre nt cancer. If an archival tumor sample is not available, a tumor sample from a fresh biopsy is acceptable. Please note that a lesion that has been biopsied during screening cannot be selected as a target lesion for RECIST assessment. Tumor samples will be tested for somatic (ie, non-germline) deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in either of the BRCA genes ( BRCA1 or BRCA2 ) and the following homologous recombination repair (HRR)-associated genes: ATM, BRIP1, PALB2, RAD51C, BARD1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51D, and RAD54L . RI"

The Investigator(s) will:1. Obtain signed informed consent from the potential patient or their guardian/legal representative before any study specific procedures are performed. 2. Assign potential patient a unique enrollment number, beginning with ‚ÄòE#‚Äô through the Interactive Response Technology system. This numbe r is the patient‚Äôs unique identifier and is used to identify the patient on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs). 3. Determine patient eligibility. See Section 3. If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then her enrollment code cannot be reused. This is an open-label study; there is no randomization. 3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled patients 3.4.1 Screen failures Screening failures are patients who do not fulfil the eligibility criteria for the study, and therefore must not be entered into the study. Patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, enter the study or receive IPs. There can be no exceptions to this rule. 3.4.2 Incorrectly en rolled patients Where a patient does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is e nrolled in error, or incorrectly started on treatment, the Investigator should inform the AstraZeneca study physician immediately, and a discussion should occur between the AstraZeneca study physician and the Investigator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the patient from treatment. The AstraZeneca study physician must ensure all decisions are appropriately documented. 3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups Not applicable; this is a single arm study. 3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding Not applicable; this is an open-label, unblinded, study. 3.7 Methods for unblinding Not applicable; this is an open-label, unblinded, study. RI"

Absorption of oral contraceptives can be impaired in case of GI symptoms such as diarrhea >24 hours or vomiting. In addition, the possibility that cediranib may induce GI CYP3A and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT) enzymes cannot be excluded and the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced if co administered with cediranib. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use two highly effective forms of contraception (see Appendix J) during study treatment and for at least 6 weeks after discontinuation of study treatment and to perform pregnancy tests as required (see Sections 5.2.5.1, 6.6.1). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant during the study conduct, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Breast-feeding is contraindicated whilst receiving IPs. Restrictions related to pregnancy are provided in Section 6.6. Restrictions related to concomitant medications (including medications metabolized via CYP3A4/5 or P glycoprotein (PgP)/UGT; anticoagulant therapy; anti-emetics/anti-diarrheal therapies; palliative RT and administration of other anti-cancer agents) are described in Section 7.7and Appendix I. Patients may not use any complementary or al ternative medicines including natural herbal products or folk remedies as they may interfere with the effectiveness of the IPs.It is prohibited to consume grapefruit juice while on olaparib therapy. 3.9 Discontinuation of investigational product Patients may be discontinued from IPs in the following situations: ! Patient decision; the patient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment. A patient who discontinues treatment is normally expected to con tinue to participate in the study unless she specifically withdraws her consent to further participation in any study procedures and assessments (see Section 3.10.1). ! Adverse Event (AE), including AEs that meet criteria for discontinuation as defined in Section 6.7; any AEs that, in the opinion of the Investigator or AstraZeneca, contraindicates further dosing. !

However, in rare circumstances, patients experiencing ongoing clinical benefit but who develop one of the toxicities listed below, related to one of the IPs, that prevents them to continue to take this IP, may be allowed to continue on the unrelated drug if in the opinion of the treating investigator the risk benefit remain s favorable and only after discussion with the AstraZeneca Study Physician and the Principal Investigator. AEs requiring cediranib to be discontinued: ! GI perforation ! Arterial Thromboembolic Event ! Reversible Posterior Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) ! Severe hemorrhage ! Severe persistent hypertension despite maximal anti-hypertensive treatment AEs requiring olaparib to be discontinued: ! Bone marrow findings consistent with MDS/AML. ! Severe persistent anemia !

If a patient is withdrawn from study, see Section 3.10. A patient that decides to discontinue the IPs will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If possible, they will be seen and assessed by an Investigator(s). AEs will be followed up (see Section 6) and all study drugs should be returned by the patient. By discontinuing from IPs, the patient is not withdrawing from the study. Any patient discontinuing the IPs should attend the scheduled Treatment Discontinuation visit, and the Follow Up visit 30 days post-discontinuation for the assessments outlined in the study schedule.

In addition, they will record on the eCRF the date and reasons of discontinuation, any clinical manifestations and treatments required at the time of discontinuation. Any patient who has not yet shown objective radiological disease progression at discontinuation from cediranib and olaparib tre atments should continue to be followed as per RECIST as detailed in Section 4(ie, patients should be followed for progression by tumor assessments every 8 weeks). Following objective radiological progression, patients should also be followed for survival as detailed in Section 5.1.4. After discontinuation of the IPs at any point in the study, all ongoing AEs or serious adverse events (SAEs) must be followed until resolution unless, in the Investigator‚Äôs opinion the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the patients underlying disease, or the patient is lost to follow up (see Section 6.3.2 ) or until the patient starts new anti-cancer treatment. All new AEs and SAEs occurring during the 30 calendar days after the last dose of IPs must be reported (if SAEs, they must be reported to AstraZeneca within 24 hours as described in Section 6.4) and followed to resolution as above. For guidance on reporting AEs after the 30 day follow up period see Section 6.3.3 . All patients must be followed for survival, up to the data cut-off for the primary analysis.

AND if they are withdrawing consent for the use of any samples (tumor or blood) Data obtained prior to withdrawal of consent will be maintained in the clinical database and used in the study reporting (see Section 5.7.6 ). 3.10.1 Withdrawal of the informed consent Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (IPs and assessments), without prejudice to further treatment. A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. The Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study. If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then her enrollment code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. If the patient is lost to follow-up, the Investigator should make every reasonable effort to contact the patient or a responsible relative. Patients will be considered lost to follow-up only if no contact has been established at any time up to data cut-off for the primary analysis, such that there is insufficient information to determine the patient‚Äôs status at that time. Patients who refuse to continue participation in the study, including telephone contact, should be documented as ‚Äúwithdrawal of consent‚Äù rather th an ‚Äúlost to follow-up.‚Äù Investigators should document attempts to re-establis h contact with missing patien ts throughout the study period.

All patients must sign the Informed Consent Form and if applicable, any locally required privacy act document authorization must also be obtained prior to the start of any screening procedures. All screening procedures must be performed within 28 days before dosing (Day -28 to Day -1). Consenting patients are assessed (Table 5 ) to ensure that they meet eligibility criteria and to discontinue other therapies, if required (Section 3.1, Section 3.4). Patients who do not meet these criteria must not be entered into the study. All patients agree to provide a sample of their archival FFPE tumor sample (or approximately 20 unstained sections mounted on glass slides prepared from the block) from the primary or recurrent cancer for entry into this study, and a blood sample which may be used for a subsequent confirmatory BRCA mutation test using the Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx¬Ætest. If archival tumor sample is not available tumor sample from fresh biopsy is acceptable. 4.2 Treatment period Descriptions of the procedures for this period are included in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5 ) with exceptions of the following specific requirements for the treatment period: The Study conduct period starts at the time of admin istration of the first dose of IPs (cediranib plus olaparib). There is no maximum duration for taking IPs in this study. While on study treatment, patients will be required to attend study visits every week during the first 4 weeks, every 2 weeks during the next 4 weeks and every 4 weeks (¬± 3 days) thereafter. RECIST assessments will be pe rformed every 8 weeks (¬±1 week) after first doses of IPs until disease progression. Patients will continue the study treatments until: ‚àÄobjective radiological disease progression, as defined by RECIST 1.1 guidelines, ‚àÄunacceptable toxicity or ‚àÄdiscontinuation of IPs for other reasons (patient withdrawal of consent, physician discretion; see Section 3.9, Section 3.10 and Section 3.11). ‚àÄSevere non-compliance with the protocol. 4.3 Follow-up period If both study treatments are discontinued, patie nts should undergo the assessments required at the discontinuation visit (see Table 5 ), whether or not radiological disease progression has occurred. A safety follow-up visi t should be condu cted 30 days after the discontinuation visit. Any serious and/or non-serious AEs ongoing at this time should be followed-up to resolution or until, in the Investigator‚Äôs opinion, the cond ition is unlikely to improve or resolve due to RI"

Descriptions of the procedures for the follow-up visit are included in the Schedule of Assessment ( Table 5 ). Assessments in the post study treatments follow-up period (following discontinuation of IPs), depend on whether a patient discontinues study treatments in the presence or absence ofradiological disease progression. 4.3.1 Discontinu ation of study treatments due to disease progression If a patient discontinues IPs because of radiol ogical disease progression, she will be followed up for survival every 8 weeks (relative to first dose). Survival information may be obtained via telephone contact with the patient, patient‚Äôs family or by contact with the patient‚Äôs current physician. 4.3.2 Discontinuation of study treatments in the absence of disease progression If a patient discontinues IPs in the absence of radiological disease progression, RECIST assessments for disease progression should continue to be performed every 8 weeks (¬±1 week) until radiological disease progression or withdra wal of consent. Once a patient has radiological disease progression, she will be followed up as described in Section 4.3.1 above. Once patients have been discontinued from the IPs, other treatment options will be at the discretion of the Investigator. All subseque nt anti-cancer treatments should be recorded according to Section 7.8. If the patient is lost to follow-up, then this should be noted in the eCRF. 4.4 Final protocol visit Patients who continue to receive clinical benef it without meeting any discontinuation criteria during the study, will complete a FPV which will occur at their last scheduled visit prior to data cut-off for the primary analysis. Beyond the FPV, patients may continue to receive cediranib and/or olaparib if th ey are deriving clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator, and not fulfilling any discontinuation criteria. Beyond the FPV, patients continuing to receive IPs are to be treated as described in Section 4.5. 4.5 End of study The end of the study is defined as ‚Äòthe last visit of the last patient undergoing the study‚Äô (ie, last subject last visit [LSLV]) or when the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study. There will be a primary data cut-off defined at approximately 8 months (LSLV) after the last patient received her first dose of study treatment. This primary data cut-off will be followed by clinical database lock when all data for all patients have been collected. The primary data analysis will be performed and a Clinical Study Re port (CSR) written based on this data set. RI"

Beyond the FPV, patients may continue to receive cediranib and/or olaparib (to be provided by the Sponsor), if they are deriving clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator, and not fulfilling any discontinuation criteria. Such patients are to be followed in accordance with the Medical Standard of Care and as deemed appropriate by the Investigators. Seri ous adverse event reporting (on paper) will continue to ensure safety data collection and monitoring of the patients while receiving the investigational product. It is recommended th at investigators continue to observe ongoing patients at the frequency employed prior to the FPV. Protocol dose modification and stopping criteria are to be followed while a patient is receiving cediranib and/or olaparib. Restrictions regarding concomitant medications (Section 7.7) must be followed while the patient is receiving cediranib and/or olaparib. A change in the dose/schedule of cediranib and/or olaparib should only occur for safety reas ons, based on the Investigator‚Äôs judgement, and should generally follow the approach for dose reduction and discontinuation as described in this protocol. Combining cediranib and/or olaparib with other anti-cancer therapy is not allowed. If in the opinion of the investigator, a patient is no longer receiving clinical benefit from the IPs beyond the FPV, then the IPs will be stopped. The Investigator will inform AstraZeneca when a patient discontinues the IPs. Patients must return unused medication during routine clinic visits; drug accountability information must continue to be collected in patient source documents until the patient discontinues treatment. Patients will continue to be monitored for all SAEs and pregnancies while receiving IPs and for 30 days after the last dose of IPs. 5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS The RAVE Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection. The investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs as specified in the study protocol and in accordance with the eCRF completion guidelines. The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded in the eCRF and the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA). The Investigator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site. 5.1 Efficacy assessments 5.1.1 Tumor assessments by CT or MRI scans Radiological assessment should use the s ame modality of imaging throughout the trial. Contrast-enhanced CT scan is preferred but MRI is acceptable where CT is contraindicated. Please refer to the Image Acquisition Guidelines and Site Operations Manual for a quick reference guide for image acquisition and data handling. RI"

Follow-up CT/ MRI tumor assessments will cover chest (in those patients with disease in the chest or upper abdomen lymphadenopathy at baseline), abdomen and pelvis with any other regions imaged at baseline where disease was present. Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged. Radiological examinations performed in the condu ct of this study should be retained at site as source data. Copies of all imaging assessments including unscheduled visit scans will be collected on an ongoing basis and sent to Contract Research Organization (CRO) for ICR (see Section 5.1.3 ). All treatment decisions will be based on Investigator assessment of scans. All patients will have RECIST 1.1 tumor assessments at screening (within 28 days prior to the date of first dose of IPs) and thereafter every 8 weeks (¬±1 week) relative to the date of first dose of IPs (Table 5 ) until objective radi ological disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 and as determined by the Investigator, or unless they withdraw consent. Objective radiological response on treatment (CR or PR) will need to be confirmed during next RECIST 1.1 visit assessment. If a patient discontinues IPs for any reason other than disease progression or withdrawal of consent, RECIST 1.1 assessments should continue as per protocol schedule until evidence of objective radiological progression or withdrawal of consent (see Section 4.3). It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible. If scans are performed outside of scheduled visit (¬±1 week window) and the patient has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent scans at their scheduled time points. 5.1.2 Tumor evaluation RECIST 1.1 will be used to assess progression and patient response to treatment by determining ORR, DCR, DoR and PFS. The RECIST 1.1 guidelines for measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions (N TLs) and the objective tumor response criteria (CR, PR, SD or PD) are presented in Appendix F. Categorization of objective tumor response assessment will be based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria of response: CR, PR, SD or PD. Target lesion progression will be calculated in comparison with when the tumor burden was at a minimum (ie, smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study). In the absence of progression, tumor response (CR, PR, or SD) will be calculated in comparison with the baseline tumor measurements obtained before starting treatment. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 1.1 criteria. For this study, a rise in CA-125 al one is not sufficient to declare progression, and progression events should be determined by radiographic evidence of progression. If the Investigator is in doubt as to whether progression has occurred, particularly with response to NTLs or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue treatment until  RI"

If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial scan should be declared as the date of progression. To achieve ‚Äòunequivocal progression‚Äô on the basis of non -target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest ‚Äòincrease‚Äô in the size of one or more NTLs is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 5.1.3 Central reading of scans An independent review of all scans used in the assessment of tumors using RECIST 1.1 will be conducted. Copies of all imaging assessments including unscheduled visit scans will be collected on an ongoing basis and sent to an AstraZeneca appointed CRO for central analysis. If a patient had tumor biopsy during screening, but after the baseline RECIST scan, information on which lesion was biopsied will be provided to ICR so that such lesion is not chosen as the target lesion. Results of this independent review will not be communicated to Investigators, and the management of patients will be based solely upon the results of the RECIST assessment conducted by the Investigator. The primary analysis of ORR will be based on ICR assessment. 5.1.4 Survival assessment Assessments for survival should be made every 8 weeks (relative to first dose) following objective disease progression or discontinuation fr om treatment. Survival information may be obtained via telephone contact with the patient, patient‚Äôs family or by contact with the patient‚Äôs current physician. OS will be analyzed at the time of the primary analysis; patients should be contacted or other data sources checked (see Section 3.10.2) in the 2 weeks following the data cut-off for the primary analysis to provide current complete survival data. Subsequent anti-cancer therapies should also be recorded. 5.2 Safety assessments 5.2.1 Laboratory safe ty assessments Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be taken at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (see Section 4). Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator. The date, time of collection and results (values, units and reference ranges) will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.

A rise in CA-125 alone is not sufficient to declare progression, and discontinue IPs; progression events should be determined by radiographic evidence of progression, see Section 5.1.2 . Further assessment of CA 125 post radiologi cal progression will be at the discretion of the investigator according to local clinical practice. For blood volume see Section 5.8.1 . 5.2.1.4 Urinalysis Urinalysis by dipstick should be performed as stated in Schedule of Assessments in Table 5 . Microscopic analysis should be performed by the hospital‚Äôs local laboratory if required. If appropriate, a spot urine protein-creatinine ratio may be performed. Patient with urine protein ‚â•3.5 g/24 hours (CTCAE Grade 3 according to CTCAE v4) or urinary protein/creatinine ratio of >3.5 should be considered as nephrotic-range proteinuria.

Confirm if the patient had a normal renal function at baseline (creatinine ‚â§ULN) ! Check if the patient has reported any of the following as a treatment-emergent and concurrent AE: hypoalbuminemia (laboratory value albumin <3 g/dL, or an AE of hypoalbuminemia CTCAE Grade ‚â• 2); edema (any); dyslipidemia (hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia); hyperlipidemia; or a thrombotic event.

Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained after the patient has been rested in a supine position for at least 5 minutes in each case. The Investigator or designated physician will review the paper copies of each of the timed 12-lead ECGs on each of the study days when they are collected. ECGs will be recorded at 25 mm/sec. All ECGs should be assessed by the investigator as to whether they are clinically significantly abnormal / not clinically significantly abnormal. If there is a clinically significant abnormal finding at baseline, the Investigator should record this in the baseline eCRF. If there is a treatment emergent significant abnormal finding, the Investigator will record it as an AE on the eCRF. The original ECG traces must be stored in the patient medical record as source data. 5.2.4 Vital signs Any clinically significant changes in vital signs should be recorded as an AE. For information on how AEs based on changes in vital signs should be recorded and reported, see Section 6.3. 5.2.4.1 Pulse and blood pressure Since rapid changes in BP can occur with ce diranib treatment with the potential for life- threatening complications if hypertension is not appropriately managed, all patients should check their BP twice daily for at least the first 8 weeks after starting IPs, or, if antihypertensive management is required, until a stable anti-hypertensive regimen has been established, even if this requires more than 8 weeks. After 8 weeks or once a stable regimen has been achieved, BP monitoring may be reduced to once daily. Twice daily monitoring should be re-implemented after any cediranib dose interruption for at least two w eeks or until the patient is re-established on a stable antihypertensive regimen, whichever takes longer. RI"

Patient BP will be measured during routine study visits: weekly during the first 4 weeks, every 2 weeks during the next 4 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter to ensure that BP guidelines are being correctly followed. During routine study visits, BP and pulse rate will be measured preferably using a semi-automatic BP recording device with an a ppropriate c uff size after 10 minutes rest. For timings of assessments refer to the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 5 ). The date of collection and measurement will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 5.2.4.2 Body temperature Body temperature will be measured in degrees Celsius according to local practice at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 5 ; vital signs). The date of collection and measurement will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 5.2.5 Other safety assessments 5.2.5.1 Serum or urine pregnancy test Pregnancy tests on blood or urine samples will be performed only for pre-menopausal women of childbearing potential, within 7 days prior to the start of IPs, every 4 weeks thereafter during study treatment. Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential is required at the FPV and every 4 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. Tests will be performed by the hospital‚Äôs local laboratory. If results are pos itive the patient is ineligible and must not be recruited into the study. A confirmed pregnancy during the study conduct must be recorded in eCRF and immediately reported; the patient will be discontinued from the IPs, but should continue in the study. 5.3 Other assessments 5.3.1 Clinical Ou tcome Assessments PROs is an umbrella term referring to all outcomes and symptoms that are directly reported by the patient. PROs have become a significant endpoint when evaluating effectiveness of treatments in clinical trials. The following PROs will be administered: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30, QLQ OV28, and Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE; see Appendix K). 5.3.1.1 EORTC QLQ C30 and EORTC QLQ OV28 The EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed by the EORTC Quality of Life Group 1993.

The QLQ-OV28 is a module which is sp ecific for ovarian cancer. It consists of 28 items assessing abdominal/GI symptoms (6 items), peripheral neuropathy (2 items), other chemotherapy side effects (5 items), hormonal symptoms (2 items), body image (2 items), attitudes to disease/treatment (3 items), sexuality (4 items), and four other single items. 5.3.1.2 PRO-CTCAE The Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) system has been devel oped by the NCI. PRO-CTCAE is an item-bank of symptoms experienced by patients while undergoing treatment of their cancer. It was developed in recognition that collecting symptom data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symptomatic AE data collection. This was based on findings from multiple studies demonstrating that physicians and nurses underestimate symptom onset, frequency, and severity in comparison with patient ratings (Basch et al 2009 ; Basch et al 2014 ; Litwin et al 1999 ; Sprangers and Aaronson 1992 ). To date, 81 symptoms of the CTCAE (version 4) have been identified to be amenable to patient reporting. These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (eg, CTCAE term ‚Äúmyalgia‚Äù converted to ‚Äúaching muscles‚Äù). For several symptoms, like fatigue and pain, additional questions are asked about symptom frequency, severity, and interference with usual activities. For other symptoms like rash, additional questions focus on the presence on the body. The items included in the PRO-CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative review among experts and patients. These items and the additional quest ions for some of the symptoms have been extensively evaluated by cancer patients, using cognitive testing methods, to be clear, comprehendible, and measure the symptom of inte rest. Not all items are administered in any one clinical trial. The intention is to only ask patients to complete those items which are considered relevant for the trial, site of cancer, and cancer treatment (see Appendix K). The following 6 PRO-CTCAE AEs will be collected in the study: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, and dizziness. In addition to these items from the PRO-CTCAE item bank, the following additional item will be asked together with the PRO-CTCAE items: ""In the last 7 days, how much did LOOSE OR WATERY STOOLS (DIARRHEA) INTERFERE with your usual or daily activities?"" 5.3.1.3 Administration of PRO questionnaires Patients will complete the PRO assessments at home and at site using the same handheld electronic device (ePRO).

Similarly, during the post-progression period, subjects should complete ePROs at home or at the study site if a scheduled visit coincides with the time point. If subjects have had scans or other tests at an outside fa cility or missed a scheduled data collection site visit, ePROs should st ill be completed by the subject at home for that scheduled visit within the window period. The Investigator will arrange for relevant training in the set-up of the electronic device and training patients in how to self-administer the questionnaires using the electronic device. Subjects should complete the questionnaires in accordance with the study schedule (see Table 5 ). The significance and relevance of the data should be explained carefully to participating subjects so that they are motivated to comply with data collection. Reminders should be sent to subjects at home as needed to ensure compliance with the assessment schedules. The following best practice guidelines should be followed when collecting PRO data via an electronic device: ! PRO questionnaires must be completed prior to any other study procedures (following informed consent) and before discussion of disease progression to avoid bias in patient‚Äôs responses to the questions. ! When each instrument is due to be completed, the following order for completion should be ensured: EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-OV28, PRO-CTCAE. ! PRO questionnaires must be completed by the subject in private. ! The research nurse or appointed site staff must explain to subject the value and relevance of study participation and inform them that these questions are being asked to find out, directly from them, how they feel. The research nurse or appointed site staff should also stress that the information is confidential. Therefore, if the subjects have any medical problems, they should discuss them wi th the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment. ! The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the subject on how to use the ePRO device, using the materials and training provided by the RI"

The research nurse or appointed site staff should remind subjects that there are no right or wrong answers. ! The research nurse or appointed staff must avoid clarifying items in order to avoid bias. ! The subject must not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to answer the PRO questionnaires. If a subject uses visual aids (eg, spectacles or contact lenses) for reading and does not have them when he attends the clinic, the subject will be exempted from completing the PROs. ! Site staff must not read or complete the PRO questionnaires on behalf of the subject. If the subject is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind or illiterate), that subject is exempted from completing PRO questionnaires and may still participate in the study. Subjects exempted in this regard should be flagged appropriately by the site staff. ! The subject should be given sufficient time to complete the PRO questionnaires at her own speed. The research nurse or appointed site staff must monitor compliance to ensure all data is captured. Compliance must be checked at each st udy visit to identify problems early. If a subject‚Äôs compliance drops below 85%, they will be flagged in the routine compliance report generated by the ePRO system and a check-in call from the site to ask the subject if she has any difficulties is highly recommended. 5.3.2 Exploratory Immunol ogic/Molecular Assessments Assessment of somatic deleterious or suspected deleterious variant in BRCA genes ( BRCA1 or BRCA2 ) or in HRR-associated genes, and potential homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), including genomic scarring, BRCA1 methylation, and other genes that might modify HRD, using current and/or potential future tumor based assays including, but not limited to, BRCA or HRR gene mutations may be carried out.

For patients who meet the trial eligibility criteria, but do not know their BRCA mutation status, or whose gBRCA status was determined using a local test conducted in a local laboratory which was not appropriately accredited laboratory, or where the BRCA test result is non- mutant but did not include comprehensive sequencing and large rearrangement analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 , a blood sample for the Myriad BRCA test can be taken once all local ethical procedures (eg, genetic counselling) for such testing have been completed. When the result from the Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx¬Ætest indicates the patient has no evidence of a deleterious or susp ected deleterious germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, the patient can be entered into the study. Residual blood (or its derivatives) may be used to develop and validate future BRCA companion diagnostic tests and for additional e xploratory work, to elucidate the mechanism of response, understand the mode of action of study treatment, and improve the understanding of disease recurrence. 5.7.2 Collection of biomarkers biological samples Biological samples (archived tumor samples and blood sa mples) will be collected only from patients who are eligible to start study treatment and will be analyzed for exploratory biomarkers to assess correlations with diseas e activity, effects of study drug, clinical outcomes and toxicity: !

The results of this biomarker res earch will be reported either in the CSR itself or as an addendum, or separately in a scientific report or publication. The results of this biomarker research may be pooled with biomarker data from other studies with the study drug to generate hypotheses to be tested in future research. 5.7.4 Labelling and shipment of biological samples The Investigator ensures that samples are labelled and shipped in accordance with the Laboratory Manual and the Biological Substance, Category B Regulations (materials containing or suspected to contain infectious substances that do not meet Category A criteria), see Appendix C ‚ÄòIATA 6.2 Guidance Document‚Äô. Any samples identified as Infectious Cate gory A materials are not shipped and no further samples will be taken from the patient unless agreed with AstraZeneca and appropriate labelling, shipment and containment provisions are approved. 5.7.5 Chain of custody of biological samples A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle. The Investigator at each center keeps full traceability of collected biological samples from the patients while in storage at the center until shipment or disposal (where appropriate).The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival. AstraZeneca keeps oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of study sites and auditing of external laboratory providers. Samples retained for further use are registered in the AstraZeneca Biobank system during the entire life cycle. 5.7.6 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of/destroyed, and the action docu mented.

However, the volume of blood to be drawn from each patient (including for PK samples) during screening and up to and including Week 8 should not exceed 154 mL, according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidance ( NIH guidance 2009 ). The total volume of blood to be drawn from each patient in the study, assuming they complete screening, 48 weeks of treatment, a treatment discontinuation visit and the 30-day follow-up visit, should not exceed 335 mL. The procedures for the collection, handling, and shipping of laboratory samples are specified in the Sample Handling and Logistics Manual supplied to sites. Safety laboratory assessments will be performed locally by means of their established methods. The number of samples/blood volumes is therefore subject to site-specific change. Extra blood samples may also be collected if, for example, additional samples are required for repeat safety assessments. RI"

SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT The PI is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. 6.1 Definition of adverse events An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laborat ory findings, ECG). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no IPs have been administered. The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs. 6.1.1 Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are events of scientific and medical interest specific to the further understanding of the safety profiles of cediranib and olaparib; AESIs require close monitoring and rapid communication by th e investigators to AstraZeneca. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. ! AESIs for cediranib are the Important Identified Risks: PRES, arterial thromboembolic events, and the Important Potential Risks: symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and cardiac failure; nephrotic syndrome; renal thrombotic microangiopathy and liver failure. ! AESIs for olaparib are the Important Potential Risks of MDS/AML, new primary malignancy (other than MDS/AML) and pneumonitis. 6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: ! Results in death (NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event) ! Is immediately life-threatening (NOTE: the term ‚ÄúLife-Threatening‚Äù refers to an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe) ! Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization RI"

Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions ! Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect ! Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix B to the Clinical Study Protocol. The full requirements of the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to. 6.3 Recording of adverse events 6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events SAEs will be collected from time of signature of informed consent throughout the treatment period up to and including the 30-day follow-up period. AEs will be collected between the date of the first dose of IPs and the end of th e 30-day follow-up period. All ongoing and any new AEs/SAEs identified during the 30 calendar days follow up period, af ter the last dose of IPs must be followed to resolution, unl ess resolution is unlikely to occur. 6.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events Any SAE or non-serious adverse event that is ongoing at the time of the 30-day follow up, must be followed up to resoluti on unless the event is considered by the investigator to be unlikely to resolve, or the patient is lost to follow up. AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 6.3.3 Adverse events after the 30 day follow up period For olaparib pharmacovigilance purposes and characterization of events of special interest, any case of MDS/AML or new primary malignancy occurring after the 30 day follow up period should be reported to AstraZeneca Patient Safety whether it is considered a non-serious AE (eg, non-melanoma skin cancer) or SAE, and regardless of investigator‚Äôs assessment of causality. These AEs must be reported according to the timelines for reporting an SAE (see Section 6.4). Investigators will be asked during the regular follow up for OS if the patient has developed MDS/AML or a new primary malignancy and prompted to report any such cases. A questionnaire will be sent to any investigator reporting MDS/AML, pneumonitis, or new primary malignancy as an aid to provide detailed information on the case. At any time after a patient has completed the study, if an Investigator learns of any SAE or death, unrelated to SAEs of special interest, and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the ev ent is causally related to the IPs, the Investigator should notify AstraZeneca, Patient Safety. RI"

Otherwise, after end of study there is no obligation to actively report information on new AEs or SAEs occurring in former study patients. This includes new AEs/SAEs in patients still being followed up for survival but who have completed the post treatment follow up period (30 days). 6.3.4 Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE; ! AE verbatim ! The date when the AE started and stopped ! Changes in CTCAE grade will be reported for AEs of diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension and nausea.

Probable cause of death ! Date of death ! Autopsy performed ! Causality assessment in relation to IPs and/or Study procedure(s). Investigators are also required to complete targeted safety questionnaires should any of the following events be reported: MDS/AML, new primary malignancy or pneumonitis. The grading scales found in the NCI CTCAE version 4.03 will be utilized for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading. For those events without assigned CTCAE grades the recommendation is that the CTCAE criteria that convert mild, moderate and severe events into CTCAE grades should be used. A copy of NCI CTCAE version 4.03 is available at http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf. Adverse events not listed by CTCAE version 4.03 will be graded using the following criteria: Intensity rating scale:1 mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)2 moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities) 3 severe (incapacitating, with inab ility to perform normal activities) Alternative intensity rating scale for in-patients: 4 mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 5 moderate (disturbing but still tolerable) 6 severe (intolerable).It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 6.2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2. RI"

Causal relationship will also be assessed for other (ie, other than one of study IPs) medication and study procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‚Äòyes‚Äô. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix B to the Clinical Study Protocol. 6.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or care provider reported in response to the open question from the study personnel: ‚Äò Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked ?‚Äô, or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the rec ording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms; for example, for vomiting, nausea, fever, please consider providing diagnosis if available, as 1 AE of ‚Äògastroenteritis‚Äô if appropriate, instead of 3 separate AEs. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, th e diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 6.3.7 Adverse events based on examinations and tests The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the CSR. Deterioration as compared with baselin e in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs and ECG abnormalities should only be reported as AEs or SAEs if one of the following is met: ! Any criterion for an AE or SAE is fulfilled ! Causes discontinuation of IPs ! Causes IP interruption ! Causes IP dose reduction ! The abnormality is considered clinically significant by the Investigator If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clini cal signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information.

Deterioration of a baseline laboratory value or condition, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. 6.3.8 Hy‚Äôs Law Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ‚â• 3xULN together with total bilirubin ‚â• 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix D for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy‚Äôs Law. 6.3.9 Disease progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient‚Äôs condition attributable to the disease for which the IPs are being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in th e signs and symptoms of the cancer. The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study. 6.3.10 New cancers The development of a new primary cancer (including skin cancer) should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet at least one of the SAE criteria (see Section 6.2). New primary cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the IPs and have developed after the inclusion of the patient into the study. They do not include metastases of the original cancer. Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are considered to be disease progression. 6.3.11 Lack of efficacy When there is deterioration in the cancer, for which the IPs are being used, there may be uncertainty as to whether this is lack of efficacy or an AE. In such cases, unless the Sponsor or the reporting physician considers that the IPs contributed to the deterioration of the condition, or local regulations state to the contrary, the deterioration should be considered to be a lack of efficacy and not an AE. 6.3.12 Deaths All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol-defined 30-day post-st udy follow-up period after the administration of the last dose of IPs, must be reported as follows: ! Death clearly the result of disease progre ssion should be documented in the DEATH eCRF but should not be reported as an SAE.  RI"

Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease under study, the AE causing the death must be reported to the study monitor as a SAE within 24 hours (see Section 6.4for further details). The report should contain a comment regarding the co-involvement of progression of disease, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory cause s of death. This information can be captured in the ‚Äòdeath eCRF‚Äô. Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE. A post mortem maybe helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy of the post-mortem results should be forwarded to Ast raZeneca within the usual timeframes. 6.4 Reporting of serious adverse events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IPs, or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). For patients who continue to receive clinical benefit and IP after data cut-off, investigators will continue to report all SAEs to AstraZeneca Patient Safety until 30 days after study treatment is discontinued (Section 6.3.1 ). As the clinical study database will have closed, investigators should complete paper SAE forms and fax them directly to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety Data Entry site for entering onto the AstraZeneca Patient Safety database. Drug accountability s hould conti nue to be performed until the patient stops study treatment completely. If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators, or other site personnel, inform the appropriate AstraZeneca represen tatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately. Investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative.

Contact details are provided separately in the Investigator Study File. The reference documents for definition of expectedness/listedness are the IBs for cediranib and olaparib. 6.5 Overdose The use of IPs in doses in excess of that specified in the protocol is considered to be an overdose. Approximately 290 patients have received cediranib at dose levels of 45 mg or higher. At these higher dose levels the cediranib safety profile was similar to that observed at lower dose levels of 20 mg. In cases of suspected overdose, cediranib should be paused, BP monitored and if needed, supportive care instituted. There is no specific treatment for cediranib overdose. At the discretion of the Investigator, re-starting cediranib at the recommended dose can be considered. There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose with olaparib and possible symptoms of overdose are not established. In the event of an overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and AEs associated with overdose should be treated symptomatically. Any dose, or frequency of dosing, that exceeds the dose regimen specified in the study protocol should be reported as an overdose. The maximum tolerated dose is 300 mg bd for the tablet formulation. ! An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE eCRF, including the Overdose section of the eCRF. ! An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose section of the eCRF. If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site. For overdoses associated with a SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply, see Section 6.4. For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days. 6.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca. RI"

The efficacy of hormonal contraceptives ma y be reduced if co-administered with cediranib (see Section 3.8); therefore, an additional non- hormonal contraceptive method should be used during treatment (see Appendix J) and pregnancy tests performed as required per SOA See Table 5). Should a pregnancy still occur, the IPs should be discontinued immediately and the pregnancy reported to AstraZeneca. Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspicion that the IPs under study may have interfered with the e ffectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose of study medication until 6 weeks after the last dose of study medication should be followed up and documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study. If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the st udy, then the Investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZen eca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 5 calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies. The same timelines apply when outcome information is available. The PREGREP module in the eCRF is used to report the pregnancy and the PREGOUT is used to report the outcome of the pregnancy. 6.7 Medication Error For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that either causes harm to the Patient or has the potential to cause harm to the Patient. A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or Patient. Medication error includes situations where an error: ! occurred ! was identified and intercepted before the patient received the drug RI"

Primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is not recommended (Mountzios et al 2016). They do not alleviate fatigue or increase energy. They should not be used in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. The package inserts should be consulted. If a patient develops febrile neutropenia, IPs should be stopped and appropriate management including G-CSF should be given according to local hospital guidelines. Please note that G-CSF should not be used within at least 24 hours of the last dose of olaparib unless absolutely necessary. Platelet transfusions, if indicated, should be done according to local hospital guidelines. 6.8.1.2 Dose modifications for hematologic toxicity Patients who have IPs held for hematologic toxicities should have blood counts and differentials checked at least weekly until recovery; these data should be recorded in eCRF as extra laboratory examinations. If counts do not improve to CTCAE Grade 1 or better despite drug cessation for 3 weeks, patients should be referred to a hematologist for further assessment. A bone marrow analysis should be considered per hematology assessment. For AEs that are unrelated to the study drug, study drug may be withheld for up to 3 weeks at the discretion of the treating Investigator.

In clinical trials, increases in BP have been reported within a few hours of starting cediranib. Since rapid changes in blood pressure can occur with cediranib treatment, with the potential for life-threatening complications if hypertension is not appropriately managed, all patients should check their BP twice daily for at least the first 8 weeks after starting cediranib, or, if antihypertensive management is required, until a stable anti-hypertensive regimen has been established, even if this requires more than 8 weeks. After 8 weeks or once a stable regimen has been achieved, BP monitoring may be reduced to once daily. Twice daily monitoring should be re-implemented after any cediranib dose interruption for 2 weeks or until the patient is re-established on a stable antihypertensive regimen, whichever takes longer. Patient BP will also be measured during routine st udy visits: weekly during the first 4 weeks, every 2 weeks during the next 4 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter, to ensure that BP guidelines are being correctly followed. Increase in BP should be treated promptly with standard antihypertensive therapy, ens uring that the maximum recommended dose and number of antihypertensive medicinal products is reached before considering cediranib dose adjustment. See Appendix G for suggested antihypertensive medications by class. Patients may have up to 4 drugs for management of hype rtension prior to any dose reduction in cediranib. If patients require a delay of > 3 weeks for management of hypertension, discontinuation of cediranib or protocol therapy may be consider ed after discussion with the PI and the AstraZeneca study physician. In case of persistent or severe hypertension, despite the optimal use of antihypertensive medicinal products and cediranib dose reduction, cediranib should be permanently discontinued. Patients already taking antihypertensive therap y at baseline or those aged 75 years or older are at a higher risk of having elevated BP or may require more than one medicinal product or more intensive therapy. Pre-existing cardiov ascular risks should be assessed and managed, and pre-existing hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting treatment with cediranib. Note: Stopping or reducing the dose of cediranib is expected to cause a decrease in BP. The treating physician should monitor the patient for hypotension and adjust the number and dose of antihypertensive medications accordingly.  RI"

Diarrhea usually starts early (within the first 4 weeks of treatment), however, it can occur at any time during treatment. Management of diarrhea should start at the first sign of diarrhea. Loperamide and advice on how to manage diarrhea should be readily available to patients from the start of cediranib treatment so that they can be applied at first episode of diarrhea. Active and early management of diarrhea is recommended even with Grade 1 diarrhea. Management is as shown in Table 13 : Table 13 Management of Diarrhea Toxicity Management/Modifications Initial grade 1 or 2 diarrhea Patients should start loperamide (per standard practice) and continue to take loperamide until patients are free from diarrhea for at least 12 hours. The dose of loperamide should not exceed 16 mg in a 24-hour period. Patients should also be counselled to start a BRAT diet. If diarrhea persists despite 24 hours of loperamide treatment, withhold cediranib for a maximum of 7 days, continue loperamide, and maintain hydration. Cediranib may be restarted at the same dose once patients have been free from diarrhea for 12 hours.

Fatigue experienced by patients taking cediranib may be rapid in onset. During clinic visits, patients fatigue levels should be discussed. Patients should seek medical advice early if Grade 2 fatigue develops (moderate fatigue causing di fficulty performing some activities of daily living). Care should be taken to ensure that the nutritional status of the patients is optimized and patients should be encouraged to drink plenty of fluids. Patients should be encouraged to manage fatigue by alternating periods of rest with light aerobic exercise, which may improve the symptoms in some cases. Consideration should be given to other possible causes of fatigue (eg, thyroid function, depression/insomnia and other concomitant medicinal products). Additionally, short interruption of cedir anib dosing (initially 2-3 days-or longer-up to a maximum of 21 days) may help relieve fatigue. When symptoms improve cediranib should be restarted with the same dose or, if necessary, a dose reduction can be considered. 6.8.3.4 Proteinuria Proteinuria is a common adverse reaction reported for cediranib and if this occurs during treatment, it should be managed according to Table 14.

PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances, and can be fatal. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. In patients developing PRES, treatment of specific symptoms including control of BP is recommended. Confirmation of PRES requires brain imaging, preferably MRI. Cediranib should be discontinued following confirmation of PRES.

In the ovarian cancer population, vaginal fistula has been uncommonly reported in cediranib treated patients. Cediranib should be used with caution in patients at risk of fistula and discontinuation of cediranib should be considered in patients who develop fistulae. 6.8.3.10 Arterial thromboembolism Arterial thromboembolic events (including transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke) have been reported in clinical studies with cediranib.

Cediranib should be permanen tly discontinued in patients who develop an arterial thromboembolic event. 6.8.3.11 Venous thromboembolism Venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have been commonly reported in patients treated with cediranib. Anticoagulant treatment should be started in accordance with clinical practice. Discontinuation of cediranib may be considered. Cediranib should be used with caution in patients at risk of venous thromboembolism. 6.8.3.12 Wound healing Treatment with cediranib should be stopped at least 2 weeks prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume cediranib therapy after surgery s hould be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. In patients who experience wound healing complications during therapy, treatment with cediranib should be interrupted until the wound is fully healed. No formal studies of the effect of cediranib on wound healing have been conducted; however, in the ICON6 pivotal study there was no evidence of an increase in wound healing complications in cediranib treated patients compared with placebo. 6.8.3.13 Elderly There is a limited amount of safety data available for cediranib use in patients aged 75 years and older. Based on a population PK analysis, the clearance of cediranib decreased with age, however, no dose adjustment is needed given the small impact on exposure or variability. Caution should be taken when treating patients who are aged 75 years or older with cediranib. In case of toxicity dose pause or dose reduction may be considered. 6.8.3.14 Mild/moderate renally impaired patients Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment discontinued cediranib more often due to adverse events, particularly when cediranib was co-administered with chemotherapy. Population PK analysis showed that no adjustment of cediranib dose is required in this population as cediranib is minimally renally cleared; however, cediranib clearance may be decreased in patients with low body weight. In the ICON6 pivotal study, patients with mild or moderate impairment had lower median body w eight compared with patients with normal renal function. Caution shoul d be exercised in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment and a cediranib dose adjustment should be considered in case of signs of toxicity. For information on use of olaparib in renally-impaired patients, please see Section 6.8.4.4 6.8.3.15 Weight decreased In the ICON6 study, weight decreased was very commonly reported in cediranib treated patients. Weight loss ( ‚â•7%) in cediranib-treated patients was associated with higher incidence of decreased appetite, vomiting and stomatitis, although these events were also commonly reported in patients who did not lose weight. RI"

Following investigation, if no evidence of abnormality is observed on CT imaging and symptoms resolve, then IP(s) can be restarted, if deemed appropriate by the investigator. If significant pulmonary abnormalities are identified, these need to be discussed with the Study Physician. 6.8.4.3 Management of nausea and vomiting Events of nausea and vomiting are known to be associated with olaparib treatment. In study D0810C00019 nausea was reported in 71% of the olaparib treated patients and 36% in the placebo treated patients and vomiting was reported in 34% of the olaparib treated patients and 14% in the placebo treated patients. These events are generally mild to moderate (CTCAE Grade 1 or 2) severity, intermittent and manageable on continued treatment. The first onset generally occurs in the first month of treatment for nausea and within the first 6 months of treatment for vomiting. For nausea, the incidence generally plateaus at around 9 months, and for vomiting at around 6 to 7 months. No routine prophylactic anti-emetic treatment is required at the start of treatment with the IPs, however, patients should receive appropriate anti-emetic treatment at the first onset of nausea or vomiting and as required thereafter, in accordance with local treatment practice guidelines. Taking olaparib tablets with food may help alleviate symptoms of nausea and vomiting. As per international guidance on anti-emetic use in cancer patients (European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO], NCCN), generally a single agent antiemetic should be considered eg, dopamine receptor antagonist, antihistamines or dexamethasone. 6.8.4.4 Management of renal impairment If subsequent to study entry and while still on study treatments, a patient‚Äôs estimated creatinine clearance (CrCL) falls below the threshold for study inclusion (<50 mL/min), retesting should be performed promptly. A dose reduction of olaparib is recommended for patients who develop moderate renal impairment (calculated CrCL by Cockcroft-Gault equation of ‚â•31 mL/min and ‚â§50 mL/min) for any reason during the course of the study: the dose of olaparib should be reduced to 150 mg bd.  RI"

Olaparib has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL‚â§30 mL/minutes) or end-stage renal disease; if patients develop severe impairment or end stage disease is it recommended that olaparib be discontinued. For information on use of cediranib in renally-impaired patients, please see Section 6.8.3.14 . 6.8.5 Interruptions for intercurrent non-toxicity related events IP(s) dose interruption for conditions other than t oxicity resolution should be kept as short as possible. If a patient cannot restart IP(s) within 3 weeks for resolution of intercurrent conditions not related to disease progression or tox icity, the case should be discussed with AstraZeneca study physician. All dose reductions and interruptions (including any missed doses), and the reasons for the reductions/interruptions are to be recorded in the eCRF. Both IPs should be stopped at least 2 weeks prior to planned surgery. After surgery both IPs can be restarted when the wound has healed. No stoppage of IPs is required for any needle biopsy procedure. Both IPs should be discontinued for a minimum of 3 days before a patient undergoes radiation treatment. Both IPs should be restarted within 3 weeks as long as any bone marrow toxicity has recovered. Because the AEs related to olaparib may include asthenia, fatigue and dizziness, patients should be advised to use caution while driving or using machinery if these symptoms occur. 7.

Cediranib oxidative metabolism appears to be mediated by flavin-containing monooxygenase enzymes FMO1 and FMO3 and glucuronidation by UGT1A4. Co-administration of cediranib with strong inducers of PgP/UGT decrease cediranib plasma concentrations; therefore, use of potent inducers of UGT/PgP (eg, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin and St. John Wort) should be avoided if possible. Cediranib is a substrate of MDR1 (Pgp), and possible substrate of breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP). Cediranib is not an inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3, but it has a low potential to inhibit MDR1 (Pgp), BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1. The clinical impact of this finding is unknown. Cediranib may act as an inhibitor of renal tubular MATE2-K, this could increase exposure of co-administered agents such metformin or to endogenous agents such as creatinine; however, the ICON6 study showed that increases of blood creatinine caused by 20 mg/day cediranib treatment were infrequent (4.4%) and only mild in severity, suggesting the clinical impact of renal tubular MATE2-K inhibition by cediranib is small. Olaparib and CYP 3A4/5 enzymes CYP3A4/5 are the isozymes predominantly responsible for the metabolic clearance of olaparib. Clinical studies to evaluate the impact of known CYP3A inhibitors and inducers have shown that co-administration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased olaparib maximum plasma concentration (C max) 1.42-fold (90% CI: 1.33-1.52) and increased mean area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) 2.70-fold (90% CI: 2.44-2.97); co- administration of a strong CYP inducer decreased C maxby 71% (treatment ratio: 0.29; 90% CI: 0.24-0.33) and mean AUC by 87% (treatment ratio: 0.13; 90% CI: 0.11-0.16). Consequently, to ensure patient safety, the follo wing potent inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 must not be used during this study for any patient receiving olaparib (eg, itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, boosted protease inhibitors, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate inhibitors (ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil) of this isozyme should not be taken with the IPs in this study. Strong CYP 3A4/5 inducers (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine, enzalutamide and St John‚Äôs Wort) and moderate inducers CYP 3A4 inducers (eg, bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil) should not be taken with the IPs in this study. After enrollment if the use of any potent inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 are considered necessary for the patient‚Äôs safety and welfare, the investigator must contact the AstraZeneca Study Physician. A decision to allow the patient to continue in the study will be made on a case-by-case basis. RI"

Based on limited in vitro data, olaparib may reduce the exposure to substrates of 2B6. Caution should be observed if substrates of these isoenzymes or transporter proteins are co-administered. Anticoagulant Therapy Patients who are taking warfarin may participate in this trial; however, it is recommended that prothrombin time (International Normalized Ratio [INR] and activated partial thromboplastin time) be monitored carefully at least once per week for the first month, then monthly if the INR is stable. Subcutaneous heparin and low molecular weight heparin are permitted. Anti-emetics/Anti-diarrheal From screening onwards, should a patient develop nausea, vomiting and / or diarrhea, then these symptoms should be reported as AEs (see Section 6.3) and appropriate treatment of the event given. Palliative radiotherapy Palliative RT may be used for the treatment of pain at the site of bony metastases that were present at baseline, provided the investigator does not feel that these are indicative of clinical disease progression during the study period. Bot h IPs should be discontinued for a minimum of 3 days before a patient undergoes therapeutic palliative radiation treatment. Both IPs should be restarted within 4 weeks as long as any bone marrow toxicity has recovered. Administration of other anti-cancer agents Patients must not receive any other concurrent anti-cancer therapy, including investigational agents, while on one or both IPs. Patients may continue the use of bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone disease and corticosteroids for the symptomatic control of brain metastases provided the dose is stable before and during the study and they were started at least 4 weeks prior to the first doses of IPs. RI"

After discontinuation of IPs, the inve stigator will be at liberty to define further most appropriate anti-cancer treatment. Information on subsequent PARP and VEGF inhibitors and other anti-cancer therapies should be recorded on the clinical database as part of survival follow-up. 8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY ASTRAZENECA 8.1 Statistical considerations A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared prior to first patient enrolled and any subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments completed prior to database lock. Additional de tails relating to the ICR will be detailed in the ICR Charter. An interim futility analysis w ill take place after 20 evaluable (by Investigator assessment) patients have received at least 1 dose of IP and have been followed for at least 4 months. Patients in the futility analysis w ill also have their baseline scans reviewed by ICR to evaluate the concordance rate on measurable disease at this stage. Enrollment will continue during the futility analy sis. Assuming the study passes the futility assessment, the data cut-off for the primary analysis of ORR will tak e place 8 months after the last patient has received her first dose of IP, to allow opportunity for all patients to complete at least 4 RECIST follow-up assessments. Patients will be followed for survival and analysis of OS will also take place at this time. Patients should be contacted or other data sources checked (see Section 3.10.2 ) in the 2 weeks following the data cut-off for the primary analysis to provide current survival data. At this time, the CSR will be written including the analysis of the confirmed ORR by ICR using RECIST 1.1 criteria, supported by Investigator assessment of ORR and by other efficacy endpoints (DoR, DCR, PFS, OS and TDT), PROs and safety/tolerability variables. Following the data cut-off for the primary analys is, no further statistical analysis of the data will be conducted. RI"

The primary analysis scheduled at 8 months after the last patient received her first dose of IP (approximately 20 months after study start), allows all patients to have at least 4 RECIST follow-up assessments. An interim futility analysis of ORR (c onfirmed and/or unconfirmed CRs and PRs based on investigator assessment) will take place after 20 evaluable patients (ie, with measurable disease (by Investigator assessment) have received at least 1 dose of IP and have been followed for at least 4 months. If less than 4 of the 20 have responded the study may be stopped for fu tility. If 4 or more patien ts have responded the study will continue to the primary analysis. The study design was formulated within a Bayesian framework ( Fisch et al 2015 ) based on dual criteria to show improvement over the expected response rate under current standard treatments (20% RR targeted as an improvement over <15% RR based on chemotherapy, Davis et al 2014 ) and to have a RR of a relevant size (approximately 30%, similar to the RR seen for bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in the AURELIA trial, Pujade-Lauraine et al 2014 ) defined as follows: 1. to have high confidence (>90%) that the true ORR is at least 20% or probability (ORR‚â• 20%) >0.9 and 2. an observed rate of 30/100 is seen at the primary analysis.The futility rule a bove (stop if number of responses is <4), was chosen so that the trial may stop if there is a low chance (<10% predictive probability) of 30 or more responses being observed at the primary analysis. Computation of posterior and predictive probabilities used a neutral prior ie, beta (1/3, 1/3) distribution (Kerman 2011), for the ORR. The predictive probability of observing a given number of responses at the end of the trial given the observed responses at the interim analysis is computed using a beta binomial distribution. With 30 responders out of 100 at the primary analysis we would be >99% confident that the ORR is greater or equal to 20% and 94.6% confident that the ORR is ‚â•23%. It is noted that the interim analysis is based on unconfirmed, investigator assessed RECIST data, whereas the primary analysis will be based on ICR assessed data with responses confirmed at least 4 weeks after the initial response. Data from the OCEANS study indicated an approximate 1.5% reduction in response by ICR compar ed with investigator response (Aghajanian et al 2014). If only 26 patients out of 100 were to m eet the latter definition of response at the primary analysis there would still be >90% confidence that the true rate was greater than or equal to 20%. Assuming median PFS of 6 months, 73% PFS events are expected at the primary analysis at 8 months after the last patient receives her first dose of IP. The original analysis for OS at 12 months after last patient receives her first dose of IP would expect 59% deaths. RI"

All radiological scans for all patien ts (including those at unscheduled visits, or outside visit windows) will be provided to the ICR. Prior RT reports for patients (at baseline) and information on any lesions that were biopsied to provide a tumor sample for study entry (see Section 5.7.2 ) will also be provided to allow the selection of appropriate target lesions. The imaging scans will be reviewed by two independent radiologists using RECIST 1.1 criteria and will be adjudicated if required. For each patient, the ICR will define the overall visit response data (CR, PR, SD, PD or not evaluable [NE]) and the relevant scan dates for each time point (ie, for visits where response or progression is/is not identified). If a patient has had a tumor assessment which cannot be evaluated then the patient will be assigned a visit response of NE (unless there is evidence of progression in which case the response will be assigned as PD). Further details of the ICR will be documented in the Independent Review Charter. Investigator RECIST based assessments From the investigators review of the imagining scans, the RECIST tumor response data will be used to determine each patient‚Äôs visit response according to RECIST version 1.1. At each visit, patients will be programmatically assigned a RECIST 1.1 visit response of CR, PR, SD or PD depending on the status of their disease compared with baseline and previous assessments. If a patient has had a tumor assessment which cannot be evaluated then the patient will be assigned a visit response of NE (unless there is evidence of progression in which case the response will be assigned as PD). 8.4.1 Primary Endpoint Objective Response Rate (ORR) ORR is defined as the number (%) of patients with measurable disease at baseline, with at least one visit response of CR or PR that is confirmed at least 4 weeks later. For the primary analysis ICR is required for both the initial response and confirmation. Data obtained up until progression, or last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, will be included in the assessment of ORR. However, any CR or PR which occurred or was confirmed after a further anticancer therapy was received will not be included in numerator of the ORR calculation. In the case where a patient has two non-consecutive visit responses of PR or CR, then, as long as the time between the 2 visits of PR or CR is greater than 4 weeks and there is no PD between the PR visits, the patient will be defined as a responder. Note that CR followed by PR is classed as progression.  RI"

The date of the response start will be defined as the latest of the dates contributing towards the first visit response of PR or CR. If the response is not confirmed, it will not be included. The end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the PFS endpoint. If a patient does not progress following a response, then their duration of response will use the PFS censoring time. Disease control rate (DCR) DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who have a best overall response of CR or PR or SD (at 6 months). Progression free survival (PFS) PFS is defined as the time from date of fi rst dose until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from study therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment fro m their last evaluable RECIST assessment. However, if the patient progresses or dies after three or more missed RECIST assessments visits, the patient will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST assessment. If the patient has no evaluable visits or does not ha ve baseline data they will be censored at 0 days unless they die within two visits of baseline. The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates not visit dates. RECIST assessments/scans contributing towards a particular visit may be performed on different dates. The following rules will be applied: ! Date of progression will be determined based on the earliest of the dates of the component that triggered the progression ! When censoring a patient for PFS the patient will be censored at the latest of the dates contributing to a particular overall visit assessment. Overall visit assessments will be determined for each assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) and will contribute to the derivation of PFS. Objective disease progression is defined as: at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions (compared with a previous minimum sum) and an absolute increase of >5 mm, an overall assessment of progression or a new lesion. RI"

Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Note: Survival calls will be made in the 2 weeks following the date of the data cut-off for the primary analysis, and if patients are confirmed to be alive (or if the death date is post the relevant data cut-off date) these patients will be censored in the associated analyses at the date of the data cut off. Time to discontinuation of IPs or death (TDT) TDT is defined as the time from the date of first doses of IPs to the earlier of the date of discontinuation of both IPs, or death date. Both IPs should be discontinued at the same time but in rare circumstances discontinuation of one of the IPs before the other may be allowed (see Section 3.9). In such a case, TDT will reflect the time from the date of first dose to the earliest IP discontinuation date. HRQoL Analyses: The EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-OV28 questionnaires will be used. Descriptive statistics of absolute scores and change from baseline of all subscales will be presented and plots will be generated as appropriate to interpret changes over time. Proportions of patients who had improved, stayed the same or deteriorated for all subscales (symptom and functioning scales) will be presented. A 10 point change in score will be used as cut-off point. The quantity and impact of missing data will be evaluated. If warranted, some investigation of HRQoL data by whether patients are still taking study drug will be performed. ! Symptom Improvement Rate at 8 weeks ‚àÄFor dyspnea, pain and constipation from QLQ-C30 and abdominal/GI symptoms from QLQ-OV28, the symptom improvement rate at 8 weeks will be defined as the number (%) of patients showing a clinically meaningful improvement (a decrease from baseline score >10; Osoba et al 2005 ) in that symptom from baseline. The denominator will consist of a subset of the FAS population who have a baseline symptom score >10. 8.4.3 Other endpoints Patient reporting of CTCAE symptoms The PRO-CTCAE questionnaire will be used to derive patient reporting of CTCAE symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, and dizziness. RI"

Any AE occurring before the start of IP will not be included in the summary tables of AEs. Any AE occurring within 30 days of discontinuation of IPs (ie, the last dose of cediranib + olaparib) or the last dose of the last IP to be discontinued, in the rare case where discontinuation dates are different will be included in the AE summaries. Blood pressure data collected electronically (see Section 5.2.4.1 ) will not be reported in the CSR. Patient profiles and BP data over time for pa tients may be evaluated in an exploratory analysis at a later time. 8.5 Methods for statistical analyses Descriptive statistics will be used for all variables, as appropriate. Continuous variables will be summarized by the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency counts and percentages for each category. Unless otherwise stated, percentages will be calculated out of the FAS. Baseline will be the last assessment of the variable under consideration prior to the intake of the first dose of IP. 8.5.1 Analysis of the p rimary variable ORR The primary analysis will be based on ICR assessments of tumor response. Only patients with a confirmed CR or PR, by ICR, at least 4 weeks after the initial response will be counted as responders. The number of responders (confirmed CR or PR) will be modelled using a binomial distribution with a neutral Beta (1 /3,1/3) prior distribution on the rate. The mean and median of the posterior distribution of ORR will be presented, along with the standard deviation and a 95% credible interval around the mean (based on the highest posterior density [Lee, 1997]). The observed ORR by ICR will also be presented with 95% exact (Clopper Pearson) CIs. The posterior probabilities of the ORR being larger than 15%, 20% and 24% will be also computed. To further characterize the RR, the posterior probability of showing low (<15%), moderate ( ‚â•15%- <20%), high ( ‚â•20%- <24%) or substantial ( ‚â•24%) efficacy will be presented. Summaries of the number of patients with best response in each of the follow categories will be presented: CR, PR, SD, PD and NE.

Confirm that facilities remain acceptable ! Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately and timely recorded in the eCRFs, that biological samples are handled in accordance wi th the Laboratory Manual and that study drug accountability checks are being performed ! Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the eCRFs with the patient‚Äôs medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study) including verification of informed consent of participating patients. This will require direct access to all original records for each patient (eg, clinic charts) ! Ensure withdrawal of informed consent to the use of the patient‚Äôs biological samples is reported and biological samples are identified and disposed of/destroyed accordingly, and the action is documented, and reported to the patient. The AstraZeneca representative will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or otherstaff at the center needs information and advice about the study conduct. AstraZeneca medical personnel will be readily available to discuss study related me dical questions or problems with the inve stigator(s). Contact details are provided separately in the Investigator Study File. 9.2.1 Source data Refer to the CSA for location of source data. 9.2.2 Study agreements The Principal Investigator at each center should comply with all the terms, conditions, and obligations of the CSA, or equivalent, for this study. In the event of any inconsistency between this Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) and the CSA, the terms of CSP shall prevail with respect to the conduct of the study and the treatment of patients and in all other respects, not relating to study conduct or treatment of patients, the terms of the CSA shall prevail. Agreements between AstraZeneca and the PI should be in place before any study-related procedures can take place, or patients are enrolled. 9.2.3 Archiving of st udy documents The Investigator follows the principles outlined in the CSA. 9.3 Study timetable and end of study The end of the study is defined as ‚Äòthe last visit of the last patient undergoing the study‚Äô (ie, LSLV) or when the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study. There will be a primary data cut-off defined at approximately 8 months (LSLV) after the last patient received her first dose RI"

Data cut-off will be followe d by clinical database lock when all data for all patients have been collected. The study is expected to start in Quarter 3, 2016 and to end by Quarter 3, 2019. The study may be terminated at individual centers if the study procedures are not being performed according to GCP, or if recruitment is slow. AstraZeneca may also terminate the entire study prematurely if concerns for safety arise within this study or in any other study with either cediranib or olaparib. An interim futility analysis w ill take place after 20 evaluable patients (ie, with measurable disease [by investigator assessment] and received at least one dose of IP) have been recruited and followed for at least 4 months. Assuming the study passes the fut ility assessment, the data cut-off for the primary analysis of ORR and OS for the full CSR will take place 8 months after the last patient received her first dose of IP, to allow opportunity for all patients to complete 4 RECIST follow-up assessments and to allow responding patients to have a DoR greater than 6 months. At this time, the clinical study database will close to new data and all efficacy, HRQoL and safety/tolerability inf ormation will be summarized for preparation of the CSR. Patients are permitted to continue to receive IPs beyond the FPV if, in the opinion of the Investigator, they are continuing to receive benefit from treatment with cediranib and/or olaparib and have not met any discontinuation criteria. Such patients will complete a FPV, which will occur at their last scheduled visit prior to data cut-off. For further information regarding the FPV please refer to Section 4.4. For patients who continue to receive treatment beyond the FPV, Investigators will assume a manual drug ordering process for IPs. Patients who continue to receive treatment beyond the FPV are to be followed in accordance with the Medical Standard of Care and as deemed appropriate by the Investigators. Serious adverse event reporting (on paper) will continue to ensure safety data collection and monitoring of the patients while receiving the investigational product. It is recommended that Investigators continue to observe ongoing patients at the frequency employed prior to the FPV. Protocol dose modification and stopping criteria are to be followed while a patient is receiving cediranib and/or olaparib. Restrictions regarding concomitant medications (Section 7.7) must be followed while the patient is receiving cediranib and/or olaparib. A change in the dose/schedule of cediranib and/or olaparib should only occur for safety reasons, based on the Investigator‚Äôs judgement, and should generally follow the approach for dose reduction and discontinuation as described in this protocol. Combining cediranib and/or olaparib with other anti-cancer therapy is not allowed. If in the opinion of the Investigator, a patient is no longer receiving clinical benefit from the IPs beyond the FPV, then the IPs will be stopped. The Investigator will inform AstraZeneca when a patient discontinues the IPs. Patients must return unused medication during routine clinic visits; drug accountability information must continue to be collected in patient source documents until the patient discontinues treatment. Patients will continue to be monitored for all SAEs and pregnancies while receiving IPs and for 30 days after the last dose of IPs. RI"

For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an Investigator might know a patient‚Äôs identity and also have access to his or her genetic data. Also, Regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the patient‚Äôs medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate. 10.3 Ethics and regulatory review An Ethics Committee (EC)/ Institutional Review Board (IRB) should approve the final study protocol, including the final version of the Informed Consent Form and any other written information and/or materials to be provided to the patients. The Investigator will ensure the distribution of these documents to the applicable EC/IRB and to the study site staff. The opinion of the EC/IRB should be given in writing. The Investigator should submit the written approval to AstraZeneca before enrollment of any patient into the study. The EC/IRB should approve all advertising used to recruit patients for the study. AstraZeneca should approve any modifications to the Informed Consent Form that are needed to meet local requirements. If required by local regulations, the protocol should be re-approved by the EC/IRB annually. Before enrollment of any patient into the study, the final study protocol, including the final version of the Informed Consent Form, is approved by the national regulatory authority or a notification to the national regulatory authority is done, according to local regulations. AstraZeneca will handle the distribution of any of these documents to the national regulatory authorities. AstraZeneca will provide Regulatory Authorities, EC/IRB and the PI(s) at each center with safety updates/reports according to local requirements. Each PI is responsible for providing the EC/IRB with reports of any serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the IPs. AstraZeneca will provide this information to the PI(s) so that he/she can meet these reporting requirements. 10.4 Informed consent The PI(s) at each cen ter will: ! Ensure each patient is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study ! Ensure each patient is notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time  RI"

Ensure the original, signed Informed Consent Form(s) is/are stored in the Investigator‚Äôs Study File ! Ensure a copy of the signed Informed Consent Form is given to the patient ! Ensure that any incentives for patients w ho participate in the study as well as any provisions for patients harmed as a consequence of study participation are described in the informed consent form that is approved by an EC/IRB. 10.5 Changes to the protocol and informed consent form Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the PI and AstraZeneca. If there are any substantial changes to the study protocol, then these changes will be documented in a study protocol amendment and where required in a new version of the study protocol (Revised CSP). The amendment is to be approved by the relevant EC/IRB and if applicable, also the national regulatory authority approval, before implementati on. Local requirements are to be followed for revised protocols. AstraZeneca will distribute any subsequent ame ndments and new versions of the protocol to each PI(s). For distribution to EC/IRB see Section 10.3. If a protocol amendment requires a change to a center‚Äôs Informed Consent Form, AstraZeneca and the center‚Äôs EC/IRB are to approve the revised Informed Consent Form before the revised form is used. If local regulations require, any administrative change will be communicated to or approved by each EC/IRB. 10.6 Audits and inspections Authorized representatives of AstraZeneca, a re gulatory authority, or an EC may perform audits or inspections at the center, including source data verification. The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and documents, to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, ICH GCP and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator will contact AstraZeneca immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection at the center.  RI"

Hospitalisation Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. Important medical event or medical intervention Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used. !

Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the subject actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? ! Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties? ! De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug? ! No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. ! Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge. ! Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship. In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: ! Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug? ! Is there a known mechanism? Causality of ‚Äòrelated‚Äô is made if following a revi ew of the relevant data, there is evidence for a ‚Äòreasonable possibility‚Äô of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression ‚Äòreasonable possibility‚Äô of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship and includes any toxicities considered related, probably related, or possibly related to the drug.  RI"

It is not intended t o be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry. The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy‚Äôs Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy‚Äôs Law (HL) criteria are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alte rnative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes. DEFINITIONS Potential Hy‚Äôs Law (PHL) Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ‚â• 3x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) ‚â• 2xULN at any point during the study following the start of study medication irrespective of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP). Hy‚Äôs Law (HL) AST or ALT ‚â• 3x ULN together with TBL ‚â• 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL HY‚ÄôS LAW CASES In order to identify cases of PHL it is import ant to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination: RI"

No later than 3 weeks after the biochemis try abnormality was initi ally detected, the Study Physician contacts the Investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP. The AstraZeneca Medical Science Director and Global Safety Physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate. According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Investigator will follow the instructions below.

DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE, NON-MEASURABLE, TARGET AND NON- TARGET LESIONS Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in the study. Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least 1 measurable lesion that has not been previously irradiated. Measurable: A lesion, not previously irradiated or biopsied per the protocol prior to enrollment/randomisation, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ‚â•10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ‚â•15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements. Non-measurable: ! All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ‚â•10 mm to <15 mm short axis at baseline 1). ! Truly non-measurable lesions include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by CT or MRI. ! Lesion biopsied per the protocol prior to randomisation ! Previously irradiated lesions 2 1Nodes with <10 mm short axis are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed as non-target lesions (NTLs). 2Localised post-radiation changes which affect lesion sizes may occur. Therefore, lesions that have been previously irradiated will not be considered measurable and must be selected as NTL at baseline and followed up as part of the NTL assessment. RI"

Skin lesions assessed by clinical examination ! Brain metastasis. Special cases: ! Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic‚Äìblastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability. Blastic lesions are considered non-measurable. ! Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for measurability from a radiological point of view , but if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient; these should be selected as target lesions (TLs). Target lesions: A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative of all lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TLs at baseline. Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at baseline. METHODS OF ASSESSMENT The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during follow-up visits. A summary of the methods to be used for RECIST assessment is provided in Table 20.

In the D8488C00001 study it is recommended that CT examinations of the chest and abdomen (including liver and adrenal glands) will be used to assess tumour burden at baseline and follow-up visits. CT examination with intravenous contrast media administration is the preferred method. MRI should be used where CT is not feasible or it is medically contra-indicated. For brain lesion assessment, MRI is the preferred method. Clinical examination In the D8488C00001 study, clinical examination will not be used for assessment of TL. Clinically detected lesions can be selected as TLs if they are assessed by CT or MRI scans. Clinical examination can be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions. Chest X-ray In the D8488C00001 study, ches t X-ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL as they will be assessed by CT examination or MRI examination. Chest X-ray can, however, be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions. Plain X-ray In the D8488C00001 study plain X-ray may be used as a method of assessment for bone NTL and to identify the presence of new bone lesions. Ultrasound In the D8488C00001 study, ultrasound examination will not be used for assessment of TL and NTL as it is not a reproducible method, does not provide an accurate assessment of tumour size and it is subjective and operator dependent. Ultrasound examination can, however, be used to identify the presence of new lesions. If new clinical symptoms occur and an ultrasound is performed then new lesions should be confirmed by CT or MRI examination. Endoscopy and laparoscopy In the D8488C00001 study, e ndoscopy and laparoscopy will not be used for tumour assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumour assessment. Tumour markers In the D8488C00001 study tum our markers will not be used for tumour response assessments as per RECIST 1.1. Cytology and histology RI"

Cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment is required when the measurable tumour has met criteria for response or stable disease. In such circumstances, the cytology is necessary to differentiate between response/stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease (if the neoplastic origin of the fluid is confirmed). Where cytology findings are not available, any effusion that significantly worsens (from trace to large) or appearance of clinically significant effusion (requi ring change in drug therapy) during the study treatment will be considered to be progression of NTL, or disease progression due to new lesions. Isotopic bone scan Bone lesions identified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by CT, MRI or X-ray at baseline should be recorded as NTL and followed by the same method as per the baseline assessment. In the D8488C00001 study isotopic bone scans may be used as a method of assessment to identify the presence of ne w bone lesions at follow-up visits. New lesions will be recorded where a positive hot-spot that was not present on the baseline bone scan assessment is identified on a bone scan performed at any time during the study. The Investigator should consider the positive hot-spot to be a significant new site of malignant disease and represent true disease progression in order to record the new lesion. Confirmation by CT, MRI and X-ray is recommended where bone scan findings are equivocal. FDG-PET scan In the D8488C00001 study , 18-Fluoro-de oxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions, according with the following algorithm: New lesions will be recorded where there is positive 18-Fluoro-d eoxyglucose uptake 3not present on baseline FDG-PET scan or in a location corresponding to a new lesion on CT/MRI at the same follow-up visit. If there is no baseline FDG-PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesions on CT/MRI scans then follow-up CT/MRI assessments should be continued, scheduled as per protocol or clinical indicated, in order to confirm new lesions. TUMOUR RESPONSE EVALUATION Schedule of evaluation 3A positive FDG-PET scan lesion should be reported only when an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue is observed. RI"

Follow-up assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (¬±1 week), relative to first dose of investigational product(s) until confirmed objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (irrespective of the reason for stopping treatment and/or subsequent therapy). Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be adequately imaged at follow-up. If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the patient has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent a ssessments at their scheduled visits. This schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by some patients being assessed at a different frequency than other patients. Target lesions Documentation of target lesions A maximum of 5 measurable lesions, with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ (including lymph nodes), representative of all lesions involved should be identified as TL at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions or short axis for nodal lesions), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected. The site and location of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes). All measurements should be recorded in millimetres. At baseline the sum of the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the follow-up sum of diameters. Special cases: For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the longest diameter. For pathological lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis. If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is >5 mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan. If a lesion has completely disappeared, the longest diameter should be recorded as 0 mm. If a TL splits into 2 or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts. If 2 or more TLs merge then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be recorded for 1 of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesion(s). If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned. If an accurate measure can be given, this should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. RI"

When a TL has had any intervention eg, radiotherapy, embolisation, surgery, during the study, the size of the TL should still be provided where possible. Evaluation of target lesions This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumour visit response for TL (see Table 21). Table 21 Evaluation of target lesions Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all TLs since baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to <10 mm. Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD Progression of disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the TLs were not assessed or not evaluable or had a lesion intervention at this visit. Note: If the sum of diameters meets the progressive disease criteria, progressive disease overrides not evaluable as a TL response CR Complete response; PR Partial response; PD Progression of disease; NE Not evaluable; SD Stable disease; TL Target lesion. Non-target lesions Evaluation of non-target lesions All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at baseline. Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status should be followed at subsequent visits. At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL response should be recorded by the Investigator. This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine and record overall response for NTL at the investigational site at each visit (see Table 22). RI"

All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). Non CR/Non PD Persistence of 1 or more NTL. Progression of disease (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. Unequivocal progression may be due to an important progression in 1 lesion only or in several lesions. In all cases the progression MUST be clinically significant for the physician to consider changing (or stopping) therapy. Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant when 1 or some of the NTLs were not assessed and, in the Investigator's opinion, they are not able to provide an evaluable overall NTL assessment at this visit. CR Complete response; PR Partial response; PD Progression of disease; NE Not evaluable; NTL Non-target lesion. To achieve ‚Äòunequivocal progression‚Äô on the basis of NTLs, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of stable disease or partial response in TLs, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest ‚Äòincrease‚Äô in the size of 1 or more NTLs is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. New lesions Details of any new lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment. The presence of one or more new lesions is assessed as progression. A lesion identified at a follow-up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumour. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumour assessments should be continued until the new lesion has been confirmed. If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesion, then the progression date should be declared using the date of the initial scan. Symptomatic deterioration RI"

Confirmation will be subject to the investigator‚Äôs discretion (eg. if investigator is not sure of progression at initial assessment). The confirmat ory scan s hould occ ur preferably at the next scheduled visit and no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of progression of disease (PD) in the absence of clinical deterioration. If a patient discontinues treatment (and/or receives a subsequent cancer therapy) prior to progression then the patient should still continue to be followed until objective disease progression. CONFIRMATION OF RESPONSE In Study D8488C00001, imaging for confirmation of response (CR or PR) should be performed at the next scheduled RECIST assessment, 8 weeks (certainly no less than 4 weeks) following the date the criteria for response were first met.
