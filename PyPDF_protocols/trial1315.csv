The sample size is selected so that the multiple contrast test (as part of the multiple comparisons procedure -modelling [MCP-Mod] that will be used to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint) exceeds a power of 90%. With the planned sample size, the power criterion of the multiple contrast test is fulfilled because 29 subjects per cohort would yield a power of at least 90% to detect a dose -response signal if present. A 1-sided significance level of 𝛼𝛼 = 0.025 will be used. In general, data will be analyzed by cohort and study phase (Main Period and Extension Period) and may be differentiated further (e.g., by visit or by study site). The primary efficacy endpoint of the percentage of subject s with HiSCR at Week 16 will be analyzed using the MCP -Mod procedure. The secondary efficacy endpoint of the percentage of subjects with HiSCR at Week 12 will be analyzed in the same way as the primary endpoint using the MCP- Mod procedure. For all other continuous efficacy endpoints , the absolute values and changes from baseline (absolute and relative) will be analyzed by descriptive statistics (e.g., number of observations, mean, standard d eviation, minimum, median, maximum, lower quartile, upper quartile, and upper and lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval [CI] for the mean) by time point. Model- based analyses (e.g. , analysis of covariance [ ANCOVA ], Poisson, and logistic regression models) for continuous, count , and binary endpoints will be defined in the statistical analysis plan as deemed necessary and possible. All categorical efficacy endpoints will be summarized by time point using absolute and relative frequencies , including 95% exact CIs based on the b inomial distribution. Sensitivity analyses will be defined for efficacy endpoints if deemed necessary. Continuous safety parameters will be analyzed by descriptive statistics for absolute values and change s from baseline (absolute and relative) by time point. Categorical safety parameters will be summarized by absolute and relative frequencies by time point. No formal interim analysis is planned for this study. An independent, unblinded Data Monitoring Comm ittee (DMC) will be established to allow regular monitoring of the study data in order to detect and report early evidence of unanticipated harm to subjects."

Nodules appear in the affected areas, progressively become swollen, and rupture with the release of pus. This process occurs repeatedly leading to sinus tract formation and scars [1]. The disease course creates a frustrating situation for patients as well as for physicians. Treatments recommended by guidelines include dietary and behavioral changes, topical and systemic medications (including antibiotics), and timely surgical interventions [ 2, 3]. Behavioral interventions and topical and systemic medications are most beneficial for preventing new lesions and reducing the inflammatory component of the disease. Surgical interventions are used to eliminate nodules, remove existing sinus tracts and scars, and prevent new sinus tract and scar formation. Despite treatment, relapse is very frequent, leading to severe impairment of the quality of life. The Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) for HS is 8.9 , and thereby higher than in any other skin disorder [4]. This devastating disorder has often been neglected and considered a rare condition. From an analysis of commercial health insurance reimbursement data for 2007 from a large group of patients in the United States, Cosmatos et al. determined a prevalence of 0.053% for clinically detected HS, and an estimated 146,000 to 162,000 patients in 2007 [ 5]. HS see ms to indiscriminately affect the global population. A recent large epidemiological survey in France reported 0.97% disease prevalence[ 6]. However, the point prevalence is reported to r ange between 1% and 4% [7]. The exact pathophysiology of HS is unknown. Smoking, dietary habits , and genetic predisposition have all been linked with HS [8, 9]. However, a recent survey in 53 patients disclosed a severe derangement of the monocyte function and of subsequent antigen processing in these patients [10]. There the percentage of natural killer cells was increased and that of CD4- lymphocytes decreased compared to healthy controls, probably implying an autoimmune origin of the disorder. Additionally, a defective lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced production of the pro- inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF- α) and interleukin (IL) -6 by blood monocytes was demonstrated in patients with HS. This down- regulation of systemic cytokine production seems to be counter -regulatory to what happens i n the inflamed skin : over-production of pro -inflammatory cytokines mainly TNF- α and IL- 1β is t a distinctive feature that, nevertheless, does not seem to follow a specific pattern [ 11, 12]. The wide range of possible pathogenic mechanisms suggested by different studies denotes that HS may be associated with host mechanisms rather than exogenous factors. Taking into account the paradox that both anti- infectious ( e.g., antibiotics) and pro- infectious ( e.g., anti- TNF, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive drugs) therapies may be effective , HS appear s as an auto -inflammatory disease based on a defect in the hair follicle innate immunity [ 13]. The auto- inflammatory nature of HS is further s upported by the evidence that p ro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 1β and TNF -α are markedly increased in lesional and perilesional skin[14]. As a consequence, the implication of some autoimmune or auto-inflammatory mechanism in the pathogenesis of HS has been speculated over the last years. The hypothesis is further reinforced by positive results from the administration of TNF antagonists such as adalimumab, which is approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe HS in prospective, placebo- controlled studies [15]. In the first study conducted with IFX -1 in subjects with HS (Study IFX -1-P2.3), in which subjects with moderate to severe HS were treated with 9 consecutive infusions of IFX -1 800 mg over 50 days, 83.3% of subjects achieved a Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response ( HiSCR) ."
29,page_29,"IFX-1-P2.4 Global Amendment 1.1 [ Final V2 .0, 16 November 201 8] page 30 of 109 IFX-1 InflaRx GmbH 1.2 Background Information on IFX -1 IFX-1 is a monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to the soluble human complement split product C5a. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that IFX -1 binds to its target rapidly and is capable of a nearly complete blockade of C5a- induced biological effects while not affecting cleavage of C5 and formation of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) [16, 17]. Single and repeated intravenous (iv) administration of IFX -1 at doses of up to 50 mg/kg body weight (bw) over 6 months in cynomolgus monkeys resulted in no related or relevant toxicological adverse findings within an extended core battery of safety pharmacology assessments. Various nonclinical studies have been conducted to assess pharmacological and toxicological aspects of IFX -1, none of which revealed any obvious toxicological or safety concern s for IFX-1. IFX-1 was well tolerated and did not show any toxicity with any of the doses tested. Therefore, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level was defined as the highest administered dose of 50 mg/kg bw (corresponding to a human equivalent dose of 16.13 mg/kg bw). IFX-1 is an investigational medicinal product (IMP) and is not approved in any country worldwide. To date, IFX -1 has been investigated in 1 Phase I study in healthy subjects and in 3 Phase II studies in subjects with early septic organ dysfunction, in subjects undergoing complex cardiac surgery, and in subjects with moderate to severe HS. Study IFX -1-P1.1 (healthy subjects) : in this Phase I study in 15 healthy subjects, 5 consecutive dose groups (IFX -1 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 2, and 4 mg/kg bw) received single iv infusions of IFX -1 or placebo. IFX-1 was safe and well tolerated. The following adverse events ( AEs) were reported by the investigator as at least possibly related to IFX -1: nausea, headache, nasopharyngitis, and C -reactive protein (CRP) i ncreased. Study IFX -1-P2.1 (subjects with early septic organ dysfunction) : in this Phase II study in subjects with early septic organ dysfunction caused by pulmonary or abdominal infection, the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and eff icacy of IFX -1 were investigated in 3 different dose groups (IFX -1 2 × 2 mg/kg bw, 2 × 4 mg/kg bw, and 3 × 4 mg/kg bw, each with a placebo control). In total, 48 subjects were treated with IFX -1. IFX -1 was safe and well tolerated. The following AEs were reported by the investigator as at least possibly related to IFX -1: acute hepatic failure, hepatocellular injury, pulmonary embolism, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and impaired healing. Study IFX -1-P2.2 (subjects undergoing complex cardiac surgery) : in this Phase II study in subjects undergoing complex cardiac surgery, the efficacy, PK, PD, and safety of single doses of IFX -1 were investigated in 4 different dose groups (IFX -1 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg bw, each with a placebo control). In total, 82 subjects were treated with IFX -1. IFX -1 was safe and well tolerated. The following AEs were reported by the investigator as at least possibly related to IFX-1: leukocytosis, impaired healing, blood pressure decreased, and heart rate decreased. Study IFX -1-P2.3 ( subjects with moderate to severe HS ): in this Phase II study in subjects with moderate to severe HS, the safety, PK, PD, and efficacy of IFX -1 were investigated after 9 weekly infusions of 800 mg. In total, 12 subjects were treated with IFX -1. IFX-1 was sa fe and well tolerated. There were no AEs reported by the investigator as at least possibly related to IFX-1. An overview of known and potential risks and benefits of the IMP to human subjects is available in Section 1.4 . Further details on IFX -1 are given in the Investigator’s Brochure, the current version of which is available in the investigator site file."
30,page_30,"IFX-1-P2.4 Global Amendment 1.1 [ Final V2 .0, 16 November 201 8] page 31 of 109 IFX-1 InflaRx GmbH 1.3 Rationale for the Phase II Study HS is diagnosed by its clinical features and its chronicity. It is recognized by the presence of recurrent, painful, deep -seated, rounded nodules usually ending in abscesses and sinus tracts with suppuration and hypertrophic scarring of apocrine gland- bearing skin and is likely to be an auto- inflammatory disease based on a defect in the hair follicle innate immunity [13] (Section 1.1). As complement C5a is involved in the underlying acute inflammatory responses, this study is set up based on the hypothesis that IFX -1 might be able to block C5a induced pro-inflammatory effects such as neutrophil activation and cytokine generation, potentially contributing to the local skin inflammation and tissue damag e. As the dose- response for IFX -1 has not been assessed to date in a chronic disease, the primary rationale of this Phase II study is to investigate a dose -response signal of IFX -1 in subjects with moderate to severe HS according to the HiSCR. Further important aims of the study are to investigate the PK, PD, and safety of IFX -1 in subjects with HS. The study will also collect data on clinical parameters that could be positively affected by a C5a blocking therapy (e.g., DLQI, Patient’s Global Assessment of Skin Pain [Numeric Rating Scale, NRS ]). Rationale for S tudy Population Patients with HS show elevated serum levels of TNF- α [14, 18]. Additionally , CRP values and white blood cell count (WBC) ar e increased significantly in patients with moderate or severe HS compared with the mild manifestation of the disease [ 19]. Because these patients present signs of systemic inflammation , the administration of a compound such as IFX-1, with its multi- faceted anti -inflammat ory potential , may be a suitable agent for the management of HS , as shown in Study IFX -1-P2.3. The subjects with moderate to severe HS enrolled in the current study are considered to have a sufficiently severe disease status to evaluate the tolerability , PK, and PD of 4 dos ing regimens of IFX -1, compared with placebo. In line with the conclusions of an HiSCR validatio n study [20], subjects with a total abscess and inflammatory nodule count (AN) of < 3 at baseline will be excluded to eliminate the possibility that a 1- unit reduction in AN count could lead to an HiSCR response . To keep the study population as homogenous as possible, subjects will not be enrolled into the study if they have been treated previously with any of the following for prespecified time periods before Screening (Section 4.2): IFX-1, adalimumab or other biologic products, non-stable dose s of oral antibiotic treatment permitted for HS ( doxycycline or minocycline only), systemic non -biologic therapies for HS with potential therapeutic impact for HS, any other systemic therapy for HS, any iv anti- infective therapy, phototherapy ( ultra-violet B [UVB] or psoralen and ultra -violet A [UVA]), analgesics (including opioids) for HS -related pain, prescription -only topical therapies for HS, or oral anti- infectives for infections other than HS. Rationale for D osing R egimen The aim of treatment with IFX -1 is to reach an almost complete blockade of the overall available C5a (existing and newly produced) in human whole blood during the entire treatment period. The rate at which consumed or activated C5 can be regenerated ( the so-called C5 turnover rate) is not known. I t is plausible to assume that more C5 could be produced in settings of chronic inflammation than in healthy subjects , and thus more C5a could result from the ensuing activation. From clinical studies conducted so far (IFX -1-P1.1 and -P2.1), it is known that t he peak IFX -1 concentration upon administration of 4 mg/kg bw was approximately 100 µg/mL (approximately 650 nM ), which could theoretically block approximately 1200 nM of C5a. The expected half -life of IFX -1 is 3 to 4 days, thus, a biweekly dosing interval with a dose range of 400 to 800 mg in subjects with normal body weight is recommended ."
31,page_31,"IFX-1-P2.4 Global Amendment 1.1 [ Final V2 .0, 16 November 201 8] page 32 of 109 IFX-1 InflaRx GmbH In Study IFX -1-P2.3 in subjects with HS, IFX -1 administered at a weekly dose of 800 mg resulted in mean IFX -1 trough concentrations of 50.1 to 79.4 µ g/mL . This dosing regimen was well tolerated, with no new safety signals, and clinical improvement of HS was demonstrated in the majority of subjects. The percentage of subjects achieving an HiSCR was higher than in the Phase III studies of adalimumab [11]. An effective dose of IFX- 1 is unknown, as is the appropriate interval of administration. Therefore, 4 dosing regimens were selected for the current study to evaluate a dose- response signal for IFX -1 in subjects with HS a ccording to the HiSCR at Week 16 . All dosing regimens consist of a 2 weeks induction treatment to achieve blockade of C5a. After this induction treatment , a regular dosing schedule for maintenance treatment will start to maintain a blockade even in subjects on a low dose and in subjects in whom the entire C5 pool is enlarged and “turned over” several times. The toxicology development of IFX -1 is considered adequate to support the planned Phase II clinical study in subjects who will be treated at doses up to 1200 mg IFX- 1 over a time period of 40 weeks. There were no relevant findings in the toxicology studies, which would preclude the continued clinical development of IFX -1. Exposures and safety margins are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Exposure and Safety Margins NOAEL (26w T ox) 1200 mg Dose ( Extrapolated) Safety Margin Cmax [µg/mL] 2,553 ca. 260 ca. 10 AUC inf [µg*h/mL] 464,737 ca. 17 ,000 ca. 27 AUC inf = area under the curve to infinity ; ca. = circa; C max = peak plasma concentration; NOAEL = No Observed Adverse Effect Level Rationale for S tudy Design This is a double-b lind, placebo- controlled, multicenter Phase II study to determine the efficacy and safety of IFX -1 in subjects with moderate to severe HS. With the ex perience gained in an earlier, open -label study of IFX -1 in subjects with HS (Study IFX-1-P2.3), which dem onstrated acceptable safety and potentially beneficial efficacy, the double- blind, placebo- controlled design of the current study is deemed appropriate for investigating the efficacy and safety of IFX-1 in subjects with moderate to severe HS . The study design is also deemed appropriate for generating PK and PD data to determine dose ranges for future studies . The study will be conducted in compliance with this study protocol, International Council for Harmoni sation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines for Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), and the applicable regulatory requirement(s) (Section 11). 1.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment IFX-1 has been successfully investigated in an open- label Phase II study in subjects with moderate to severe HS. Further, considerations on risk -benefit -related aspects are derived from nonclinical data and clinical Phase I data in healthy subjects as well as from clinical data in 2 other Phase II stud ies conducted in subject s suffering from early, newly developing abdominal or pulmonary derived septic organ dysfunction and in subjects undergoing complex cardiac surgery."

In addition, IFX-1 has been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in healthy human subjects administered IFX -1 intravenously at single doses of up to 4 mg/kg b w. Furthermore, the safety of IFX -1 has been investigated in 3 Phase II studies, conducted in 48 subjects with early septic organ dysfunction treated with up to 3 x 4 mg/kg bw IFX -1 given over 4 days, in 82 subjects undergoing complex cardiac surgery treated with single doses of up to 8 mg/kg bw IFX-1, and in 12 subjects with moderate to severe HS treated with 9 weekly infusions of 800 mg IFX -1. Overall, IFX- 1 was safe and well tolerated in all these studies, and no additional risks associated with the administration of IFX -1 were observed. Thus, it has been demonstrated that IFX- 1 was generally well t olerated when administered to subjects with HS. The potential risks associated with iv administration of IFX -1 due to its mode of action include the following: Infections: the mechanism of action for IFX-1 and the 3 known complement pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin pathway ) do not suggest any significant impact on C5 activation and MAC formation resulting from the presence of IFX -1 in blood. Data from an in vitro complement activation model and in vivo data from Phase I and II stud ies provide s ome evidences that IFX -1 does not interfere with the MAC formation. This is essential because MAC is the final step in the formation of complement activation elements leading to microbial elimination , especially for encapsulated bacteria. A theoretical ris k of infection exists due to the inhibition of C5a, t herefore, investigators (and other health care professionals) should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of infections in general. See Section 5.6 for the procedures to be followed in case of infections. Meningitis /meningococcal septicemia : current data do not suggest that subjects treated with IFX-1 are at significantly increased risk of infection with N. meningitides and to date, no cases of meningitis or meningococcal septicemia have been reported in clinical studies with IFX -1. Therefore, mandatory vaccination or concomitant broad spectrum antibiotic treatment is not warranted based on the mode of action for IFX -1. However, until a larger number of subject s have been exposed to IFX -1, investigator s should be vigilant for signs of N. meningitides infection. See Section 5.6 for the procedures to be followed in case of meningitis/meningococcal septicemia. Anaphylactic reactions and acute systemic allergic hypersensitivity : because IFX-1 is an antibody/protein, a general risk for anaphylactic reactions and acute systemic allergic hypersensitivity exists . Subject s who are included in this study are treated with IFX -1 at the study site so that adequate treatment and care is available in case of an anaphylactic reaction. To date , no anaphylactic reactions have been reported after administration of IFX -1 in clinical Phase I and II studies . See Section 5.6 for the procedures to be followed in case of anaphylactic reactions and acute systemic allergic hypersensitivity. 1.4.3 Risk Associated with Lack of Efficacy With the administration of IFX -1 or placebo, no deterioration in health status is expected with respect to HS . Nevertheless, deterioration in HS can occur due to the fluctuating nature of the"

In case of a lack of efficacy with IFX-1 treatment, or in case of placebo treatment, subjects will continue to experience their typical HS symptoms. Subjects who have a loss of response (see Definitions of Terms) during the Extension Period will have an optional visit 2 weeks later. Subjects who then have a loss of response at the subsequent (planned) visit will be discontinued from the study and will not switch to the non- responder schedule. Subjects who experience WOAI (see Definitions of Terms) at 2 consecutive visits during the Extension Period will be discontinued from the study. 1.4.4 Risk -Benefit Conclusio n HS is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, which affects approximately 1% of the general population in the West, with women affected 2 to 5 times more commonly than men [ 21], and an average onset age of 23 years. This poorly understood disease is believed to be under - reported by those who suffer from it. The disease is associated with significant morbidity. Given the pain and consequent physical impairment associated with the tender lesions that are symptomatic of this disease, it has been reported that health -related quality of life ( HRQL ) is lower in patients with HS than in patients with other dermatological diseases. Furthermore, a recent study estimated that up to 20% of patients with HS report the co- existence of depression, and patients with HS report a high level of stigmatization. Due to the significant physical and emotional burden of this disease, patients often aggressively seek treatment. The level of disease severity strongly influences the approach to the treatment of HS. Subjects with moderate to severe HS ( Hurley Stage II or III disease) will be included in this study . Subjects with Hurley Stage II disease exhibit recurrent inflamed nodules and abscesses, which often lead to sinus tracts and scarring that may not resolve with antibiotic therapy. Subjects with Hurley Stage III disease require preventive and medical therapy , and efficacy in severe HS was shown for adalimumab , infliximab , and acitretin [3]. It is hypothesized that treatment with IFX -1 could block the C5a- mediated inflammatory effect and thus reduce the pain and consequent physical impairment associated with the tender lesions of HS , and may even improve the disease status. During treatment with 9 weekly doses of IFX-1 in a proof -of-concept study in subjects with moderate to severe HS (IFX -1-P2.3) , the AN count decreased, the HiSCR increased, and the Hidradenitis Suppurativa- Physician’s Global Assessment (HS-PGA) indicated a shift from very severe to moderate dis ease. This dosing regimen was well tolerated and, as seen in the other Phase I and II studies, IFX -1 had a favorable safety profile. In case of a lack of efficacy with IFX -1 treatment or in case of placebo treatment, subjects will continue to experience their typical HS symptoms, for which currently only limited treatment options are available. The hypothesized benefit of treatment with IFX -1, therefore , outweighs the potential risk s for the subjects participating in this study."

After establishing that the incl usion and exclusion criteria have been fulfilled at Screening (Sections 4.1 and 4.2), 175 subjects are planned to be randomized to receive double- blind treatment with IMP in 1 of 5 treatment cohorts in a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1. Subject s who give informed consent f or participation in the PK substudy will be sequentially included in the PK substudy. Subjects will further be asked to consent to a photographical documentation of areas affected by HS. Subjects who consent will have photographs taken at prespecified times (Section 8.2.2.13 ). An independent, unblinded Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC) will be established to allow regular monitoring of the study data in order to detect and report early evidence of unanticipated harm to subjects (Section 13.3). Main Period (16 Weeks) For each cohort, the Main Period starts at Week 0 (Day 1, immediately before first administration of IMP) and consists of a 2-week Induction Phase (ends immediately after administration of IMP at Week 2 ) followed by a 14- week Maintenance Phase through Week 16 (ends immediately after administration of IMP at Week 16 ). During the Main Period, IMP ( IFX-1 or placebo) will be administered in 5 treatment cohorts: placebo, IFX-1 400 mg q4w , IFX-1 800 mg q4w , IFX-1 800 mg q2w, and IFX-1 1200 mg q2w , as summarized in Table 2. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage of subjects with a response on the basis of the HiSCR determined at Week 16 , before administration of IMP (Section 8.2.2.2 )."
35,page_35,"IFX-1-P2.4 Global Amendment 1.1 [ Final V2 .0, 16 November 201 8] page 36 of 109 IFX-1 InflaRx GmbH PK Substudy in Main Period A PK substudy will be conducted in approximately 50 of the 175 subjects participating in the Main Period. The subjects in Cohorts 1 to 5 will be sequentially included for participation in the PK substudy if consent for participation was given. The PK substudy assessments will be made on 2 visits during the Main Period, at Weeks 2 and 16. Extension Period (28 Weeks) – HiSCR Responders Subjects from all cohorts who are HiSCR responders at Week 16 (response on the basis of HiSCR is defined in Section 8.2.2.2 ) will receive IFX -1 at a dose of 800 mg q4w, starting at Week 20 through Week 40. Subjects who have a loss of response (see Definitions of Terms ) during the Extension Period will have an optional visit 2 weeks later. Subjects who then have a loss of response at the subsequent (planned) visit will be discontinued from the study. A final visit at the study site for efficacy, PK, PD, and safety assessments will occur at Week 44. For subjects who discontinue early, a Post -Treatment Follow -Up visit will occur 3 months after the early discontinuation or when another HS therapy has been started, wh ichever occurs first. At the P ost-Treatment Follow -Up visit the same parameters for efficacy, PK, PD and safety as at Week 44 or the early discontinuation visit will be assessed. Extension Period (28 Weeks) – HiSCR Non -Responders Subjects from all cohorts who are HiSCR non- responders at Week 16 (response on the basis of HiSCR is defined in Section 8.2.2.2 ) will receive IMP during an Induction Phase (Weeks 18 and 19), followed by IFX -1 at a dose of 800 mg q2w during the Maintenance Phase from Week 20 through Week 40 (see also Table 3). Subjects who experience WOAI (see Definitions of Terms ) at 2 consecutive visits during the Extension Period will be discontinued from the study. A final visit at the study site for efficacy , PK, PD, and safety assessments will occur at Week 44 . For subjects who discontinue early, a Post-Treatment FUV will occur 3 months after the early discontinuation or when another HS therapy has been started, which ever occurs first. At the Post-Treatment Follow -Up visit the same parameters for efficacy, PK, PD and safety as at Week 44 or the early discontinuation visit will be assessed. 3.2 Study Sites and Number of Subjects This multicenter study is planned to be conducted at approximately 50 sites in approximately 8 countries. According to the sample size calculation (Section 10.2), 175 subjects are planned to be enrolled and randomized at Screening to 1 of 5 cohorts in the Main Period to ensure that approximately 145 subjects complete treatment with IFX -1 or placebo . 3.3 Expected Duration of the Study The study start is defined as the date of the first visit of the fi rst subject enrolled in the Main Period, and t he end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last subject participating in the Extension Period ( Week 44), as recorded in the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF). The estimated recruitment period is approximately 9 months . The study duration for an individual subject will be up to 48 weeks and will includ e the following study periods: • Screening Period: up to 18 days before first administration of IMP (Week −4 to Week −2 [Days -28 to Day -10])"

Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria , and any non- treatment -emergent serious adverse event ( SAE). Subjects who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be rescreened once. 4.5 Rationale for Gender Distribution No randomization stratified by gender is planned. All potential subjects will be asked for informed consent for participation in the study regardless of their gender. Because more women than men are affected by HS , a 2:1 distribution of women and men is expected to be enrolled in the study . 5 STUDY INTERVENTION Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol. All IMP supplied by the sponsor for use in this study will have been manufactured, tested, and released according to the standards of Good Manufacturing Practice. 5.1 Investigational Medicinal Product 5.1.1 IFX-1 IFX-1 is a monoclonal anti- human C5a immunoglobulin as active pharmaceutical i ngredient , which is formulated in a phosphate buffered saline and Polysorbate 80. IFX-1 will be supplied in 10 mL glass vials at a concentration of 10 mg/mL (i.e., 100 mg per vial) for iv administration and will have the following composition: Ingredient Strength IFX-1 10 mg/ mL Sodium chloride 150 mM Sodium phosphate 10 mM Polysorbate 80 0.05% 5.1.2 Placebo Placebo will be supplied in 10 mL glass vials for iv administration and will have the following composition: Ingredient Strength Sodium chloride 150 mM Sodium phosphate 10 mM Polysorbate 80 0.05% The placebo vials and content have the same appearance as the IFX -1 vials and additives."

The cardboard boxes will be labeled with a unique number (“medcode”) . The glass vials containing the IMP will be labeled with the same medcode as the cardboard box in which they are packed. The labels are part of the Clinical Trial Application documentation . 5.3 Supply , Storage , and Accountability 5.3.1 Supply The IMP will be supplied to study sites on behalf of the sponsor by Almac . The IMP should be shipped at a temperature of 2°C to 8°C , and should not be frozen. For each subject, the IMP will be sent from A lmac to the study site after the subject has been enrolled into the study at Screening. Because it may take up to 10 days for the IMP to reach the study site, at least 10 days should be allowed between Screening and first administration of IMP . At each study site , authorized personnel will check the IMP for any loss, damage, or tampering and confirm receipt. Records of the receipt of IMP have to be maintained. Any technical complaints arising from defects in the quality of the IMP, or defects in the packaging or labeling of the IMP, must be reported to t he sponsor or the delegate at the earliest opportunity and the IMP should not be used . The authorized personnel will be responsible for adequate handling of the IMP and local drug accountability as well as recording of the accurate administration of the I MP (i.e., complete administration of IMP , including flushing of the infusion line) used for each subject . 5.3.2 Storage The IMP must be stored between 2 and 8°C and should not be frozen. To record the temperature , an established and validated local temperature management system with temperature logs should be used. If this is not possible , the responsible site personnel will maintain temperature records for the entire duration of the study. A template for the temperature records will be provided by the Clinical Research Organization ( CRO ). At a minimum, the daily (working day ) minimum and maximum temperatures must be documented. All IMP supplies must be stored separately from normal hospital inventories, in a locked facility with access limited to authorized personnel . 5.3.3 Accountability During the study , all IMP vials will be reconciled against the current inventory and the dispensing records as a component of the monitoring visits. IMP administration data kept at the site will be m onitored throughout the study by the monitor. After completion of the study , all records regarding the IMP will be provided to the sponsor , who will decide on the return or destruction of any unused IMP. In case any unused IMP should be destroyed at the site, this destruction must be documented on the form provided by the sponsor for this purpose . If unused IMP cannot be destroyed at the site, it needs to be returned to the depot."

Depending on the dose to be administered ( Table 2 and Table 3), the amount of IMP for a single infusion is 400, 800, or 1200 mg IFX -1, or placebo. IMP or placebo will be diluted in sterile sodium chloride. To keep the blinding of site personnel and subjects, the total volume in the infusion bag for each infusion should be 250 mL. Details of IMP preparation and application will be outlined in the respective IMP manual. 5.4.2 Administration and Compliance Main Period: after Screening, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 5 treatment cohorts in a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 (Section 5.5) and then receive IMP in the 16- week Main P eriod as shown in Table 2 .

For France: After each infusion of IMP administered in the Induction Phases of the Main and Extension Periods, subjects must remain at the study site for at least 60 min after end of IMP administration; appropriate treatment for potential infusion-related reactions must be available during this time. Each administration of IMP will be recorded in detail in the source documentation and in the eCRF . If a subject misses a visit for a scheduled infusion of IMP for any reason, the infusion must be administered as soon as possible after the scheduled time of infusion. If the scheduled infusion cannot be administered within 3 days after the scheduled time of infusion, then that infusion should be omitted and t he subsequent infusion must be administered as planned. If a subject appears at the study center for a scheduled infusion but the infusion cannot be administered due to any reason, the visit can be repeated within 3 days (if the investigator thinks that the IMP can be administered within 3 days ). Otherwise, the infusion will be omitted and is documented accordingly in the eCRF. Subjects who omit more than 2 scheduled (consecutive or non -consecutive) infusions during the Main Period will be discontinued from the study and will have a Post-Treatment FUV 3 months after discontinuation or when another HS therapy has been started (Section 6.2). The number of unused, partially used, and empty vials will be documented and the vials will be kept until the drug accountability documentation has been checked by the monitor . 5.5 Randomization and Blinding The randomization can occur at every time point between Screening and Day 1 or at Day 1 after confirmation of the Principal Investigator that the patient fulfil ls the eligibility criteria. If the investigator randomizes the patient between Screening Visit and Day 1 and recognizes that the patient did not fulfil l the eligibility criteria anymore at Day 1, the patient should not be treated and will be classified as early discontinuation. For treatment during the double- blind Main Period, subjects will be centrally assigned to randomized IMP in 1 of 5 cohorts in a ratio of 1:1:1 :1:1 (Section 3.1) using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) at Day 1 stratified by Hurley Stage II and III. Complete data from the clinical HS examination must be available before randomization can occur . The double- blind will be maintained through the Main Period and, for HiSCR non -responders , in the Induction Phase of the Extension Period. Emergency Identification of I nvestigational Medicinal Product The IRT will be programmed with blind- breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a subject ’s treatment"
47,page_47,"IFX-1-P2.4 Global Amendment 1.1 [ Final V2 .0, 16 November 201 8] page 48 of 109 IFX-1 InflaRx GmbH assignment is warranted. Subject safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, he or she should make every effort to contact the sponsor before unblinding a subjec t’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment. If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the sponsor will be notified via the IRT and the subject should discontinue treatment . The date and reason why the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and in the eCRF , as applicable. 5.6 Procedures in Case of Specific Side Effects To date, IFX-1 has been tested in healthy subjects and subjects with early septic organ dysfunction, complex cardiac surgery , and HS . An overview of side effects (i.e., ADRs that occurred in these studies ) is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. If a side effect occur s or is suspected after administration of IMP , subjects must be closely monitored and carefully observed, and as applicable the side effect must be reported as a n AE (Section 9). Any t reatment deemed as medically appropriate should be initiated. In case of the following specific types of side effects , the procedures reported below must be applied. Infections : because IFX -1 block s C5a, there is a theoretical risk of an increased rate of infections. Therefore , the investigator (and other health care professionals who take care of the subjects ) should be alert to signs and symptoms of infections in general. In case a subject develops a clinical picture that is difficult to distinguish from that associated with invasive infection, routine blood cultures and early start of antibiotic treatment is recommended . In subjects with bacterial infection, depending on the severity of the infections, it is important that concomitant antibiotic therapy be administered during treatment with IFX -1 to ensure appropriate control of the source of the infection. The investigator should pay close attention to the choice of an appropriate broad spectrum antibiotic treatment according to applicable guidelines. The IMP can be temporarily or permanently interrupted at the investigator’s discretion. Any invasive infection has to be reported as an adverse event of special interest (AESI) (Section 9.3). Meningitis/Meningococcal Sepsis : in case of signs of meningitis at any time during the study period, the subject must be carefully observed and the guideline for “ambulatory acquired bacterial meningoencephalitis” [22] should be followed. This includes lumbar puncture, blood culture testing, immediate start of treatment with dexamethasone and iv antibiotics (combination therapy with ampicillin and 3 rd generation cephalosporin) , and search for infectious focus (e.g., computed tomography or magnetic resonance tomography ). The IMP should be interrupted immediately in case of signs and symptoms of meningitis and withdrawn if meningitis is confirmed. Infusion-R elated Reactions/Anaphylactic Reactions and Acute Systemic Allergic Hypersensitivity: In case of any severe, acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction during, or shortly after, infusion of IFX -1, the infusion should be stopped immediately and the subject discontinued from further dosing. In such cases, subjects should be closely monitored for any changes in blood pressure, heart rate, metabolic conditions, or organ function, and appropriate measures should be taken to stabilize all vital signs. Fluid resuscitation may be needed, as well as vasopressor therapy or other measures to treat changes in blood pressure, vital signs, or metabolic conditions in general. In cases of emergency with immediate life -threatening potential such as cardiac arrest or similar life -threatening changes, appropriate cardio- pulmonary resuscitation should be started immediately according to applicable guidelines, or as established at the study sites through existing standard operating procedures or other algorithms for cardio- pulmonary resuscitation according to current recommended resuscitation guidelines."
48,page_48,"IFX-1-P2.4 Global Amendment 1.1 [ Final V2 .0, 16 November 201 8] page 49 of 109 IFX-1 InflaRx GmbH For any potential infusion -related event, the physician should check for a potentially developing or existing anaphylactic reaction. In case an anaphylactic reaction is anticipated, appropriate immediate actions should be taken according to the severity or stage o f the detected anaphylactic reaction as recommended by existing guidelines for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions or, if established at the study sites, according to available standard operating procedures or algorithms. If the investigator abstains from further dosing, the subject should be discontinued from the study and handled as drop- out. In case of an emergency or other situation in which it is medically imperative for the investigator to identi fy the IMP that a subject has received or is receiving during the Main Period and during the Induction Phase of the Extension Period, the procedure for emergency identification of IMP described in Section 5.5 must be followed. 5.7 Overdose The c onsequences of an overdos e with IFX -1 are not known. If overdosing occurs or is suspected, subject s must be closely monitored and carefully observed for any symptoms. In case of any symptoms, treatment as deemed medically appropriate by the investigator should be initiated. Overdoses must be recorded as t reatment - emergent adverse event s (TEAEs). 5.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy Any medication, vaccine (including, but not limited to, over -the-counter or prescription medicines such as aspirin, antacids, vitamins, mineral supplements , and/or herbal supplements ), or procedure (e.g., phototherapy or laser -surgical therapy) that the subject received during 3 months before Screening, at Screening , or receives during the study, must be recorded in the source documentation and in the eCRF , with details on t he reason for use, date(s) of administration (with start and end dates ), and dos ing information , including dose , route , and frequency of administration . 5.8.1 Prior Therapy Any p rior treatment with phototherapy , laser -surgical therapy , or antibiotic s (see Section 5.8.2.2 ) during at least the 3 months before Screening will be documented in the eCRF . Subjects must have been on a stable dose of doxycycline or minoc ycline during the 28 days before S creening ( “as needed” dosing is not considered stable) . Any p rior treatment with oral corticostero ids, immunosuppressive drugs, biologics, biosimilars, investigational treatment, any other systemic therapy for HS, any iv anti -infective therapy , analgesics (including opioids) for HS -related pain (see Section 5.8.2.3 ), prescription- only topical therapies for HS , and oral anti- infectives for infections other than HS during the 28 days before Screening will be documented . Any biologic treatment for HS used previously , including details on reason for discontinuation will be documented . All information on the use of prior medication will be recorded in the source documentation and in the eCRF . Prior therapy should also include a detailed history of prior therapies used to treat H S. All medications will be documented in the eCRF by verbatim name, dosing regimen, route of administration, start and end date of administration, and indication."

The dosing regimen must remain stable throughout study participation. Antibiotics taken on an “as needed ” basis are not considered a stable dose. Permitted oral concomitant antibiotics include: • Doxycycline (at an oral dose of up to 100 mg twice daily ) • Minocycline (at an oral dose of up to 100 mg twice daily ) An adequate test of oral antibiotic therapy is considered to be at least 90 days in duration. If, after ≥ 90 days of oral antibiotic therapy, any of the following has occurred, the subject will be considered to have had an inadequate response, or loss of response, to oral antibiotics : • Progression of Hurley Stage (i.e., the Hurley Stage of at least 1 affected anatomic region has progressed from II to III or , after having improved to I during the study [inclusion criterion #4, Section 4.1], progressed from I to II or from I to III) • Subject requires at least 1 intervention (e.g., incision and drainage or intralesional injection of corticosteroid) • Subject experiences pain interfering with activities of daily living, with unsatisfactory relief from over -the-counter analgesics (e. g., ibuprofen or acetaminophen) • Subject experiences pain requiring opioids, including tramadol • Subject experiences drainage interfering with activities of daily life (e.g., requires multiple dressing changes and/or change of clothes daily) • Subject experiences an increase in the number of anatomic regions affected by HS • Subject experiences at least 1 new absc ess or 1 new draining fistula A subject is defined as intolerant to oral antibiotic therapy when the therapy has been discontinued by a physician as a result of a significant adverse reaction to the therapy in question. An adverse reaction is considered significant if it is at least moderately severe (i.e., the reaction causes discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities or functions). Examples of significant adverse reactions include, but are not limited to, the following : • Nausea resulting in decreased oral i ntake • Macular or papular eruption or erythema with pruritus or other associated symptoms • Dizziness, disequilibrium , lightheadedness , or vertigo interfering with function • Allergic reaction manifesting as rash, flushing, urticaria, dyspnea, or fever ≥ 38°C"

This includes analgesics for HS - related pain and other pain (non- HS-related). If a subject’s pain (HS -related or non- HS-related) worsens after Day 1 , they may initiate analgesic therapy at any time during the study as follows : For HS -related pain , permitted analgesics are limited to: • Ibuprofen (at an oral dose of up to 800 mg every 6 h) , not to exceed 3.2 g/24 h, or lower , according to the maximum dose allowed per local requirements • Acetaminophen as per local labeling • Tramadol (at an oral dose of up to 100 mg every 4 h), not to exceed 400 mg/24 h, in case of HS-related pain that remains uncontrolled with ibuprofen or acetaminophen given according to the dosing regimens above after Day 1 Dose adjustments of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or tramadol and use of these analgesics as needed for HS- related pain up to the maximum permitted dose and frequency are permitted during the study. Subjects will be required to report taking any analgesics. All use of analgesics and any dose adjustments will be recorded in the source documentation and in the eCRF. For non- HS-related pain: • Oral o pioid analgesics are prohibited • All other analgesics (including tramadol) are allowed at the recommended or prescribed dose 5.8.2.4 Lesion Intervention In case an acutely painful lesion occurs that requires immediate intervention, physicians may perform either of the following permitted interventions : • Injection with intralesional triamcinolone acetonide suspension (at a concentration of up to 5 mg/mL, up to 1 mL ), and incision and drainage • If incision and drainage are performed, an over-the-counter antiseptic wash should be used. New systemic and topical therapies following incision and drainage (including antibiotics) are not permitted. Concomitant use of wound care dressings is allowed, but limited to alginat es, hydrocolloids, and hydrogels Subjects should continue using any ongoing oral and topical treatment (with the constraints described in Section 5.8.3 ) during the study. The use of c oncomitant therapy associated with the lesion intervention(s) must be captured in the source documentation and in the eCRF. Main Period: a total of 2 permitted interventions are allowed during the Main Period. An intervention can be applied to a maximum of 2 different lesions at the same visit to the study site, or to the same lesion at 2 different visits. The same lesion cannot be treated twice at the"

Extension Period: a maximum of 2 interventions are permitted every 4 weeks during the Extension Period. An intervention can be applied to a maximum of 2 different lesions at the same visit to the study site, or to the same lesion at 2 different visits. Within each 4- week period, the same type of intervention cannot be applied twice on the same lesion. If a subject requires more than 2 interventions within a 4- week period, or has 2 of the same interventions for the same lesion within a 4 -week period, then they must be discontinued from the study . All the assessments and procedures scheduled for a given visit to the study site must occur before any interventions are applied. Any lesion that undergoes an intervention will be documented. The site will be required to count any lesion that undergoes an intervention as permanently present from the date of intervention, and must account for it in the source documentation and in the eCRF . 5.8.3 Prohibited Therapy The following therapies are prohibited for all subjects during the study : • Phototherapy (UVB or psoralen and UVA) • All biologic therapy with a potential therapeutic impact on the disease being studied including , but not limited to , the following: o Abatacept (Orencia®) o Anakinra ( Kineret®) o Belimumab ( Benlysta®) o Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®) o Efalizumab (Raptiva®) o Etanercept ( Enbrel®) o Golimumab (Simponi®) o Infliximab (Remicade®) o Natalizumab (Tysabri®) o Rituximab (Rituxan®) o Tocilizumab (Actemra®) o Ustekinumab (Stelara®) • Any investigational agent • Any other systemic medication for HS, including , but not limited to , antibiotics (except as specified in Section 5.8.2.2 ), methotrexate, cyclosporine, retinoids , and fumaric ac id esters • Oral or i njectable corticosteroids • Oral analgesics for HS not listed in Section 5.8.2.3 • Oral opioid analgesics for non -HS-related pain (for HS -related pain , see Section 5.8.2.3 ) • New prescription topical therapies for HS • Over -the-counter topical antiseptic washes, creams, soaps, ointments, gels , and liquids containing antibacterial agents to treat HS , not listed in Section 5.8.2 • Surgical or laser intervention for an HS lesion"

The investigator(s) will be notified in writing, outlining the reasons for discontinuation, and the investigator(s) must promptly inform all participating subjects. Detai led instructions on further assessments will be provided. All study materials, except documents needed for archiving requirements, will be returned to the sponsor, including all records regarding the IMP, and the sponsor will decide on whether any unused IMP should be returned or destroyed. The clinical monitor will ensure that any outstanding data clarification issues and queries are resolved and that all study records at the study site are complete. In accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, the sponsor will promptly inform the competent regulatory authorities of the discontinuation and its reason(s), and the investigator or sponsor will promptly inform the Institutional Ethics C ommittee . The approval of the study can be rescinded, or the study can be discontinued by a competent authority or a responsible Ethics C ommittee . 6.2 Discontinuation of Individual Subject Participation Each early discontinuation of individual subject participation, irr espective of the reason for discontinuation, must be documented by the investigator. If possible, the date, circumstances , and reason for discontinuation should be documented. The investigator will attempt to complete all procedures usually required at the end of the study (i.e., at Week 4 4) at the time when the subject’s participation in the study is discontinued. Subjects who have been discontinued from the study will have a Post-Treatment FUV 3 months after discontinuation or when another HS therapy has been started. 6.2.1 Withdrawal of Informed Consent Subjects may discontinue their participation in the study by withdrawing their consent at any time without giving reasons. Nevertheless, they should be asked about the reason for discontinuation after being informed that they do not need to do so. Information as to when they withdrew consent must be document ed.

The Screening procedures will be conducted between 28 days and 1 0 days before firs t administration of IMP. The findings from the Screening procedures will be documented in the Subject Screening/ Enrol lment Log. For each subject, the IMP will be sent from Almac to the study site after the subject has been enrolled into the study at Screening. Because it may take up to 10 days for the IMP to reach the study site, at least 10 days should be allowed for between Screening and first administration of IMP. The investigator may pre -screen subjects for study inclusion and exclusion criteria without first obtaining written informed consent for participation in the current study on the basis of 1 or both of the following situations : • Pre-existing data (e .g., for study inclusion and exclusion criteria, as available in medical records held by the investigator) • Initial contact (e.g. , routine visit, phone call) where only routine and/or non -study specific questions are allowed After subjects have provided written informed consent, potentially eligible subjects will be assessed at the Screening visit to determine if all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are met . All subjects must provide written informed consent before any study specific assessments or procedures are performed. The f ollowing procedures will be conducted and documented at the Screening visit: • Initiate and complete informed consent procedure and document process • Review all inclusion and exclusion criteria (see S ections 4.1 and 4.2) • Serum pregnancy test , required for all women of childbearing potential • Blood sample for analysis of safety laboratory parameters • Blood sample to t est for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus ( HBV), and hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) • Medical and surgical history during the 6 months before Screening • Review and record prior therapy for chronic diseases taken during the 3 months before Screening • Review and record prior and concomitant therapy as specified in the exclusion criteria (Section 4.2) • Demographic s and baseline characteristics • HS medical and surgical history • Physical examination • 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG ) • Vital signs • HS clinical parameters • Erythema assessment"

The maximum time between signing informed consent at Screening and randomization should be 3 weeks, and the maximum time between randomization and first administration of IMP should be 3 week s. The maximum time between Screening and first administration of IMP should be 4 weeks. Because it may take up to 10 days for the IMP to reach the study site, at least 10 days should be allowed for between Screening and first administration of IMP. Subjects who give informed consent for participation in the PK substudy will be sequentially included in the PK substudy. Subjects will further be asked to consent to a photographical documentation of affected areas at prespecified visits. Subjects enrolled into the study will be issued a subject card with relevant contact details, including emergency contact details. If the subject meets an exclusion criterion or another reason for non- inclusion in the study is present after obtaining informed consent , the subject will not be enrolled into the study and will be deemed as screen failure. 7.2 Main Period ( 16 Weeks) The following section describes all study assessments and procedures that have to be performed in the Main Period ( double- blind) . For each cohort, the Main Period starts at Week 0 (Day 1, immediately before first administration of IMP) and consists of a 2- week Induction Phase (ends immediately after administration of IMP at Week 2 ) followed by a 14- week Maintenance Phase through Week 16 (ends immediately after administration of IMP at Week 16). An overview of the visit schedule is available in the Schedule of Assessments - Screening and Main Perio d (All Subjects) . Before administration of IMP , the following assessments and procedures will be performed at the visits to the study site, as indicated: • Review all relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section 4.1 and 4.2) to confirm eligibility for participation in the study (Week 0 [Day 1]) • Review and record concomitant therapy, as specified in the exclusion criteria (Section 4.2), to confirm eligibility for participation in the study (Week 0 [Day 1])"

(yes/no) 8.2.2.2 Hidradenitis Suppurativa C linical Response (HiSCR) The HiSCR is defined by the status of 3 types of lesions [20]: • Abscesses • Inflammat ory nodules • Draining fistulas The definition for response to treatment based on HiSCR relative to Day 1 is: • At least 50% reduction in AN count • No increase in number of abscesses • No increase in number of draining fistulas A subject is considered to be a HiSCR responder only if all 3 criteria above are fulfilled. If any 1 of the 3 criteria is missing, the HiSCR response will be recorded as missing . Additionally, the HiSCR25 response will be calculated. The definition of a HiSCR25 responder relative to Day 1 is: • An at least 25% reduction in AN count • No increase in number of abscesses • No increase in number of draining fistulas A subject is considered to be a HiSCR25 responder only if all 3 criteria above are fulfilled. The HiSCR will be assessed at each of the prespecified times when the HS clinical parameters are scheduled to be assessed during the study after Day 1, as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments. The score will be calculated using data recorded for HS clinical parameters in the eCRF (Section 8.2.2.1 ). 8.2.2.3 Hidradenitis Suppurativa- Physician’s Global Assessment (HS -PGA) The HS -PGA is a physician- rated HS disease severity scale with a score ranging from 0 (least severe) to 5 (most severe) based on counts of abscesses, draining fistulas, inflammatory nodules , and non- inflammatory nodules measured as HS clinical parameters (Appendix 17.2) . The HS -PGA will be calculated based on the HS clinical parameters at each of the prespecified times when the HS clinical parameters are scheduled to be assessed during the study , as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments . Lesions are counted by considering all anatomical regions. A further efficacy endpoint is the achievement of clear or minimal severity among subjects with at least 2 grades of improvement (reduction) from Day 1 to each time point. 8.2.2.4 Modified Sartorius Score (mSS) The mSS is a summation of HS lesions based on a number of factors including anatomical region, number and type of lesions , and distance between relevant lesions measured as HS"

The mSS has a minimum val ue of 0 and no upper limit and is calculated using data recorded for HS clinical parameters in the eCRF (Section 8.2.2.1) according to the algorithm in Appendix 17.3 . The mSS and the corresponding change from Day 1 will be assessed at each of the prespecified times when the HS clinical parameters are scheduled to be assessed during the study , as outlined in Schedules of Assessments . 8.2.2.5 Lesions Lesion counts are defined as the number of all abscesses, inflammatory nodules, non-inflammatory nodules, non -draining fistulas , draining fistulas, hypertrophic scars , and other lesions . Lesion counts will be recorded at each of the prespecified times when the HS clinical parameters are scheduled to be assessed during the study (as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments ). 8.2.2.6 Erythema Assessment For each anatomic region affected by HS, the investigator will assess the overall degree of erythema using a 4- point ordinal scale ranging between 0 and 3 (0 = no redness, 1 = faint but discernible pink coloration, 2 = moderate red coloration, 3 = very red or bright red coloration) (Appendix 17.4) through Week 44 (as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments ) or early discontinuation visit and the 3-m onth Post -Treatment Follow -Up visit if the subject discontinues before Week 44. The erythema assessment will be used to assess the worst and average degree of erythema for each affected anatomic region and overall. 8.2.2.7 P atient’ s Assessment of Drainage The Patient’s Assessment of Drainage (Appendix 17.5) will be assessed daily by subjects in an e-diary from Scree ning through the FUV at Week 44 The Patient’s Assessment of Drainage will be used to assess the amount of drainage due to HS. Ratings affected by HS will range from 0 (no drainage ) to 10 ( drainage as bad as you can imagine). 8.2.2.8 Analgesic Therapy Subjects will be required to report taking any analgesics. All use of analgesics and any dose adjustments will be recorded in the source documentation and in the eCRF. For further details refer to section 5.8.2.3 . 8.2.2.9 Patient ’s Global Assessment of Skin Pain (NRS) The Patient ’s Global Assessment of Skin Pain ( NRS ) (Appendix 17.6) will be assessed by subjects every day in an e- diary from Screening through the FUV at Week 44. The NRS will be used to assess the worst and average skin pain due to HS. Ratings for these 2 items range from 0 (no skin pain) to 10 (skin pain as bad as you can imagine). Subjects should be instructed to respond to the items based on a recall period of the “last 24 h”. They should also document any analgesic therapy in the e- diary. 8.2.2.10 Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) The DLQI is an established and widely used patient -reported outcome instrument for assessing the impact on health- related quality of life due to dermatolog ical conditions in clinical"

The DLQI will be assessed by subjects on Day 1 (Week 0) and during the study at prespecified times through Week 44 (as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments ) or an early discontinuation visit and the 3-month Post -Treatment Follow -Up visit if the subject discontinues before Week 44. A score is documented for each of the 10 DLQI items , ranging from 0 to 3 for each item. The total score is the sum of the responses to all 10 DLQI items , ranging from 0 to 30. A higher score corresponds to worse HRQL [ 20]. Guidelines with regard to the scoring of each question and the handling of incorrectly completed questionnaires are taken from the DLQI manual (http://si tes.cardiff.ac.uk/dermatology/quality -of-life/dermatology -quality -of-life-index -dlqi/dlqi- instructions -for-use-and-scoring/ ). Details of the subject questi onnai re and t he evaluat ion of the total DLQI score are available in Appendix 17.7. The DLQI score yields an efficacy endpoint. To avoid biasing the subject’s response, t he subject should complete the questionnaire at the study site before study site personnel perform any other assessments and before any interaction with the study site personnel has occurred. 8.2.2.11 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Subjects will complete the HADS questionnaire (Appendix 17.8) on Day 1 (Week 0) and during the study at prespecified times through Week 44 (as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments) or an early discontinuation visit and the 3-month Post -Treatment Follow -Up visit if the subject discontinues before Week 44. The HADS is a subject -rated scale designed to screen for anxiety and depressive states. It consists of 2 sub-scales: the D -scale measures depression and the A -scale measures anxiety. Each sub -scale contains 7 items and each item is rated from 0 (absent) to 3 (maximum severity). The score of each sub -scale ranges from 0 to 21. To avoid biasing the subject’s response, t he subject should complete the questionnaire at the study site before study site personnel perform any other assessments and before any interaction with the study site personnel has occurred. 8.2.2.12 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF- 36v2) Subjects will complete the SF- 36v2 questionnaire (Appendix 17.9) on Day 1 (Week 0) and during the study at prespecified times through Week 44 (as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments) or an early discontinuation visit and the 3-month Post -Treatment Follow -Up visit if the subject discontinues before Week 44. The SF- 36v2 is a subject -reported generic measurement of health status that has proven useful in studies of both general and specific populations, comparing the relative burden of diseases and the health benefits produced by different treatments [24]. The SF- 36v2 consists of 36 questions from the following 8 domains: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Each domain is directly transformed into a scale from 0 to100 on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. A lower score indicates a poorer health status ; a higher score indicates a better health status (i.e., a score of 0 is equal to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equal to no disability). The 8 domains are summarized to form 2 distinct higher- ordered clusters (physical health and mental health). To avoid biasing the subject’s response, t he subject should complete the questionnaire at the study site before study site personnel perform any other assessments and before any interaction with the study site personnel has occurred."

The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized subject -reported measure of health status in terms of quality -of-life parameters , such as the subject’s mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. There are 5 categorical response choices for each of the 5 measures . In addition, subjects are asked to indicate “the state of your health today” on a visual analog scale of 0 to 100 (0 = worst imaginable health state, 100 = best imaginable health state) [25]. The EQ -5D-5L relates to the respondent’s situation at the time the assessment is completed, therefore the subject does not need to recall their health status over the preceding days or weeks. To avoid biasing the subject’s response, t he subject should complete the questionnaire at the study site before study site personnel perform any other assessments and before any interaction with the study site personnel has occurred. 8.2.2.14 Photographic Documentation of Affected Areas Subjects at prospectively selected sites may be asked to have photographs taken of the affected areas during the study. Subjects who consent will have photographs taken a t prespecified times through Week 44 (as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments ) or an early discontinuation visit and the 3-month Post -Treatment Follow -Up visit if the subject discontinues before Week 44. No formal analysis is foreseen. 8.3 Safety Variables 8.3.1 Overview of Variables Safety will be assessed on the basis of the following variables : • AEs • Physical examination • Vital signs • ECG • Laboratory safety parameters • Pregnancy test • Status of HIV, HBV , and HCV status at Screening • ADA status 8.3.2 Methods of Assessment 8.3.2.1 Adverse Events The incidence, severity , and causality of AEs will be assessed at every visit from signature of the informed consent form at Screening to the subject’s last evaluation according to the procedures described in Section 9."

Physical examination findings that are related to the medical history will be recorded in the source documentation and in the eCRF . A symptom -directed physical examination should be performed at all other visits, as warranted. An abnormalit y noted after starting treatment with IMP (Day 1) will be evalu ated by the investigator for whether it constitutes an AE. 8.3.2.3 Vital Signs Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure , pulse rate (counted for at least 30 seconds after 5 min in a sitting position), respiratory rate , and body temperatur e will be obtained at each visit to the study site . Blood pressure and pulse rate should be measured before blood draws are performed. Height and body weight will only be measured at Screening. 8.3.2.4 Electrocardiogram A resting 12- lead ECG will be performed at Screening and during the study at prespecified times through Week 44 (as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments ). Subjects who had a 12- lead ECG with normal findings performed during the 90 days before Screening will not be required to have a repeat ECG at Screening , provided all the relevant documentation specified in the protocol is available. If there are other findings that are clinically significant (CS), the investigator must contact the medical monitor at the CRO before enrolling the subject into the study. Subjects will have a repeat ECG at Week 44 or at an early discontinuation visit and the 3- month Post -Treatment Follow -Up visit if the subject discontinues before Week 44. Subjects can have a repeat ECG examination at any time during the study if considered warranted by the investigator. An appropriately certified physician will interpret, sign , and date each ECG. Any clinical significant ( CS) and non -clinical significant (NCS ) findings will be recorded in the source document ation and in the eCRF . Each signed , original ECG will be reviewed by the clinical monitor for correctnes s (date, time, and clinically relevant abnormal findings , if applicable) and stored with the source documentation at the study site. 8.3.2.5 Laboratory Safety Parameters Laboratory safety parameters will be assessed at Screening and during the study at prespecified times through Week 44 (as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments ) or an early discontinuation visit and the 3-month Post -Treatment Follow -Up visit if the subject discontinues before Week 44. Blood samples should be obtained after the subjects have provided responses to questionnaires and after vital sign determinations have been completed, but before administration of IMP . Analyses will be conducted by a certified central laboratory.

A portion of the samples will be collected for possible future analysis ; this is not applicable for patients in Denmark . In addition, serum samples for future research taken at Week 2 (Day 15) will be used for ADA measurement. ADAs will be measured in serum samples at a specialized laboratory using a validated homogeneous electrochemiluminescence- based bridging enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay for initial detection as well as an additional conf irmatory assay in case of positive findings detected in the initial test. Samples that are confirmed as ADA -positive will be quasi- quantified by titration. 8.4 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 8.4.1 Overview of Variables PK will be assessed on the basis of IFX -1 concentrations. PD will be assessed on the basis of the following variables : • Complement factors C3a and C5a • CH50 • CRP 8.4.2 Methods of Assessment 8.4.2.1 Pharmacokinetic Variables Concentrations of IFX -1 in citrate plasma will be analyzed on Day 4 and during the study at prespecified times through Week 44 (as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments ) or an early discontinuation visit and the 3-month Post -Treatment Follow -Up visit if the subject discontinues before Week 44. In the PK substudy, the PK of IFX -1 will be assessed in approximately 10 subjects from each Cohort at Weeks 2 and 16 of the Main Period. At these times, blood samples will be obtained for the analysis of IFX- 1 in citrate plasma before IMP infusion (0 h) and at after end of IMP administration (+10 min) , and at 2 h (± 10 min), 6 h (± 10 min), 24 h (± 2 h), and 48 h (± 2 h) after start of IMP administration, in all cases using a separate infusion line. IFX-1 will be analyzed by a speciali zed laboratory with an ELISA test system . 8.4.2.2 Pharmacodynamic Variables The PD variables will be assessed on Day 1 and during the study at prespecified times through Week 44 (as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments ) or an early discontinuation visit and the 3-month Post -Treatment Follow -Up visit if the subject discontinues before Week 44. Complement factor C3a will be analyzed in plasma samples by a specialized laboratory with an ELISA test system ."

Total complement hemolytic act ivity CH50 will be analyzed in serum samples by the central laboratory with a liposome immunoassay . CRP will be analyzed in serum samples by the central laboratory with a standard assay . 8.4.2.3 Serum and Plasma Biomarker Variables Samples to assess serum and plasma biomarkers will be taken on Day 1 and during the study at prespecified times through Week 44 (as outlined in the Schedules of Assessments ) or an early discontinuation visit and the 3-month Post -Treatment Follow -Up visit if the subject discontinues before Week 44. The collection of serum and plasma biomarker samples are not applicable for Denmark . Samples may be analyzed for plasma and serum proteins, peptides, and non- protein soluble factors such as lipids that could help predict disease behavior or help determine more severe disease phenotypes. The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi- study assessment of factors involved in the response to IFX -1. The samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests related to IFX -1. The results of any such analyses may be reported separately . Serum samples taken at Week 2 (Day 15) will be used for ADA measurement (Section 8.3.2.8 ). 9 ADVERSE EVENT S 9.1 Adverse Events 9.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an IMP ; an AE does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment . AEs encompass any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease that arises or worsens after the inclusion of the subject into the study . AEs may include: • The significant worsening of the disease or symptoms of the disease under investigation following administration of an IMP • Illnesses that coincide with an onset after administration of an IMP • Exacerbation (i.e., increase in frequency or severity) of a pre- existing condition. Chronic illnesses present prior to study entry, other than the indication being investigated, should be recorded in the medical history page of the eCRF and only be reported as AEs if there is an increase in the frequency or severity of the condition during the study • For laboratory safety parameters, any absolute values outside of the reference range or changes after initial administration of the IMP that are considered by the investigator as CS must be recorded in the eCRF as AEs if not previously documented as ongoing medical conditions or as ongoing AE s. Examples of laboratory abnormalities that should be considered as AEs include those that result in discontinuation of treatment with the"

AEs do not include: • Medical or surgical procedures ; the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE • Untoward medical findings that occur before initial administration of the IMP if they occur in the scope of investigations that are performed for assessing inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., results of laborator y tests conducted at S creening) • Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred, e.g., planned hospitalization due to a pre -existing condition that has not worsened, hospitalization that occur s for a procedure not associated with an AE (e.g., elective surgery or social admission), or hospitalization for a diagnostic procedure that takes less than 24 h • Overdose of an IMP or any concomitant therapy that does not result in any adverse signs or symptoms. Details of the dosing (volume, location of infusion, and infusion rate) of the IMP will be recorded in the eCRF At each visit to the study site, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred. If known, the medical diagnosis of an AE should be recorded in preference to the listing of individual signs and symptom s. 9.1.2 Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events The observation period for AEs will start with confirmation of signed informed consent at Screening (i.e., at Day -28 to Day -10) and ends at Week 44. All AEs reported from the time the subject gives written informed consent to participate in the study until 28 days after the last administration of IMP will be recorded , irrespective of whether they were solicited or reported spontaneously by the subject. AE information will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. For subjects who discontinue early, a Post-Treatment FUV will occur 3 months after the early discontinuation or when another HS therapy has been started, whichever occurs first."
72,page_72,"IFX-1-P2.4 Global Amendment 1.1 [ Final V2 .0, 16 November 201 8] page 73 of 109 IFX-1 InflaRx GmbH Any AEs judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treat ment with the IMP should be reported to the sponsor regardless of the length of time that has passed since the subject has completed the study. Every attempt should be made to describe AEs in terms of a diagnosis. If appropriate, component symptoms should be listed in addition to the diagnosis. If only nonspecific signs or symptoms are present, then these should be recorded as separate diagnoses in the eCRF . All subject s who experience AEs , irrespective of whether they are considered by the investi gator to be at least possibly related to treatment with the IMP, must be monitored to determine the outcome. The clinical course of each AE will be followed up according to accepted standards of medical practice, even after the subject has completed participation in the study, until a satisfactory explanation is found or the investigator considers it medically justifiable to terminate the follow -up. Should the AE result in death, a full pathologist’s report should be provided, if possible. AEs will be classified according to their severity, causal relationship to the IMP s, and seriousness . If the AE is serious or of special interest , as defined in Section 9.3 , the investigator or other authorized medical personnel at the study site must be notified and complete the paper “SAE form” at the time the SAE is detected. SAE reporting should occur within 24 h (Section 9.2.2 ). Severity of Adverse Events The severity of AEs will be assessed according to the following criteria : Mild • Transient or mild discomfort • No limitation in activity • No medical intervention or therapy required Moderate • Marked limitation in activity • Some assistance usually required • Medical intervention or therapy required • Hospitalization possible Severe • Extreme limitation in activity • Significant assistance required • Significant medical intervention or therapy required • Hospitalization or hospice care probable Causal R elationship of Adverse Events The investigator must assess whether or not the AE is causally related to administration of the IMP. Even if the investigator considers that there is no causal relationship to the IMP, the AE must still be reported. The causal relationship of AEs to administration of the IMP will be assessed according to the following criteria:"

All AEs classified as “ not related” or “unlikely related” will be considered as “ not related” to the IMP. The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to administration of the IMP or an alternative cause (e.g., natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy, etc.) must be determined on the basis of how well the AE can be understood in terms of: • Known pharmacology of the IMP • Clinically and/or pathoph ysiologically plausible context • Reaction of a similar nature previously observed with similar products, or reported in the literature for similar products as being product -related (e.g., headache, facial flushing, pallor ) • Plausibility supported by the temporal relationship ( e.g., the event being related by time to administration or termination of treatment with the IMP, drug withdrawal, or reproduced on rechallenge)"
74,page_74,"IFX-1-P2.4 Global Amendment 1.1 [ Final V2 .0, 16 November 201 8] page 75 of 109 IFX-1 InflaRx GmbH 9.2 Serious Adverse Events 9.2.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events An AE is defined as serious (i.e., as an SAE) according to the ICH E2A guideline if any of the following criteria are fulfilled: • Results in death • Is life -threatening NOTE: the term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death had it been more severe • Requires in- patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect • Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should also usually be considered serious. The following hospitalizations are not considered to be serious AEs because there is no “adverse event” (i.e., there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospitalization: • Hospitalization for respite care • Hospitalization planned prior to informed consent (where the condition requiring the hospitalization has not changed after administration of IMP ) 9.2.2 Documentation and Reporting Obligations of Serious Adverse Events The observation period for SAEs starts with confirmation of signed informed consent at Screening (i.e., at Day -28 to Day -10) and ends at Week 44. Any SAE judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with the IMP should be reported to the sponsor regardless of the length of time that has passed since study completion. SAEs have to be documented on “SAE forms ” and the investigator must report them immediately to the CRO , or no later than 24 h after becoming aware of the SAE. If more information about the SAE becomes available later, this must also be reported immediately or no later than 24 h after becoming aware of the SAE . In case of a subject ’s death, the investigator will provide the applicable Ethics C ommittee(s) and the applicable responsible authorities with any further information requested. In all reports, personal data are to be anonymized by using the subject identification number. It must be possible to relate the initial and all follow -up reports to each other by means of the subject identification number, or name and address , or the like. The investigator must report all SAEs to the following address:"

Such an event might require further investigation in order to characterize and understand it. For this study , the following AEs are defined as AESIs : • Acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction • Meningitis • Meningococcal septicemia • Invasive infection All AESIs will be recorded and reported as SAE s, and subject narratives will be generated. 9.4 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 9.4.1 Definition of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected U nexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) are side effects whose nature or severity is inconsistent with the information available about the product in the Investigator ’s Brochure. 9.4.2 Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions The sponsor will submit all available information on a SUSAR immediately to the applicable Ethics C ommittee, the applicable regulatory authority, and the investigator s in this study, at the latest within 15 calendar days after the event becomes known. For every SUSAR that result s in death or a life- threatening condition, the responsible E thics Committe e, the applicable regulatory authority , and the investigator s in this study must be informed by the sponsor within 7 calendar days after the event becomes known. Additional information has to be given within 8 further calendar day s. 9.5 Therapeutic Procedures If a subject requires treatment as a result of an AE, the treatment must meet the recognized standards of medical care in order to restore the subject ’s health. Appropriate resuscitation devices and medication must be available in order to treat the subject as quickly as possible in the event of an emergency. The actions taken to treat the AE/SAE must be documented by the investigator either in the appropriate eCRF and/or using additional documents."

Any such complication must then be reported accordingly as an SAE. A female subject who becomes pregnant while participating in the study, or up to and including 28 days after the last dose of IMP, must notify the investigator immediately and, if appropriate, discontinue treatment with the IMP. The subject may continue other study procedures at the discretion of the investigator. The sponsor must be notified within 5 days of the investigator becoming aware of the pregnancy , using the following address . Fax: + 353 1 809 9501 QLS_IFX1@ iqvia.com Whenever possible, a pregnancy in subjects exposed to IMP should be followed to term so as to assess any potential occurrence of congenital anomalies or birth defects. Any follow -up information, including premature termination and the status of the mother and child after delivery, should be reported by the investigator. In certain situations, it may be necessary to monitor the development of the child for an appropriate period after birth. If this is the case, details should be included in this section. Severe side effects and complications during a pregnancy as well as congenital birth defects are SAEs per definition and, therefore , have to be reported additionally as SAE s according to the reporting procedures described above. 10 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMIN ATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 10.1 General Considerations A detailed statistical analysis plan will be developed and finalized (approved with signatures) before the Blind Data Review Meeting (BDRM), and may be amended after the BDRM and before unblinding the study database if the need arises. The statistical analysis plan will include the exact definition of endpoints and variables to be analyzed, extensive details of the statistical analysis methods to be used together with the structure of tables and figures to be included as end- of-text tables and figures as well as appended listings for the clinical study report. All endpoints and variables will be adequately evaluated. Individual data will be listed. Data will be summarized using suitable descriptive statistics; depending on the structure of the data , either sample statistics or frequency tables will be used. Data will be analyzed by cohort and study period (Main Period and Extension Period) and might be further differentiated (e.g., by visit or by study site ). 10.2 Determination of Sample Size The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the multiple comparisons procedure -modelling (MCP -Mod) procedure [ 26-28]. A total of 175 subjects are planned to be"
77,page_77,"IFX-1-P2.4 Global Amendment 1.1 [ Final V2 .0, 16 November 201 8] page 78 of 109 IFX-1 InflaRx GmbH enrolled into the study (i.e., 35 subjects per cohort ) to achieve at least 29 subjects per cohort available for the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. The sample size is selected in a way that the multiple contrast test exceeds a power of 90%. With the planned sample size, the power criterion of the multiple contrast test is fulfilled because 29 subjects per cohort would yield a power of at least 90% to detect a dose -response signal if present. In this context , the HiSCR at Week 1 6 is assumed to be 25% in the placebo group, as shown in earlier HS studies [15], and 30%, 45%, 55% , and 60% in the active cohort s (Cohorts 2 to 5), with cumulative doses of 2000 mg, 48 00 mg, 8000 mg, and 10,800 mg, respectively. A 1-sided significance level of 𝛼𝛼 = 0.025 will be used. Additionally, simulations were conducted to investigate the expected length of the 2- sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the minimum effective dose (MED) and the median effective dose (ED 50). Definitions of MED and ED 50 can be found in Section 10.5. Based on the planned sample size of at least 29 evaluable subjects per cohort, wide 90% CIs can be expected for the MED and the ED 50. The expected length of the 90% CIs was determined by simulations of the modelling step of the MCP -Mod procedure. To determine the true HiSCR at Week 16, a maximum possible effect for the agonist (E max) model and a logistic model were selected, which are the same models that will be used as candidate models in the MCP -Mod procedure. A guesstimate of ED 50 = 3000 was used for the E max model and guesstimates of ED 50 = 3500 and 𝛿𝛿 = 1100 was used for the logistic model. 10.3 Analysis Sets Full analysis set (FAS) : the FAS will consist of all subjects who will receive at least 1 infusion of IMP. The analysis will be based on the cohort the subject s are randomized to (intention- to- treat principle ). Per protocol set (PPS) : the PPS will be a subset of the FAS and will exclude all subjects with major protocol violations that affect the evaluation of the primary endpoint of the study. Subjects who will receiv e treatment fr om a cohort that they are not randomized to for the complete treatment course until Week 16 will not be excluded from the PPS and will be analyzed based on the actual treatment they will receive. Safety analysis set (SA S): the SAS will consist of all subje cts who will receive at least 1 infusion of IMP. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received. Actual treatment refers to the individual dosing schedule. The allocation of single subjects to the actual dosing groups will be performed under blinded conditions during the blinded data review. Safety analyses will be based on the SAS. Efficacy analyses will be provided for the FAS and the PPS. More detailed specifications of the analysis sets and analyses will be provided in the s tatistical analysis plan. 10.4 Endpoints 10.4.1 Efficacy Endpoints The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects with a response on the basis of the HiSCR (Section 8.2.2.2) determined at Week 16, before administration of IMP . The secondary efficacy endpoints are: • Percentage of subjects with a response on the basis of the HiSCR determined at Week 12, before administration of IMP"

The endpoints that are evaluated by time point will be analyzed in a similar way during the Extension Period. Summary tables for the Extension Period will be grouped by HiSCR responder s and non- responder s. In addition, the percentage of subjects with loss of response, defined as a loss of at least 50% of the improvement (reduction) in the AN count achieved from baseline to Week 16 [AN > ½ × (Baseline AN count + Week 16 AN count)] based on the number of subjects with HiSCR at Week 16 will be analyzed for the Extension Period. Descriptive s ubgroup analyses will be performed on selected efficacy endpoints . Relevant subgroups are defined by subjects with and without previous exposure to adalimumab or other biologic products, and with and without response to adal imumab or other biologic products , Hurley Stage, antibiotic treatment , and baseline demographics. The subgroup analyses will be exploratory . Details on subgroup analyses and further subgroup analyses ( if deemed necessary ) will be provided in the statistical analysis plan. Other efficacy endpoints (e.g., erythema assessment, Patient’s Assessment of Drainage and analgesic therapy ) will be exploratory, as defined in detail in the statistical analysis plan ."

Furthermore, the number and percentage of subjects who have a TEAE as well as the number of TEAEs will be assessed for all causally related TEAEs, related SAE s, AESIs, TEAEs leading to study discontinuation, related TEAEs leading to study discontinuation, TEAEs leading to IMP discontinuation, and related TEAEs leading to IMP discontinuation. For the analysis of severity and causal relationship of AEs, the worst severity and the strongest relationship per subject and class of AE will be considered. Laboratory safety parameters , especially the change in inflammatory markers and differential blood cell counts , will be assessed by time point and changes in routine laboratory parameters from baseline will be determined. Shifts in safety laboratory parameters outside of normal ranges compared with baseline will be investigated. Immunogenicity will be assessed by determining the number and percentage of subjects with detection of ADAs (before and after administration of IMP ). Other safety endpoints will be exploratory, as defined in detail in the statistical analysis plan . Non-treatment -emergent AEs will be listed . 10.4.3 Pharmacokinetic E ndpoints The exposure to IFX -1 in all subjects will be measured as the plasma concentration of IFX -1 determined on Day 4 and at all subsequent scheduled visits to the study site through Week 44 before administration of IMP, and at Week s 0 (Day 4 ), 2, and 16 after administration of IMP using a separate infusion line. Actual PK sampling times will be determined and the plasma concentration of IFX -1 will be assessed by time point. A PK substudy will be conducted during the Main Period, at Weeks 2 and 16 , in approximately50 of the 175 subjects participating in the Main Period (8 to 10 subjects per cohort). At these times, blood samples will be obtained for the analysis of IFX -1 in citrate plasma before IMP administration (0 h), after end of IMP administration (+ 10 min) , and at 2 h (± 10 min), 6 h (± 10 min), 24 h (± 2 h), and 48 h (± 2 h) after start of IMP administration, in all cases using a separate infusion line. The analysis of derived PK parameters will be described in a separate PK analysis plan. 10.4.4 Pharmacodynamic Endpoints The PD of IFX -1 are primarily measured by plasma concentration of C5a, which is determined at prespecified times after administration of IFX -1. Plasma concentrations of C5a and C3a and serum concentrations of CH50 will be assesse d by time point and as change from Day 1 . Serum concentrations of CRP will be assessed by time point and as change from Day 1. 10.5 Analysis of Endpoint s 10.5.1 Efficacy The primary efficacy endpoint HiSCR at Week 16 will be analyzed using the MCP -Mod procedure. The MCP -Mod approach will include Hurley S tage at baseline, concomitant use of antibiotic therapy , and AN count at baseline as covariates ."
80,page_80,"IFX-1-P2.4 Global Amendment 1.1 [ Final V2 .0, 16 November 201 8] page 81 of 109 IFX-1 InflaRx GmbH Multiple contrast test s, which are part of the MCP -Mod procedure , will be used to test for a dose- response signal using the placebo cohort and the cohorts based on cumulative doses of 2,000 mg, 4,8 00 mg, 8,000 mg, and 10,800 mg as do se levels . In the MCP -Mod procedure, dose- response models can be consistently considered as: f(d,𝛉𝛉) = θ0+ θ1∙f0(d,𝛉𝛉∗), where d denotes the respective dose, and f0(d,𝛉𝛉∗) denotes the standardized dose- response model parametrized by the vector 𝛉𝛉∗. In this parametrization, θ 0 denotes the location parameter, θ1 denotes the scale parameter , and 𝛉𝛉∗ determines the shape of the model function. For this study, a candidate se t of 2 dose -response models are prespecified, m = 1,2, which both characteri ze a monotonically increasing dose- response relationship: 1. E max model 2. Logistic model For each of the standardized dose- response models fm0(d,θ∗), (m = 1,2) in the candidate set, the null hypothesis H 0m: cmT µ= 0 will be tested against the 1- sided alternative H 1m: cmT µ > 0 using a multiple contrast test with significance level α/2 = 0.025, where cm= (cm1, … , cm5)T is the optimal contrast vector representing model m and µ= (µ1, … ,µ5)T denotes the HiSCR at Week 16 for the applied doses. Single contrast tests will be used to test the null hypotheses that there is no dose-response signal for candidate model m = 1,2. By combining the single test statis tics to a multivariate test statistic and comparing this test statistic to a multivariate normal -distribution, the single tests are multiplicity adjusted and the multiple test problem is adequately considered. The maximum of the 2 test statistics will be used as a combined test statistic. Only if a dose- response signal can be detected for at least 1 of the candidate models in terms of the multiple contrast test s, the shape of the dose- response curve and the target dose(s) of interest will be estimated. The estimated dose- response curve will be used to estimate the MED and ED 50. The MED is defined as t he minimum dose, at which the HiSCR at Week 16 is at least 15% higher than the HiSCR at Week 16 in the placebo group. An improvement of 15% over placebo in Hi SCR at Week 1 6 is considered as clinically relevant [15]. The ED 50 is defined as the minimum dose that achieves 50% of the maximum achievable effect over placebo. Standard formulas for the estimation of ED 50 will be used and will be explicitly stated in the statistical analysis plan . Multiple imputations will be performed for subjec ts with missing data on HiSCR at Week 16 who did not discontinue before Week 16 because of one of the following reasons: • Disease relapse • Progressive disease • L ack of efficacy Subjects who discontinued before Week 16 because of one of the above mentioned reasons will be treated as not having achieved HiSCR at Week 16. All further specifications for multiple imputations are based on the assumption that the number of subjects that need to have the HiSCR at Week 16 imputed, will be relatively small. Multiple imputations will be performed based on the assumption that HiSCR response at Week 16 is missing at random, i.e. missingness will not depend on the HiSCR at Week 16 itself but will only depend on the factors in the imputation model. The factors that will be used in the multiple imputation model for HiSCR at Week 16 are HiSCR at prior visits , cohort, baseline Hurley Stage , baseline AN count , and concomitant use of antibiotics. We anticipat e that baseline Hurley S tage, baseline AN count and concomitant use of antibiotic s will not be"
81,page_81,"IFX-1-P2.4 Global Amendment 1.1 [ Final V2 .0, 16 November 201 8] page 82 of 109 IFX-1 InflaRx GmbH missing for subjects in the intent -to-treat population. The multiple imputation model will be using fully conditional specification logistic regression. We will perform 20 imputations using a random seed of 122007 using SAS PROC MI. The MCP -Mod approach as outlined above will be applied to all 20 imputed datasets. If the MCP step results in a non- significant dose -response signal for more than one of the 20 datasets, the results will be considered as not robust enough for dose- response estimation. In this case, the Mod step will not be performed. For the estimation of the dose- response curve for each candidate model (Mod step), the individual model parameters (ED 50 for the Emax model and ED 50 and 𝛿𝛿 for the logistic model) from the analysis on each imputed dataset will be combined using Rubin’s rule. The percentage of subjects with a response on the basis of the HiSCR ( Section 8.2.2.2 ) determined at Week 12 before administration of IMP will be analyzed in the same way as the primary endpoint. For all other continuous efficacy endpoints , the absolute values and changes from baseline (absolute and relative ) will be summarized by display of basic descriptive statistics (e.g., number of observations (n), mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum, lower quartile, upper quartile, and upper and lower boundary of the 95% CI for the mean ) by time point . Model -based analyses (e.g. a nalysis of covariance [ ANCOVA ], Poisson, and logistic regression models) for continuous, count , and binary endpoints will be defined in the statistical analysi s plan as deemed necessary and possible. All categorical efficacy endpoints will be summarized by time point using absolute and relative frequencies including 95% exact CIs based on the b inomial distribution . Sensitivity analyses will be defined for all efficacy endpoints if deemed necessary. 10.5.2 Safety Treatment -emergent AEs will be analyzed according to the number and percentage of subjects who had a TEAE, as well as the number of TEAEs with the respective MedDRA System Organ Class and P referred Term. Additionally, the number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be further grouped by severity and causal relationship. T he number and percentage of subject s with SAEs and AESIs and the number of S AEs and AESIs will be analyzed. Where AEs are grouped by severity or relationship, the maximum severity/relationship per subject and class of AE will be considered. If the number of subject s discontinuing treatment or discontinuing the study is substantial, further analyses taking into account the time of AE onset and cumulative dose may be considered. Safety laboratory , physical examination, and vital signs parameters will be analyzed by summary statistics ( e.g., number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum, lower quartile, upper quartile) for absolute values and changes from baseline by visit . Categorical safety parameters will be summarized by absolute and relative frequencies by time point . 10.5.3 Pharmacokinetics The analysis of derived PK parameters will be described in a separate PK analysis plan. 10.5.4 Pharmacodynamics Where applicable, the absolute values and changes from baseline of PD endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics ( e.g., number of obser vations (n), mean, standard"

All PD parameters will be analyzed based on the FAS with all values and assessments available. Some analyses may be repeated for the PPS. 10.6 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Baseline characteristics and demographic information (inclu ding medical/HS history and surgeries) will be summarized by cohort and overall. A baseline measurement will be defined as the latest measurement obtained prior to the first administration of IMP, if applicable. 10.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapies Prior and concomitant therapies will be summarized by absolute and relative frequencies by cohort and overall. Therapies will be defined as concomitant if the start or end date is later than the date of first IMP administration, or if no end date is available (ongoing therapy ). 10.8 Subject Disposition The disposition of subject s who were enrolled (i.e., signed the informed consent form) in the study as well as reasons for discontinuation from study and from treatment will be summarized for each cohort . 10.9 Treatment Exposure The administration of IMP will be summarized by cohort and will include the number and percentage of subject s completing each treatment visit. The actually received cumulative dose in mg relative to the planned cumulative dose will be calculated per subject and will be summarized for each cohort. 10.10 Handling of Mis sing Data Data imputation rules are defined for missing values for the primary efficacy endpoint of percentage of subjects with a response, as measured by HiSCR at Week 16. Subjects with missing baseline assessments (baseline assessments might be obtained at Screening or at Day 1 before first infusion of IMP) necessary for the calculation of the HiSCR at Week 16 will not be randomized ( i.e., there shall be no missing baseline values for HiSCR) . Missing values for assessments at Week 16 necessary for the calculation o f HiSCR at Week 16 will be replaced by multiple imputation, as described in section 10.5.1 . All other missing data will not be replaced. Sensitivity analyses will b e conducted based on the PP S. Further sensitivity analyses (e.g., evaluating patients with missing HiSCR at Week 16 as non- responders) will be defined in the statistical analysis plan if deemed necessary. 10.11 Interim Analysis No formal interim analysis is planned for this study. The database will be locked for the analysis of the Main Period when all data up to and including Week 16 have been collected and cleaned, and the BDRM has taken place. All endpoints in the Main Period will be analyzed after unblinding , which will take place after all subjects have completed the assessments at Week 20 due to operational reasons. A database snapshot will be performed during the Extension"
